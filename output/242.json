    "abstract": "Recent advances in the design and implementation of wearable resistive, capacitive, and optical strain sensors are summarized herein. Wearable and stretchable strain sensors have received extensive research interest due to their applications in personalized healthcare, human motion detection, human–machine interfaces, soft robotics, and beyond. The disconnection of overlapped nanomaterials, reversible opening/closing of microcracks in sensing films, and alteration of the tunneling resistance have been successfully adopted to develop high‐performance resistive‐type sensors. On the other hand, the sensing behavior of capacitive‐type and optical strain sensors is largely governed by their geometrical changes under stretching/releasing cycles. The sensor design parameters, including stretchability, sensitivity, linearity, hysteresis, and dynamic durability, are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the promising applications of wearable strain sensors are highlighted in detail. Although considerable progress has been made so far, wearable strain sensors are still in their prototype stage, and several challenges in the manufacturing of integrated and multifunctional strain sensors should be yet tackled.",

In this regard, the digital twin, analyzing various sensor data with the help of AI algorithms, has become a cutting‐edge technology that connects the physical and virtual worlds, in which the various sensors are highly desirable to collect environmental information. However, although existing sensor technologies, including cameras, microphones, inertial measurement units, etc., are widely used as sensing elements for various applications, high‐power consumption and battery replacement of them is still a problem.

Furthermore, miniature robots can access complex and narrow regions of the human body as well as manipulate down to subcellular entities; however, integrating onboard components is difficult due to their limited size. Combining these two technologies, magnetic miniature robots have undergone rapid development during the past two decades, mainly because of their high potential in medical and bioengineering applications. To improve the scientific and clinical outcomes of these tiny agents, developing suitable and reliable actuation systems is essential. As a newly emerging field that has progressed in recent years, magnetic actuation systems offer a harmless and effective approach for the remote control of miniature robots via a dynamic magnetic field.

    "abstract": "Machine learning, particularly in the form of deep learning (DL), has driven most of the recent fundamental developments in artificial intelligence (AI). DL is based on computational models that are, to a certain extent, bio‐inspired, as they rely on networks of connected simple computing units operating in parallel. The success of DL is supported by three factors: availability of vast amounts of data, continuous growth in computing power, and algorithmic innovations. The approaching demise of Moore's law, and the consequent expected modest improvements in computing power that can be achieved by scaling, raises the question of whether the progress will be slowed or halted due to hardware limitations. This article reviews the case for a novel beyond‐complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology—memristors—as a potential solution for the implementation of power‐efficient in‐memory computing, DL accelerators, and spiking neural networks. Central themes are the reliance on non‐von‐Neumann computing architectures and the need for developing tailored learning and inference algorithms. To argue that lessons from biology can be useful in providing directions for further progress in AI, an example‐based reservoir computing is briefly discussed. At the end, speculation is given on the “big picture” view of future neuromorphic and brain‐inspired computing systems.",

The reservoir is followed by a readout layer that can analyze the extracted features to accomplish tasks such as inference and classification. RC systems inherently exhibit an advantage, since the training is only performed at the readout layer, and therefore they are able to compute complicated temporal data with a low training cost. Herein, a physical reservoir computing system using diffusive memristor‐based reservoir and drift memristor‐based readout layer is experimentally implemented. The rich nonlinear dynamic behavior exhibited by a diffusive memristor due to Ag migration and the robust in situ training of drift memristor arrays makes the combined system ideal for temporal pattern classification. It is then demonstrated experimentally that the RC system can successfully identify handwritten digits from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, achieving an accuracy of 83%.",

First, the required nonlinear elasticity concepts are introduced with a focus on the relevant models for soft robotics.

Then, a comprehensive review of constitutive model parameters for the most widely used silicone rubbers in the literature is provided. An overview of the procedure is provided for three commercially available software packages (Abaqus, Ansys, and COMSOL).

In this perspective piece, the way the explainability metrics of these two methods are generated is discussed and a framework for the interpretation of their outputs, highlighting their weaknesses and strengths is proposed. Specifically, their outcomes in terms of model‐dependency and in the presence of collinearity among the features, relying on a case study from the biomedical domain (classification of individuals with or without myocardial infarction) are discussed. The results indicate that SHAP and LIME are highly affected by the adopted ML model and feature collinearity, raising a note of caution on their usage and interpretation.",

Herein, the stringent requirements in device performance and array parameters for hardware ANNs are analyzed, and the efforts in addressing the associated challenges are discussed. Recent progress on the experimental demonstration of neuromorphic computing systems (NCSs) is presented. Recommendations for further performance optimization at the device, circuit, and algorithm levels are proposed. This Report serves as a guide for the hardware implementation of NCS based on large‐scale CBAs.",

    "abstract": "The low communication bandwidth between memory and processing units in conventional von Neumann machines does not support the requirements of emerging applications that rely extensively on large sets of data. More recent computing paradigms, such as high parallelization and near‐memory computing, help alleviate the data communication bottleneck to some extent, but paradigm‐shifting concepts are required. In‐memory computing has emerged as a prime candidate to eliminate this bottleneck by colocating memory and processing. In this context, resistive switching (RS) memory devices is a key promising choice, due to their unique intrinsic device‐level properties, enabling both storing and computing with a small, massively‐parallel footprint at low power. Theoretically, this directly translates to a major boost in energy efficiency and computational throughput, but various practical challenges remain. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of several key existing challenges in implementing high‐capacity, high‐volume RS memories for accelerating the most computationally demanding computation in machine learning (ML) inference, that of vector‐matrix multiplication (VMM), is presented. The monolithic integration of RS memories with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits is presented as the core underlying technology. The key existing design choices in terms of device‐level physical implementation, circuit‐level design, and system‐level considerations is reviewed and an outlook for future directions is provided.",

    "abstract": "Over the last three decades, fiber optic sensors (FOS) have gained a lot of attention for their wide range of monitoring applications across many industries, including aerospace, defense, security, civil engineering, and energy. FOS technologies hold great promise to form the backbone for next‐generation intelligent sensing platforms that offer long‐distance, high‐accuracy, distributed measurement capabilities and multiparametric monitoring with resilience to harsh environmental conditions. The major limitations posed by FOS are 1) cross‐sensitivity, 2) enormous volume and large data generation, 3) low data processing speed, 4) degradation of signal‐to‐noise ratio over the fiber length, and 5) overall cost of sensor and interrogator systems. These challenges can be overcome by building advanced data analytics engines enabled by recent breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). This article presents a comprehensive review of recent studies that integrate ML and AI algorithms with FOS technologies. This review also highlights several FOS technology development directions that promise a significant impact on widespread use for several industrial applications, with an emphasis on energy systems monitoring.

    "abstract": "The emergence of memristors with potential applications in data storage and artificial intelligence has attracted wide attentions. Memristors are assembled in crossbar arrays with data bits encoded by the resistance of individual cells. Despite the proposed high density and excellent scalability, the sneak‐path current causing cross interference impedes their practical applications. Therefore, developing novel architectures to mitigate sneak‐path current and improve efficiency, reliability, and stability may benefit next‐generation storage‐class memory (SCM). Moreover, conventional digital computers face the von‐Neumann bottleneck and the slowdown of transistors’ scaling, imposing a big challenge to hardware artificial intelligence. Memristive crossbar features colocation of memory and processing units, as well as superior scalability, making it a promising candidate for hardware accelerating machine learning and neuromorphic computing. Herein, first, crossbar architecture is introduced. Then, for storage, the origin of sneak‐path current is reviewed and techniques to mitigate this issue from the angle of materials and circuits are discussed. Computing wise, the applications of memristive crossbars in both machine learning and neuromorphic computing are surveyed, focusing on the structure of unit cells, the network topology, and the learning types. Finally, a perspective on future engineering and applications of memristive crossbars is discussed.",

However, the most important hurdle to progress in their development is the so-called cycle-to-cycle variability, which is inherently rooted in the resistive switching mechanism behind the operational principle of these devices. In order to achieve the whole picture, variability must be assessed from different viewpoints going from the experimental characterization to the adequation of modeling and simulation techniques. Herein, special emphasis is put on the modeling part because the accurate representation of the phenomenon is critical for circuit designers. In this respect, a number of approaches are used to the date: stochastic, behavioral, mesoscopic..., each of them covering particular aspects of the electron and ion transport mechanisms occurring within the switching material. These subjects are dealt with in this review, with the aim of presenting the most recent advancements in the treatment of variability in resistive memories.",

Compared with conventional medical robotic systems, microrobots may be capable of reaching more narrow and vulnerable regions in the human body with minimal damage. However, limited by the small scale of microrobots, microprocessors, power supplies, and sensors can hardly be integrated on‐board. Thus, new strategies for the actuation and feedback for microrobots need to be explored. Furthermore, the open‐loop control method accomplished by operators may lack accuracy, and long‐duration operation could bring a severe physical challenge in many applications. Consequently, the automatic control of microrobots with the aid of control theories is developed to improve the control efficiency and precision. To further promote the automation level of microrobots, machine learning algorithms are expected to provide a solution to let microrobots adapt to more dynamic environments and undertake more complex medical tasks. Herein, a systematic introduction of the manipulation of microrobots from open‐loop to closed‐loop control is given in this review.

An extensive review encapsulating algorithmic dissection, interface devices, and applicative dimensions forms part of this discourse. This manuscript distinctively combines multimodal HRI with cognitive science, deeply probing into the three dimensions, perception, cognition, and action, thereby demystifying algorithms intrinsic to multimodal HRI. Finally, it accentuates the empirical challenges and contours preemptive trajectories for multimodal HRI in human‐centric smart manufacturing.",

The high‐frequency characteristics of DEAs enable them to be applied in a wider range of fields. In this review, the high‐frequency (&gt;10 Hz) characteristics and applications of DEAs are focused on. The basic concepts and metrics for high‐frequency DEAs are first given. Next, the commercial and synthesized dielectric and electrode materials of DEAs used in high‐frequency applications are reviewed. Following materials, strategies for extending the lifetime of DEAs are introduced. Subsequently, the dynamic modeling approaches for DEAs are presented, considering damping, inertia, and the electrical loss. Building on the fundamental research, some important applications are summarized based on the high‐frequency motions of DEAs including loudspeakers, active vibration suppression, pumps/valves, haptic devices, and high‐speed mobile robots. Finally, the conclusions and future perspectives are given. This review will give readers a clearer understanding of how to design and use high‐frequency DEAs.",

Point‐LIO has two key novelties. The first one is a point‐by‐point LIO framework that updates the state at each LiDAR point measurement. This framework allows an extremely high‐frequency odometry output, significantly increases the odometry bandwidth, and fundamentally removes the artificial in‐frame motion distortion. The second one is a stochastic process‐augmented kinematic model which models the IMU measurement as an output. This new modeling method enables accurate localization and reliable mapping for aggressive motions even with inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements saturated in the middle of the motion. Various real‐world experiments are conducted for performance evaluation. Overall, Point‐LIO is capable to provide accurate, high‐frequency odometry (4–8 kHz) and reliable mapping under severe vibrations and aggressive motions with high angular velocity (75 rad s −1 ) beyond the IMU measuring ranges. Furthermore, an exhaustive benchmark comparison is conducted. Point‐LIO achieves consistently comparable accuracy and time consumption. Finally, two example applications of Point‐LIO are demonstrated, one is a racing drone and the other is a self‐rotating unmanned aerial vehicle, both have aggressive motions.",

With heightened concerns for the environment, considerable effort has been made to develop organic transient memristors to realize eco‐friendly flexible neural networks. However, in the transient neural networks, achieving flexible memristors with biorealistic synaptic plasticity for energy efficient learning processes is still challenging. Herein, a biodegradable and flexible polymer‐based memristor, suitable for the spike‐dependent learning process, is demonstrated. An electrochemical metallization phenomenon for the conductive nanofilament growth in a polymer medium of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is analyzed and a PVA‐based transient and flexible artificial synapse is developed. The developed device exhibits superior biodegradability and stable mechanical flexibility due to the high water solubility and excellent tensile strength of the PVA film, respectively. In addition, the developed flexible memristor is operated as a reliable synaptic device with optimized synaptic plasticity, which is ideal for artificial neural networks with the spike‐dependent operations. The developed device is found to be effectively served as a reliable synaptic component with high energy efficiency in practical neural networks. This novel strategy for developing transient and flexible artificial synapses can be a fundamental platform for realizing eco‐friendly wearable intelligent systems.

To address this, intelligent surveillance systems leverage AI and computer vision to automatically detect anomalies. This study proposes an innovative method combining 3D convolutions and long short‐term memory (LSTM) modules to capture spatiotemporal features in video data. Notably, a structured coarse‐level feature fusion mechanism enhances generalization and mitigates the issue of vanishing gradients. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks, the approach employs depth‐wise feature stacking, reducing computational complexity and enhancing the architecture. Additionally, it integrates microautoencoder blocks for downsampling, eliminates the computational load of ConvLSTM2D layers, and employs frequent feature concatenation blocks during upsampling to preserve temporal information. Integrating a Conv‐LSTM module at the down‐ and upsampling stages enhances the model's ability to capture short‐ and long‐term temporal features, resulting in a 42‐layer network while maintaining robust performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in false alarms and improved accuracy compared to contemporary methods, with enhancements of 2.7%, 0.6%, and 3.4% on the UCSDPed1, UCSDPed2, and Avenue datasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "4D printing with carbon nanotube (CNT)‐reinforced polymers enables advanced shape‐changing materials but faces challenges in CNT dispersion and performance. This study addresses these limitations by functionalizing CNTs with polyethylene glycol (PEG), significantly enhancing dispersion and interfacial bonding within biocompatible polyvinyl chloride (PVC)‐polycaprolactone (PCL) composites. The composites, tailored for biomedical applications with a glass transition temperature (T g ) of 37–41 °C, exhibit enhanced mechanical, thermal, and shape‐memory properties. At 0.5 wt% CNT, the composite achieves a 25% increase in tensile strength, 95.78% shape fixity, and a 5‐s recovery time, offering an optimal balance of strength, flexibility, and rapid shape recovery. Higher CNT concentrations (5 wt%) further improve thermal stability, increasing the decomposition temperature by 20 °C and storage modulus by 670 MPa, although ductility is reduced. PEG grafting prevents CNT agglomeration, enabling high filler loading without compromising printability, as confirmed through uniform nanoparticle dispersion and defect‐free fused deposition modeling (FDM)‐printed structures. These intelligent composites combine biocompatibility, durability, and excellent shape‐memory performance, making them suitable for diverse structural and biomedical applications, such as adaptive medical devices, ergonomic shoe soles, and wearable biosensors.

Herein, a self‐monitoring system based on real‐time camera images and deep learning algorithms is developed to classify the various extents of delamination in a printed part. In addition, a novel method incorporating strain measurements is established to measure and predict the onset of warping. Results show that the machine‐learning model is capable of detecting different levels of delamination conditions, and the strain measurements setup successfully reflects and determines the extent and tendency of warping before it actually occurs in the print job.

Reliable, rapid, and high‐throughput screening of MPs from other components of a water sample after sieving and/or digestion is still a highly desirable goal to avoid cumbersome visual analysis by expert users under the optical microscope. Here, a new approach is presented that combines 3D coherent imaging with machine learning (ML) to achieve accurate and automatic detection of MPs in filtered water samples in a wide range at microscale. The water pretreatment process eliminates sediments and aggregates that fall out of the analyzed range. However, it is still necessary to clearly distinguish MPs from marine microalgae. Here, it is shown that, by defining a novel set of distinctive “holographic features,” it is possible to accurately identify MPs within the defined analysis range. The process is specifically tailored for characterizing the MPs' “holographic signatures,” thus boosting the classification performance and reaching accuracy higher than 99% in classifying thousands of items. The ML approach in conjunction with holographic coherent imaging is able to identify MPs independently from their morphology, size, and different types of plastic materials.",

Herein, a magnetic continuum device with variable stiffness (VS) is presented, whose tip is precisely shaped and controlled using an external magnetic field. Based on a low melting point alloy (LMPA), the serial segments composing the continuum device are independently softened via electrical current and remotely deformed under a magnetic torque, whereas the rest of the device is locked in place. The resulting system has the advantage of combining the precision of magnetic navigation with additional degrees of freedom provided by changing the segments stiffness. With a minimum diameter as small as 2.33 mm and an inner working channel, the magnetic continuum device with VS is adapted to use in several therapeutic scenarios, including radio‐frequency cardiac ablations and interventional endoscopy in the gastrointestinal tract. The magnetic torque is used to remotely control the shape of the soft sections, whereas the stiff sections remain unchanged, thus adding degrees of freedom to the magnetic continuum device.",

Among various building materials, hydrogels have great advantages as artificial muscles, such as responsiveness to a wide range of stimuli, large volume deformation, and sensitivity. However, conventional hydrogel actuators that generate only isotropic volume change in response to an external stimulus cannot be considered as artificial muscles because complex deformations are not possible. Instead, programmed complex deformations originated from a rationally designed anisotropic structure are desired in artificial muscles. Herein, recent approaches for constructing stimuli‐responsive hydrogels with an anisotropic structure, thereby enabling a directional complex motion to mimic a muscle are reviewed. First, stimuli‐responsive shape‐deforming hydrogels as a main building matrix are categorized according to stimulating external signals. The representative methods for modulating the isotropic structure of a hydrogel into various anisotropic structures, such as multilayer structure, linearly oriented structure, and patterned structure are discussed. Finally, the recent strategies to achieve muscle‐like motion of hydrogels by combining stimuli responsiveness and anisotropic structures for translation from elementary contraction and expansion to programmed deformations, such as multidirectional bending, directionally amplified deformation, and compositive programmed motion, are covered.",

However, the current direct‐ink‐write (DIW) printing‐based fabrication of hmSAM parts and structures only permits programmable magnetic direction with a constant magnetic density. Also, the existing designs rely on the brute‐force approach to generate the assignment of magnetization direction distribution, which can only produce intuitional deformations. These two factors greatly limit the design space and the application potentials of hmSAMs. Herein, a “voxel‐encoding DIW printing” method to program both the magnetic density and direction distributions during hmSAM printing is introduced. The voxel‐encoding DIW printing is then integrated with an evolutionary algorithm (EA)‐based design strategy to achieve the desired magnetic actuation and motion with complex geometry variations and curvature distributions. With the new EA‐guided voxel‐encoding DIW printing technique, the functional hmSAMs that produce complicated shape morphing with desired curvature distributions for advanced applications such as biomimetic motions are demonstrated. These demonstrations indicate that the proposed EA‐guided voxel‐encoding DIW printing method significantly broadens the application potentials of hmSAMs.",

In the composite filaments, a small quantity of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is incorporated to facilitate the alignment of liquid crystal molecules along the long axis of the filament. Up to 2 wt% carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is introduced into a LCE matrix without aggregation, which in turn greatly improves the mechanical property of filaments and their actuation speed, where the Young's modulus along the long axis reaches 40 MPa, the electrothermal response time is within 10 s. The maximum work capacity is 38 J kg −1 with 2 wt% CNT loading.

    "abstract": "We present here a new approach for using the intelligence aspects of artificial intelligence for knowledge discovery rather than device optimization in electromagnetic (EM) nanostructures. This approach uses training data obtained through full-wave EM simulations of a series of nanostructures to train geometric deep learning algorithms to assess the range of feasible responses as well as the feasibility of a desired response from a class of EM nanostructures. To facilitate the knowledge discovery and reduce the computation complexity, our approach combines the dimensionality reduction technique (using an autoencoder) with convex-hull and one-class support-vector-machine (SVM) algorithms to find the range of the feasible responses in the latent (or the reduced) response space of the EM nanostructure. We show that by using a small set of training instances (compared to all possible structures), our approach can provide better than 95% accuracy in assessing the feasibility of a given response. More importantly, the one-class SVM algorithm can be trained to provide the degree of feasibility (or unfeasibility) of a response from a given nanostructure. This important information can be used to modify the initial structure to an alternative one that can enable an initially unfeasible response. To show the applicability of our approach, we apply it to two important classes of binary metasurfaces (MSs), formed by array of plasmonic nanostructures, and periodic MSs formed by an array of dielectric nanopillars. In addition to theoretical results, we show the experimental results obtained by fabricating several MSs of the second class. Our theoretical and experimental results confirm the unique features of this approach for knowledge discovery in EM nanostructures.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in soft‐matter sensors has shown improved fabrication techniques, resolution, and range. However, scaling up these sensors into an information‐rich tactile skin remains largely limited by designs that require a corresponding increase in the number of wires to support each new sensing node. To address this, a soft tactile skin that can estimate force and localize contact over a continuous 15 mm 2 area with a single integrated circuit and four output wires is introduced. The skin is composed of silicone elastomer loaded with randomly distributed magnetic microparticles. Upon deformation, the magnetic particles change position and orientation with respect to an embedded magnetometer, resulting in a change in the net measured magnetic field. Two experiments are reported to calibrate and estimate both location and force of surface contact. The classification algorithms can localize pressure with an accuracy of &gt;98% on both grid and circle pattern. Regression algorithms can localize pressure to a 3 mm 2 area on average. This proof‐of‐concept sensing skin addresses the increasing need for a simple‐to‐fabricate, quick‐to‐integrate, and information‐rich tactile surface for use in robotic manipulation, soft systems, and biomonitoring.",

Soft robotics, which originates from interdisciplinary advances in materials, fabrication, and electronics, featuring better adaptability and safer interaction, holds great promises in addressing current technical challenges in MIS, which are difficult to be solved with current rigid robotic technologies. For the first time, herein, the expected characteristics of next‐generation MIS from the surgeons’ perspectives are analyzed and the recent progress of soft surgical instruments from three different aspects is comprehensively summarized: engineering design, fabrication techniques, and human–robot interaction. Perspectives of next‐generation soft surgical robots are then discussed, where some exciting possibilities are emphasized. It is believed that further developments of intelligent soft robotics enable the next‐generation MIS to agilely navigate to the target and conduct dexterous diagnostic or therapeutic procedures without any trade‐offs in invasiveness and ultimately be a propitious solution for future surgery.",

In contrast to conventional robots composed of rigid materials, soft robots made from soft materials offer remarkable advantages in achieving various adaptive locomotion, manipulating delicate objects, providing safe human–robot interaction and adapting to confined environments due to their excellent compliance and adaptability, which have the potential to be widely used in numerous applications such as medical, exploration and rescue devices, etc. Unlike ﬁxed‐morphology soft robots, modularization of soft robots is a low‐cost and rapid strategy that enables them to adapt to changing tasks and environments by rearranging the connectivity of module units and attain complex functionalities such as self‐assembly, self‐repair, or self‐replication. Although MSRs exhibit many advantages, they are still in the nascent stage with plenty of challenges. Herein, first the materials, fabrication, actuation, sensor, and control of various modular units in MSRs are introduced. Then, some main connection methods between modular units are summarized.

The goal of these synthetics is to swim like natural micro‐organisms through biological environments and perform complex tasks such as drug delivery and microsurgery. Extensive efforts in the past several decades have focused on generating propulsion at the microscopic scale, which has engendered a variety of artificial microswimmers based on different physical and physicochemical mechanisms. Yet, these major advancements represent only the initial steps toward successful biomedical applications of microswimmers in realistic scenarios. A next step is to design “smart” microswimmers that can adapt their locomotion behaviors in response to environmental factors. Herein, recent progress in the development of microswimmers with intelligent behaviors is surveyed in three major areas: 1) adaptive locomotion across different media, 2) tactic behaviors in response to environment stimuli, and 3) multifunctional swimmers that can perform complex tasks. The emerging technologies and novel approaches used in developing these “smart” microswimmers, which enable them to display behaviors similar to biological cells, are discussed.",

After introducing available microrobotic propulsion and control mechanisms, microrobots that are manufactured and powered by light are focused herein. Referring to pioneering works and recent interesting examples, light is presented not only as a fabrication tool, by means of twophoton polymerization direct laser writing, but also as an actuator for microrobots in both hard and soft stimuli–responsive polymers. In this scenario, a number of challenges that yet prevent polymeric light-powered microrobots from reaching their full potential are identified, whereas potential solutions to overcome said challenges are suggested. As an outlook, a number of real-world applications that light-powered microrobots should be particularly suited for are mentioned, together with the advances needed for them to achieve such purposes. An interdisciplinary approach combining materials science, microfabrication, photonics, and data science should be conducive to the next generation of microrobots and will l ultimately foster the translation of microrobotic applications into the real world.",

It is indeed a challenge to satisfy these performances at the same time. Inspired by the arthropod metamerism in nature, herein, a millirobot composed of three piezoelectric segments is proposed. The millirobot is tethered for power, and the whole size of the millirobot is 58 × 44 × 12 mm; it uses several principles of arthropod locomotion, can carry loads and cross obstacles, and also has the rapidity and agility like a centipede through the coordination of multiple piezoelectric segments. Fast motion with a maximum speed of 516 mm s −1 is realized by operating at resonant mode, and stepping motion with a resolution of 0.44 μm is achieved by the pulsed sinusoidal mode. The widest speed range among published reports of millirobots is achieved (from 4.5e −3 to 9 BL s −1 ). Its agility surpasses other piezoelectric millirobots; the linear, steering, and rotational motions are performed and switched flexibly. The results show that fast motion, high resolution, wide speed range, high agility, large load capacity, good adaptability, and miniaturization are successfully achieved by the millirobot.",

With the potential to store numerous values in I – V pinched hysteresis, memristors (memory resistors) have emerged as alternatives to existing CMOS‐based computing systems. Herein, four types of memristive devices, namely, resistive switching, phase‐change, spintronics, and ferroelectric tunnel junction memristors, are explored. The application of these devices to a crossbar array (CBA), which is a novel concept of integrated architecture, is a step toward the realization of ultradense electronics. Exploiting the fascinating capabilities of memristive devices, computing systems can be developed with novel computing paradigms, in which large amounts of data can be stored and processed within CBAs. Looking further ahead, the ways in which memristors could be incorporated in neuromorphic computing systems along with various artificial intelligence algorithms are established. Finally, perspectives and challenges that memristor technology should address to provide excellent alternatives to existing computing systems are discussed. The infinite potential of memristors is the key to unlock new computing paradigms, which pave the way for next‐generation computing systems.",

Organized into large arrays with a top-down approach, memristive devices in conventional crossbar architecture demonstrated the implementation of brain-inspired computing for supervised and unsupervised learning. Alternative way using unconventional systems consisting of many interacting nano-parts have been proposed for the realization of biologically plausible architectures where the emergent behavior arises from a complexity similar to that of biological neural circuits. However, these systems were unable to demonstrate bio-realistic implementation of synaptic functionalities with spatio-temporal processing of input signals similarly to our brain. Here we report on emergent synaptic behavior of biologically inspired nanoarchitecture based on self-assembled and highly interconnected nanowire (NW) networks realized with a bottom up approach. The operation principle of this system is based on the mutual electrochemical interaction among memristive NWs and NW junctions composing the network and regulating its connectivity depending on the input stimuli. The functional connectivity of the system was shown to be responsible for heterosynaptic plasticity that was experimentally demonstrated and modelled in a multiterminal configuration, where the formation of a synaptic pathway between two neuron terminals is responsible for a variation in synaptic strength also at non-stimulated terminals. These results highlight the ability of nanowire memristive architectures for building brain-inspired intelligent systems based on complex networks able to physically compute the information arising from multi-terminal inputs.",

    "abstract": "Organic synaptic transistors using intrinsic (i.e., non‐doped) organic semiconductors have demonstrated various synaptic functions to mimic biological synapses, but the devices show limited long‐term retention behaviors although long‐term memory is essential for neuromorphic computing. To achieve long‐term retention time, correlating the synaptic responses with the microstructures of polymer semiconductor is an imperative step. It is shown that synaptic plasticity in ion‐gel‐gated organic synaptic transistors (IGOSTs) can be modulated by controlling the microstructure of organic semiconductors and that long‐term memory retention can be significantly prolonged by increasing their crystallinity. The crystallinity of poly(3‐hexylthiophene‐2,5‐diyl) (P3HT) films that are spun‐cast on bare and self‐assembled monolayer is systematically controlled, before and after thermal treatments. Long‐term retention tends to extend, as the crystallinity increases. To evaluate synaptic current decay behaviors, it is suggested that the relaxation is a result of de‐doping of the polymer semiconductor over time. The recognition of handwritten digits is simulated and a high classification accuracy (&gt;92%) is achieved with IGOSTs including high crystalline P3HT film. The study provides fundamental information about the effects of polymer microstructure on synaptic plasticity of IGOSTs, which may be applicable in neuromorphic electronics.",

Robot‐assisted surgeries offer many benefits over the conventional approach including lower risk of infection and blood loss, shorter recovery, and an overall safer procedure for patients. The past few decades have shown many emerging surgical robotic platforms that can work in complex and confined channels of the internal human organs and improve the cognitive and physical skills of the surgeons during the operation. Advanced technologies for sensing, actuation, and intelligent control have enabled multiple surgical devices to simultaneously operate within the human body at low cost and with more efficiency. Despite advances, current surgical intervention systems are not able to execute autonomous tasks and make cognitive decisions that are analogous to those of humans.

Also, available autonomous surgical platforms are comprehensively discussed with comments on the essential technologies, existing challenges, and suggestions for the future development of intelligent robotic‐assisted surgical systems toward the achievement of fully autonomous operation.",

    "abstract": "Herein, this progress report summarizes recent studies of electrochemical oxidation to modulate the interfacial tension of gallium‐based alloys. These liquid alloys have the largest interfacial tension of any liquid at room temperature. The ability to modulate the tension offers the possibility to create forces that change the shape and position of small volumes of liquid metal. It has been known since the late 1800s that electrocapillarity—the use of potential to modulate the electric double layer on the surface of metals in electrolyte—lowers the interfacial tension of liquid metals. This phenomenon, however, can only achieve modest changes in interfacial tension since it is limited to potentials that avoid Faradaic reactions. A recent discovery suggests reactions driven by the electrochemical oxidation of gallium alloys cause the interfacial tension to decrease from ≈500 mN m −1 at 0 V to ≈0 mN m −1 at less than 1 V. This change in interfacial tension is reversible, controllable, and goes well‐beyond what is possible via conventional electrocapillarity or surfactants. This report aims to introduce beginners to this field and address misconceptions. The report discusses applications that utilize modulations in interfacial tension of liquid metal and concludes with remaining opportunities and challenges needing further investigation.",

    "abstract": "An artificial muscle is a type of actuator that can contract, extend, or rotate when exposed to external stimuli (e.g., electrochemical, temperature, pressure, humidity, light, etc.). Twisted fibers can be used in powerful artificial muscles and can convert volume expansion upon stimuli into torsional rotation or axial contraction due to their spiral structure. Upon twist insertion, torsional stress is produced in the fiber, and fiber volume expansion increases the torsional stress, resulting in fiber untwisting. By inserting twist to form a self‐coiled fiber, fiber volume expansion causes the contraction of this self‐coiled fiber if the fiber is torsionally tethered. Fiber‐based artificial muscles have potential applications in a variety of fields such as temperature‐regulating clothing, soft robots, prosthetics, and exoskeletons. Herein, the recent progress in twisted‐fiber artificial muscles with different actuation stimuli, such as thermal, photo, solvent adsorption or infiltration, and electrochemical, is reviewed. The opportunities and challenges for twisted‐fiber artificial muscles are also discussed. Therefore, this review provides an insight for designing high‐performance and multi‐functional twisted‐fiber artificial muscles and motivates the development and applications of fiber‐based artificial muscle in future research.",

This study reports multiple sensor integration, called an electronic skin (e‐skin), embedded in a pneumatic balloon‐based soft robotic hand. The sensors have good sensitivity to different stimuli but are insensitive to bending of the structure. By integrating multiple tactile force sensors (2 × 2 pixels), sliding or slipping movements of an object from a soft robotic hand can be monitored by measuring the time delay of tactile forces in the sensors as well as the tactile force generated by the pneumatic robot and external stimulus such as human contact. This information prevents the robotic hand from dropping an object by providing real‐time feedback, which is used to determine the tactile force. In addition to the fundamental characteristics, demonstration of pneumatic actuation and multiple sensing detections are successfully addressed as the first proof‐of‐concept.",

The squishy touch sensor is developed with custom‐made graphite paste on a tiny permanent magnet, encapsulated in Sil‐Poxy, and the actuator (15 μ‐thick coil) is fabricated on polyimide by Lithographie Galvanoformung Abformung (LIGA) micromolding method. The actuator can operate in two modes (expansion and contraction/squeeze) and two states (vibration and nonvibration). The sensor was tested with up to 12 N applied forces and exhibited ≈70% average relative resistance variation (Δ R / R o ), ≈0.346 kPa −1 sensitivity, and ≈49 ms response time with excellent repeatability (≈12.7% coefficient of variation) at 5 N. During simultaneous sensing and actuation, the modulation of coil current, due to Δ R / R o (≈14% at 2 N force) in the sensor, allows the close loop control (Δ I / I o ≈385%) of expansion/contraction (≈69.8 μm expansion in nonvibration state and ≈111.5 μm peak‐to‐peak in the vibration state). Finally, the soft sensor is embedded in the 3D‐printed fingertip of a robotic hand to demonstrate its use for pressure mapping along with remote vibrotactile stimulation using SensAct device. The self‐controllable actuation of SensAct could provide eSkin the ability to tune stiffness and the vibration states could be utilized for controlled haptic feedback.",

Of all nanomaterials, graphene oxide (GO) has emerged as a prime sensing platform due to its high specific surface area, good aqueous stability, varied functional groups and desirable surface, and electrical and optical properties. This review starts with an introduction of GO and describes its physical and chemical properties. Then, the general strategies of interfacing DNA and GO to develop sensors are discussed. The trends in GO/DNA biosensor development are organized into classes based on the mode of DNA interaction with GO (physisorbed vs chemisorbed). Due to the intermediate DNA adsorption strength on GO, most of the sensors developed utilize physisorption of DNA to GO. Even within the realm of physisorbed probes, there are multiple sensing methods: direct adsorption, inhibited adsorption, competitive adsorption with the use of blocking agents, and tethered adsorption containing a strongly adsorbing block of DNA. Covalently linked DNA probes are also used to increase the biosensor stability. Each of these sensors has its advantages and disadvantages and the designs are discussed with representative examples in detail.",

Emulating biological synaptic functions by electric devices for neuromorphic computation has been considered as a way to overcome the traditional von Neumann architecture in which separated memory and information processing units require high power consumption for their functions. Synaptic devices are expected to conduct complex signal processing such as image classification, decision‐making, and pattern recognition in artificial neural networks. Among various materials and device architectures for synaptic devices, 2D materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have been attracting tremendous attention from researchers based on their capacity to mimic unique synaptic plasticity for neuromorphic computing. Herein, the basic operations of biological synapses and physical properties of 2D materials are discussed, and then 2D materials and their vdW heterostructures for advanced synaptic operations with novel working mechanisms are reviewed. In particular, there is a focus on how to design synaptic devices with the vdW structures in terms of critical 2D materials and their limitations, providing insight into the emerging synaptic device systems and artificial neural networks with 2D materials.",

Although diverse materials and designs have been proposed for magnetic soft robots with programmable shape transformation, it is still challenging to produce strong actuation by a small magnetic field. Inspired by arthropod species, magnetic soft millirobots with joint structures by 3D printing hydrogels have been developed. The joints can turn the bending deformation into the folding deformation, with the jointed region deforming locally. Different from homogeneous bending deformation, such local deformation allows larger motions of robots and reduces the overall energy consumption at the same time. Through experiments and numerical simulations, it is shown that the magnetic arthropod millirobots are capable of performing multimodal locomotion and programmed shape transformation, such as move, flip, catch, carry, and release. Finally, ex vivo experiments of removing a foreign object from porcine organs (e.g., aorta, stomach, and intestine) are presented to demonstrate the potential surgery application of magnetic arthropod millirobots.",

    "abstract": "The emerging field of soft robotics presents a new paradigm for robot design in which “precision through rigidity” is replaced by “cognition through compliance.” Lightweight and flexible, soft robots have vast potential to interact with fragile objects and navigate unstructured environments. Like octopuses and worms in nature, soft robots’ flexible bodies conform to hard objects and reconfigure for different tasks, delegating the burden of control from brain to body through embodied cognition. However, because of the lack of efficient modeling and simulation tools, soft robots are primarily designed by hand. Typically, hard components from rigid robots or living creatures are heuristically substituted for comparable soft ones. Autonomous design and manufacturing methodologies are urgently required to produce bespoke, high‐performing robots. Currently, design methodologies exist between simple but realistic parametric optimizations, and evolutionary algorithms which simulate morphology and control coevolution. To find high‐performing designs, novel high‐fidelity simulators and high‐throughput manufacturing and testing processes are required to explore the complex soft material, morphology and control landscape, blending simulation, and experimental data. This article reviews the state of the art in autonomous soft robotic design. Existing manual and automated designs are surveyed and future directions to automate soft robot design and manufacturing are presented.",

In this work, a data‐driven review is presented that addresses the recent surge of research by providing a quantitative snapshot of the field.

Second, device‐level analysis examines the tethering of robots and the incorporation of component types (actuators, sensors, controllers, power sources) into each robot. Finally, component‐level analysis investigates the compliances, material compositions, and “function media” (energetic methods by which components operate) of each soft robotic component in the analyzed literature. The reported data indicate a significant reliance on elastomeric materials, electrical and fluidic media, and physical tethering; meanwhile, controllers and power sources remain underdeveloped relative to actuators and sensors.

In addition, it is necessary to lower the operating current of the RRAM cell and enable gradual switching characteristics to mimic the low‐energy operations of biological. In most filamentary RRAMs, however, overshoot current occurs in the forming stage, and the RRAM shows large device variation, high operating current, and abrupt set and reset switching characteristics. Herein, the shortcomings occurring in the forming stage are overcome by introducing and optimizing an overshoot suppression layer. Consequently, the RRAM exhibits gradual switching characteristics both in the set and reset regions, thereby enabling implementation of 4‐bit multilevel operation. In addition, the forming step can be easily performed in a 16 × 16 crossbar array owing to its self‐compliance characteristics without disturbing neighboring cells in the array. The tuning and vector–matrix multiplication (VMM) operations are also experimentally verified in the array. Finally, classification performance with off‐chip training is compared in terms of accuracy and robustness to tuning tolerance depending on the number of bits of the implemented multiconductance levels.",

    "abstract": "An electronic nose (e‐nose) mimics the mammalian olfactory system in identifying odors and expands human olfaction boundaries by tracing toxins and explosives. However, existing feature‐based odor recognition algorithms rely on domain‐specific expertise, which may limit the performance due to information loss during the feature extraction process. Inspired by human olfaction, a smart electronic nose enabled by an all‐feature olfactory algorithm (AFOA) is proposed, whereby all features in a gas sensing cycle of semiconductor gas sensors, including the response, equilibrium, and recovery processes are utilized. Specifically, our method combines 1D convolutional and recurrent neural networks with channel and temporal attention modules to fully utilize complementary global and dynamic information. It is further demonstrated that a novel data augmentation method can transform the raw data into a suitable representation for feature extraction. Results show that the e‐nose simply comprising of six semiconductor gas sensors achieves superior performances to state‐of‐the‐art methods on the Chinese liquor data. Ablation studies reveal the contribution of each sensor in odor recognition. Therefore, a deep‐learning‐enabled codesign of sensor arrays and recognition algorithms can reduce the heavy demand for a huge amount of highly specialized gas sensors and provide interpretable insights into odor recognition dynamics in an iterative way.",

Owing to the superior merits of both metals and fluids, liquid metal smart materials are increasingly being innovatively used as soft actuators and sensors to construct soft robots. To promote further development and prosperity in this field, this review organizes and summarizes the typical progress in liquid metal smart materials, with a special focus on their robotic response behaviors. In particular, the article emphasizes the concept of smart composite systems consisting of liquid metals and synergistic substances (e.g., solutions, particles, and polymers). The response behaviors of liquid metal smart materials under the actions of external factors (electricity, magnetism, ultrasound, light, heat, etc.) are examined and the smart properties occurring during these responses, such as motion, transformation, self‐organization, adaptive healing, and autonomous sensing, are identified. Furthermore, soft actuators, control systems, and robots based on liquid metal smart materials are summarized and elaborated upon. Finally, the potential directions worth pursuing and challenges are outlined.

Despite the remarkable progress on sensors development, there are still some limitations, for instance, the requirement of high operating temperatures, and that most sensors are solely dedicated to individual gas monitoring. Herein, an ultrasensitive, highly discriminative platform is demonstrated for the detection and identification of ammonia and phosphine at room temperature using a graphene nanosensor. Graphene is exfoliated and successfully functionalized by copper phthalocyanine derivate. In combination with highly efficient machine learning techniques, the developed graphene nanosensor demonstrates an excellent gas identification performance even at ultralow concentrations: 100 ppb NH 3 (accuracy—100.0%, sensitivity—100.0%, specificity—100.0%) and 100 ppb PH 3 (accuracy—77.8%, sensitivity—75.0%, and specificity—78.6%). Molecular dynamics simulation results reveal that the copper phthalocyanine derivate molecules attached to the graphene surface facilitate the adsorption of ammonia molecules owing to hydrogen bonding interactions. The developed smart gas sensing platform paves a path to design a highly selective, highly sensitive, miniaturized, low‐power consumption, nondedicated, smart gas sensing system toward a wide spectrum of gases.",

However, the biofluid environment in blood vessels is complicated due to variations in flow rate and direction. It is still unknown how to make magnetic microrobots resist the variable flow rate in biofluids with both upstream and downstream locomotion. Herein, magnetic microrobots with various shapes and sizes have been controlled to navigate diverse biofluids under different flow rates and directions. Simulation and experimental studies have been conducted to analyze the influences of microrobot size and shape on translational velocity in confined microchannels filled with biofluids. A strategy is proposed to choose the optimized parameters of rotating magnetic field actuation for precise delivery of microrobots in a microfluidic chip, which contains a complex biofluid environment with variable flow rate and direction. The results are validated using various microrobots navigating the microfluidic chip and the yolks of zebrafish larvae in vivo. This work provides a guideline for selecting desirable microrobot dimensions and magnetic field actuation parameters for controllable navigation of magnetic mobile microrobots in complex biofluid flows.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, neuromorphic systems based on memristors are considered promising approaches to the hardware realization of artificial intelligence systems with efficient information processing. However, a major bottleneck in the physical implementation of these systems is the strong dependence of their performance on the unavoidable variations (cycle‐to‐cycle, c2c, or device‐to‐device, d2d) of memristive devices. Recently, reservoir computing (RC) and spiking neuromorphic systems (SNSs) are separately proposed as valuable options to partially mitigate this problem. Herein, both approaches are combined to create a fully organic system based on 1) volatile polyaniline memristive devices for the reservoir layer and 2) nonvolatile parylene memristors for the SNS readout layer. This combination provides a simpler SNS training procedure compared with the formal neural networks and results in greater robustness to device variability, while ensuring the extraction and encoding of the input critical features (performed by the polyaniline reservoir) and the analysis and classification performed by the SNS layer. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal pattern recognition of the system brings us closer to the implementation of efficient and reliable brain‐inspired computing systems built with partially unreliable analog elements.",

Much work has been done in modeling the kinematics and dynamics of soft robots, but closed‐loop control is still in its early stages due to limited sensory feedback. Thanks to the advancement in functional materials, structures, and manufacturing techniques for flexible electronics, flexible and stretchable sensors are developing rapidly. These sensors provide feedback for closed‐loop control tasks and enable soft robots to effectively explore the unknown and safely interact with humans and the environment. Herein, recent advances in perceptive soft robots that utilize flexible/stretchable sensors and functional materials are outlined.

    "abstract": "Magnetically manipulated interventional robotic systems offer outstanding advantages for improving vascular interventions, including minimizing radiation exposure to physicians and increasing the controllability of magnetic interventional devices in hard‐to‐reach vessels. However, automatic control of magnetic guidewires (MGs) is still challenging in terms of modeling of guidewires and trajectory planning. Herein, a magnetically controlled guidewire robotic system (MCGRS) with steering and propulsion capabilities is proposed based on adequate modeling and trajectory planning methods. The steering kinematics of MG is first modeled by constant curvature theory. Then, a continuum mechanics model is built to predict the deformation of the magnetic tip by combining the dipole model and the Cosserat‐rod model. Moreover, a trajectory planning algorithm is developed to navigate the MG through vessels. Furthermore, trajectory following experiments within three vascular phantoms confirm that the proposed model and algorithm are reliable and capable of navigating the MG through the desired trajectory. Finally, two extra navigation experiments are implemented in 3D vascular phantom, which show that the MCGRS can be remotely controlled to manipulate the MG to actively steer and reach the target site. The system and methods will build the foundation for automatic control of MG and help to improve the autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Developing small mobile robots for Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) is a major challenge due to constraints in size and power required to perform vital functions such as obstacle navigation, victim detection, and wireless communication. Drawing upon the idea that insects’ locomotion can be controlled, what if we further utilize the insects’ intrinsic ability to avoid obstacles? Herein, a cockroach hybrid robot (≈ 1.5 cm height, 5.7 cm length) that implements the abovementioned functions is developed. It is tested in an arena with randomly placed obstacles, and a motion capture system is used to track the insect's position among the untracked obstacles. A navigation algorithm that uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is developed to heuristically predict the insect's situation and stimulate the insect to escape nearby obstacles. The utilization of insect's intrinsic locomotor ability and low‐powered IMU reduces the onboard power load, allowing the addition of a human‐detecting function. An image classification model enables the use of an onboard low‐resolution infrared camera for human detection. Consequently, a single hybrid robot is established that includes locomotion control, autonomous navigation in obstructed areas, onboard human detection, and wireless communication, representing a significant step toward real USAR application.",

However, in the deep sea, the robots face challenges, such as the miniaturization of the pressure protection unit and the driving method for rapid and agile motions. Herein, a jet‐driven method for a high‐pressure underwater environment is proposed by utilizing the high‐frequency vibration of a piezoelectric vibrator. Thereafter, an antihydropressure miniature robot with a body length of less than 5 cm is designed, which can perform the highly agile actions of floating, sinking, hovering, straight driving, and turning under a water pressure of 20 MPa (equal to the pressure under a water depth of 2000 m). A vertical velocity of 2.95 BH/s and a horizontal velocity of 3.22 BL/s are realized by the prototype, and it achieves faster motions than existing miniature underwater robots. Some potential applications have been realized, including small multicorner pipe exploration by carrying a camera, seaweed epidermal cell sampling in designated areas, and large object transportation by swarming, which proves the high maneuverability and agility of the developed robot. These merits make the robot ideal for multitasking operations in narrow environments with high water pressure, such as multiobstacle seabed.",

Artificial skin is a new type of HMI sensor that enables a seamless connection between human and electronic devices. Currently, artificial skin is mostly prepared from rigid materials, which lack flexibility and scalability, thus impeding the development of HMI. Hydrogel, consisting of 3D polymer network and water is similar to human tissues and is therefore an excellent candidate for artificial skin in HMI. The conventional HMI of hydrogel‐based artificial skin includes touch pad and machine control based on capacitive or resistive sensors. However, the energy supply of HMI depends on battery which requires frequent recharging and replacement. Therefore, hydrogel‐based self‐powered artificial skin is expected to become primary interaction medium for the forthcoming generation of HMI.

    "abstract": "Two significant issues in biosensors that can't be solved by conventional analytical methods are selectivity among likely biological interfering molecules and background noise in clinical samples. The application of embedded machine learning in the removal of background interference, which is extremely common in complex matrix solutions such as cerebrospinal fluid, is still unexplored. The implementation of machine learning into devices and sensors can enhance their reliability to discriminate responses. In addition, implementing these models into portable devices can further improve the usage of point‐of‐care devices, continuous monitoring, and viral mutation assessments. Herein, the requirements to implement an embedded AI model (TinyML) into low‐power portable systems and its use in the electrochemical field are presented. The application of TinyML to discriminate between interference of uric acid and ascorbic acid, both well‐known abundant electrochemically active species, in neurotransmitter detection, is explored, reaching overall accuracy of 98.1% for 32‐bit float point unit and 96.01% after 8‐bit quantization, with the usage of 4.55% of the custom‐made potentiostat memory. The model can be improved simply by having the trade‐off between memory and accuracy. The research suggests that TinyML can be a key component in future medical devices, allowing data processing in real time and with increasing reliability.",

To address these challenges, here we geometrically design a class of metacaps whose rich nonlinear mechanical behaviors can be harnessed to create soft robots with unprecedented functionalities. Specifically, we demonstrate a sensor-less metacap gripper that can grasp objects in 3.75 ms upon physical contact and a pneumatically actuated gripper with tunable actuation behaviors that have little dependence on the rate of input. Both grippers can be readily integrated into a robotic platform for practical applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the metacap enables propelling of a swimming robot, exhibiting amplified swimming speed as well as untethered, electronics-free swimming with tunable speeds.

It features multifunctional touch interaction capabilities including tactile amplitude and position and tensile strain. Four fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are embedded in a skin‐like three‐layer laminate structure of the SOFT sensor, forming a flexible tactile sensing array with a stretchability larger than 20%.

More specifically, the study elucidates a new strategy to amplify the actuation performance of the shape memory coil actuator by coupling it to a carefully designed, monostable curve beam with a snap‐through buckling behavior. Such SMA‐curved beam assembly is integrated with an entirely mechanical circuit featuring a slider mechanism. This circuit can automatically cut off and supply current to the SMA according to its deformation status, generating a self‐sustained rhythmic deformation cycle using a simple DC power supply. Finally, this study presents a new strategy to coordinate (synchronize) two rhythmic deformation cycles from two robotic modules to achieve efficient crawling locomotion but still use a single DC power.

Previous approaches have simplified robot manufacturing by using fluidic control circuits, but these rely on labor‐intensive methods like silicone molding and manual assembly, limiting accessibility and replicability. Recent work, including this work, has demonstrated 3D‐printed robotic grippers and crawlers with embedded control circuits, but generating cyclic control outputs for legged locomotion in rough terrain remains challenging. This study addresses the challenge with a monolithic 3D‐printable four‐phase bistable oscillating valve, capable of generating coordinated motion of multiple limbs from a steady source of pressurized air. The ability of the oscillator to control an electronics‐free autonomous legged robot capable of walking on rough terrain, which can be fully fabricated on a desktop 3D printer without postassembly is demonstrated. The robot is operational immediately upon connection to an air supply.

Existing research has mostly focused on optimizing individual techniques, lacking comprehensive solutions that integrate the strengths of different methods. This article proposes a hybrid digital watermarking algorithm for medical images based on frequency domain transformation and deep learning convolutional neural networks. The algorithm combines the advantages of traditional frequency domain watermarking methods and deep learning techniques. Specifically, the algorithm first extracts feature vectors from medical images using discrete wavelet transform and discrete cosine transform, enhancing the robustness of the image watermark. It then integrates an improved Inception v3 network, optimizing the convolutional kernel design, thereby effectively enhancing the robustness of the watermarking process. To further improve the security of the watermark, the Logistic Map is used to scramble and encrypt the watermark information, and a hash function and XOR operation are employed for zero embedding of the watermark. The watermark extraction and decryption process relies on a key provided by a third party, enabling blind extraction of the watermark without requiring the original image. Through extensive experimental data analysis and comparisons with multiple existing algorithms, the results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid watermarking algorithm excels in terms of attack resistance and robustness, significantly improving the security and reliability of medical image watermarking.",

These materials may play a vital role in reducing atmospheric carbon via negative carbon output. However, there is no one‐size‐fits‐all approach as different operating conditions and feedstocks may require different CLOU materials. As a result, the exploration and discovery of high‐performance CLOU materials can be a slow process. To address this challenge, a high‐throughput inverse machine learning workflow that identifies optimum materials from perovskite oxides for a given set of targets is developed—temperature and Gibbs free energy of oxygen formation. The model is trained on high‐throughput density functional theory calculations of CLOU materials and inverts the materials design process using a genetic algorithm to produce realistic substituted SrFeO 3‐δ compositions as output. Using the inverse model, it is able to identify several interesting new families of CLOU materials: Sr 1‐ x A x Fe 1‐ y B y O 3‐δ (e.g., A = Ca or K; B = Mg, Bi, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, or Zn).

To address these limitations, we propose MultiMedRes, a multimodal medical collaborative reasoning framework that simulates human physicians’ communication by incorporating a learner agent to proactively acquire information from domain‐specific expert models. MultiMedRes addresses medical multimodal reasoning problems through three steps i) Inquire: The learner agent decomposes complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain‐specific sub‐problems; ii) Interact: The agent engages in iterative “ask‐answer” interactions with expert models to obtain domain‐specific knowledge; and iii) Integrate: The agent integrates all the acquired domain‐specific knowledge to address the medical reasoning problems (e.g., identifying the difference of disease levels and abnormality sizes between medical images). We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X‐ray images. The experiments show that our zero‐shot prediction achieves state‐of‐the‐art performance, surpassing fully supervised methods, which demonstrates that MultiMedRes could offer trustworthy and interpretable assistance to physicians in monitoring the treatment progression of patients, paving the way for effective human–AI interaction and collaboration.",

However, in most cases, human intervention remains essential for the healing process. This poses a challenge, especially in working environments with limited human access or where human involvement cand hinder efficiency. To address this gap, in this article, first, the different phases of the healing process in soft robotics are discussed and then the technologies that are or can be integrated into self‐healing soft robots to allow each individual phase to be performed autonomously with minimal human involvement are reviewed. Finally, in this article, the challenges of integrating all phases into self‐healing soft robots are discussed and the perspectives on achieving fully autonomous self‐healing in the future are offered. These phases are classified into five: damage detection, damage cleaning, damage closure, stimulus‐triggered material healing, and recovery assessment. Achieving these attributes requires employing physical intelligence at the material level through the use of stimuli‐responsive materials or utilizing embodied intelligence at the system level by integrating healing‐assistive subsystems or a synergistic combination of both. Consequently, self‐healing soft robots can achieve self‐sufficiency in their healing capabilities, rendering them a sustainable solution for broader applications.",

With such a memory–computation duality, RRAM‐based in‐memory computing enables an efficient hardware solution for matrix‐multiplication‐dependent neural networks and related applications. Herein, the recent development of RRAM nanoscale devices and the parallel progress on circuit and microarchitecture layers are discussed. Well suited for analog synapse and neuron implementation, RRAM device properties and characteristics are emphasized herein. 3D‐stackable RRAM and on‐chip training are introduced in large‐scale integration. The circuit design and system organization of RRAM‐based in‐memory computing are essential to breaking the von Neumann bottleneck. These outcomes illuminate the way for the large‐scale implementation of ultra‐low‐power and dense neural network accelerators.",

    "abstract": "The widespread implementation and rapid development of autonomous systems pose stringent performance requirements on emerging sensory systems. In addition to the basic sensing requirements, leading sensory systems are required to process data and extract featured information from highly redundant data in real time. With the added edge‐computational capabilities, data shuttling is avoided, leading to significant reduction of computational burden and bandwidth pressure in the cloud. Among the different computing architectures, the neuromorphic sensory system stands out due to its high power efficiency, low latency, and excellent processing capability. Mimicking the biological neural network, the colocation of sensory, processor, and memory components of neuromorphic sensory systems enables the requirements for frequent data shuttles to be circumvented. In particular, artificial intelligent perceptions built on memristive neuromorphic systems exhibit outstanding characteristics of small footprint, low power consumption, 3D stacking ability, and high density. Herein, the two essential parts of the memristive artificial perceptron system are presented: 1) memristive systems for neuromorphic computing and 2) high‐performance sensors. Next, the current state of the art established on artificial perceptron systems covering visual, auditory, and tactile sensations is highlighted. To conclude, the current challenges and future direction in the area of advanced intelligent perceptions are presented.",

Hardware implementation of neuromorphic computing with emerging devices substantially reduces power consumption down to a few mW cm −2 , compared with the central processing unit based on conventional Si complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies (50–100 W cm −2 ). Herein, a brief introduction on the characteristics of neuromorphic computing is provided.

A few computation models for artificial neural networks (NNs), including spiking neural network (SNN) and deep neural network (DNN), which boost power efficiency by simplifying the computing procedure and minimizing memory access are discussed.

However, existing continuum robots reach the bottleneck in actuation on account of the contradiction among small size, compliance actuation, large tender range, high precision, and small dynamic error. Herein, a 3D-printed millimeter-scale soft continuum robot with an ultrathin hollow skeleton wall (300 μm) and a large inner-to-outer ratio (0.8) is reported. After coating a thin ferromagnetic elastomer layer (≈100-150 μm), the proposed soft continuum robot equipped with hybrid actuation (tendon- and magnetic-driven mode) achieves large-angle (up to 100°) steering and high-precision (low to 2 μm for static positioning) micromanipulation simultaneously. Specifically, the robot implements an ultralow dynamic tracking error of ≈10 μm, which is ≈30-fold improved than the state of art. Combined with a microneedle/knife or nasopharyngeal swab, the robot reveals the potential for versatile biomedical applications, such as drug injection on the target tissue, diseased tissue ablation, and COVID-19 nasopharyngeal sampling. The proposed millimeter-scale soft continuum robot presents remarkable advances in large-range and high-precise actuation, which provides a new method for miniature continuum robot design and finds broad applications in biomedical engineering.",

The artificial visual systems used in industrial production and domestic daily life rely significantly on cameras and image‐processing components for live monitoring and target identifying. They, however, often suffer from bulky volume, high energy consumption, and more critically, lack of adaptive responsiveness under extreme lighting conditions and thus possible mortal visual disability of flash blinding or nyctalopia for applications such as auto‐piloting. Herein, it is demonstrated that perovskite switchable photovoltaic devices are used to effectively construct all‐in‐one sensory neural network. Arising from the spontaneous and electric field‐induced ion‐migration effect, the photoresponsivity of the perovskite device can be reconfigured over the wide range of 540–1270%, which not only allows high‐fidelity adaptive image sensing of the visual information but also acts as updatable synaptic weight to enable the sensor array for performing machine‐learning tasks. With the bioinspired electronic pupil regulation function achieved through adjustable photoresponsivity of the perovskite sensor array, a proof‐of‐concept adaptive machine vision system with a maximum 263% enhancement of the object recognition accuracy for compact, mobile yet delay‐sensitive applications is demonstrated.",

Comparably, designing a strategy that can easily tune the synaptic plasticity of artificial synapses can benefit constructing an artificial neural system, where synapses with different short‐term plasticity (STP) and long‐term plasticity (LTP) are required. Herein, a strategy is designed that can easily tune the plasticity of crystallized conjugated polymer nanowire‐based synaptic transistors (STs) by low‐temperature solvent engineering. Essential synaptic functions are achieved, such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF), spike‐frequency‐dependent plasticity (SFDP), spike‐duration‐dependent plasticity (SDDP) and spike‐number‐dependent plasticity (SNDP), and potentiation/depression. The balance between crystallinity and roughness is successfully adjusted by altering solvent compositions, and plasticity of the synaptic device is easily tuned between short term and long term. The evident transition from STP to LTP, good linearity and symmetry of potentiation and depression, and the broad dynamic working range of synaptic weight are achieved. This provides a facile way to tune synaptic plasticity at low temperatures and is applicable to future organic and flexible artificial nervous systems.",

Such in‐retina biological signal processing capability is enabled by the spatiotemporal correlation within different receptive fields of the DS ganglion cells. Taking inspiration from the biological DS ganglion cells in the retina, the motion detection is demonstrated in an artificial neural network made of volatile resistive switching devices with short‐term memory effects.

Incorporating inherently soft LM into elastomeric devices offers comfort, mechanical compliance, and stretchability. The thin oxide layer also enables the formation of stable liquid colloids and LM micro/nanosized droplets that do not coalesce easily. The oxide layer can also be exfoliated and chemically modified into semiconductor 2D materials to create and deposit atomically thin materials at room temperature. Thus, the interface and its manipulation are important. This review summarizes physical and chemical methods of modifying the surface of LM to tune its properties.

    "abstract": "Soft robots are ideal to interact safely alongside humans when compared to rigid‐bodied robots. These robots require robust soft sensors that can sustain large deformations. Novel soft pneumatic sensing chambers (SPSCs) that can be directly 3D printed using a low‐cost 3D printer and an off‐the‐shelf thermoplastic poly(urethane) (TPU) are presented. The SPSCs are responsive to four main mechanical input modalities of compression, bending, torsion, and rectilinear displacement, and all of these cause a pressure change in the SPSCs. The SPSCs have several advantages including fast response, linearity, negligible hysteresis, repeatability and reliability, stability over time, long lifetime, and very low power consumption. The SPSCs are optimized using finite element modeling (FEM) simulations to obtain a linear relationship between the input mechanical modalities and the output pressure. With the hyperelastic material model developed for the TPU, the FEM simulations accurately predict the experimental behavior. These SPSCs are generic and can be tailored to diverse soft and interactive human–machine interfaces including soft wearable gloves for virtual reality applications and soft adaptive grippers control, soft push buttons for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education platforms, haptic feedback devices for rehabilitation, soft game controllers and soft throttle controllers for gaming, and soft bending sensors for soft prosthetic hands.",

    "abstract": "Wearable devices have many applications ranging from health analytics to virtual and mixed reality interaction, to industrial training. For wearable devices to be practical, they must be responsive, deformable to fit the wearer, and robust to the user's range of motion. Signals produced by the wearable must also be informative enough to infer the precise physical state or activity of the user. Herein, a fully soft, wearable glove is developed, which is capable of real‐time hand pose reconstruction, environment sensing, and task classification. The design is easy to fabricate using low cost, commercial off‐the‐shelf items in a manner that is amenable to automated manufacturing. To realize such capabilities, resisitive and fluidic sensing technologies with machine learning neural architectures are merged. The glove is formed from a conductive knit which is strain sensitive, providing information through a network of resistance measurements. Fluidic sensing captured via pressure changes in fibrous sewn‐in flexible tubes, measuring interactions with the environment. The system can reconstruct user hand pose and identify sensory inputs such as holding force, object temperature, conductability, material stiffness, and user heart rate, all with high accuracy. The ability to identify complex environmentally dependent tasks, including held object identification and handwriting recognition is demonstrated.",

It is complex to mimic key skin features using existing tactile sensors, and there exists no somatosensor that responds to real stimuli of pressure, temperature, and touch. Herein, three critical skin receptors created by realizing integrated electronic systems that mimic the feedback response of somatosensors are experimentally demonstrated. Fully functional Pacinian corpuscles, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors are realized using a combination of stretchable pressure sensors, phase‐change oxide thin films, and threshold‐based resistive switching (memristor) memory elements. The ability to detect and respond to pressure, temperature, and pain stimuli above a threshold with real‐life performance characteristics is demonstrated with explanation of underlying mechanisms. The ability to design and realize artificial skin receptors enables replacement of affected human skin regions, augment skin sensitivity for agile applications in defense and sports, and drive advancements in intelligent robotics.",

    "abstract": "Bioinspired soft robotics have unique advantages in superior adaptability and complex motions for field exploration and interaction with humans. The mobility and output force, however, are still the critical challenges for many promising applications. It is attractive to develop “untethered” robotics to improve the mobility by getting rid of the external electrical or pneumatic tethers while achieving massive output stroke and force. Inspired by the creatures' movements induced by the multiplication of cells and asymmetric volume changes of the tissue, an untethered soft actuator composed of self‐contained liquids and super‐elastic chambers is proposed, and by remote stimuli (e.g., near‐infrared light), the capsuled liquids transit from liquid to vapor, giving rise to volume change in the corresponding chambers. Programmable motions, i.e., photophobia of artificial sunflower, can be realized, indicating a massive and linear driving stroke (up to 160% in elongation, 0.5 mm °C −1 ) and output force (14.5 N with 6 g self‐weight, 0.33 N °C −1 ). The untethered soft actuator suggests a feasible approach to develop smart, soft, and autonomous robotics and holds promise in fields ranging from surgery to rehabilitation and rescue.",

Therapeutic antibody and vaccine development are being actively explored, and a phase I clinical trial of mRNA‐1273 which is developed in collaboration between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Moderna, Inc. is currently underway. Timelines for the broad deployment of a vaccine and antibody therapies have been estimated to be 12–18 months or longer. These are promising approaches that may lead to sustained efficacy in treating COVID‐19. However, its emergence has also led to a large number of clinical trials evaluating drug combinations composed of repurposed therapies. As study results of these combinations continue to be evaluated, there is a need to move beyond traditional drug screening and repurposing by harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize combination therapy design.

However, the limited effective workspace of an electromagnet‐based magnetic navigation system (MNS) influences the practical applications. Herein, the method of steering a flexible MCR in the enlarged workspace of a common MNS for RIRS is presented. First, the field heterogeneity is parameterized to quantitatively analyze its influence on the motion of the MCR. Then, a kinematic model of the MCR is constructed, by coupling the heterogeneous‐field and Cosserat‐rod models, to predict its large deformation in the enlarged workspace with constraints. The model is validated with the maximum mean error of 0.53 ± 0.39 mm for the tip position in all the experiments. It is demonstrated that the effective workspace can be enlarged to 75% of the physical workspace. In addition, experiments in phantoms, which simulate two challenges during RIRS, are performed to prove its manipulability. This study enlarges the effective workspace of the MNS, which helps expand the practical application of the MCR.",

However, a comprehensive benchmark that considers not only the device but also the peripheral circuit necessary for realizing complete neural functions is still lacking. Herein, the recent progress of emerging spiking neuron devices and circuits is reviewed. By implementing peripheral analog circuits for supporting various spiking neuron devices in the in‐memory computing architecture, the advantages and challenges in area and energy efficiency are discussed by benchmarking various technologies. A small or even no membrane capacitor, a self‐reset property, and a high spiking frequency are highly desirable.",

    "abstract": "Multimaterial 3D printing in electronics is expanding due to the ability to realize geometrically complex systems with simplified processes compared with conventional printed circuit board. Herein, the feasibility of using a copper‐based filament to realize 3D circuits with planar and vertical interconnections is presented. The resistivity of the tracks (1–3 mm wide) is studied with reference to printing parameters and orientation. Using lateral infill for 1 mm tracks offers lower resistance compared with longitudinal infill (≈75%). For wider tracks, the effect of infill orientation on resistance diminishes. The evaluation of tracks embedded in polylactic acid shows a drop in maximum current (to ≈11 mA) compared with exposed tracks (≈16 mA). There is no observed correlation between electrical performance and number of embedding layers. However, a significant correlation is observed between the tracks’ resistance and the amount of time the filament remains in the heated nozzle. This in‐depth study leads to optimum resolution to realize conductive tracks of 0.67 mm thickness and the first integration of fused deposition modeling (FDM)‐printed conductive traces with small‐outline integrated circuits to open a pathway for higher‐density 3D printed circuits. Finally, the transmission of digital data by a 3D printed circuit is demonstrated.",

However, soft strain sensors generally cannot distinguish in‐plane strain from normal stress. For example, stretching a sensor often gives a similar signal to pressing the sensor. To solve this problem, a liquid metal (LM)‐interdigitated capacitive strain sensor that is insensitive to normal stress is introduced. The sensor contains LM‐interdigitated electrodes prepared by vacuum filling of LM into lithographically defined microchannels. The capacitance between the LM electrodes decreases with increasing strain due to geometric changes. Because of the liquid nature of the electrodes, the sensor exhibits high stretchability (100% strain) and repeatability with gauge factor of −0.3. Due to the elasticity of the device, the sensor has low hysteresis (&lt;1%) and no crosstalk between strain and normal stress sensing. These types of soft sensors may find use in wearable devices.",

    "abstract": "The human receives and transmits various information from the outside world through different sensory systems. The sensory neurons integrate various sensory inputs into a synthetical perception to monitor complex environments, and this fundamentally determines the way how we perceive the world. Developing multifunctional artificial sensory elements that can integrate multisensory perception plays a vital role in future intelligent perception systems, whereas prior spiking neurons reported can only handle single‐mode physical signals. Herein, a bioinspired haptic‐temperature fusion spiking neuron based upon a serial connection of piezoresistive sensor and VO 2 volatile memristor is presented. The artificial sensory neuron is capable of detecting and encoding pressure and temperature inputs based on the voltage dividing effect and the intrinsic thermal sensitivity of metal–insulator transition in VO 2 . Recognition of Braille characters is achieved through multiple piezoresistive sensors, taking advantage of the spatial integration capabilities of such spiking neurons. Notably, the traditionally separate haptic and temperature signals can be fused physically in the sensory neuron when synchronizing the two sensory cues, which is able to recognize multimodal haptic/temperature patterns. The artificial multisensory neuron thus provides a promising approach toward e‐skin, neurorobotics, and human–machine interaction technologies.

In‐sensor computing based on optoelectronic synapses allows efficient computation by directly sensing and processing optical signals. Herein, an optoelectronic synapse based on Au/ZnO:N/IGZO/TiN structure is proposed. It shows uniform optical SET and electrical RESET behaviors, with various light‐tunable plasticity. Furthermore, a 4‐bit reservoir is experimentally implemented on the device, which is ideal to construct in‐sensor reservoir computing (RC) system. By converting spatiotemporal optical signals to higher dimensional feature space, in‐sensor RC has a great advantage in processing sequential visual information. Simulation results demonstrate that the in‐sensor RC system based on the proposed synapse achieves a considerable recognition accuracy (90.45%) for the MNIST dataset with very limited 36‐30‐10 perceptron network, and a 97.14% accuracy for human action classification from sequential vision data based on the Weizmann dataset. This work proves the low training cost and great efficiency for processing spatiotemporal and sequential optical signals, which may pave a new way for future machine vision applications.",

    "abstract": "Conventional resistive crossbar array for in‐memory computing suffers from high static current/power, serious IR drop, and sneak paths. In contrast, the “capacitive” crossbar array that harnesses transient current and charge transfer is gaining attention as it 1) only consumes dynamic power, 2) has no DC sneak paths and avoids severe IR drop (thus, selector‐free), and 3) can be fabricated on top of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) circuits for 3D‐stacking. For the first time, ferroelectric Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO) capacitive crossbar arrays are experimentally demonstrated. Asymmetry of the HZO electrode interfaces leads to small‐signal capacitance on/off ratio &gt;110% that can achieve read‐disturb‐free operation. The vector matrix multiplication (VMM) experiments are conducted on the fabricated capacitive crossbar array, showing a linear weighted sum versus numbers of input or on‐state weight. The array‐level VMM operation could maintain weight pattern reprogramming after 1) thousands of 1 ms/3 V pulses and 2) an extrapolated 10‐year retention at 85 °C. Array‐level circuit simulation at 22 nm node shows the energy consumption of a capacitive crossbar array is 20–200× lower than the resistive crossbar array counterpart. Moreover, analog‐shift‐and‐add circuits are designed for multibit weight summation, achieving 16.6% less area and 26.9% lower energy consumption than digital‐shift‐and‐add circuits.",

However, the functional versatility and multimodal sensing of soft robots still need improvements. On one hand, the configuration of a soft robot is predefined during manufacturing; on the other hand, the multimodal perception of the deformable soft actuator is challenging. In this work, a reconfigurable and proprioceptive soft origami module is presented, where two kinds of basic actuation modes (i.e., extension and bending) are realized, and multimodal perception is enabled using a novel foldable self‐inductance sensor. As a result, the origami module can be reconfigured to assemble multifunctional robots that can measure interaction force, body configuration, and other environmental information. Dedicated experiments are performed to validate the performance of the proposed origami module. An intelligent gripper assembled using three origami modules is designed with the capabilities of grasping mode adjustment, grasping force measurement, and the grasping target's size measurement. An intelligent jellyfish is assembled using five origami modules, and equipped with buoyancy adjustment and underwater grasping capabilities. The proposed proprioceptive modular soft origami provides an effective solution for versatile and intelligent soft robot design.",

Electrostatic clutches (ESClutches) offer a very‐low‐energy solution to block motion and are mm thin. Challenges for ESClutches in wearables are 1) effective integration in clothing to accurately block body motion while ensuring comfort, 2) well‐controlled sliding for variable stiffness rendering, and 3) adaptation to shoulder or hip joints. Here, the control of sliding friction of soft ESClutches is demonstrated, using materials that enable both integration in textile and efficient force transfer to the user. We present a 1.3 mm‐thick soft glove with five ESClutches, providing up to 50 N of kinesthetic feedback per finger. A clutch in a thin haptic sleeve that controls elbow extension is reported. Eight cable‐format ESClutches on a shoulder are shown, selectively blocking multiple degrees of freedom. VR tests demonstrate that the glove and the sleeve give the user the ability to rank the softness and weight of virtual objects. In a teleoperation scenario, the glove enables the user to remotely feel an object's stiffness.

Droplet‐based robots are great candidates to travel inside narrow and constrained spaces without damaging the interfaces due to their extreme deformability and liquid nature, which enables smooth contact between robots and target spaces. Here, magnetic liquid metal droplet robots, comprising liquid metal and carbonyl iron, that can perform reversible telescopic deformation, bending, and on‐demand locomotion are proposed. The magnetic liquid‐metal‐based robots can perform on‐demand and reversible coalescence and splitting by intricately applying magnetic fields. Importantly, the liquid metal robot can perform phase transition to fix the desired shape after programmable shape encoding. The liquid‐metal‐based soft robots can serve as dynamic and recyclable switches for complex circuits, and are capable of repairing damaged sections of microcircuits by remote actuation, controllable coalescence, and on‐demand circuit welding. This technology provides a new application scenario of droplet‐based soft robots for on‐demand circuit welding and transient recyclable electronics.

The sensing signals of mechanical deformation and temperature changes are often hard to differentiate manually. Herein, two hydrogel sensors are used for simultaneously proprioceptive, thermoceptive, and mechanoreceptive sensing. These stretchable sensors show high sensitivity to strain and temperature changes. Then, a machine learning model composed of a 1D convolutional neural network and a feed‐forward neural network is utilized to decode the sensing signal for various stimuli identification. It is demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately predict the soft actuator's body posture changes, such as bending, twisting, and stretching. In addition, the model can discern contact events with or without thermal stimuli. This data‐driven method for multimodal sensing discrimination might pave the way for future intelligent soft robots.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic miniature robots (MMRs) are mobile actuators that can exploit their size to noninvasively access highly confined, enclosed spaces. By leveraging on such unique abilities, MMRs have great prospects to transform robotics, biomedicine, and materials science. As having high dexterity is critical for MMRs to enable their targeted applications, existing MMRs have developed numerous soft‐bodied gaits to locomote in various environments. However, there exist two critical limitations that have severely restricted their dexterity: 1) MMRs capable of multimodal soft‐bodied locomotion have only demonstrated five‐degrees‐of‐freedom (five‐DOF) motions because the sixth‐DOF rotation about their net magnetic moment axis is uncontrollable; 2) six‐DOF MMRs have only realized one mode of soft‐bodied, swimming locomotion. Herein, a six‐DOF MMR is proposed that can execute seven modes of soft‐bodied locomotion and perform 3D pick‐and‐place operations. By optimizing its harmonic magnetization profile, the MMR can produce 1.41–63.9‐fold larger sixth‐DOF torque than existing MMRs with similar profiles, without compromising their traditional five‐DOF actuation capabilities. The proposed MMR demonstrates unprecedented dexterity: it can jump through narrow slots to reach higher grounds; use precise orientation control to roll, two‐anchor crawl, and swim across tight openings with strict shape constraints; and perform undulating crawling across three different planes in convoluted channels.

A task‐specified small dataset that focuses on a narrow material system, knowledge (rule)‐based descriptor extraction, and significant data dimension reduction are not the main focus of this study. Conventional powder XRD patterns, which are most widely used in materials research, can be used as a significantly informative material descriptor for deep learning. Both the FCN and T‐encoder outperform the CGCNN for symmetry classification. For property prediction, the performance of the FCN concatenated with multilayer perceptron reaches the performance level of CGCNN. Machine‐learning‐driven material property prediction from the powder XRD pattern deserves appreciation because no such attempts have been made despite common XRD‐driven symmetry (and lattice size) prediction and phase identification. The ICSD and MP data are embedded in the 2D (or 3D) latent space through the VAE, and well‐separated clustering according to the symmetry and property is observed.",

Herein, stretchable strain sensors capable of operating over multi‐strain range and having an excellent gauge factor are presented. The systematic study, carried out with different combinations of elastomer, conductive filler, and graphene–carbon paste (GCP), revealed that the sensors exhibit excellent stretchability when only filler particles are present in the elastomer, and they exhibit high sensitivity when filler particles are mixed with GCP. The molecular dynamics simulations show that the addition of GCP to the elastomer‐filler composite helps to attain an excellent sensor response with wide range stretchability. Thus, sensors’ response can be tuned by using selected material composition. Accordingly, the strain sensor with 50 wt% GCP reveals 500% stretchability and a maximum gauge factor of 504. Likewise, 150 wt% GCP loading lead to sensors with 45% stretchability and an unprecedented gauge factor of 1 834 140. The capability to detect the small‐ to large‐scale strains makes the presented sensors attractive for monitoring the movements of body parts–which range from small movements during facial expression to large movement experienced by the limb joints.",

However, actuation strategies of these robots have long been designed out of heuristics. Herein, it is aimed to develop an intelligent method to solve the inverse problem of finding workable magnetic fields for the actuation of strip‐like soft robots entirely based on deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Magnetic torques and a dissipation force to the Cosserat rod model are introduced, and the developed model to simulate the dynamics of MSRs is utilized. Meanwhile, under the reinforcement learning framework, soft robots to move forward without human guidance are successfully trained, and the results intelligently adapt to different magnetization patterns and magnetic field restrictions. The learned actuation strategies by directly applying simulated magnetic fields to real MSRs in an open loop way are validated. The experimental results show good accordance with simulations. By presenting the first case of using strategies entirely generated by reinforcement learning to control real MSRs, the potential of using reinforcement learning to achieve autonomous actuation of MSRs is demonstrated, which can be used to establish a route for the creation of highly adaptive design framework.",

For many artificial tactile sensors, especially those based on optical principles, inflexibility, bulkiness, and monomodality limit their potential to function as humanoid skins. Herein, by embedding lab‐made optical nanofibers (ONFs) into elastomeric films, soft, flexible, thin (around 500 μm, similar to human skin), and multimodal (force and thermosensitive) robotic skins are achieved. These superior characteristics arise from the low flexural rigidity and large evanescent field of ONFs, due to their subwavelength diameters (down to 450 nm). By tuning light wavelength, ONF diameter, and skin thickness, variable sensitivities and sensing ranges for both force and temperature are reported. Depending on different sensing requirements, special modules can be further assembled on the ONF skins for various surface properties, including hardness, texture, and thermal conductivity. The ONF skins can enable a commercial robot to emulate human behaviors, including adaptive grasping of flimsy objects, contactless temperature measurement, and even the perception of leaf veins. It is anticipated that these ONF skins could offer a unique solution in multiple intelligent systems such as robotics, prosthetics, human–machine interface and wearable devices.",

In these systems, a common lack of integrated microsensors or optical feedback prohibits stabilizing closed‐loop control. Moreover, the low stiffness of compact actuator and microfabrication limitations lead to difficult control. Herein, a compact bistable open‐loop micromechanism mounted on a small (170 μm) capillary fiber is developed. Bistabillity is utilized to control the mechanism to precise positions without the need for feedback or continuous control. Repeatable fabrication of this compact and high‐resolution bistable micromechanism is achieved with a two‐photon polymerization (2PP) process refined by oxygen plasma etching (OPE) that results in minimal feature size of a few hundred nanometers along the direction of the laser's axis, allowing 2PP bistable mechanisms to be fabricated in arbitrary orientations not restricted by printing direction. Finite element method simulations and experimental studies of the OPE effect are presented and used to optimize the micromechanism's bistable behavior. Finally, the feasibility of such compact bistable mechanism with a gripper that captures 50 μm spheres and passively maintains grasping without constant driving force even in long open‐close cycles is demonstrated.",

These flexible manipulators are required to advance through the tortuous and narrow anatomic paths via natural orifices for dexterous diagnostic examination and therapeutic operations. Therefore, developing flexible endoscopic manipulators with the capacity of snake‐like movements for flexible access and variable stiffness regulation for operations to address these flexible access surgical difficulties is demanding but remains challenging. To address such challenges, herein, it is proposed that a novel distal continuum joint based on the hybrid pneumatic and cable‐driven approach achieves variable stiffness capacity, excellent bending characteristics in both flexible and rigid states, satisfactory motion consistency and shape‐locking ability during the rigid‐flexible transition, and relatively high loading capacity for flexible gastrointestinal endoscopic robots. Characterization experiments validate these performances, and phantom and ex vivo experiments have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness for FE. The presented method demonstrates an effective and practical approach to enabling continuum robots with both flexible access and tunable stiffness capacity and supports a convenient extension for MIS applications.",

Herein, the design of a diffractive processor is presented that can all‐optically perform multispectral quantitative phase imaging of transparent phase‐only objects within a snapshot. The design utilizes spatially engineered diffractive layers, optimized through deep learning, to encode the phase profile of the input object at a predetermined set of wavelengths into spatial intensity variations at the output plane, allowing multispectral QPI using a monochrome focal plane array. Through numerical simulations, diffractive multispectral processors are demonstrated to simultaneously perform quantitative phase imaging at 9 and 16 target spectral bands in the visible spectrum. The generalization of these diffractive processor designs is validated through numerical tests on unseen objects, including thin Pap smear images.

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing (RC) architecture which mimics the human brain is a fundamentally preferred method to process dynamical systems that evolve with time. However, the difficulty in generating rich reservoir states using two‐terminal devices remains challenging, which hinders its hardware implementation. Herein, the 1D array of ferroelectric field‐effect transistor (Fe‐FET) based on α ‐In 2 Se 3 channel, which shows volatile memory effect for realizing various RC systems, is demonstrated. The fading effect in α ‐In 2 Se 3 is sufficiently investigated by polarization dynamic model. The proposed Fe‐FET is capable of experimentally classifying images using MNIST dataset with a high accuracy of 91%. Furthermore, time‐series real‐life chaotic system, for example, Earth's weather, can be accurately forecasted using our Ferro‐RC based on the Jena climate dataset recorded in a 1 year period. Remarkable determination coefficient ( R 2 ) of 0.9983 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 8.3 × 10 −3 are achieved using a minimized readout network. The demonstration of integrated memory and computation opens a route for realizing a compact RC hardware system.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in wearable sensing technology have demonstrated unprecedented opportunities for artificial intelligence. In comparison with the traditional hand‐held electrolarynx, a wearable and intelligent artificial throat with sound‐sensing ability is a more comfortable and versatile method to assist disabled people with communication. Herein, a piezoresistive sensor with a novel configuration is demonstrated, which consists of polystyrene (PS) spheres as microstructures sandwiched between silver nanowires and reduced graphene oxide layers. In fact, changes in the device's conducting patterns are obtained by spay‐coating the various weight ratios and sizes of the PS microspheres, which is a fast and convenient way to establish microstructures for improving sensitivity. The wearable artificial throat device also exhibits high sensitivity, fast response time, and ultralow intensity level detection. Moreover, the device's excellent mechanical–electrical performance allows it to detect subtle throat vibrations that can be converted into controllable sounds. In this case, an intelligent artificial throat is achieved by combining a deep learning algorithm with a highly flexible piezoresistive sensor to successfully recognize five different words (help, sick, patient, doctor, and COVID) with an accuracy exceeding 96%. Herein, new opportunities in voice control as well as other human‐machine interface applications are opened.",

Herein, reservoir computing is demonstrated that utilizes multidetected nonlinear spin wave interference in an yttrium‐iron‐garnet single crystal. The subject computing system achieves excellent performance when used for hand‐written digit recognition, second‐order nonlinear dynamical tasks, and nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA).

However, most studies have focused on one or several locomotion modes, lacking in terms of inverted climbing, movement with a heavy load, and climbing a vertical plane. Herein, an inchworm‐like soft robot is actuated with multimodal locomotion using an acrylic stick‐constrained dielectric elastomer actuator (ASCDEA). By assembling the ASCDEA with a flexible support frame, a soft saddle‐like shape body is designed to provide the shape deformation ability for the robot. This design enables the robot to move under a heavy load. Two electroadhesion actuators are designed to implement the anchoring action. Additionally, a coordination control strategy is developed to synchronize the shape deformation and electroadhesion for multimodal locomotion. Experimental results confirm that the designed robot can move at a maximum velocity of 39.55 mm s −1 (0.53 body length s −1 ) on an inverted plane. Moreover, the robot is capable of multimodal locomotion, including inverted climbing, vertical climbing, horizontal crawling, turning locomotion, and rapid movement with a heavy load. The developed soft robot can navigate through a confined horizontal tunnel while carrying a payload, cross a gap, circumvent obstacles, and is particularly robust owing to its compliance.",

TASTA is made to be simple, small, clean, and efficient for clear performance justification and possible easy extension.

The subject redox‐IGR successfully solves a second‐order nonlinear dynamic equation by utilizing voltage pulse driven ion‐gating in a Li x WO 3 channel to enable reservoir computing. Under the normal conditions, in which only the drain current ( I D ) is used for the reservoir states, the lowest prediction error is 8.15 × 10 −4 . Performance is enhanced by the addition of I G to the reservoir states, resulting in a significant lowering of the prediction error to 5.39 × 10 −4 , which is noticeably lower than other types of physical reservoirs (memristors and spin torque oscillators) reported to date. A second‐order nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA2) task, a typical benchmark of reservoir computing, is also performed with the IGR and good performance is achieved, with a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.163. A short‐term memory task is performed to investigate an enhancement mechanism resulting from the I G addition. An increase in memory capacity, from 2.35 without I G to 3.57 with I G , is observed in the forgetting curves, indicating that enhancement of both high dimensionality and memory capacity is attributed to the origin of the performance improvement.",

As more complex and data‐intensive tasks emerge, it is becoming increasingly important to enhance CAM density for improved performance and better area efficiency. To reduce the area overheads, various nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices, such as ferroelectric field‐effect transistors (FeFETs), are used in CAM design. Herein, a novel ultracompact 1FeFET CAM design that enables parallel associative search and in‐memory hamming distance calculation is used, as well as a multibit CAM for exact search using the same CAM cell. The proposed CAM design leverages the 1FeFET1R structure, and compact device designs that integrate the series resistor current limiter into the intrinsic FeFET structure are demonstrated to turn the 1FeFET1R structure into an effective 1FeFET cell. A two‐step search operation of the proposed binary and multibit 1FeFET CAM array through both experiments and simulations is proposed, showing a sufficient sensing margin despite unoptimized FeFET device variation. In genome pattern matching applications, using the hyperdimensional computing paradigm, the design results in a 89.9× speedup and 66.5× improvement in energy efficiency over the state‐of‐the‐art alignment tools on GPU.",

Therefore, robotic manipulators need high‐resolution touch sensors that are compact, robust, inexpensive, and efficient. The soft vision‐based haptic sensor presented herein is a miniaturized and optimized version of the previously published sensor Insight. Minsight has the size and shape of a human fingertip and uses machine learning methods to output high‐resolution maps of 3D contact force vectors at 60 Hz. Experiments confirm its excellent sensing performance, with a mean absolute force error of 0.07 N and contact location error of 0.6 mm across its surface area. Minsight's utility is shown in two robotic tasks on a 3‐DoF manipulator. First, closed‐loop force control enables the robot to track the movements of a human finger based only on tactile data. Second, the informative value of the sensor output is shown by detecting whether a hard lump is embedded within a soft elastomer with an accuracy of 98%. These findings indicate that Minsight can give robots the detailed fingertip touch sensing needed for dexterous manipulation and physical human–robot interaction.",

    "abstract": "Organic synaptic transistors (OSTs) using intrinsic polymer semiconductors are demonstrated to be suitable for neuromorphic bioelectronics. However, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)‐based copolymers are not applicable to neuromorphic computing systems because the DPP polymer film has demonstrated only short‐term plasticity with short retention (&lt;50 ms) in synaptic devices because of their intrinsic difficulty of electrochemical doping. To expand their applications toward neuromorphic computing that requires long‐term plasticity, artificial synapses with extended retention time should be developed. Herein, molecular tailoring approach to extend the retention time in the ion‐gel‐gated OSTs that use DPP is suggested. The molecular structure is controlled by changing alkyl spacer lengths of side chains. As a result, the doping process is more favorable in DPP with long alkyl spacer, which is confirmed by high doping concentration and slow dedoping rate. Therefore, dedoping of ions is more suppressed in DPP with long alkyl side chain that exhibits extended retention time (≈800 s) of the OSTs. These optimized DPP‐based OSTs obtain high pattern recognition accuracy of ≈96.0% in simulations of an artificial neural network. Molecular tailoring strategies provide a guideline to overcome the intrinsic problem of short synaptic retention time of the OSTs for use in neuromorphic computing.",

Yet, there is no single gripper that can gently grip objects with such a wide range of properties. Herein, a soft gripper that combines granular jamming (GJ) and electroadhesion (EA) to gently grasp and release a large set of diverse objects is presented. The gripper can operate in GJ mode only, in EA mode only, or in a combination mode that simultaneously activates GJ and EA. In GJ mode, the gripper can grasp objects with different surface properties, lift objects 38 times its own weight using negative pressure, and release objects by applying positive pressure, but has difficulty in handling flat and fragile objects. In EA mode, the gripper can manipulate flat and fragile objects but encounters difficulties with different surface properties such as oily or moisture. In the combination mode, the gripper can generate grasping forces up to 35% higher than in the GJ mode for all object sizes and certain shapes such as a cylinder.

The most recent IT devices are based on oxygen ions and vacancies movement to alter interfacial Schottky barrier parameters and thereby control RS properties. However, the reliability and stability of these devices have been significantly affected by the undesired diffusion of ionic species. Herein, a reliable interface‐dominated memristive device is demonstrated using a simple Au/Nb‐doped SrTiO 3 (Nb:STO) Schottky structure. The Au/Nb:STO Schottky barrier modulation by charge trapping and detrapping is responsible for the analog resistive switching characteristics. Because of its interface‐controlled RS, the proposed device shows low device‐to‐device, cell‐to‐cell, and cycle‐to‐cycle variability while maintaining high repeatability and stability during endurance and retention tests. Furthermore, the Au/Nb:STO IT memristive device exhibits versatile synaptic functions with an excellent uniformity, programmability, and reliability. A simulated artificial neural network with Au/Nb:STO synapses achieves a high recognition accuracy of 94.72% for large digit recognition from MNIST database. These results suggest that IT resistive switching can be potentially used for artificial synapses to build next‐generation neuromorphic computing.",

    "abstract": "The ability to locate and quantify large strains will significantly improve the real‐world application scenario of flexible and stretchable strain sensors. However, current methods for implementing stretchable distributed strain sensing still face challenges such as complicated demodulation, multisensor crosstalk, and high power consumption. Herein, a self‐powered and stretchable optical fiber strain sensor is reported with distributed sensing capability based on mechanoluminescent optical fiber, where mechanoluminescent phosphors with different emission color light are discretely integrated onto the outer cladding of the elastomer optical fiber. Based on the wavelength coding technique and time‐domain filtering comparison method, the capability of strain magnitude quantification (10–60%) and strain location identification together in a single stretchable optical fiber is successfully realized, even at multiple positions simultaneously in the strain‐applied situation. Moreover, this stretchable optical fiber strain sensor shows insensitivity to bending, compression, and temperature disturbances and outstanding durability (&gt;8000 cycles). Due to the excellent light confinement of the elastomer optical fiber, demonstrations such as bright‐field measurement, saline water operation, and wearable glove application exhibit its potential as a promising technology for future self‐powered distributed optical sensing systems.",

While fully autonomous farming holds great potential, most systems fall short of meeting the demands of present‐day agricultural operations. The use of human labor or teleoperated robots is also limited due to the physiological constraints of humans and the shortcomings of interfaces used to control robots. To harness the strengths of autonomous capabilities and endurance of robots, as well as the decision‐making capabilities of humans, human–robot collaboration (HRC) has emerged as a viable approach. By identifying the various applications of HRC in current research and the infrastructure employed to develop them, interested parties seeking to utilize collaborative robotics in agriculture can gain a better understanding of the possibilities and challenges they may encounter. In this review, an overview of existing HRC applications in the agricultural domain is provided. Additionally, general trends and weaknesses are identified within the research corpus. This review serves as a presentation of the state‐of‐the‐art research of HRC in agriculture for professionals considering the adoption of HRC. Robotics engineers can utilize this review as a resource for easily accessing information on the hardware, software, and algorithms employed in building HRC systems for agriculture.",

The power requirement of multitudes of devices in the e‐Skin is a major hurdle for its wider uptake. Herein, a solar cells‐based energy generating e‐Skin is presented and how the energy outputs of solar cells can be innovatively processed for multimodal sensing is demonstrated. By reading the variations and energy output patterns of the e‐Skin, present on a robotic arm, multiple parameters can be sensed including object motion, color detection, and ambient temperature. With the accurate tracking of shadow sensing, for an object moving in horizontal and vertical directions with respect to the solar skin, information can be obtained such as the velocity and acceleration of moving object. In this regard, the presented e‐Skin can also be seen to have vision capability. The presented multifunctional energy‐generating e‐Skin shows an energy surplus of &gt;1 mW (effective module area of 20 cm 2 ) under white light illumination of 4,450 lux, which is sufficient for continuous powering of portable low‐powered devices.

The actuator comprises a 3D printed, cylindrical handed shearing auxetic (HSA) structure and a deformable, internal rubber bellows shaft. The actuator linearly extends upon applying torque from a servo motor; the rubber bellows shaft is stretchable but resistant to torsional deflection, allowing it to transmit torque from the servo motor to the other end of the HSA. The high flexibility of the HSA and rubber bellows shaft enable the actuator to adaptively extend even when bent. The actuator's two components and its performance are mechanically characterized. Actuation strains of 45% elongation and a maximum blocked pushing force of about 8 N are demonstrated. The actuator's capabilities are showcased in two separate demonstrations: a crawling robot and a sensorized artificial muscle that integrates a microfluidic, liquid metal strain sensor. The architected material design approach for a robust, motor‐driven soft actuator provides several unique features—including a compact form factor and ease of use—over other motorized soft robotic actuators based on HSA assemblies or cable tendon mechanisms.",

Universal soft grippers have proven effective for grasping common objects, however complex objects or environments require bespoke gripper designs. Multi‐material printing presents a vast design‐space which, when coupled with an expressive computational design algorithm, can produce numerous, novel, high‐performance soft grippers. Finding high‐performing designs in challenging design spaces requires tools that combine rapid iteration, simulation accuracy, and fine‐grained optimization across a range of gripper designs to maximize performance, no current tools meet all these criteria. Herein, a diversity‐based soft gripper design framework combining generative design and topology optimization (TO) are presented. Compositional pattern‐producing networks (CPPNs) seed a diverse set of initial material distributions for the fine‐grained TO. Focusing on vacuum‐driven multi‐material soft grippers, several grasping modes (e.g. pinching, scooping) emerging without explicit prompting are demonstrated. Extensive automated experimentation with printed multi‐material grippers confirms optimized candidates exceed the grasp strength of comparable commercial designs. Grip strength, durability, and robustness is evaluated across 15,170 grasps. The combination of fine‐grained generative design, diversity‐based design processes, high‐fidelity simulation, and automated experimental evaluation represents a new paradigm for bespoke soft gripper design which is generalizable across numerous design domains, tasks, and environments.",

First, a modularization concept and a hybrid actuation scheme to create a novel origami continuum manipulator with exceptional deformability are introduced. Second, an accurate model and framework for the forward and inverse kinematic analysis of origami manipulators are proposed. Specifically, each origami manipulator module can achieve axial extension and bending deformation by coordinated actuation of shape memory alloy (SMA) and pneumatic muscles, and the manipulator's end is equipped with a deformable gripper based on waterbomb origami and actuated by SMA. Through careful consideration of the self‐weight and torque balance, an accurate kinematic model based on the Denavit–Hartenberg method is established, which enables one to effectively predict the reachable extreme positions and spatial poses of the manipulator and solve the inverse kinematics using a genetic algorithm. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the design's rationality and model's accuracy . In these tests, the rich spatial configurations are not only demonstrated that can be achieved by integrating hybrid actuators with origami modules but also the accuracy and reliability of the kinematic model are confirmed, opening up possibilities for the advancement and application of origami‐inspired robotics in various fields.",

The cellophane films reported here bend almost instantaneously under changing humidity, with a large bending curvature, high repeatability, and negligible hysteresis. Different actuation modes are studied using both coated and uncoated cellophane films. The uncoated cellophane film can continuously move on a moist substrate through autonomous bending–rolling–flipping (or oscillating) cycles. A facile strategy is used here to control the rolling direction and facilitate the flipping motion by offsetting its center of gravity during deformation by adding appropriate weights on the end of the actuator. The coated cellophane film is used to fabricate motion‐programmable actuators through heat‐laminating. Several actuator structures are designed and fabricated and their diverse moisture‐induced motions are demonstrated.",

To promote a safe working environment for workers, wearable robots (wearables) are rapidly emerging to fulfill various needs in human‐robot interactive tasks. Although numerous studies have successfully developed wearables to assist humans, they are often limited to supporting a single degree of freedom (DoF) of the human body with a single actuator. However, as humans tend to use multiple parts of their bodies, additional actuators and mechanisms to transmit force/motion are necessary to realize multi‐DoF, which increases the volume, price, and complexity of the wearables. To address these issues, a multi‐DoF wearable robot (WeaRo) with an adjustable twisted string actuator (ATSA) and a two‐stage transmission mechanism (2TM) is proposed. By introducing the novel ATSA and 2TM, the proposed WeaRo achieves multi‐DoF (lumbar and arm) with only a single electric motor and ATSA. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WeaRo effectively reduces the maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC) of lumbar, biceps, and triceps muscles by a maximum of 18.2, 29.1, and 27.0%, respectively without constraining users’ movements. Additionally, the fabric‐based design ensures a lightweight solution weighing 5.2 kg including batteries.",

Herein, a novel collaborative multirobot navigation system‐assisted magnetic catheter guidance and shape perception method using the information fusion of robotic vascular ultrasound imaging and electromagnetic tracking (EMT) to reconstruct the catheter's shape and vasculature in 3D are proposed. A collaborative multirobot navigation system with triple manipulators is reported to guide the magnetic catheter with kinematic modeling, whose centerline shape is localized by a six‐degree‐of‐freedom flexible electromagnetic guidewire embedded as the moving backbone of the magnetic catheter, which is fit by a Bézier curve‐based method. The vasculature is intraoperatively scanned by robotic ultrasound imaging, and the vascular contours are segmented by the Hough transform algorithm, which is fused with EMT‐based catheter shape perception to realize spatial reconstruction. In vitro experimental results indicate a shape reconstruction error of 1.12 ± 0.26 mm and a vasculature reconstruction error of 1.65 ± 1.29 mm in four regions, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and the potential of the nonionizing approach for robotic endovascular intervention.",

    "abstract": "A novel approach of fusing datasets from multiple sensors using a hierarchical support vector machine (HSVM) algorithm is presented. The validation of this method is experimentally carried out using an intelligent learning system that combines two different data sources. The sensors are based on a contactless sensor, which is a radar that detects the movements of the hands and fingers, as well as a wearable sensor, which is a flexible pressure sensor array that measures pressure distribution around the wrist. A HSVM architecture is developed to effectively fuse different data types in terms of sampling rate, data format, and gesture information from the pressure sensors and radar. In this respect, the proposed method is compared with the classification results from each of the two sensors independently. Herein, datasets from 15 different participants are collected and analyzed. The results show that the radar on its own provides a mean classification accuracy of 76.7%, whereas the pressure sensors provide an accuracy of 69.0%. However, enhancing the pressure sensors' output results with radar using the proposed HSVM algorithm improves the classification accuracy to 92.5%.",

However, with alternating current (AC) pulse and huge inherent impedance, the TENGs usually exhibit low‐energy supply efficiency when either powering conventional electronics or charging energy storage devices directly. Efficient power management has always been a technical bottleneck for the TENGs toward practical applications in self‐powered microsystems. Over the past years, several strategies of power management have been proposed, such as rectification, electromagnetic transformation, capacitive transformation, and direct current (DC) conversion, which can be used for voltage regulation, impedance matching, and efficiency improvement for electronics. Herein, the recent advances on power management for TENGs are systematically reviewed and analyzed, which has exhibited manageable triboelectric power by electronics as an important research issue of TENGs.

Recently, however, oxygen-tolerant CLRP techniques, such as oxygen-tolerant photoinduced electron/energy transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT), enzyme degassing of RAFT (Enz-RAFT), and atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), have emerged. Herein, the use of a Hamilton MLSTARlet liquid handling robot for automating CLRP reactions is demonstrated. Synthesis processes are developed using Python and used to automate reagent handling, dispensing sequences, and synthesis steps required to create homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and block copolymers in 96-well plates, as well as postpolymerization modifications. Using this approach, the synergy between highly customizable liquid handling robotics and oxygen-tolerant CLRP to automate advanced polymer synthesis for HTP and combinatorial polymer research is demonstrated.",

An artificial cogni‐retina is a millimeter‐scale, intelligent apparatus designed as a replacement for these systems, while executing simple image processing tasks. As a bionic limb, it can connect directly to the optic nerve and perform rudimentary cognitive functions such as perceiving, learning, remembering, and classifying elementary visual data.

Recently, an increasing number of publications have used interesting materials in artificial synaptic devices that drive this idea closer toward becoming a real‐world application.

While many promising medical magnetic microrobots are proposed, the ones using hard magnetic materials are not mostly biocompatible, and the ones using biocompatible soft magnetic nanoparticles are magnetically very weak and, therefore, difficult to actuate. Thus, biocompatible hard magnetic micro/nanomaterials are essential toward easy-to-actuate and clinically viable 3D medical microrobots. To fill such crucial gap, this study proposes ferromagnetic and biocompatible iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticle-based 3D microprinting of microrobots using the two-photon polymerization technique. A modified one-pot synthesis method is presented for producing FePt nanoparticles in large volumes and 3D printing of helical microswimmers made from biocompatible trimethy- lolpropane ethoxylate triacrylate (PETA) polymer with embedded FePt nanoparticles. The 30 μm long helical magnetic microswimmers are able to swim at speeds of over five body lengths per second at 200 Hz, making them the fastest helical swimmer in the tens of micrometer length scale at the corresponding low- magnitude actuation fields of 5-10 mT. It is also experimentally in vitro verified that the synthesized FePt nanoparticles are biocompatible. Thus, such 3D-printed microrobots are biocompatible and easy to actuate toward creating clinically viable future medical microrobots.",

The logic primitive circuit, usually composed of resistive switching memory or memristor units, is the fundamental and kernel element to build a stateful logic family. However, the current stateful logic primitive circuits cannot be configured between the devices from the adjacent layers of the 3D crossbar array (CBA) which largely limited its application in high‐density and capacity memory arrays. Herein, a new stateful logic primitive circuit is presented based on the structure of two antiparallel bipolar memristors. The presented logic primitive circuit enables a complete set of stateful logic operation and is compatible with a 3D CBA. The working principle and validity of the logic design were experimentally demonstrated by either a real TiO 2 ‐based memristive circuit or the HSPICE simulation. Furthermore, a space‐time‐wise cascading method was demonstrated by XOR and the full adder functions based on a CBA, and its merits were further elucidated through comparison with different logic families with various cascading methods.",

Although deep learning has recently been proposed to address these issues, it is expensive in terms of data collection and processing. Therefore, an adaptive calibration method is proposed for soft sensors, suitable for mass production and long‐term usage. In addition to maintaining the original benefits of deep learning characterization, this method enables fast and accurate calibration by capturing the change in the characteristics of the sensor through domain adaptation, using optimal transportation. An offline calibration method is first described, which is for alleviating the difficulty in calibrating every single unit from mass produced soft sensors. The main advantage is that identically manufactured soft sensors in a large volume with variations can be calibrated with reduced time and effort for collecting and processing data. Online calibration is then discussed, which compensates for the parameter changes when a soft sensor is continuously used for an extended period of time. For a single sensor, even though the sensor shows signal drift from the long‐term usage, the calibrated network weights can be quickly adjusted online. Finally, the proposed adaptive calibration is experimentally evaluated using actual soft sensors.",

This paper describes a haptic glove capable of producing sensations reminiscent of three types of near-surface properties: hardness, temperature, and roughness. To accomplish this mixed mode of stimulation, three types of haptic actuators were combined: vibrotactile motors, thermoelectric devices, and electrotactile electrodes made from a stretchable conductive polymer synthesized in our laboratory. This polymer consisted of a stretchable polyanion which served as a scaffold for the polymerization of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The scaffold was synthesized using controlled radical polymerization to afford material of low dispersity, relatively high conductivity (0.1 S cm-1), and low impedance relative to metals. The glove was equipped with flex sensors to make it possible to control a robotic hand and a hand in virtual reality (VR). In psychophysical experiments, human participants were able to discern combinations of electrotactile, vibrotactile, and thermal stimulation in VR. Participants trained to associate these sensations with roughness, hardness, and temperature had an overall accuracy of 98%, while untrained participants had an accuracy of 85%.

    "abstract": "Self‐powered flexible tactile sensors based on triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can be of use in the development of robotic intellisense and interaction. Such sensors typically use triboelectronegative material as top layer, requiring contacting and separating with specific interface material to operate, and may result in suboptimal performance under practical conditions. Herein, a self‐powered interface‐independent tactile sensor array that is based on bilayer single‐electrode TENGs is reported. By integrating both triboelectronegative and triboelectropositive layers in the structure, the sensor overcomes the material restriction of top layer and could sense applied pressure from any material. Furthermore, a 5 × 5 sensor array is fabricated to realize the detection of contact point and the recognition of trajectory. Last, the sensor array is successfully implemented as electronic skin (e‐skin) in a robotic hand for tactile sensing and human–machine interaction. In this regard, it can be envisioned that such tactile sensors possess a promising application in intelligent robots including robotic e‐skin and artificial intelligence.",

LCEs have demonstrated their potential applications in soft robots, soft actuators, artificial muscles, etc. How to align the mesogen orientation and achieve actuations of LCEs are the two most important issues for the studies on LCEs. At present, varied alignment methods and versatile actuations for LCEs have developed rapidly. However, few reviews are addressing these two important issues simultaneously. In this review, three types of alignment methods for LCEs as mechanical stress‐induced alignment, external field‐induced alignment, and surface effect‐induced alignment are summarized, and comparing their programmability toward the mesogen orientation is focused on. The key factors influencing the versatile actuations of LCEs are their orientation structure (intrinsic factor) and the applied external stimuli (extrinsic factor). Thus, actuations are classified into two types on the basis of programmable orientation structure and selective external stimuli, respectively, and focus on comparing their deformation controllability. Finally, an outlook for the future key technologies to develop versatile, precise, and fast‐responsive deformation actuations for LCEs is proposed.",

Thus far, the power requirement of robots has been met through lead‐acid and Li‐ion batteries and energy harvesters. However, except for a few advances such as light weight, shape, and size, the batteries used in robotics have remained unchanged for several decades, even if the research advances in energy storage have led to devices with flexible form factors. Besides being slow at adopting new energy technologies, robotics also appears to have settled with the idea of centralized energy, as evident from the battery backpack designs of several humanoids. This is in contrast with the biological world, where energy sources are distributed all over the body. Although several attempts have been made to imitate the distributed tactile skin, the energy distribution has strangely not caught attention. With distributed energy, a robotic platform can benefit in terms of increased energy density, lesser design complexities, improved body dynamics, and operational reliability.

Conventional pressure sensors have a narrow pressure range (&lt;10 kPa) and complex fabrication processes, which significantly hinder their extensive applications. A facile laser‐engraving method is proposed to fabricate a flexible multiwalled‐carbon‐nanotube (MWCNTs)/poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) composite‐based piezoresistive sensor with hierarchical microstructures. Herein, the nonstandard‐circular feature and Gaussian distributed facula of a laser spot are utilized to produce the middle‐level porous microdome upon the bottom‐level cylinder microcolumn array, while the top‐level tentacle‐like conical micropillars are produced by vertically rotating the acrylic mold during the laser engraving process. This novel hierarchical microstructure endows the proposed piezoresistive sensor with orders‐of‐magnitude of higher sensitivity (≈35.51 kPa −1 ) than that of other reported electromechanical sensors and a more extensive pressure sensing range up to 23 kPa. Moreover, the detection limit of the sensor is down to 2 Pa, which makes it a desirable candidate for monitoring subtle pressure. The sensor is successfully applied to distinguish the syllables of each pronounced word, detect movements of the human wrist, and monitor radial arterial pulse, thus demonstrating its promising applications in wearable electronics.",

The gripper can pick a wide variety of objects, such as delicate fruits, small parts, and parts with uneven loads, with high pull‐off forces (over 7.4 N with ∅ 20 mm/55 kPa). The achieved pull‐off forces are significantly higher than the previously reported suction cup grippers with films and more comparable with commercial vacuum grippers. The pull‐off forces show no significant differences with surfaces of varying roughness (up to root‐mean‐square roughness of 5.66 μm) and the gripper is able to pick and release target objects repeatedly. The gripper is also compared with a commercial vacuum gripper with comparable dimensions. It outperforms the commercial gripper in the case of fragile objects, objects smaller than the gripper diameter, and objects with uneven loads. It can apply high pull‐off forces while having controllable release, and is suitable for gripping a wide variety of real‐world objects, including heavy, rough, small, thin, and fragile ones.",

This poses a new challenge in human–machine interaction, particularly during the control authority transition from automated functionality to a human driver.

The intelligent haptic torque is applied to the steering wheel and switches its functionality between predictive guidance and haptic assistance according to the varying state and control ability of human drivers. This helps drivers gradually resume manual control during takeover. The developed approach is validated by conducting vehicle experiments with 26 participants. The results suggest that the proposed method effectively enhances the driving state recovery and control performance of human drivers during takeover compared with an existing approach. Thus, this new method further improves the safety and smoothness of human–machine interaction in automated vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Memristors offer great advantages as a new hardware solution for neuromorphic computing due to their fast and energy‐efficient matrix vector multiplication. However, the nonlinear weight updating property of memristors makes it difficult to be trained in a neural network learning process. Several compensation schemes have been proposed to mitigate the updating error caused by nonlinearity; nevertheless, they usually involve complex peripheral circuits design. Herein, stochastic and adaptive learning methods for weight updating are developed, in which the inaccuracy caused by the memristor nonlinearity can be effectively suppressed. In addition, compared with the traditional nonlinear stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updating algorithm or the piecewise linear (PL) method, which are most often used in memristor neural network, the design is more hardware friendly and energy efficient without the consideration of pulse numbers, duration, and directions. Effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated on the training of LeNet‐5 convolutional neural network. High accuracy, about 93.88%, on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology handwriting digits datasets is achieved (with typical memristor nonlinearity as ±1), which is close to the network with complex PL method (94.7%) and is higher than the original nonlinear SGD method (90.14%).",

Tactile perception is composed of multiple fundamental and physical experiences felt as changes in stiffness, texture, shape, size, temperature, and weight by the skin. While researchers and industries have made continuous efforts to abstract and recreate these haptic experiences, haptic devices are still limited in invoking intricate and rich sensations. Herein, the design, model, and experimental validation of a wearable skin‐like interface, able to recreate the roughness, shape, and size of a perceived object is presented; a platform for an interactive “physical” experience. The cogency of immersion through tactile feedback on moldable clay by the user response from the active haptic feedback, is examined. For the experimental test, a soft pneumatic actuator (SPA)‐skin interface (90 Hz bandwidth) with a complex actuation pattern is prototyped. The SPA‐skin's performance using three sets of simulated textures (&lt;300 μm) and for reconstructing simulated contours (of a rectangle, circle, or trapezoid) in the virtual reality (VR) platform is investigated.

Driven by a fluid input, the presented dual‐origami soft actuators produce quasisequential deployment and bending motion that is guided by unsymmetric unfolding of low‐stretchable origami components. The dominance between the deployment and bending can be shifted by varying the unfolding behavior, enabling preprogramming of the motion. The proposed origami‐inspired soft actuators are directly fabricated by low‐cost fused deposition modeling 3D printing and subjected to heat treatment postprocessing to enhance the fluid sealing performance.

Due to the unique functionalities of mechanoreceptors in human skin, humans can easily distinguish materials with different surface characteristics (e.g., compressibility, roughness, etc.) by simply pressing and sliding the fingertip over the samples. However, how to achieve such delicate texture recognition for robots remains an open challenge due to the lack of skin‐comparable tactile sensing systems and smart pattern recognition algorithms. Herein, a novel texture recognition method is proposed by designing an arc‐shaped soft tactile sensor and a bidirectional long short‐term memory (LSTM) model with the attention mechanism. By using the proposed method, a respective recognition accuracy of 97% for Braille characters and 99% for 60 types of fabrics have been achieved, revealing the effectiveness of our method in surface texture recognition and the potential benefit to various applications, such as Braille reading for visually impaired people and defect detection in the textile industry.",

Existing interaction modalities in autonomous vehicle simulation and testing are not sufficiently smart, and they barely reflect human‐like behaviors in real‐world driving scenarios. Therefore, a novel hierarchical game‐theoretical framework is presented to represent naturalistic multimodal interactions among road users during simulation and testing, which is subsequently validated by the Turing test. Given that human drivers have no access to the complete information of the surrounding road users, the Bayesian game theory is used to model the decision‐making process. Next, a probing behavior is generated by the proposed game‐theoretic model, and is further applied to control the vehicle via the Markov chain. The proposed method is tested through a series of experiments and compared with existing approaches. In addition, Turing tests are conducted to quantify the human‐likeness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed Bayesian game‐theoretic framework can effectively generate representative scenes of human‐like decision‐making during autonomous vehicle interactions, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Intelligent materials and devices are considered the key to fulfill the strict and challenging requirements given by a large set of applications in numerous fields. The synergistic interplay of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, specifically 4D‐printing, and artificial intelligence (AI), have widened the design space and accelerated the design phase. 4D‐printing, intended as the combination of 3D‐printing with a fourth dimension (i.e., time), ensures the fabrication of complex topologies with materials that can be selectively triggered to change specific features (e.g., shape, color), whereas the use of smart inks or embedded sensors can bring additional functionalities (e.g., repairing, sensing, actuating) to fulfill the requirements of the targeted application. AI is the tool allowing scientists to train machines for developing human‐like capabilities to discern, predict, and represent the statistically significant behavior of a phenomenon. If applied to the design of smart structures, it can be a powerful and efficient tool capable of reducing the time‐to‐manufacturing, improving the traditional design approach. In this perspective, a viewpoint is provided on how the synergistic use of AI and AM can advance the design of intelligent systems, with successful applications ranging from the robotics to the bioengineering sectors.",

An aqueous medium makes a device closer to the brain‐like system with the movement of ions. This review paper proposes advances in liquid resistive memories and neuromorphic computing behavior to emulate electronic synapses. Primarily, the aqueous iontronic resistive memories can be used to study electrode and active layer materials and different device structures. Hence, herein, a timely and comprehensive study of these devices using ionic liquids, hydrogels, salt solutions, and soft electrodes to classify the device mechanism is presented. The filament formation is discussed in detail based on ion concentration polarization, electrode metallization, and movements of ions and charged molecules, which result in the formation of the metal dendrite. To manufacture a higher‐performance memory, device parameters should be optimized based on aqueous electrolytes, electrode materials, and other device design parameters. Aqueous electrolytes have smooth neurotransmission ability to fabricate brain‐inspired resistive memories with stable performance and device repeatability with smooth ion transmission. Aqueous electrode materials can be reliable for neural interface activities to compute electronic synapsis with electrical and chemical properties to ensure device reliability for a longer time period.",

Nociceptor is a crucial sensory neuron that recognizes harmful inputs and sends pain signals to the central nervous system to avoid injury; however, visual nociceptors, considered to be a key bionic function to protect eyesight based on optoelectronic devices, have yet to be developed. Herein this study, a three‐terminal flexible memory phototransistor (MPT) is first fabricated, which simulates the visual nociceptive behavior by adjusting light stimulation. The CsPbBr 3 quantum‐dots (QDs)‐few‐layered black phosphorous nanosheets (FLBP NSs) heterojunction MPT demonstrates high responsivity of 7.2 × 10 3 AW −1 and high detectivity of 1.8 × 10 13 Jones due to the high absorption coefficient of CsPbBr 3 QDs materials and a high carrier transport property of FLBP NSs. Moreover, the proposed device can be used to emulate ultraviolet‐stimuli‐induced characteristics of visual nociceptors such as a threshold, no adaption, relaxation, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. It provides a new avenue for the realization of next‐generation neural‐integrated devices via its visual pain sense‐perception abilities.",

As an ordered soft material, directional shape changes of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) can be easily achieved via external stimuli thanks to its anisotropic elasticity. However, harnessing the interplay between molecular ordering, geometry, and shape morphing in this anisotropic material to create programmable and complex shape changes remains a challenge. Here, by integrating the concepts of kirigami or Chinese paper cutting “JianZhi” in the light‐actuated LCE encoded with controlled molecular orientations, various complex 3D shape morphing behaviors are demonstrated. Versatile combinations of fundamental shape changes such as bending, folding, twisting, and rolling are enabled by fine‐tuning the molecular orientations and geometries in the monolithic LCE kirigami. Furthermore, various functions such as fluttering of the Chinese crane bird “QianZhiHe,” arbitrary directional locomotion in the annulus and linear locomotion in the complex Chinese character are also realized. These complex, fast‐response, untethered, remote, reversible, and programmable shape morphologies actuated in a monolith of LCE kirigami will open opportunities in soft robotics and smart materials.",

It has been used as a metric for tracking rehabilitation progress and identifying diseases that affect muscle activation patterns.

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic electronics attract significant attention as a new computing architecture. Despite much effort for achieving practical neuromorphic systems, it is still challenging to construct a synapse array ideal for complex neural networks. Herein, a novel strategy for developing a highly integrated crossbar array of a one‐selector–one‐memory (1S–1R) synapse by systematically engineering ion injection is demonstrated. In the proposed synapse, an electrochemical metallization (ECM) memristor consisting of unstable filaments and a typical ECM device with stable filaments act as a selector with a low leakage current and a stable memory device, respectively. To overcome the voltage‐matching issues in constructing the 1S–1R synapse with high integration density, ion injection related with the electrical properties is optimized in the ECM devices via the distribution of active metal nanoparticles at the interface. The developed synapse possesses a high on/off ratio, superior selectivity, low operating current, and stable multilevel conductance, compared to the previously reported devices. High feasibility for complex neuromorphic systems is demonstrated, and the neural network based on the developed synapse array exhibits reliable parallel computation with high energy efficiency. This promising concept of realizing complex neuromorphic electronics is a fundamental building block for the practical artificial intelligence.",

Deep reinforcement learning is a promising method of autonomously developing robust controllers for creating smart microrobots, which can adapt their behavior to operate in uncharacterized environments without the need to model the system dynamics. This article reports the development of a smart helical magnetic hydrogel microrobot that uses the soft actor critic reinforcement learning algorithm to autonomously derive a control policy which allows the microrobot to swim through an uncharacterized biomimetic fluidic environment under control of a time varying magnetic field generated from a three-axis array of electromagnets. The reinforcement learning agent learned successful control policies from both state vector input and raw images, and the control policies learned by the agent recapitulated the behavior of rationally designed controllers based on physical models of helical swimming microrobots. Deep reinforcement learning applied to microrobot control is likely to significantly expand the capabilities of the next generation of microrobots.",

    "abstract": "Compliant grasping is an important function of continuum robots that interact with humans and/or unpredictable environments. However, the existing robots often have cross‐sections that remain constant along their length. This causes the robots to exhibit poor grasping ability, especially when dealing with objects with diverse curvatures. Here, inspired by the high adaptability of seahorse tails in grasping, a cable‐driven continuum robot with tapered tensegrity, capable of conformally grasping objects with various curvatures is proposed. To characterize the effects of tapering on robotic kinematics, a mechanical model is derived using a multi‐body dynamic framework for both predicting the configuration and developing a control strategy for cables. Theoretical predictions indicate that the curvature of each unit can be regulated by altering the length of the cables, allowing the robot to conform to objects with curvatures ranging from 1.48 to 28.21 m −1 . Further, a continuum robot is employed, and the control strategy that can be used for grasping floating objects when the curvature of the objects is used as the input is tested. The robotic design, which presents an example of embedded physical intelligence, can inspire in situ characterization techniques for collecting floating contaminants.",

    "abstract": "Animal locomotion offers valuable references as it is a critical component of survival as animals adapting to a specific environment. Especially, underwater locomotion poses a challenge because water exerts a high antagonistic drag force against the direction of progress. However, marine vertebrates usually use much lower aerobic energy for locomotion than aerial or terrestrial vertebrates due to their unique intermittent gliding locomotion. None of the prior works demonstrate the locomotive strategies of marine vertebrates. Herein, an untethered soft robotic fish capable of reconstructing the marine vertebrates’ effective locomotion and traveling underwater by controlling localized buoyancy with thermoelectric pneumatic actuators is introduced. The actuators enable both heating and cooling to control a localized buoyancy while providing a substantial driving force to the system. Besides mimicking the locomotion, the bidirectional communication system enables the untethered delivery of commands to the underwater subject and real‐time acquisition of the robotic fish's physical information. Underwater imaging validates the fish's practical use as a drone, allowing for inspecting the aquatic environment that is not easily accessible to humans. Future work studies the operation of the robotic fish as a collective swarm to examine a broader range of the underwater area and conduct various strategic missions.",

Manual sensor placement can reach most locations but lacks scalability. Micro‐aerial vehicles (MAVs) allow for scalable sensor delivery, but current solutions are limited to attaching sensors to the trunk or large branches with spines or adhesives. The thinner branches of the outer canopy remain inaccessible, despite being of particular interest due to the important physiological processes occurring in the foliage. Herein, a MAV‐deployable bistable helically coiling origami gripper is developed. The unfurled state allows for transport with a MAV, and when pushed against a branch triggers the second helically coiled state, which permits secure attachment to branches. Origami manufacturing keeps the weight of the gripper below 5 g, despite holding up to 280 g, and gripping diameters from 8 mm to 38 mm inclined up to 30°. The holding force, activation force, and resistance to tilt and rotation offsets are experimentally characterized. The deployment and retrieval of the gripper and sensor are demonstrated outside, where sensor data are collected from previously inaccessible branches in the outer canopy. Enabling robust sensor attachment in the outer canopy marks a step toward scalable environmental monitoring of forest ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Soft actuators have been an important research focus in robotics due to their advantages in nondestructive contact and excellent motion adaptability, which enable flexible manipulation, extreme environments exploration, and in vivo surgical treatment. Various soft robots actuated electrically, magnetically, optically, and fluidically are built toward different application scenarios. Among them, electrical actuation method is an advanced choice to actuate and control soft actuators that are expected to be compatible and integrated with existing industrial robotic systems and wearable intelligent devices. Current robotic systems have higher requirements on the actuators’ function, which can be explored through material and structural designs. Based on a variety of deformable materials, the structural design enables the soft actuators to span from low dimension to high dimension with further improvement in function. Therefore, in this review, 2D and 3D electrical‐based soft actuators from the perspective of dimension design are introduced, which involve functional materials, structure design, and fabrication technology. Some novel 3D fabrication methods, such as the 3D compressive buckling process, are summarized to build 3D soft robots. This review aims at offering important guidelines for the development of soft actuators and the construction of integrated robotic systems in the future.",

    "abstract": "Skin disease recognition is one of the essential topics in the medical industry. Detecting skin disease from appearance can be difficult due to the similar appearance of skin lesions. In some cases, such as the monkeypox virus, the illness must be quickly determined, and the patients must be isolated to reduce the spreading of the disease. This study aims to create a deep learning‐based automated intelligent mobile application to detect skin disease. First, different small‐size pretrained networks are trained for skin lesion image classification. Then, the most suitable network from the viewpoint of both performance and mobile compatibility is transformed into the TensorFlow Lite format. Finally, a mobile application is created on the Android platform that utilizes the smartphone's camera to obtain images and uses TensorFlow Lite to make predictions. The proposed system produces 74.27% classification accuracy for seven classes on a combined dataset. It produces comparable/better results compared to the literature. Owing to the proposed system, the patients can make a preliminary diagnosis of their lesions using their smartphones. Thus, risky patients can be encouraged to visit the hospital for a definitive diagnosis. In addition, the mobile application can avoid undue stress and false alarms.",

    "abstract": "Herein, complex motion in soft, fluid‐driven actuators composed of elastomer bladders arranged around a neutral plane and connected by slender tubes is demonstrated. Rather than relying on complex feedback control or multiple inputs, the motion is generated with a single pressure input, leveraging viscous flows within the actuator to produce nonuniform pressure between bladders. Using an accurate predictive model coupling with a large deformation Cosserat rod model and low‐Reynolds‐number flow, all dominating dynamic interactions including extension and curvature are captured with two governing equations. Given insights from this model, five design elements are described and demonstrated in practice. By choosing the relative timescales between the solid, fluid, and input pressure cycles, the tip of the actuator can obtain almost any desired trajectory and can be placed anywhere temporarily within its 2D workspace. Finally, the benefits of viscous‐driven soft actuators are showcased in a six‐legged untethered robot able to walk 0.05 body lengths per second. The foundation is laid for a new class of morphologically intelligent, soft robotic actuators that enables complex deformations and multifunctionality without explicit drivers; whereby generating nonuniform pressure distributions, their infinite degrees of freedom can be exploited.",

    "abstract": "Nano‐/microparticles of gallium (Ga), as a low‐melting‐point metal, are extensively used in the fields of soft electronics and sensors to provide thermal and electrical conductivity. However, a passivating oxide layer can be formed on the surface of Ga nano‐/microparticles during the synthesis process. This oxide layer is removed by a secondary sintering step, especially mechanical sintering, which is generally not a controllable process, and compromises the integrity of the system. Herein, thiol molecules, 1‐butanethiol, thiophenol, and 4‐mercaptopyridine, that can functionalize the surface of Ga via sonication to reduce the oxidation of Ga surface are used. The resulting particles exhibit electrical conductivity based on metal–molecule junctions without the requirement for a sintering step. In particular, 4‐mercaptopyridine functionalized, thiolated Ga particles exhibit higher electrical conductivity compared to the other three thiolated Ga systems as the organic material conjugation provides conductive pathways for the mix. Subsequently, using these particle systems, soft devices are developed that can be used for gas, exhalation, and flex sensing. This study provides insights into the possibility of creating combinations of organic molecules with liquid metal‐based nano‐/microparticles to generate electrically conductive mixes and the prospects of fabricating multifunctional sensors.",

In this regard, the demand for high‐performance synaptic devices with high switching speeds, low power consumption, and multilevel conductance is increasing. Among the various synaptic devices, ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) are promising candidates. While previous studies have focused on improving reliability of FTJs to enhance the synaptic behavior, low‐frequency noise (LFN) of FTJs has not been characterized and its impact on the learning accuracy in neuromorphic computing remains unknown. Herein, the LFN characteristics of FTJs fabricated on n‐ and p‐type Si along with the impact of 1/ f noise on the learning accuracy of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are investigated. The results indicate that the FTJ on p‐type Si exhibits a far lower 1/ f noise than that on n‐type Si. The FTJ on p‐type Si exhibits a significantly higher learning accuracy (86.26%) than that on n‐type Si (78.70%) owing to its low‐noise properties. This study provides valuable insights into the LFN characteristics of FTJs and a solution to improve the performance of synaptic devices by significantly reducing the 1/ f noise.",

    "abstract": "Technology advancements in energy storage, photocatalysis, and sensors have generated enormous impedimetric data. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results play an essential role in analyzing the interfacial properties of materials. Nonetheless, in many situations, the data is misinterpreted due to the complexity of the electrochemical system or the compromise between the experimental result and the theoretical model, resulting in partiality in the interpretation process, especially for the impedimetric results. Typically, the experimenter interprets impedimetric results using a searching approach based on a theoretical model until the best‐fitting model is obtained, which is a time‐consuming process, and errors can occur. To reduce misinterpretation by the experimenter, herein, the machine‐learning strategy is demonstrated for the classification of an EIS circuit model and parameter prediction using a deep neural network (DNN). The DNN model shows a highly accurate classifier for the commonly used EIS circuit with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of more than 0.95. Additionally, the model demonstrates high accuracy in the prediction of EIS parameters on a complex EIS system, with a maximum R 2 of 0.999. These reveal that the machine‐learning strategy may open a new room for studying electrochemical systems.",

A bioinspired crawler with multimode locomotion, a reconfigurable robotic gripper capable of adaptable grasping, and reconfigurable electronic circuits are also demonstrated.

The use of multifunctional sensors is always challenging, especially when their energy requirements are considered. Herein, the heterogeneous integration of custom‐made flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is demonstrated with a large area touch sensor array. The OPV can offer power density of more than 0.32 μW cm −2 at 1500 lux, which is sufficient to meet the instantaneous demand of the array of touch sensors. In addition to energy harvesting, it is shown that the OPVs can perform shadow sensing for proximity and gesture recognition, which are crucial features needed in the e‐Skin, particularly for safe interaction in the industrial domain. Along with pressure sensing (sensitivity of up to 0.26 kPa −1 in the range of 1–10 kPa) and spatial information, the touch sensors made of indium tin oxide and monolayer graphene have shown &gt;70% transparency, which allow light to pass through them to reach the bottom OPV layer. With better resource management and space utilization, the presented stacked integration of transparent touch‐sensing layer and OPVs can evolve into a futuristic energy‐autonomous e‐Skin that can “see” and “feel.”",

As the task complexity keeps increasing in the clinical applications of magnetic microrobots, more geometric structures and magnetization profiles have been included in the designs of magnetic microrobots, posing significant challenges to the fabrication of magnetic microrobots. Microassembly is a fabrication method that can create convoluted structures with small‐scale modules. It can accurately control the position and orientation of each magnetic module, resulting in a magnetic microrobot with arbitrary 3D geometries and magnetization profiles. This article reviews recent advanced assembly‐based fabrication methods of magnetic microrobots, including microassembly driven by contact mechanical forces and noncontact field forces. The principles, fabrication processes, and the advantages and disadvantages of each assembly‐based fabrication method are summarized. The existing challenges and future development of fabricating magnetic microrobots by assembly are discussed in detail.

Diffractive optical networks complete their computational tasks at the speed of light propagation through a thin diffractive volume, without any external computing power while exploiting the massive parallelism of optics. Diffractive networks were demonstrated to achieve all-optical classification of objects and perform universal linear transformations. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, a \"time-lapse\" image classification scheme using a diffractive network, significantly advancing its classification accuracy and generalization performance on complex input objects by using the lateral movements of the input objects and/or the diffractive network, relative to each other. In a different context, such relative movements of the objects and/or the camera are routinely being used for image super-resolution applications; inspired by their success, we designed a time-lapse diffractive network to benefit from the complementary information content created by controlled or random lateral shifts. We numerically explored the design space and performance limits of time-lapse diffractive networks, revealing a blind testing accuracy of 62.03% on the optical classification of objects from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This constitutes the highest inference accuracy achieved so far using a single diffractive network on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

For biofilm eradication in tiny tubular structures, magnetic hydrogel micromachines (MHM) are designed that are capable of performing mechanical disruption of biofilms while releasing antibacterial agents in a controllable fashion. Two modes of motion controlled by external magnetic fields, namely planar rotation and wobbling modes, have been investigated to drive the micromachines to interact and destruct biofilms. In addition, the presented micromachines are composed of thermosensitive PNIPAm hydrogel that can load with the antibacterial agent (H 2 O 2 ) and release them upon heating. The Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles embedded in the hydrogel matrix act as catalysts for the Fenton reaction, generating bacteria‐killing free radicals.

    "abstract": "Soft magnetic manipulators offer the prospect of improved surgical outcomes through their potential for miniaturization and inherently safe tissue interaction. However, independent actuation of multiple manipulators within the same confined workspace is limited by undesired simultaneous actuation and manipulator–manipulator interactions. Herein, for the first time, approaches for the independent magnetic actuation of two magnetic continuum manipulators within the same confined workspace are proposed. A novel modular magnetic soft robot segment design is proposed with modified geometry to provide preferential bending planes and high angles of deflection. This design is integrated into two dual‐segment magnetic manipulators which, when arranged in parallel, can deliver independent bending in two planes of motion. Two distinct independent control strategies are proposed, based on orthogonal manipulator magnetization profiles and local field gradient control, respectively. Each dual‐manipulator configuration is characterized over a sequence of applied magnetic fields and gradients, induced via a dual robotically controlled external permanent magnet system. Manipulator independence, bending range of motion, and twisting behaviors are evaluated as a function of control strategy and manipulator separation distance. To demonstrate the system's potential in clinical scenarios, a dual‐manipulator configuration is adapted to carry an endoscopic camera and optic fiber, respectively. The resultant bimanual system is deployed in the confined anatomy of a skull‐base phantom to simulate minimally invasive ablation of a pituitary adenoma. Independent motion of the camera and tool within the confined workspace demonstrate the potential for an independent magnetic tool manipulation for surgical applications.",

    "abstract": "Memristor devices can be utilized for various computing applications, and stochastic computing is one of them. The intrinsic stochastic characteristics of the memristor cause unpredictable current fluctuations by the capture and emission of electrons in a trap site. Herein, a true random number generator (TRNG) using the random telegraph noise (RTN) of the memristor as an entropy source is proposed. TiO x /Al 2 O 3 memristors are fabricated, and the capture time probability of the RTN characteristics is modulated to 50% with varying read‐voltage and device conductance state. In addition, the TRNG operations with the RTN current signals as entropy sources are experimentally demonstrated with a customized breadboard, and the randomness is verified with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tests.",

The authors optimize the design of the piezoelectric cantilever, the weight of the magnetic mass, and the distance between the magnet and coil through theoretical simulation and experiments to maximize each contribution for the H‐MME generator. The total root mean square output power of the H‐MME generator is 28.35 mW with a power density of 0.042 mW cm −3 Oe 2 in a 5 Oe magnetic field of 60 Hz, which is sufficient for driving multiple functional Internet of Things sensors that detect temperature, humidity, light, UV radiation, air pressure, and sound. In addition, a self‐powered smart proximity‐detection system (including a microcontroller unit, an ultrasonic sensor module, a piezo speaker, and a Bluetooth module) is demonstrated by rectifying the output of the H‐MME generator and controlling it using a power management circuit. The superior output power of the H‐MME generator exceeds simple sensing functions and presents the possibility of achieving battery‐free self‐powered smart devices and systems.",

Nonlinear dynamics in physical systems provide a computational capability that is unique to reservoirs. It is, however, difficult to find an appropriate task for a reservoir because of the complexity of nonlinear information processing. The information processing capacity has recently been used to clarify systematically the tasks that are solved by reservoirs; it quantifies the memory capacity of reservoirs in accordance with the order of nonlinearity. Herein, an experimental evaluation of the information processing capacity of a spintronic oscillator consisting of nanostructured ferromagnets is reported. The spintronic reservoir state is electrically manipulated by adding a delayed‐feedback circuit. The total capacity reaches a maximum of 5.6 at the edge of the echo state property. A trade‐off between the linear and nonlinear components of the capacity is also found. The result can be used to better understand the nonlinear information processing in reservoirs and to find good matches between reservoirs and tasks. As an example, a function‐approximation task is performed and it is found that it can be efficiently solved when the reservoir state is appropriately tuned so that its information processing capacity matches that of the task.",

Their larger surface grain size decreases oxygen adsorption, resulting in enhanced desorption by photoexcited carriers during UV exposure.

This article presents a pioneering approach to the development of auxetic smart metamaterials using shape memory alloy (SMA) as the core material. As SMAs can be Joule heated to change between their low‐ and high‐temperature phases to trigger the actuation of the structure, the auxetic smart metamaterial can actively modify its shape and stiffness to produce bidirectional actuation with a single power input and using a single bias mechanical element. The proposed active auxetic metamaterial consists of an SMA plate patterned with auxetic cuts, creating hinges that modulate the deformation of the structure to produce an auxetic behavior. This work looks at the impact of different geometric parameters on the behavior of the structure, including its generated force, its maximum strain, and its Poisson's ratio. The study also investigates the effect of the number of segmented units, revealing that designs with more segmented units suffer from stress concentrations near attachment points, limiting their advantages. This article shows that smart materials can help imbue metamaterials such as auxetic metamaterials with active properties to facilitate their implementation in future robotic applications.",

Various cable‐crawling robots (CCRs) have been developed to perform scheduled inspection or convey supplies. Most existing CCRs are often actuated by motors and used in large‐scaled engineering structures. The heavy bodies of these CCRs can cause damage or even casualties once slippage or drop occurs. A small and lightweight CCR that can crawl on thin cables is highly demanded for safety inspection in narrow and confined inner spaces of engineering structures. Herein, a soft CCR (weight, 2.1 g; length, 43 mm) is developed by utilizing multilayered dielectric elastomer actuators. Compared with existing solutions, this CCR achieves crawling on thin cables (diameter: &lt;1 mm) while crawling fastest (horizontal: 0.72 body length per second). The CCR is also capable of transporting objects (horizontal: 3.69 times its own weight; vertical: 0.76 times its own weight), climbing upward on a vertical cable, and locomoting across the water–air interface. The CCR is also demonstrated to crawl on a slack cable and circular/spiral cables. Finally, the soft robot, equipped with an endoscope, demonstrates inspections on a tensegrity structure as well as in an airplane wing model with a preplaced cable.",

Reproducible design and scalable manufacturing of biohybrid machines requires methods to increase the stroke output of strain‐limited muscle actuators and enable accurate and precise quality control and performance monitoring. Compliant mechanical elements, termed flexures, are designed to enhance muscle contractile stroke to ≈5× previously reported values and decode contraction dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution. Combining rigid and flexible elements within a linear elastic flexure enables us to outperform the sensitivity of gold standard elastomeric beam‐based measurements of muscle contraction at both low‐ and high‐frequency stimulations. Flexures are leveraged to make quantitative comparisons of force, work, and power outputs in muscle actuators, driving us to discover a new observation of frequency‐dependent fatigue in muscle, and also develop a novel method for tuning muscle contractile dynamics in a frequency‐independent manner. By enhancing the contractile stroke of muscle actuators and precisely tuning contractile dynamics and endurance with unprecedented precision, this study sets the stage for leveraging flexures to improve robust, reproducible, and predictive design and manufacturing of next‐generation biohybrid robots.",

Force tests investigate the mechanical properties of a soft robot module, resulting in orthogonal forces of N. Then, the policy is trained in simulation leveraging a dynamic Cosserat rod model of the soft robot. Domain randomization mitigate the sim‐to‐real gap while careful reward engineering induced pose and force control even without explicit force inputs.

A discussed topic is the intricate relationship between the brain and the body at the core of intelligence in robots. The goal of this article is, therefore, to unravel the strategies to implement different types of intelligence currently adopted in soft robots. A classification is made by making a distinction between agents that adapt to their environment by 1) their adaptive shape, 2) their adaptive functionality, and 3) their adaptive mechanics. Additionally, the perspectives on intelligence based on their computational approach are distinguished: centralized computation, decentralized computation, or embedded computation. It is concluded that a tailored robotic design approach attuned to specific environmental demands is needed.

Skeletal muscle tissue‐based bioactuators respond to externally applied stimuli, such as electrical fields. However, current bioactuation systems rely on open‐loop control strategies that lack knowledge of the actuator's state. The regulation of output force and position of biohybrid robots requires self‐sensing control systems that combine bioactuators with sensors and control paradigms. Herein, a soft, fiber‐shaped mechanical sensor based on a piezoresistive composite is proposed that efficiently integrates with engineered skeletal muscle tissue and senses its contracting states in a cell culture environment in the presence of applied electrical fields. After testing the sensor's insulation and biocompatibility, its sensitivity for typical strains (&lt;1%) is characterized, and its ability is proven to detect motions from contractile skeletal muscle tissue constructs. Finally, it is shown that the sensor response can feed an autonomous control system, thus demonstrating the first proprioceptive biohybrid robot that senses and responds to its contraction state. In addition to inspiring implantable systems, biomedical models, and other bioelectronic devices, the proposed technology will confer biohybrids with decisional autonomy, thus driving the paradigm shift between bioactuators and intelligent biohybrid robots.",

However, designing and optimizing custom microfluidic systems remains challenging because of their inherent complexities. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with microfluidics promises to overcome these barriers by leveraging AI algorithms to automate device design, streamline experimentation, and enhance diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes. Psoriasis is an incurable dermatological condition that is difficult to diagnose and treat owing to its complex pathogenesis. Traditional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are often ineffective and fail to address individual variabilities in disease progression and treatment responses. However, AI‐coupled microfluidic platforms have the potential to revolutionize psoriasis research and clinical applications with expansive dermatological applications.

    "abstract": "The suckers on the octopus arm play a pivotal role in the execution of tasks in unstructured environments by providing a means to grip objects as well as perceive the environment through (chemo‐)tactile receptors in the suckers. This work presents an octopus‐inspired suction cup with high‐resolution tactile sensing capabilities using a camera that captures the displacement of markers that are integrated in the suction cup. The orientation of the suction cup with respect to an object surface could be predicted with an average error of 1.97° for latitude and 9.41° for longitude. In a closed‐loop control experiment, the orientation of the suction cup with respect to the object surface is estimated by an initial touch and the suction cup is consequently reoriented to approach the object surface in a perpendicular manner. The passive compliance of the suction cup is sufficient to compensate for the prediction error and a seal could be created on all of the objects. In combination with the automated design and manufacturing process, this is a major step toward the deployment of sensory innervated suction cups for motion planning and control of soft continuum robot arms.",

    "abstract": "In building maintenance, cleaning the exterior walls of high‐altitude buildings is a critical task traditionally performed by human workers. However, manual maintenance exhibits several challenges, including fall risks, high costs, and aging workforce. To address such issues, this article presents a biped wall‐cleaning robotic system (BWCRS) dedicated to the maintenance of multi‐isolated areas on exoskeleton‐structured windows. To solve the complete coverage cleaning path planning problem, a full coverage cleaning approach is proposed by integrating a deep Q‐network (DQN)‐based method with the BWCRS. The proposed method enhances the cleaning process by optimizing the robot's travel path using DQN, ensuring stable navigation on walls with obstacles through advanced biped loco‐manipulation. The effectiveness of the reported approach is validated through extensive simulations and experimental investigations. Comparative studies reveal that the presented method outperforms the existing method. The results demonstrate the BWCRS's capability to efficiently and safely clean exoskeleton‐structure windows. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to path planning of other types of climbing robots.",

A machine learning approach using micro inertial measurement units (μIMUs) for noninvasive sarcopenia‐prone screening through a single sit‐to‐stand (1STS) test is developed. The study involves 53 older participants (65–84 years), each wearing two IMUs, i.e., one on the thigh and one on the waist. The 1STS motion is divided into four phases and extract 510 features from the collected data. Phase 1 is crucial for distinguishing healthy from sarcopenia‐prone participants, while Phase 2 is significant in differentiating risk levels. Key indicators include anterior–posterior and mediolateral movements, particularly along the y ‐axis and z ‐axis of the sensors. Five classification algorithms (support vector machine (SVM), K‐nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, linear discriminant analysis, and multilayer perceptron (MLP)) with selected features are trained. The method achieves 98.32% accuracy using SVM and MLP in distinguishing healthy from sarcopenia‐prone participants and 90.44% accuracy using KNN in classifying participants across four risk levels (0–3) based on physical performance severity. These results suggest that the proposed method provides a low‐cost, nonspecialist technique for large‐scale sarcopenia‐prone risk screening and assessment of physical performance severities.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are inspired by the brain, are a central pillar in the ongoing breakthrough in artificial intelligence. In recent years, researchers have examined mechanical implementations of ANNs, denoted as physical neural networks (PNNs). PNNs offer the opportunity to view common materials and physical phenomena as networks, and to associate computational power with them. In this work, mechanical bistability is incorporated into PNNs, enabling memory and a direct link between computation and physical action. To achieve this, an interconnected network of bistable liquid‐filled chambers is considered. All possible equilibrium configurations or steady‐states are first mapped, and then their stability is examined. Building on these maps, both global and local algorithms for training multistable PNNs are implemented. These algorithms enable to systematically examine the network's capability to achieve stable output states and thus the network's ability to perform computational tasks. By incorporating PNNs and multistability, it is possible to design structures that mechanically perform tasks typically associated with electronic neural networks, while directly obtaining physical actuation. The insights gained from this study pave the way for the implementation of intelligent structures in smart tech, metamaterials, medical devices, soft robotics, and other fields.",

The resistive switching behavior of the memristor is based on proton‐involved photoreduction, and the memristor exhibits humidity‐dependent optical resistive switching and synaptic behaviors similar to an artificial optoelectronic synapse. The plasticity of the artificial synapse can be further modulated by a heterosynapse with an external bias caused by electric field‐driven oxygen migration.

However, these modular soft robots always show limitations in coping with application requirements due to the defects of their building blocks, including limited motion patterns, poor repetitive positioning accuracy, and weak load‐bearing capacity. Herein, a rigid parallel structure on the exterior of a soft origami structure is introduced, developing a rigid‐flexible coupling building block. In this combined theoretical and experimental study, the geometric parameters to realize the coupling synergy between the two structures in terms of kinematics are adapted. Then, diverse experiments are conducted to characterize the performance of this building block, indicating that this building block not only has all basic motion patterns (i.e., contraction Δ H max = 30.78 mm, bending = 59.96°, and twisting = 33.67°) but also exhibits high repeatable positioning accuracy and strong load‐bearing capacity. Based on this building block, a soft continuum robot that showcases its versatility, such as flexibly twisting light bulbs and using bending motion pattern to grasp items of varying weights is developed.",

Despite significant advancements, persistent challenges at the battery interfaces—where electrode and electrolyte interactions occur—are of particular concern. These interfaces play pivotal roles in phenomena such as dendrite growth and the formation of solid–electrolyte interphases (SEI), which are crucial for the performance, longevity, and safety of batteries. Machine learning (ML), a vital subset of artificial intelligence, offers robust capabilities by autonomously identifying patterns in complex datasets, thereby enhancing the understanding of these intricate interfacial processes. This review highlights recent progress in ML‐assisted simulations and predictions at battery interfaces, illustrating how ML accelerates the research and development trajectory. By employing ML algorithms and machine vision, simulations of lithium dendrite growth, SEI formation, and interfacial dynamics can be performed. These simulations not only deepen the comprehension but also serve as a foundation for further material optimization and predication and the battery property enhancement. The aim of this review is to spur ongoing research and the application of ML to address existing challenges, thereby advancing the development of state‐of‐the‐art battery technologies.",

    "abstract": "Social immunity involves collective defensive strategies against infectious diseases. Despite its prevalence in eusocial insects, little is known about social immunity in non‐eusocial organisms like gregarious locusts. To address this gap, an emergent biohybrid approach bridging robotics and ethology is employed to study the behavior of the gregarious phase of Schistocerca gregaria in response to the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana . Herein, the first animal–robot–microorganism interaction is developed to explore how infected biomimetic agents (IB) influence healthy locust behavior compared to healthy biomimetic agents (HB), as well as to infected and healthy non‐biomimetic controls (INB, HNB). Significant differences in locust responses to different agents, including latency duration, grooming behavior, tactile interactions, and aggression are observed. In healthy locusts, the increased grooming and tactile interactions in response to IB highlight potential preventive measures against pathogen transmission. Also, tactile interaction behavior is notably extended toward IB, emphasizing the role of reciprocal hygiene in limiting pathogens spread within the swarm. Infected locusts exhibit altered behaviors, including increased interaction with any robotic agents, potentially to be cleaned of fungal conidia. This animal–robot interaction study reveals social immunity dynamics in non‐eusocial organisms, with implications for pest control, evolutionary ecology, social complex systems, and bioinspired engineering design.",

This work introduces a responsive joint attention system integrated into the social robot Mini. The system calculates the position of the user's head, body, and face orientations in real‐time. With this information, the robot can perform natural movements based on the user's gaze and pointing directions. Moreover, the robot employs verbal expressions to alert the user when distractions are detected, enhancing the perception of the robot's responsiveness. This study also explores differences in user perception of the robot when the joint attention system is active. A user experiment involving an interactive gaming scenario is proposed.

    "abstract": "Humans possess an exquisite sense of touch, which robotic and prosthetic systems aim to replicate. Algorithms are developed to create neuron‐like (neuromorphic) spiking representations of texture that are invariant to the scanning speed and contact force applied in the sensing process. These spiking representations mimic the activity of mechanoreceptors in human skin and subsequent processing up to the brain. The algorithms are tested on a tactile texture dataset collected under 15 speed–force conditions. An offline texture classification system based on the invariant representations demonstrates higher classification accuracy, improved computational efficiency, and enhanced capability to identify textures explored in novel speed–force conditions. The speed‐invariance algorithm is adapted for a real‐time human‐operated texture classification system. In this system, invariant representations again improve classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and the ability to identify textures encountered under novel conditions. The invariant representation is particularly critical in this context, as human imprecision can be perceived as a novel condition by the classification system. These results show that invariant neuromorphic representations enable superior performance in neurorobotic sensing systems. Additionally, because the neuromorphic representations are grounded in biological processing, this work can serve as the basis for naturalistic sensory feedback for upper limb amputees.",

The sensing system consists of a mobile robot with a 3D EP sensor and portable Faraday cage for data acquisition, using an AI‐powered convolution neural network to analyze EP data in greenhouses and categorize irrigation levels to optimize water usage for scalable agricultural management. The findings reveal that the 3D EP sensor displays lower and more stable contact resistance (2.10 ± 0.52 MΩ) compared to flat thin‐film sensors (2.96 ± 1.45 MΩ), ensuring high electrical reliability due to effective contact with hairy tomato leaves. The 3D EP sensor's high sensitivity (signal resolution of 0.0122 mV) detects subtle EP signal changes linked to irrigation levels, aiding water optimization and crop yield enhancement. For the first time, this study employs scalogram images for detailed analysis of plant EP signals, achieving a classification accuracy of 86.91%, comparable to red, gren, and blue image‐based methods (86.37%).

This leads to proposing a tumor‐assisted prediction strategy (MCFFS) based on multi‐scale feature fusion to achieve accurate segmentation and grade recognition. It introduces the Swin structure to replace the downsampling and upsampling processes in the traditional U‐Net to achieve the fusion of deep and shallow feature information at different levels; by constructing a multiscale feature fusion strategy based on transformer to enhance the fusion of low‐ and high‐dimensional spatial information; through the prediction algorithm with weight update, accurate classification of pathological images is achieved. The segmentation Dice Similariy Coefficient (DSC) of the MCFFS method reached 0.849, and the classification accuracy reached 0.938, indicating that it has superior performance in cell nucleus segmentation and tumor classification prediction, providing a strong auxiliary reference for doctors' clinical diagnosis.

Although advanced functionalities for manipulation and drug delivery tasks have been explored, one remaining challenge is achieving improved visualization, identification, and accurate closed‐loop control of microscale robots. To enable this, distinguishable identifying and trackable features must be included on the microrobot. Toward this end, the construction of micro‐ and nanoscale patterns using TPP is demonstrated for the first time on microrobot surfaces with the intent of mimicking color‐expressing nanostructures present on beetles or butterflies. The patterns provide identification and tracking targets due to their vivid color expression under visible light. Helical and rectangular microrobots are designed with the topical patterns and further functionalized with magnetic materials to be externally actuated by magnetic fields. Vision‐based tracking of a 20 μm × 30 μm colored feature on a 100 μm‐long helical microrobot using a fixed angular position light source during microrobotic motion is shown. This versatile structural color patterning approach shows great potential for the visual differentiation of various microrobots and tracking for improved closed‐loop control.",

Most additive manufacturing methods for soft robots are developed for devices driven by external fluidic pressure sources and are not suited to fabricate soft electrically driven actuators. To integrate electrostatic zipping actuators and microfluidics in stretchable soft machines without any rigid components, inks for sacrificial layers, dielectric elastomers, and compliant electrodes are developed herein, along with a unified printing process to print multilayer structures. Printed 2.5D stacks are transformed into fully functional 3D soft machines by inflating thin elastomer channels. Two demonstrators are reported, each consisting of seven printed layers: a flexible peristaltic pump and a compliant slug drive, inspired by the locomotion of slugs. The peristaltic pump has six integrated actuators, whereas the slug drive has 28 integrated actuators, generating a travelling wave used to transport objects. These soft devices demonstrate how inkjet printing produces densely packed high‐voltage actuators, including vias for electrical routing. Sensors and logic may be printed in the future to produce more complex autonomous soft machines.",

Herein, a strain‐free, deformation‐resilient embroidery process for near field communication (NFC) coil antennas is introduced. Coil geometry can endure extreme deformation by stretching with up to 50% elongation, bending with curvature as small as 16 mm in radius, and can still maintain a relatively small variation in its inductance, resonant frequency, Q value, as well as its energy‐harvesting capabilities. The embroidered coil antenna is used in an NFC‐based battery‐free body sensor system. Experiments demonstrate that the system can maintain a stable performance (voltage supply, temperature sensing, and reading range) under various deformation conditions.",

To further improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE), the materials selection criteria must be focused on achieving high open‐circuit voltage ( V oc ) through the alignment of the energy levels of the ternary blends. Hence, machine‐learning approaches are in high demand for extracting the complex correlation between V oc and the energy levels of the ternary blends, which are crucial to facilitate device design. Herein, the data‐driven strategies are used to generate a model based on the available experimental data, and the V oc is then predicted using available machine‐learning methods (the Random Forest regression and the Support Vector regression). In addition, the Random Forest regression is developed to find the appropriate energy‐level alignment of ternary OSCs and to reveal the relationship between V oc and electronic features. Finally, an analysis based on the ranking of variables in terms of importance by the Random Forest model is performed to identify the key feature governing the V oc and the performance of ternary OSCs. From the perspective of device design, the machine‐learning approach provides sufficient insights to improve the V oc and advances the comprehensive understanding of ternary OSCs.",

Recently, deep learning algorithms have been introduced to design metasurfaces, but the network can only output one solution for each desired input and suffers from nonunique issue. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, a deep neural network model for inverse designs of anisotropic metasurfaces with full phase properties in ultrawideband is proposed. Given the target reflection spectra as inputs, the candidate metasurface patterns are generated through a generative adversarial network (GAN), and the corresponding predictions are simply achieved by the accurate forward neural network model to match the target spectra in the whole band with high fidelity. By training the generator and discriminator in GAN in an alternating order combined with setting a threshold of discriminator loss to trigger the phase prediction, the proposed method is much more efficient and consumes less time in the training process. Numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the reflection phases of the generated meta‐atoms have excellent agreements with the given targets, providing an efficient way in automatically designing metasurfaces. The most important advantage of this approach over the previous schemes is to improve the design speed significantly with very good accuracy.",

Though previous researches have successfully fabricated soft actuators with diverse actuation modes, their actuation capabilities are often fixed once their fabrication is completed. Herein, an electrically controlled soft actuator with multiple and reprogrammable actuation modes is designed and fabricated. The soft actuator is composed of two layers of disulfide liquid crystal elastomer (ss‐LCE) film with embedded resistive heating wires of serpentine shape. The actuation mode of the actuator can be programmed by introducing a certain alignment of liquid crystal mesogens in the ss‐LCE film, which is achieved by the controlled deformation of the actuator at room temperature and the rearrangement of the polymer network through disulfide exchange reaction in the material. The actuation mode of the actuator can be easily erased by heating it up to 180 °C, and a new mode of actuation can be introduced by deforming the actuator to a new shape at room temperature. With the reprogrammable and multiple actuation modes, a reusable and general‐purpose soft actuator is demonstrated herein which can meet various requirements in constructing new soft active devices.",

However, the implementation of an artificial visual system based on a synapse remains a considerable challenge due to the limitation that most current photonic synapses fail to recognize color. Here, a photonic synapse with color recognition capability is proposed and demonstrated. Through the light‐induced adjustment of dangling bond defects inside the amorphous silicon (a‐Si) film, the device exhibits switchable volatile and nonvolatile photoconductivity (PC) behaviors at the wavelengths of 635 and 450 nm, respectively. Based on the dual PC, the photonic synapse enables dual synaptic plasticity depending on the stimulation light, allowing not only various synaptic functions, but also learning experiences, associative learning behaviors, and recognition of the red and blue colors. Moreover, the dual synaptic plasticity of the photonic synapse could be modulated via a voltage in the range below ≈1 V to realize the stable detection and precise extraction of the grayscale and color signals. With its simple structure and compatibility with existing Si‐complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, this photonic synapse shows potential for application in neuromorphic computing and advanced robot vision systems.",

    "abstract": "Touch and vision perception are two important functions humans use to interact with the real world. To mimic human‐like abilities, tactile‐ and visual‐sensing‐based intelligent humanoids have emerged and are going through a fast phase of development. Studies have demonstrated that the combination of tactile and visual information not only enables humanoids to better learn the environment, but also allows them to have pseudocognitive ability. Being a new and rapidly developing field of research, a significant growth in articles reporting different aspects of sensing and related machine learning is being witnessed. To help readers comprehensively understand the fundamentals and insights, and the current state of the art, this review is compiled to explain the working mechanisms of tactile and visual sensing, introduce the application of intelligent humanoids in diverse scenarios, discuss current challenges, and predict future trends.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as the algorithm of choice for guiding the selection of experimental parameters in automated active learning driven high throughput experiments in materials science and chemistry. Previous studies suggest that optimization performance of the typical surrogate model in the BO algorithm, Gaussian processes (GPs), may be limited due to its inability to handle complex datasets. Herein, various surrogate models for BO, including GPs and neural network ensembles (NNEs), are investigated. Two materials datasets of different complexity with different properties are used, to compare the performance of GP and NNE—the first is the compressive strength of concrete (8 inputs and 1 target), and the second is a simulated high‐dimensional dataset of thermoelectric properties of inorganic materials (22 inputs and 1 target). While NNEs can converge faster toward optimum values, GPs with optimized kernels are able to ultimately achieve the best evaluated values after 100 iterations, even for the most complex dataset. This surprising result is contrary to expectations. It is believed that these findings shed new light on the understanding of surrogate models for BO, and can help accelerate the inverse design of new materials with better structural and functional performance.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners have recently been used for magnetic actuation of robots for minimally invasive medical operations. Due to MRI's high soft‐tissue selectivity, it is possible to obtain 3D images of hard‐to‐reach cavities in the human body, where the wireless miniature magnetic robots powered by MRI could be employed for high‐precision targeted operations, such as drug delivery, stem cell therapy, and hyperthermia. However, the state‐of‐the‐art fast magnetic robot‐tracking methods in MRI are limited above millimeter‐size scale, which restricts the potential target regions inside the human body. Herein, a fast 1D projection‐based MRI approach that can track magnetic particles down to 300 μm diameter (1.17 × 10 −2 emu) is reported. The technique reduces the trackable magnetic particle size in MRI‐powered navigation fivefold compared with the previous fast‐tracking methods. A closed‐loop MRI‐powered navigation with 0.78 ± 0.03 mm trajectory‐following accuracy in millimeter‐sized in vitro 2D channels and a 3D cavity setup using the tracking method is demonstrated. Furthermore, the feasibility of submillimeter magnetic robot tracking in ex vivo pig kidneys ( N = 2) with a 3.6 ± 1.1 mm accuracy is demonstrated. Such a fast submillimeter‐scale mobile robot‐tracking approach can unlock new opportunities in minimally invasive medical operations.",

While most current endeavors mainly concentrate on LM‐assisted actuations for soft robots, it is noteworthy that the peculiar behavior and LM droplet circuits thus enabled can be adopted as intelligent elements. Such characteristics will pave a way to innovate conventional logic devices and emancipate soft robots from the existing rigid machinery. Herein, LM‐based soft logic systems are described which are capable of regulating soft machines on macroscale. The core element is a LM‐based switch (LMS) with two specific types, both utilizing the LM droplet as a conducting medium. Soft logic gates of AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR thus fabricated are demonstrated to generate electrical outputs as an integration of random inputs, and these signals can be adapted for electronic devices. For practical illustration, a logic accumulator is further constructed which can effectively regulate a pneumatic soft gripper within four states of inflation. The present LM‐enabled logic devices are expected to offer a feasible strategy to manipulate future soft machines without the participation of traditional rigid controlling elements.",

However, the phase‐array‐based DOA estimations usually require complicated system architecture and signal processing. Digital programmable metasurfaces (DPMs) can realize flexible spatial modulations of electromagnetic (EM) waves without using massive transceivers, and hence can be used for DOA estimations with much simplified architectures. Here, a mechanism of DPM‐based DOA estimations at Ka band is proposed. A reflective DPM is designed to produce a series of dual beams in random, so as to establish a sensing matrix and sample the incident wave. Orthogonal matched pursuit algorithm is used to estimate DOA from the sparsely sampled datasets. The performances of the DPM‐based DOA estimations are demonstrated by simulations and experiments for the cases of single source and double sources. This work promotes the development of DPMs and is expected to find important applications in radar and wireless communication systems, as well as the joint radar and communication systems.",

Successful pattern classifications are experimentally realized through the tuning of cycle‐to‐cycle variation, linearity range, and linearity deviation of the multilevel SOT synapse. Also, a larger m × n SOT synaptic array with m controlling transistors is proposed and it is found that the classification accuracies can be improved dramatically by decreasing the cycle‐to‐cycle variation. A way for the application of spin–orbit device arrays in neuromorphic computing is paved and the crucial importance of the cycle‐to‐cycle variation for a multilevel SOT synapse is suggested.",

    "abstract": "Recently, programmable metasurfaces have aroused great attention for various applications such as beam manipulation, wireless communication, and holograms by modulating the spatial phase or amplitude. However, programmable amplitude‐coding modulations have rarely been investigated due to the difficulty in realizing dynamic control of amplitude. Herein, a real‐time programmable amplitude‐coding metasurface with multifrequency modulation is proposed by integrating PIN diodes and chip attenuators to the metaelement. The element is encoded as “11,” “10,” and “00,” corresponding to the ON/OFF states of two diodes. By switching the two states of the PIN diode, the metaelement exhibits distinctly reflected amplitude responses in three frequencies (2.98, 4.11, and 5.73 GHz). For the whole metasurface, the magnitude of the reflected beam can be modulated with some specific coding patterns. To verify the performance, six coding patterns with 10 × 10 metaelements are designed, and four of them are measured. Experimental results are fundamentally consistent with theoretical designs and simulations. Further a wireless communication demonstration is designed and implemented to perform direct modulation of digital signals without using mixers required in the conventional wireless communication systems. It is envisioned that this work will find applications in new architecture encrypted communication and imaging systems.",

To address this challenge, herein a bioinspired hexapod piezoelectric robot (PER‐hexapod) aiming at high‐performance micromanipulation is presented. Specifically, two piezoelectric elements are integrated in a functional module to provide 3‐DOF precise motions, the collaboration of six functional modules generates the multi‐DOF motions, and the multimode fusion of three gaits facilitates the cross‐scale motion. The robot outputs 6‐DOF motions with resolutions higher than 4 nm or 0.2 μrad, and unlimited traveling ranges of in‐plane motions are accomplished. PER‐hexapod, whose weight is 0.45 kg, can stably drive a carrying load of 10 kg. In addition, PER‐hexapod realizes the accurate positioning with the root‐mean‐square error less than 5 nm. Thus, it has potential applications in the precise positioning in a large range, such as the batch injection of multiple cells and micromachining on large surfaces. Not only PER‐hexapod, but many other robots can be also designed with the same philosophy to construct micromanipulation systems for various requirements.",

However, conventional spatial spectrum methods heavily rely on a priori knowledge with a trial‐and‐error solution fashion, leading to a great challenge to estimate complete information in volatile scenarios. Inspired by the mechanism of the jumping spider (Salticidae), here a universal detection approach driven by an intelligent antenna array, with the usage of amplitude‐only information as inputs, is introduced. The applied machine learning method can process the received time‐varying signals in one single feed‐forward computation, bypassing a heavy recline on prior knowledge of the array structure. As a demonstration, a compact eight‐port antenna array is designed for simultaneous attainments of frequency, direction of arrival, and polarization, covering the entire microwave X band. Both the simulated and experimental results show that the average accuracies for the azimuth angle, elevation angle, and polarization are up to 98%, with a millisecond detection time. Different from conventional methods, the strategy herein does not involve a complex beamforming network and a time‐consuming trial‐and‐error solution fashion, allowing a big step toward a miniaturized, integrated, and cost‐effective detector.",

Herein, a flexible tactile sensor with a small cylinder protrusion and four arc‐shaped protrusions is developed. Due to its center symmetry and axisymmetry characteristics, the normal pressure and shear force can be decoupled from the complex stress without any interference from torsion. The flexible tactile sensor exhibits good linearity and superior cycling stability and is capable of determining the magnitude and direction of the applied force accurately. The flexible tactile sensor is comfortable to wear, and it is integrated onto the manipulator to realize various delicate and dexterous tasks, such as pressure detection, interaction with fragile objects, and roughness identification. Moreover, intelligent recognition of the sliding and stationary states can be achieved by decoding signals of sliding friction and static friction from the feedback information, leading to real time and precise adjustment of the grasping state of the manipulator.",

Inspired by the somatosensory processing hierarchy of humans, the bioinspired co‐design of a tactile sensor and a deep learning‐based algorithm is proposed herein, simplifying the sensor structure while providing computation‐enhanced tactile sensing performance. The soft piezoresistive sensor, based on the carbon black‐coated polyurethane sponge, offers a continuous sensing area. By utilizing a customized deep neural network (DNN), it can detect external tactile stimulus spatially continuously. Besides, a novel data augmentation method is developed based on the sensor's hexagonal structure that has a sixfold rotation symmetry. It can significantly enhance the generalization ability of the DNN model by enriching the collected training data with generated pseudo‐data. The functionality of the sensor and the robustness of the proposed data augmentation strategy are verified by precisely recognizing five touch modalities, illustrating a well‐generalized performance, and providing a promising application prospect in human–robot interaction.",

    "abstract": "Infertility is a growing global health concern, with male factor infertility contributing to half of all cases. Semen analysis is crucial to infertility diagnostics. However, sperm morphology assessment, as a routine part of analysis, is still performed manually and is thus highly subjective. Here, a stacked ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is presented for automated classification of human sperm head morphology. By combining traditional CNN models with modern residual and densely connected architectures using a multi‐class meta‐classifier, classification rate improvements of 2.7% (to 98.2%) and 2.3% (to 63.3%) on the HuSHeM and SCIAN‐MorphoSpermGS (SCIAN) datasets, respectively, are achieved. This considerable improvement in prediction performance is achieved as the meta‐classifier improves upon the individual classification rates of the base models by ≈8.5%. The ensembled deep learning model is a powerful step toward an automated sperm morphology analysis, providing new opportunities to standardize clinical practice and reduce treatment costs to improve patient treatment.",

They are essential for a range of functions from survival to adaptation in dynamic environments. Design of hardware for neuroinspired computing strives to emulate such features driven by electric bias and can also be incorporated into neural network algorithms. Herein, cellular‐like learning in oxygen‐deficient NiO x devices is demonstrated. Both habituation learning and sensitization response can be achieved in a single device by simply controlling the magnitude of the electric field. Spontaneous memory relaxations and dynamic redistribution of oxygen vacancies under electric bias enable such learning behavior of NiO x under sequential training. These characteristics in simple device arrays are implemented to learn alphabets as well as demonstrate simulated algorithmic use cases in digit recognition. Transition metal oxides with carefully prepared defect concentrations can be highly sensitive to electronic structure perturbations under moderate electrical stimulus and serve as building blocks for next‐generation neuroinspired computing hardware.",

However, most current soft robots rely on intrinsically soft materials for actuation, separately embedded sensors for sensing, and have fixed stiffness once fabricated. Large gaps remain between these soft robots and biological organisms where multifunctionality is realized within an integrated body. Herein, a new class of robotic structures from architectured particle assemblies is introduced. They combine three functions: shape changing, stiffness variation, and self‐sensing into one monolithic structure. Unlike traditional entirely soft robots, the design utilizes the geometric contacts of stiff, architectured particles under confining pressure to achieve these functions. The applications of these structures by designing smart self‐sensing architectures and soft grippers are demonstrated. The design provides a new paradigm of multifunctional robotic structures, with potential multiscale applications in adaptive robots, smart devices, and reconfigurable architectures.",

The study of live birds is time‐consuming, laborious, and, more importantly, limited to the flapping motion adopted by the animal. The latter makes systematic studies of alternative flapping strategies impossible, limiting our ability to test why birds select specific kinematics among infinite alternatives. Herein, a biohybrid robotic wing is described, partly built from real feathers, with more advanced kinematic capabilities than previous robotic wings and similar to those of a real bird. In a first case study, the robotic wing is used to systematically study the aerodynamic consequences of different upstroke kinematic strategies at different flight speeds and stroke plane angles. The results indicate that wing folding during upstroke not only favors thrust production, as expected, but also reduces force‐specific aerodynamic power, indicating a strong selection pressure on protobirds to evolve upstroke wing folding. It is also shown that thrust requirements likely dictate the wing's stroke tilting. Overall, the proposed biohybrid robotic flapper can be used to answer many open questions about avian flapping flights that are impossible to address by observing free‐flying birds.",

Most event-based stereo methods attempt to exploit the high temporal resolution of the camera and the simultaneity of events across cameras to establish matches and estimate depth. By contrast, this work investigates how to estimate depth without explicit data association by fusing Disparity Space Images (DSIs) originated in efficient monocular methods.

However, 3D printing's propensity for production errors prevents autonomous operation and the quality assurance necessary to realize this vision. Human operators cannot continuously monitor or correct errors in real time, while automated approaches predominantly only detect errors. New methodologies correct parameters either offline or with slow response times and poor prediction granularity, limiting their utility. A commonly available 3D printing process metadata is harnessed, alongside the video of the printing process, to build a unique image dataset. Regression models are trained to precisely predict how printing material flow should be altered to correct errors and this should be used to build a fast control loop capable of 3D printing parameter discovery and few‐shot correction. Demonstrations show that the system can learn optimal parameters for unseen complex materials, and achieve rapid error correction on new parts. Similar metadata exists in many manufacturing processes and this approach could enable the adoption of fast data‐driven control systems more widely in manufacturing.",

A spintronics device is a promising candidate for neuromorphic computing hardware and can be used in extreme environments due to its high resistance to radiation. Improving the information‐processing capability of neuromorphic computing is an important challenge for implementation. Herein, a novel neuromorphic computing framework using spintronics devices is proposed. This framework is called coupled spintronics reservoir (CSR) computing and exploits the high‐dimensional dynamics of coupled spin‐torque oscillators as a computational resource. The relationships among various bifurcations of the CSR and its information‐processing capabilities through numerical experiments are analyzed and it is found that certain configurations of the CSR boost the information‐processing capability of the spintronics reservoir toward or even beyond the standard level of machine learning networks. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through conventional machine learning benchmarks and edge computing in real physical experiments using pneumatic artificial muscle‐based wearables, which assist human operations in various environments.

This research, utilizing the stacked Miura‐ori‐variant (SMOV) structure that has multistable shape reconfigurability as a platform, uncovers the deep knowledge of quasistatic and dynamic transitions and proposes the corresponding versatile formation and tuning of mechanical logic gates. Through theoretical, numerical, and experimental means, discriminative and deterministic quasistatic transition sequences, including reversible and irreversible ones, are uncovered, where they constitute a transition map that is editable upon adjusting the design parameters. Via applying dynamic excitations and tailoring the excitation conditions, reversible transitions between all stable configurations become attainable, generating a fully connected transition map. Benefiting from the nonlinearity of the quasistatic and dynamic transitions, basic and compound mechanical logic gates are achieved. The versatility of the scheme is demonstrated using a single SMOV to realize different complex logic operations without increasing structural complexity, showing its unique computing power and inspiring the avenue for efficient physical intelligence.",

One of the key challenges for biomimetic perceptional machine visual systems is the self‐adaptive behavior of the retina, which is known as the ability to adjust and eventually perceive objects through a wide range of environmental light intensities. To achieve this, current systems use either complex processing algorithms or specific devices with optoelectronic properties which results in complexity and less efficiency. Herein, an artificial retina circuit is reported to imitate the adaptation process to light (photopic and scotopic adaptation) of the perceptional biovisual system. The implementation of an artificial Hodgkin–Huxley neuron circuit based on adaptive VO 2 memristors has helped the artificial retina to successfully demonstrate time‐varying activation and inhibition characteristics. The adaptable perception function under different illumination conditions is faithfully achieved by the artificial HH neuron based on the self‐adaptability of the memristor. The function is consistent with the dynamic light amplitude ranges of biological vision systems. More importantly, this development shows a pervasive way to design and fabricate a universal environmentally adaptable artificial system.",

While traditional EM metamaterials exhibit fixed behaviors due to unchangeable material properties and geometries after fabrication, reconfigurable EM metamaterials allow for tunable performance through electrical/mechanical reconfiguration strategies. Traditional biasing circuit‐based electrical reconfiguration poses challenges due to complex circuit design, while motor‐driven mechanical reconfiguration can lead to bulky and tethered structures with restricted adaptability. Herein, magnetically actuated structurally reconfigurable EM metamaterials with enhanced adaptability/conformability to different geometries, showing merits of fast, reversible, and programmable shape morphing, are developed. Magnetic actuation enables metamaterial's mechanical reconfiguration between flat deployed, flat folded, curved deployed, and curved folded states for both conformal and freestanding 3D shape morphing. Locally, the EM metamaterials fold subwavelength units for tunable properties, switching between all‐pass and band‐stop behaviors upon structural reconfiguration. Globally, the structure can conform and morph to different curved surfaces. The structurally reconfigurable metamaterial also serves as a medium for customizable subwavelength units by rationally designing attached conductive patterns for varied filtering performances such as narrow‐band, dual‐band, and wide‐band filtering behaviors, illustrating the design flexibility and application versatility of the developed structurally reconfigurable EM metamaterial.",

However, existing m‐SPAs have slow actuation speed and are either limited by a finite air supply or require energy‐consuming hardware to continuously supply compressed air. Herein, these shortcomings by introducing an internal exhaust air recirculation (IEAR) mechanism for high‐speed and low‐energy actuation of m‐SPAs are addressed. This mechanism recirculates the exhaust compressed air and recovers the energy by harnessing the rhythmic actuation of multiple chambers. A theoretical model to guide the analysis of the IEAR mechanism, which agrees well with the experimental results, is developed. Comparative experimental results of several sets of m‐SPAs show that the IEAR mechanism significantly improves the actuation speed by more than 82.4% and reduces the energy consumption per cycle by more than 47.7% under typical conditions. The promising applications of the IEAR mechanism in various pneumatic soft machines and robots such as a robotic fin, fabric‐based finger, and quadruped robot are further demonstrated.

This bending sensor is fabricated of carbon fiber with a cascade structure, resulting in excellent characteristics, including a quantitative detection capability, high gauge factor, low hysteresis, long‐term durability, and high‐frequency response. Thus, the bending sensor can recognize both the large‐scale motion of joint bending and subtle motion of muscle contraction. Fourteen bending sensors corresponding to the 14 knuckles of the human hand can accurately recognize and digitize hand gestures. These multichannel sensors are combined with nine additional bending sensors to comprehensively digitize the grasping process of the upper limb and recognize the grasping of objects with different sizes and weights. These successful applications demonstrate that the bending sensor can open a path toward learning human behavior for a humanoid robot.",

    "abstract": "Molecular spin‐crossover (SCO) complexes are phase‐change materials that develop large spontaneous strains across the thermally induced phase transition, which can be advantageously used in designing soft actuators. Herein, a bilayer bending cantilever, made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with embedded [Fe(NH 2 trz) 3 ](SO 4 ) SCO particles (25 wt%), is presented. The proposed actuator is fabricated by blade casting an SCO@TPU layer on a conducting Ag@TPU film to convert electrothermal input into mechanical response. Experiments are conducted to characterize the curvature of bilayer beams, which is then further analyzed using the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. The beam curvature change, free transformation strain, and effective work density associated with the SCO are 0.11 mm −1 , 1.6%, and 1.25 mJ cm −3 , respectively. Further, the open‐ and closed‐loop response of the actuator is investigated using a custom‐built setup. The open‐loop identification suggests that the actuator gain increases monotonously when the control current increases. This natural adaptive character can explain the drastically diminished response time in closed‐loop proportional–integral–derivative control experiments (2–3 s). Finally, tracking experiments are carried out to evaluate the robustness of the actuator with and without payloads. The results for 30 240 endurance cycles reveal a mean positioning error of 0.8%.",

Flexible robots have shown promising adaptability and dexterity in soft manipulation owing to their inherent compliance. This compliance allows them to interact safely and efficiently during space missions such as active debris removal. Herein, inspired by the bistable structure and energy‐release mechanism of the Venus flytrap, a bistable origami‐based gripper is developed. The flexible gripper, which can rapidly achieve stable state switching, is in the form of a biomimetic flytrap leaf curvature and is actuated using a shape memory alloy actuator. Subsequently, a flytrap bristle‐like locking structure is used to ensure locking via the action of a dielectric elastomer actuator to alleviate the vibration instability of the flexible robot under rapid actuation. The experimental results showed that the flexible gripper can achieve effective capture within approximately 300 ms. In addition, it exhibits good adaptability and mechanical robustness with targets having complex shapes and sizes, indicating its potential applications in the space capture and sampling fields.",

Hence, improving flexibility and designability of the stimuli‐responsive soft grippers for better grasping ability are highly desired. Inspired by the biological structure of octopuses, a class of temperature‐driven polylactic acid grippers is fabricated by 4D printing in this work, which consists of two types of bilayer structures, separately imitating the web and tentacles of an octopus. Compared with the traditional pure‐bending soft grippers, the integrated structure results in a 1.5 times wider reachable area and enhanced flexibility. The complex grasping behaviors are predicted with the 4D printing parameters (i.e., printing paths and printing speeds) using the reduced bilayer plate theory. Moreover, a method for determining the printing parameters of the gripper is provided to realize the desired grasping behavior depending on different objects. The feasibility of the design method is experimentally verified by gasping three distinctive objects, including an egg, a weight, and a Metatron's cube, which is in good agreement with the simulation results.

Consequently, the demand for high sensitivity and wide sensing range has gradually increased. Conductive hydrogels have high flexibility, excellent conductivity, and good biocompatibility, making them ideal candidates for fabricating flexible sensors. However, conductive hydrogels exhibit weak mechanical stability, which limits their applications. Therefore, sufficient mechanical properties and fatigue resistance are usually needed to fulfill their application requirements. Herein, the research frontiers of sensors based on mechanically robust conductive hydrogels are reviewed. While published papers always focus on the configuration design and application of sensors and the improvement of sensing performance, research on the network design of hydrogels and their effects on mechanical properties and sensing performance are limited. It is attempted in this review to fill this gap by focusing on the design principles of mechanically enhanced conductive hydrogels and their applications in flexible electronic devices. Herein, hydrogels’ structural designs, toughening mechanisms, mechanical properties, and sensing applications are discussed. The different working mechanisms of flexible sensors composed of tough conductive hydrogels and their applications are also reviewed.

The capability of body deformation further enhances the reachability of these small robots in cluttered terrains similar to those of insects and soft arthropods. Motivated by this concept, compliant legged articulated robotic insect (CLARI), an insect‐scale 2.59 g quadrupedal robot capable of body deformation, is presented. The robot, currently, with tethered electrical connections for power and control is manufactured using laminate fabrication and assembled using origami pop‐up techniques. To enable locomotion in multiple shape configurations, a novel body architecture comprising modular, actuated leg mechanisms, is designed. CLARI has eight independently actuated degrees of freedom driven by custom piezoelectric actuators, making it mechanically dextrous. Herein, open‐loop robot locomotion at multiple stride frequencies (1–10 Hz) is characterized using multiple gaits (trot, walk, etc.) in three different fixed body shapes (long, symmetric, wide) and the robot's capabilities are illustrated. Finally, preliminary results of CLARI locomoting with a compliant body in open terrain and through a laterally constrained gap, a novel capability for legged robots, is demonstrated.

In addition, the FBD interface exhibits significant advantages of flexibility and a compact structure. The experimental tests verify that the multimodal sensing module can accurately perceive various static and dynamic movements of a human.

    "abstract": "Pneumatic soft actuators possess relatively fast response, inherent high flexibility, and achieve extraordinary shape morphing under large deformations. Conventionally, the entire body of soft pneumatic robots needs to be designed for specific applications. Herein, a soft pneumatic actuator design with structured fabrics as actuator skins, which has high bending stiffness variation that can accomplish multiple tasks and different deformation modes in a single body, is proposed. By adjusting the structured skin, the developed soft actuator can be tailored to achieve various deformations. It is experimentally shown that the bending stiffness of the actuator can be adjusted from 108 to 5654 N m −1 . The blocking force of the actuator in bending is comparable with that of conventional fabric‐reinforced pneumatic actuators, while the actuator skins are reusable and programmable. In application, the actuators are used to construct a bionic soft gripper with multiple degrees of freedom. By switching between three grasping modes, the gripper successfully fulfills a series of tasks including lifting weights up to 1 kg and grasping objects ranging from a grain of grape to a large iron basin. This work opens up an avenue for designing structured skins for pneumatic robots with programmable deformation modes and versatile functions.",

This article fuses two different biomimetic morphological features to create an amphibious mini‐robot: mimicking the body shape and gait of a terrestrial inchworm, and mimicking the superhydrophobic leg shape and gait of an aquatic water strider. The light‐driven approach also brings the advantage of remote wireless manipulation. The mass of the robot is only 8 mg, and it has fast land movement speed (≈0.05 times body length s −1 ), water surface movement speed (≈0.5 times body length s −1 ), and some obstacle‐crossing ability (over obstacles of ≈64% of the robot's height). Moreover, the robot can quickly switch from land to water locomotion, which is expected to facilitate emerging applications in various industrial and biomedical settings.",

These robots made from flexible materials are generally with low stiffness and have limited capability to perform tasks that require the application of large forces. Soft artificial muscles (AMs) with variable stiffness are promising solutions for soft robots to handle larger payloads. However, the existing actuators need to overcome their small range of stiffness variation and slow response. Further, it is difficult to integrate self‐sensing into existing actuators. Herein, a novel electric AM with variable stiffness and self‐sensing referencing smooth muscle contraction in nature is proposed. The AM consists of two pieces of soft anode mesh, a flexible cathode and a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel dielectric layer, where the cathode is also a resistive sensor. The stiffness variation is induced by the friction change caused by electrostatic adsorption. Compared with the existing PVC gel actuation technology, the new design integrated the dielectric and the cathode layers and combined the sensing function. Also, the rigid anode and cathode are replaced by the soft ones, respectively, which makes the AM suitable for soft robotics or wearable devices.",

Physical reservoirs have been realized using spintronic oscillators, atomic switch networks, volatile memristors, etc. However, these devices are intrinsically energy‐dissipative due to their resistive nature, increasing their power consumption. Therefore, memcapacitive devices can provide a more energy‐efficient approach. Herein, volatile biomembrane‐based memcapacitors are leveraged as reservoirs to solve classification tasks and process time series in simulation and experimentally. This system achieves a 99.6% accuracy for spoken‐digit classification and a normalized mean square error of in a second‐order nonlinear regression task. Furthermore, to showcase the device's real‐time temporal data processing capability, a 100% accuracy for an epilepsy detection problem is achieved. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that each memcapacitor consumes an average of 41.5 fJ of energy per spike, regardless of the selected input voltage pulse width, while maintaining an average power of 415 fW for a pulse width of 100 ms, orders of magnitude lower than those achieved by state‐of‐the‐art devices.

    "abstract": "The innovation of high‐throughput technologies and medical radiomics allows biomedical data to accumulate at an astonishing rate. Several promising deep learning (DL) methods are developed to integrate multiomics data generated from a large number of samples. Herein, a comprehensive survey is conducted and the state‐of‐the‐art DL‐based multiomics data integration methods in the biomedical field are reviewed. These methods are classified into six categories according to their model framework, and the specific applicable scenarios of each category are summarized in five biomedicine aspects. DL‐based methods offer opportunities for disentangling biomolecular mechanisms in biomedical applications. There are, however, limitations with these methods, such as missing data problem and “black‐box” nature. A discussion of some of the recommendations for these challenges is ended.",

    "abstract": "Pneumatic and tendon‐driven actuators are widely used in soft robotic glove design. Tendon‐driven robotic gloves are generally better in controllability, dexterity, and force output, but they are less comfortable than pneumatic ones. Most soft gloves focus on only one actuation mode where either motor‐driven tendon or pump‐driven pneumatic transmission is used. Herein, a double‐acting soft actuator (DASA) that provides both tendon‐driven flexion and pneumatic extension of fingers by a single motor is presented. This is achieved by a smart pulley and bellow system. The kinematic model of the tendon‐driven flexion and the torque model of the fabric‐based pneumatic extension actuator (FPEA) are developed to analyze the DASA performance. The bending angle of the index finger actuated by the tendon and the FPEA extension torque of a joint are characterized by experimental studies. A cycle test of the DASA is conducted 3000 times, demonstrating its high repeatability. A prototype soft glove (68 g) based on the proposed DASA with a control box (835 g) is fabricated to demonstrate finger flexion and extension assistance. Based on electromyography signals, the performance of the robotic glove is evaluated by a squeezing sponge test.",

However, the regulation of the module type and/or sequence may result in time‐consuming and labor‐intensive problems. Therefore, in situ reconfiguration schemes are required to develop in a simple yet robust solution for continuum robot design. Herein, inspired by the structure characteristics of the seahorse tail, an original template based on a tensegrity building block (TBB) for creating an in situ reconfigurable continuum robotic paradigm is proposed. As the length of the stretchable struts in the TBB could be programmed, five typical homologous types from the template are derived. Then, ten TBBs into a continuum robot are assembled and the multi‐body dynamic framework is employed to develop a mechanical model for predicting the profile after deformation. Theoretical predictions demonstrate that the robotic shape can be customized in situ by switching the type of TBBs, without disassembling the robot. Furthermore, the tailored continuum robotic configurations are applied to conformally interact with the varying‐curvature objects. The experimental results suggest that the proposed programmable template offers a facile and rapid reconfiguration scheme for the continuum robots, which greatly improves the robotic interaction capability.",

Compared with electromagnet motors, smart‐material‐based rotary motors may exhibit more flexibility, robustness, and adaptability.

The motor is driven by a multilayered, slightly‐prestretched (&lt;10%) dielectric elastomer (DE) composite membrane which consists of low‐loss silicone as the DE layers and single‐walled carbon nanotube as electrodes. When operating at frequencies around its resonance, it achieves a maximum rotating speed of 2,850 rpm (to the best of the authors' knowledge, the fastest among all reported DEA rotary motors so far), torque of 0.655 mN m, and power of 34.7 mW with optimized transmission parameters. To demonstrate the motor's practical application, an off‐the‐shelf air vehicle propeller is driven by the motor, and a lift of 26 mN (1.54 times the DEA membrane's own weight) is obtained. An underwater robot driven by a water propeller is designed and a high speed of 175 mm s −1 (1.58 bl s −1 ) is obtained.

Herein, an aerial–aquatic hitchhiking robot is proposed that can fly, swim, and rapidly cross the air–water boundaries (0.16 s) and autonomously attach to surfaces in both air and water. Inspired by the mechanoreceptors of the remora ( Echeneis naucrates ) disc, the robot's hitchhiking device is equipped with two flexible bioinspired tactile sensors (FBTS) based on a triboelectric nanogenerator for tactile sensing of attachment status. Based on tactile sensing, the robot can perform reattachment after leakage or adhesion failure, enabling it to achieve long‐term adhesion on complex surfaces. The rotor‐based aerial–aquatic robot, which has two thrust vectoring units for underwater locomotion, can maneuver to pitch, yaw, and roll 360° and control precision motion position. The field tests show that the robot can continuously cross the air–water boundary, attach to the rough stone surface, and record video in both air and underwater. This study may shed light on future autonomous robots capable of intelligent navigation, adhesion, and operation in complex aerial–aquatic environments.",

Many researchers have attempted to solve this problem by introducing deep reinforcement learning, which trains agents through interaction with their environments. A method called BOAE‐DDPG, which combines the novel bidirectional obstacle avoidance enhancement (BOAE) mechanism with the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, is proposed to enhance the learning ability of obstacle avoidance. Inspired by the analysis of the reaction advantage in dynamic psychology, the BOAE mechanism focuses on obstacle‐avoidance reactions from the state and action. The cross‐attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance the attention to valuable obstacle‐avoidance information. Meanwhile, the obstacle‐avoidance behavioral advantage is separately estimated using the modified dueling network. Based on the learning goals of the mobile robot, new assistive reward factors are incorporated into the reward function to promote learning and convergence. The proposed method is validated through several experiments conducted using the simulation platform Gazebo. The results show that the proposed method is suitable for path planning tasks in unknown environments and has an excellent obstacle‐avoidance learning capability.",

However, they are still predominantly manufactured using silicones and acrylic elastomers, which pose environmental risks due to their limited biodegradability. To tackle this issue, a method for manufacturing water‐resistant, liquid‐driven soft actuators made from a novel type of konjac glucomannan (KGM) is presented, which is plant‐derived, insoluble, and edible. The material offers impressive stretchability, reaching up to 67.2% of its initial length, surpassing previous related work, and withstands over a 1000 cycles of tensile stress. Using this material, we develop soft actuators that can bend up to 47.1°, and the maximum blocking force of 0.1 N is achieved with a pressure input of 20 kPa. A gripper that is capable of grasping various objects underwater is also evaluated. In essence, this article introduces a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional soft robotic materials, paving the way for innovative and eco‐conscious underwater applications. The utilization of edible, water‐resistant materials like konjac provides a promising solution to reduce pollution and mitigate negative environmental impacts associated with traditional underwater soft robots.",

Among these creatures adept at burrowing, the mole stands out due to its exceptional body structure and unparalleled efficiency, surpassing most engineering burrowing systems. Consequently, the mole serves as an ideal model for designing highly efficient burrowing robots. This study introduces a mole‐inspired robot burrowing with forelimbs, specifically designed for planetary soil exploration. By closely examining the distinctive body morphology of moles, a forelimb burrowing mechanism is devised through biomimetic mapping, and its kinematics is thoroughly analyzed. A robot prototype is developed and an experimental setup is constructed to evaluate its burrowing performance. A series of tests are conducted to assess the capabilities of the robot, including forelimb burrowing, robot crawling, and robot burrowing. The results demonstrate that the proposed mole‐inspired burrowing robot is capable of crawling and burrowing to a certain depth using its forelimbs. Although it exhibits some upward displacement, this issue can be mitigated by modifying the head configuration and adjusting the forelimb posture to effectively overcome the vertical stress and lift force exerted by granular soils due to intensity gradient.",

Herein, inspired by the Twisted Tower origami structure, dielectrophoretic liquid zipping actuation concept is employed to develop a modular architecture, capable of achieving complicated motions with multiple degrees of freedom (DoF). The experimental results show a maximum of 3.9 degrees tilting per layer toward any desired direction, a 56.1% contraction of the original length, and 5.4 degrees twisting per layer.

Herein, surface curvature is explored as a design modality and a deep learning framework is presented to produce topologies with as‐desired curvature profiles. The inverse design framework can generalize to diverse topological features such as tubular, membranous, and particulate features. Moreover, successful generalization beyond both the design and data space is demonstrated by inverse designing topologies that mimic the curvature profile of trabecular bone, spinodoid topologies, and periodic nodal surfaces for application in bio‐scaffolds and implants. Lastly, curvature and mechanics are bridged by showing how topological curvature can be designed to promote mechanically beneficial stretching‐dominated deformation over bending‐dominated deformation.",

A significant enhancement in the memristor's on/off ratio, surpassing 10 3 , achieved by integrating both an overshoot suppression layer (OSL) and an ultra‐thin AlN oxygen barrier layer (OBL) is also reported. The concurrent insertion of an AlO x OSL is essential for manifesting the self‐compliance attribute in 4F 2 memristor arrays. Evaluations of a 24 × 24 array embedded with OSL and OBL reveal a substantial reduction in retention variation. In terms of functionality, a 7.13‐fold decline in vector‐matrix multiplication error is observed, accentuating the potential of this approach for neural network synapse applications. The analog reset characteristics of the OBL memristor facilitate over 25 multilevel states. Furthermore, the adoption of nonnegative weights presents an avenue to potentially double synaptic integration density.

In particular, when integrated with neuromorphic sensors, they can be used to produce intelligent systems for a broad range of applications. An event‐based camera is such a neuromorphic sensor, inspired by the sparse and asynchronous spike representation of the biological visual system. However, processing the event data requires either using expensive feature descriptors to transform spikes into frames, or using spiking neural networks (SNNs) that are expensive to train. In this work, a neural network architecture is proposed, reservoir nodes‐enabled neuromorphic vision sensing network (RN‐Net), based on dynamic temporal encoding by on‐sensor reservoirs and simple deep neural network (DNN) blocks. The reservoir nodes enable efficient temporal processing of asynchronous events by leveraging the native dynamics of the node devices, while the DNN blocks enable spatial feature processing. Combining these blocks in a hierarchical structure, the RN‐Net offers efficient processing for both local and global spatiotemporal features. RN‐Net executes dynamic vision tasks created by event‐based cameras at the highest accuracy reported to date at one order of magnitude smaller network size.

    "abstract": "Switchable surface adhesion at a small scale is crucial for robot end‐effector design, allowing the manipulation of small objects such as semiconductors, optical lenses, and precision mechanical parts. In this work, a detailed characterization of a millimeter‐scale (1–5 mm) adhesion modulation method is performed, demonstrating its effectiveness for switching adhesion on small, lightweight objects with smooth surfaces. This modulation phenomenon arises from the viscoelastic behavior when PDMS interacts with a rigid surface and is controlled via microvibration. A maximum apparent adhesion enhancement of 2400% and a reduction of 50% are achieved with a 1 mm‐diameter PDMS hemisphere vibrating at a 30 μm amplitude and a 700 Hz frequency. The effects of different parameters, including size, actuation amplitude/frequency, surface roughness, and material properties, on adhesion performance are carefully measured and analyzed. A monotonic increase in maximum adhesion is observed with increased device size and surface smoothness, while nonlinear relationships of other factors are generalized with a numerical model. A long working lifespan and high endurance are also observed during the characterization. This work serves as a practical reference for the further design of small‐scale soft grippers, highlighting its continuous, large modulation range, simple structure, and flexible control.",

Mechanochromic materials, acting as lightweight sensors, offer easily interpretable visual feedback for localized stress detection, structural health monitoring, and energy‐efficient robotic skins. Herein, an innovative mechanochromic soft end‐effector capable of discerning local contact stresses during mechanical interactions with objects is presented and their relative position is ascertained. This system utilizes a reversible force‐induced color switch in a thin layer of spiropyran‐functionalized polydimethylsiloxane, which coats a silicone‐made suction cup. The mechanochromic suction cup is integrated with a 3D‐printed compact load‐transferring system and electronic color‐changing detection elements. The assembly may serve as a synthetic receptor for robotic actuators, discerning localized interaction forces down to 3 N. The system's resilience to varying environmental factors, including illumination, tilting, and interaction with objects of various shapes is verified. The results indicate potential for exteroceptive solutions in reconfigurable manipulation tasks without compromising the overall softness of the manipulator.",

Early and accurate diagnosis of glioma subtypes is essential, but manual categorization is challenging due to their complexity, prompting the need for automated solutions. We developed an innovative mixed convolution‐transformer model to classify glioma subtypes, including astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, and normal brain tissue, using whole slide images. The novelty of this model lies in its remarkable efficiency and precise results. Multiple advanced and complex layers are incorporated during its development to enhance its performance, ensuring that it delivers fast and accurate classification results for glioma. This proposed model obtains an overall training accuracy of 97.41%, peaking at 98.12% for validation and 97.35% for testing. Next, our model architecture is independently evaluated by comparing its training performances on the CIFAR‐10 and CIFAR‐100 datasets with the vision transformer and compact convolutional transformer models. Results across various datasets demonstrate that the model consistently outperforms existing models. This performance underscores the effectiveness of our proposed approach in classifying glioma subtypes accurately and efficiently, highlighting its potential impact on healthcare and disability.

Gate‐last processed FDSOI MOSFET with a high‐k/metal gate stack features a memory window of 10 3 . Synaptic conductance is stably regulated by utilizing the FDSOI MOSFET, which offers the advantage of mitigating leakage current when compared to bulk Si MOSFET. Short‐ and long‐term plasticity are investigated by applying engineered pulse, verifying the long‐term synaptic properties of pattern recognition processes. With controllable synaptic conductance, the trade‐off between conductance change and linearity regarding the recognition rate is evaluated, attaining a recognition rate of 0.83. To verify the pre‐ and post‐synaptic weights within a real hardware‐based neuromorphic system, 5 × 6 FDSOI field‐effect transistor (FET) synapse array is interconnected to 10 × 10 leaky integrate‐and‐fire (LIF) neuron array. The synaptic plasticity of FDSOI MOSFET in post‐neurons following neuron firing in the neuron device is successfully demonstrated. These results indicate that FDSOI MOSFET devices could be applicable as synapse devices due to controllability and capability to realize signal transmissions and self‐learning processes simultaneously and used to mimic a synapse neuron network system by configuring a hardware system interconnected with the LIF neuron.",

    "abstract": "A bistable mechanism has two stable states with energy input required to move from one stable state to another. This energy barrier allows for energy storage and release which can be used to improve systems characteristics. Bistability has been used to increase the frequency range over which a kinetic energy harvester is effective, and it has been proposed that bistability can increase the efficiency of biomimetic swimming robots. However, experiments involving bistable swimming robots have typically used bistability as a means of overcoming limitations inherent to soft actuators, rather than to increase overall performance. This article implements bistability into a swimming robotic and compares performance with and without bistable action. The static thrust generation and power consumption for bistable and nonbistable configurations for five different tail morphologies are compared. Bistability is generally found to increase the system efficiency, particularly at lower frequencies where increases are observed up to 250%. The untethered swimming speed of the robot in open water is also found to increase by approximately 30%. The results show that bistability can offer direct performance benefits for biomimetic swimming, but that the bistable transmission must be well tuned to the dynamics of the rest of the system.",

This study introduces a novel approach to soft robotic assistive devices using untethered, soft actuators with seamlessly integrated sensing, heating, and actuation properties through digital machine knitting and low‐boiling liquid. The proposed soft actuator operates under a voltage of less than 12.5 V, generating a tip force of up to 50 mN. This actuator achieves a bending motion when filled with 2 mL of low‐boiling liquid and supplied with 15 W. The dynamic response of the actuator is examined under consistent parameters, revealing a 60‐second inflation time and a subsequent natural cooling period of 30 s at room temperature. Notably, over 12 cycles, the tip force of the actuator exhibits minimal variation, highlighting its durability for prolonged usage. The proposed approach paves the way for overcoming the limitations of existing technologies, particularly in terms of motion assistance and rehabilitation applications, with an emphasis on at‐home usage during daily activities.",

Data‐driven ML models are considerably more useful if more chemically interpretable descriptors are used to train them, as long as these models also accurately recapitulate the properties of materials in training and test sets used to generate and validate the models. Herein, how a particular type of molecular fragment descriptor, the signature descriptor, achieves these joint aims of accuracy and interpretability is described. Seven different types of materials properties are modeled, and the performance of models generated from signature descriptors is compared with those generated by widely used Dragon descriptors. The key descriptors in the model represent functionalities that make chemical sense. Mapping these fragments back on to exemplar materials provides a useful guide to chemists wishing to modify promising lead materials to improve their properties.

Herein, for the first time, by combining atomic electron tomography with an artificially intelligent “deepfake” neural network, this work demonstrates that the resolution of 3D imaging can be improved down to 0.71 Å, which is a record high resolution achieved by electron tomography.

    "abstract": "Memristive stateful logic enables energy‐ and cost‐efficient in‐memory computing, which is desirable for edge computing in the coming Internet of Things (IoT) era. Researchers have recently developed various stateful logic gates and have shown viable computing applications based on ideal memristive characteristics. However, few studies have demonstrated a system‐level in‐memory computing operation that can address the practical issues affecting device realization. Herein, a practically viable stateful logic device based on a 1‐transistor−1‐memristor (1T1M) array structure is proposed, considering the inherently stochastic memristor characteristics. Details on how to select the viable stateful logic gates in a given memristor are shown, and as an example of logic cascading, they are implemented in a device to operate a multibit carry look‐ahead adder. Then, an in‐memory computing layout that can perform all of the computing functions—data storing, transferring, and executing—inside the memory, addressing data traffic issues, is suggested. Finally, a software/hardware mixed stateful logic emulator that can virtually mimic array‐level in‐memory computing hardware based on cell‐level memristive characteristics is demonstrated.",

Herein, a method to produce large‐area carbon nanotube–LCE nanocomposite films with exceptional electrostrictive properties is examined. A methodology to produce telechelic precursor oligomeric composites at scale (&gt;100 g) is presented along with the continuous casting and photocuring process. The carbon nanotubes are well‐aligned and well‐dispersed in the films, which exhibit exceptional anisotropic thermomechanical, optical, and thermal shape change characteristics. When an electric field is applied through the film thickness, the material quickly and reversibly contracts along the alignment direction. As an example, a compliant carbon nanotube–LCE film contracts &gt;4% against a 140 kPa load, roughly comparable to the blocking force of many natural muscular tissues. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this tunable contraction is dependent upon the electric field strength, and that the contraction mimics the form function of the input electric field (e.g., a sine wave). These compliant actuators are excellent candidates for incorporation into soft and/or biological systems.",

While they are low cost and easy to manufacture, they are difficult to control due to their typical reliance on external pressure sources that become bulky as more degrees of freedom are introduced to the robot. Various techniques from microfluidics and fluid logic are used to introduce valves into soft robots to increase their autonomy, although this has frequently introduced unwanted rigidity. Herein, a magnetorheological (MR) fluid valve that uses magnetic fields to control the pressure within a continuous‐flow fluidic actuator is introduced. A predictive model for the pressure drop in such a flow is presented and validated experimentally. Guidelines for the design of single‐ and multiactuator systems with a single inlet and outlet are presented. The introduction of actuation methods that simplify fluidic control via the application of magnetic fields leads to robots capable of increased autonomy in a scalable and compliant format.",

Herein, a strategy for the design of smart microjoints (SMJs) that undergo controllable active deformation by triggering a size‐dependent layer‐by‐layer sequential swelling effect on SMJs in response to external stimuli is developed. The optimal encoding of SMJs that enables microcrawlers to achieve superior crawling speed (0.15 body length s −1 ) and efficiency (1.1 body length per step), as well as controllable locomotion, is demonstrated, e.g., migration along/against the stimuli source or along a preplanned path.

Among them, several generations of tissue‐engineered biohybrid walkers have been established as reliable platforms to study untethered locomotion. However, despite these advances, such technology is not mature yet, and major challenges remain. Herein, steps are taken to address two of them: the lack of systematic design approaches, common to biohybrid robotics in general, and in the case of biohybrid walkers specifically, the lack of maneuverability. A dual‐ring biobot is presented which is computationally designed and selected to exhibit robust forward motion and rotational steering. This dual‐ring biobot consists of two independent muscle actuators and a four‐legged scaffold asymmetric in the fore/aft direction. The integration of multiple muscles within its body architecture, combined with differential electrical stimulation, allows the robot to maneuver. The dual‐ring robot design is then fabricated and experimentally tested, confirming computational predictions and turning abilities. Overall, a design approach based on modeling, simulation, and fabrication exemplified in this versatile robot represents a route to efficiently engineer complex biological machines with adaptive functionalities.",

The conventional diagnostic methods are often less efficient in specificity and accuracy, leading to quite a few unnecessary biopsies. This work establishes a noninvasive diagnostic method for PCa by investigating urine samples using Raman spectroscopy and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. The results of urine Raman spectra show the intensities of characteristic peaks for lipids, nucleic acids, and some amino acids are distinguishable between PCa and BPH, suggesting an abnormal metabolism caused by PCa, which can be detected by Raman spectroscopy. These data are then used to train an intelligent diagnostic model with CNN algorithm. The cross‐validation results show the mean diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for PCa are 74.95%, 77.32%, and 72.46%, respectively. This noninvasive diagnostic method is a promising method for the early diagnosis of PCa, and the idea of using urine Raman spectroscopy with deep learning techniques for diagnosing PCa provides a reference for the application of artificial intelligence in the field of clinical medicine research.",

Multifunctional electronic skin (e‐skin) sensors can be an ideal candidate to bridge the gaps among humans, robots, and the environment. Mutual interference of multistimuli and unconformable spatial distribution impedes the application of e‐skin sensors. Hence, a large‐area, hand‐covering elastomeric e‐skin sensor is proposed to imitate the human hand for multifunctional detection. Five multifunctional sensing units are designed on the fingertips, and 15 pressure‐sensing units are distributed on the finger phalanxes and palm to cover the main sensory area of the hand. A multilayer architecture is designed to improve the sensing performances and reduce the coupling interference during multifunctional detection. The e‐skin sensor exhibits similarity to the human hand not only in shape but also in functionality, possessing pressure sensitivity of 0.025 V kPa −1 in 0.1–120 kPa and temperature sensitivity of 0.38% °C −1 in 20–70 °C. The performance of the e‐skin sensor can meet the requirements of daily manipulations. Experimental studies on grasping objects with different grasping modes and object properties demonstrate the potential applications of the e‐skin sensor for grasping haptic perception and human–robot interactions.",

    "abstract": "Perching in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers the possibility of extending the range of aerial robots beyond the limits of their batteries. It has been a topic of intense study for multirotor UAVs. Perching in winged UAVs is harder because a kinetic energy balance has to be struck. Reducing too much energy results in the vehicle stalling and falling. Too much kinetic energy at touchdown could damage the vehicle. Most studies used dangerous pitch‐up maneuvers to manage this balance. This work presents a system that eliminates the pitch‐up maneuver by mechanically capturing and storing kinetic energy at impact. It is validated using a passive mechanical system consisting of a storage mechanism for energy recuperation and a claw for perching on a horizontal rod. The energy stored in the mechanism is then used to unperch. The mathematical model for the recuperation strategy is presented and perching success at various approach attitudes are characterized. The proof‐of‐concept claw recaptures 5% of the kinetic energy during perching. Experiments indicate that the device can successfully perch at a wide range of yaw angles, but requires more precision in roll. We show that our perching mechanism enables the fastest UAV perching to date (7.4 m s −1 ).",

Thermoresponsive hydrogels, such as poly( N ‐isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM), typically have slow response rates and exert comparably weak forces, which usually limit their use as artificial muscles. Herein, it is shown that the incorporation of interconnected microchannels into the pNIPAM hydrogel by a template‐assisted approach leads to a significant increase in both the response rate and the volume change. For a microchannel density of only 5 vol%, a volume reduction of 90% is achieved, compared with only 12% for the bulk material, while material stiffness of the swollen hydrogels remains unchanged. By tailoring the channel density and the stiffness of the material, it is further possible to adjust the response rate and the exerted stroke force in an actuation setting. It is shown in a demonstrator gripper setup driven by the pNIPAM‐based artificial muscle that the performance of the gripper is strongly improved by the microengineered material compared with conventional bulk pNIPAM. The strategy of incorporating microchannels into the pNIPAM hydrogel provides a practical approach for the future use of volume phase transition‐based responsive materials in soft robotic applications.",

Simulating this function is of great significance to developing bioinspired electronic skins and humanoid robots, which thus creates more demands for electronic devices that can simulate thermal nociception. Herein, an artificial thermal nociceptor (ATN) is fabricated by integrating a temperature sensor and a synaptic transistor, which can simulate the thermal pain threshold of the human body and operates in a very similar way as the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). For this ATN, the function of temperature sensing is realized by a graphite–polydimethylsiloxane (Gr–PDMS) composite temperature sensor, and the synaptic functions, as well as nociceptor features, are emulated through a synaptic transistor using xanthan gum polysaccharide electrolyte as gate dielectric, providing energy‐efficient building blocks for brain‐inspired computation systems. In a word, the ATN proposed can help to open a new avenue and provides more possibilities in the design of artificial sensory systems with the functions of temperature perception and thermal feedback.",

Flow‐driven microcatheters are capable of rapidly and safely navigating small arteries with complex anatomy. However, their navigation relies on proper perfusion, which is an important bottleneck in the treatment of pathologies that cause impaired flow conditions. This work introduces the first endovascular sensor‐integrated soft robotic device that navigates sub‐millimeter arteries by extracting propulsive power from external magnetic fields. To this end, a number of innovations are described in the design, actuation, and control of flexible magnetic structures. The device is capable of advancing inside vasculature in an automated fashion using an open‐loop control scheme. Onboard sensors enable the real‐time monitoring of flow conditions, and autonomous switching between different modes of locomotion.

    "abstract": "Ferroelectric Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO) thin films have attracted wide attention in terms of potential applications of nonvolatile ferroelectric memories. However, the effect of strain on the resistance switching characteristics of the ferroelectric HZO thin‐film memristors has not been fully studied so far. In this work, the strain effects on the HZO thin‐film memristors are investigated. HZO films with different resistance properties are also prepared by controlling the value of oxygen pressure. Based on the testing results, it is proposed that the resistance switching behavior of HZO films may be caused by the joint participation between ferroelectricity and oxygen vacancy migration. The study also found that HZO films can successfully simulate learning behavior similar to the human brain. The applied pulses with a width of tens of nanoseconds timescale are beneficial to realize fast learning and computing. These results provide a fundamental and deep insight on HZO‐based ferroelectric semiconductor oxide thin‐film memristors and their potential applications in next‐generation artificial electronic synaptic devices.",

Magnetic materials, as the key components of MagRobots, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo to induce tissue/organ damage through Fenton/Fenton‐like reactions, which may hinder the clinical application of MagRobots. Here, the biologically active Prussian blue is generated on the surfaces of MagRobots via an in situ reaction to obtain magnetically actuated ROS‐scavenging nano‐robots (ROSrobots). The generated Prussian blue blocks ROS production and endows the MagRobots with additional functionalities, markedly expanding their potential medical applications. Under the action of a magnetic field, the reconfigurable ROSrobots realize multimode transformation, locomotion, and manipulation in complex environments. Importantly, a simple control method is proposed to achieve movement in 3D geometries to allow the completion of tasks in a complex environment. Furthermore, the osteoarthritis (OA) rat model was employed for proof of concept. Notably, under the guidance of ultrasound imaging, ROSrobots can be accurately injected into the articular cavity to actively target the treatment of OA. This research may further promote the clinical application of MagRobots.",

By IMC, matrix‐vector multiplication (MVM) can be executed in the crosspoint array in just one step, thus accelerating a broad range of tasks in machine learning and data analytics. However, a key issue for RRAM crosspoint arrays is the forming operation of the memories which limits the stability and accuracy of the conductance state in the memory device. In this work, a hardware implementation of crosspoint array of forming‐free devices for fast, energy‐efficient accelerators of MVM is reported. RRAM devices with a 1.5 nm‐thick HfO 2 layer show an initial low resistance without forming and an analogue‐mode programming behavior for high‐accuracy IMC. Accurate hardware MVM is demonstrated by experimental eigenvalue/eigenvector calculation according to the power‐iteration algorithm, with a fast convergence within about ten iterations to the correct solution. Deflation technique and principal component analysis (PCA) enable the classification of the Iris dataset with 98% accuracy compared with floating‐point implementation.

Inspired by the biological perception, achieving this goal through spatiotemporal processing is viable. But some challenges, such as continuous signal coding resulting in high‐energy consumption, are yet to be solved, hindering the realization of human perception emulation. Herein, a perceptual simulation enabled by spike‐based spatiotemporal processing is demonstrated, which is analogous to the biological behavior, through an NbO x ‐based oscillation neuron. The time difference between distinct inputs has a notable impact on the output spiking activity of oscillation neuron. On the basis of these features, the temporal‐related perceptions, for example, direction selectivity and sound localization are closely imitated. Unambiguous differentiation of direction or azimuth is enabled according to the output spiking numbers of oscillation neuron. Furthermore, by combining the oscillation neuron with a spiking neural network, azimuth recognition is conceptually established to mimic the human's response to auditory stimuli. Herein, the feasibility of employing spike‐based spatiotemporal processing of oscillation neurons to emulate sensory functionality, paving a highly potential way for realizing energy‐efficient artificial sensory systems, is proved.",

Therefore, there is great interest in industry to improve the characteristic gripping, holding, and releasing methods involved in pick‐and‐place operations. Within living organisms such as octopi, nature demonstrates that multiple types of conjointly working actuators are required for flexible pick‐and‐place operations. Herein, a multifunctional soft robotic arm is developed, capable of transporting an object within 3D space. The soft robotic arm consists of two structural actuators (rotating base and lifting unit) and a suction cup‐based gripper. The structural actuator acts as both the load bearing and actuating components of the robotic system. Yet, the gripper is the crucial innovation within the robotic arm. A cephalopod‐limb‐inspired gripper functioning through the reversible flat‐to‐conical deformation of azimuthally aligned liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) films is proposed. The pressure‐generating actuation mechanism of the gripper means that no external device is needed to operate the gripping function. Akin to natural systems, the in‐tandem operation of the actuators in the soft robotic arm allows for multifactored tasks. Yet, the design achieves this through the use of a single material, which is not innate in natural archetypes.",

    "abstract": "In analog in‐memory computing systems based on nonvolatile memories such as resistive random‐access memory (RRAM), neural network models are often trained offline and then the weights are programmed onto memory devices as conductance values. The programmed weight values inevitably deviate from the target values during the programming process. This effect can be pronounced for emerging memories such as RRAM, PcRAM, and MRAM due to the stochastic nature during programming. Unlike noise, these weight deviations do not change during inference. The performance of neural network models is investigated against this programming variation under realistic system limitations, including limited device on/off ratios, memory array size, analog‐to‐digital converter (ADC) characteristics, and signed weight representations. Approaches to mitigate such device and circuit nonidealities through architecture‐aware training are also evaluated. The effectiveness of variation injection during training to improve the inference robustness, as well as the effects of different neural network training parameters such as learning rate schedule, will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Many species can dynamically alter their skin textures to enhance their motility and survivability. Despite the enormous efforts on designing bio‐inspired materials with tunable surface textures, developing spatiotemporally programmable and reconfigurable textural morphing without complex control remains challenging. Herein, a design strategy is proposed to achieve surfaces with such properties. The surfaces comprise an array of unit cells with broadly tailored temporal responses. By arranging the unit cells differently, the surfaces can exhibit various spatiotemporal responses, which can be easily reconfigured by disassembling and rearranging the unit cells. Specifically, viscoelastic shells as the unit cells is adopted, which can be pneumatically actuated to a concave state, and recover the initial convex state sometime after the load is removed. It is shown computationally and experimentally that the recovery time can be widely tuned by the geometry and material viscoelasticity of the shells. By assembling such shells with different recovery times, surfaces with pre‐programmed spatiotemporal textural morphing under simple pneumatic actuation is built, and temporal evolution of patterns, such as digit numbers and emoji, and spatiotemporal control of friction are demonstrated. This work opens up new avenues in designing spatiotemporal morphing surfaces that could be employed for programming mechanical, optical, and electrical properties.

A majority of real‐world soft robots rely on a quasistatic control approach, without taking dynamic characteristics into consideration. As a result, robots with this restriction move slowly and are not able to adequately deal with forces, such as handling unexpected perturbations or manipulating objects. A dynamic approach to control and modeling would allow soft robots to move faster and handle external forces more efficiently. In previous studies, different aspects of modeling, dynamic control, and physical implementation have been examined separately, while their combination has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Herein, the accuracy of the dynamic model of the multisegment continuum robot is improved by adding new elements that include variable stiffness and actuation behavior. Then, this improved model is integrated with state‐of‐the‐art system identification and dynamic task space control and experiments are performed to validate this combination on a real‐world manipulator. As a means of encouraging future research on dynamic control for soft robotic manipulators, the source code is made available for modeling, control, and system identification, along with the recipes for fabricating the manipulator.",

Soft universal grippers take full advantage of this adaptability, facilitating effective and safe grasping of various objects. However, due to their predominantly soft material composition, these grippers have limited lifetimes, especially when operating in unstructured and unfamiliar environments. The self‐healing universal gripper (SHUG) is proposed, which can grasp various objects and recover from substantial realistic damages autonomously. It integrates damage detection, heat‐assisted healing, and healing evaluation. Notably, unlike other universal grippers, the entire SHUG can be fully reprocessed and recycled. The gripper's functionality relies on the particle jamming of steel balls enclosed within a self‐healing membrane. Thanks to the thermoreversible covalent Diels–Alder bonds in self‐healing polymer membrane, the gripper is able to recover from macroscopic damages including scratches and punctures. Temperature‐assisted healing is regulated in a closed‐loop manner using an embedded thermocouple and Joule heater. Experimental validation demonstrates the adaptability, resilience, and recyclability of the SHUG.",

Currently, logic gates can be constructed with mechanical metamaterials, but this may require complex architectures and computing rules, and more complex computations based on these gates are considerably more challenging. Mechanical computing systems with multistability cannot return to their initial stable states, which are hardly reused. Moreover, providing digital electrical outputs is useful to communicate with electrical systems. To address these issues, mechanical metamaterials can be integrated in a manner that is similar to a circuit network with a powerful computing capability. Herein, a general method that combines soft convex and concave modules, rigid frames, and conductive materials in one system to realize logic gates, addition, and multiplication is proposed. The soft modules make or break electrical connections with adjacent frames due to the presence or absence of compressive forces, operating as open and closed switches. Connections and disconnections between modules and frames can be demonstrated with conductive materials and LEDs. The proposed mechanism is simple, versatile, and reusable, allowing soft mechanical metamaterial units to carry out complex computations.

    "abstract": "The use of smartphone‐based analysis systems has been increasing over the past few decades. Among the important reasons for its popularity are its ubiquity, increasing computing power, relatively low cost, and capability to acquire and process data simultaneously in a point‐of‐need fashion. Furthermore, smartphones are equipped with various sensors, especially a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) sensor. The high sensitivity of the CMOS sensor allows smartphones to be used as a colorimeter, fluorimeter, and spectrometer, constituting the essential part of point‐of‐care testing contributing to E‐health and beyond. However, despite its myriads of merits, smartphone‐based diagnostic devices still face many challenges, including high susceptibility to illumination conditions, difficulty in adapter uniformization, low interphone repeatability, and et al. These problems may hinder smartphone‐enabled diagnosis from passing the FDA regulations of medical devices. This review discusses the design and application of current smartphone‐based diagnostic devices and highlights challenges associated with existent methods and perspectives on how to deal with those challenges from engineering aspects on constant color signal acquisition, including smartphone adapter design, color space transformation, machine learning classification, and color correction.",

    "abstract": "Continuum manipulators have found several applications in surgical interventions like endoscopy, laparoscopy, and as end‐effectors for surgical robots. Continuum manipulators coupled with magnetic actuation can be precisely maneuvered inside the human body. Recently, variable stiffness manipulators (VSMs) have been introduced for enhanced dexterity and safe navigation. This study presents a new design of a magnetically actuated VSM based on shape memory polymer (SMP) springs. The VSM has a silicone backbone enclosed within a spring made of SMP that can change in length with stiffness change that is triggered by Joule heating. The stiffness and thermal characteristics of the VSM are studied using analytical models and experiments. Subsequently, a one‐segment VSM and a two‐segment VSM having outer diameters of 9 and 10 mm and lengths of 15 and 25 mm, respectively, capable of extending to four times their length are designed. The VSM can be deployed in a compact form and extended to achieve variable bending curvatures in soft and rigid states, which can facilitate instrument insertion and reduce operation invasiveness. Potential clinical applications are demonstrated by incorporating miniature camera, biopsy tool, and laser optical fiber in the working channel of the VSM and coupled with robotic magnetic actuation.",

There are two main challenges when conducting a DL‐based XRD analysis: generating realistic XRD data including all possible perturbations, such as peak shift, broadening, texture, and noisy background, and generalizing the DL model applicability to all ICSD entries. To address both the perturbation and generalizability issues, a large‐scale computation is required because it would be infeasible with typical lab‐scale computation. Cloud computing infrastructures are leveraged for parallel computations and to obtain symmetry classification test accuracies of 98.95%, 97.18%, and 96.03% for the crystal system, extinction group, and space group, respectively. A stricter individual compound‐based train and test dataset‐splitting scheme also produces reasonable test accuracies of 92.25%, 87.34%, and 84.39%, which are still state‐of‐the‐art records. Crucially, the DL model trained on synthetic data is assessed using real‐world experimental XRD datasets to ensure its practical applicability. When tested on the real‐world experimental XRD dataset, the model achieves a test accuracy of 90.38% in predicting crystal systems.",

Herein, the performance of surface microrollers, with diameters between 5 and 50 μm, inside vessels of the systemic circulation including veins, venules, capillaries, arterioles, and arteries is investigated with computational fluid dynamics simulations. The simulation environment consists of a simplified fluid with the viscosity and density of blood, without red blood cells, in a cylindrical pipe. The microrollers demonstrate successful upstream locomotion ability in veins and partially in arteries but fail to perform in smaller blood vessels due to significant confinement and flow effects.

An untethered robot is presented, inspired by biological diggers like sea turtles, which utilize underactuated appendages to enable propulsion and obstacle sensing in granular environments. To guide the robot's design, experiments are conducted on test appendages to identify the morphological and actuation parameters for forward thrust generation. Obstacle sensing is observed in granular media by measuring the increased force on the moving appendage caused by changes in the granular flow around it. These results are integrated into an untethered robot capable of subsurface locomotion in a controlled granular bed like natural, loosely packed sand. The robot achieves subsurface “swimming” at a speed of 1.2 mm s −1 , at a depth of 127 mm, faster than any other reported untethered robot at this depth, while also detecting obstacles during locomotion via force sensors embedded in the appendages. Finally, subsurface robot locomotion in natural sand at the beach is demonstrated, a feat no other robot has accomplished, showcasing how underactuated structures enable movement and sensing in granular environments with limited limb control.",

Herein, an e‐skin tactile‐sensing system is presented, based on resistive pressure‐sensing units (serving as Meissner corpuscles) unevenly distributed on a bionic hand‐shaped polyimide substrate, which can realize shape and texture recognitions concurrently. A multilayer microporous structure with different pores is designed and introduced into the sensor, which enables each sensing unit ultrahigh sensitivity and a wide detection range. Meanwhile, a customized micro‐pyramid array is developed and assembled to the sensor array, which realizes the transformation from tangential force to normal force. With the help of artificial intelligence technology, the recognition accuracy reaches 100% for 8 different shapes, and 99.7% for 10 different textures, respectively.

The tactile sensor consists of a 4 × 4 matrix 3‐axis force sensor array (with spacings of 2 mm) and a single‐temperature sensor. The tactile sensor uses inorganic silicon and gold as materials for the detection of strain and temperature and a polymer‐based elastomer to encapsulate the sensing layer. The sensing module is equipped with a readout circuitry for signal processing. Within the measurable force range (≈1.5 N) of the sensor cell, a prototype module exhibits a repeatability error within 2%, a hysteresis error within 3%, and a resolution as small as 10 mN. Furthermore, each sensor cell independently measures 3‐axis forces with a cross‐talk error of approximately 3%. The temperature sensor exhibits linear output properties in the approximate range of 5–75 °C. Experiments are performed by mounting the module on a parallel gripper to grasp a paper cup and a reflex hammer toy. According to the experimental results, the sensor can accurately detect the state of contact with an object by analyzing three tactile modalities (i.e., 3‐axis force distribution, vibration, and temperature).",

Herein, a light‐induced bidirectional response is demonstrated in the proposed WSe 2 /MoS 2 junction field‐effect transistor (JFET) with an extra Ge back gate. The WSe 2 /MoS 2 JFET exhibits high responsivity and detectivity owing to effective modulation by the top junction and back dielectric gates. The unique bidirectional photoresponse and interfacial state storage properties of the device result in significant synaptic excitatory effects under visible light stimulation and remarkable synaptic inhibitory effects under infrared illumination. Optical storage with visible light and optical erasure with infrared light can be achieved in the device based on its synaptic behavior. The conductance changes under different types of illumination can be used to mimic the weight update in a neural network for image recognition. A high accuracy exceeding 98% was achieved in handwritten digit recognition.

Herein, a light‐responsive lampshade‐like smart material assembly as a new self‐oscillator model that is unfettered by the abovementioned challenges, is introduced. Liquid crystal elastomer with low phase transition temperature is used as the photomechanical component to provide twisting movement under low‐intensity incoherent light field.

The biological flow receptors, such as filiform hairs, lateral lines, and seal whiskers, are elegantly designed with interesting biomechanical processing principles for extreme sensitivity, exhibiting obvious morphological intelligence. For instance, superficial neuromasts on the surface of fish body have an elongated cupula to enhance flow detection with a magnified drag. The flow‐induced mechanical information is transferred to arrayed hair bundles in the neuromasts, which show spontaneous oscillation and mechanical coupling effects for a high mechanical sensitivity. In this review, the biomechanical principles of morphological intelligence in biological flow field receptors are discussed, with an emphasis on the functions of stimulus enhancement, noise reduction, and nonlinear oscillation. In addition, the recent achievements in flow sensors with morphological intelligence are summarized in this article. Though there is still a big gap in principle discovery and practical application of morphological intelligence in engineered sensors, it can be anticipated that the field of intelligent flow sensing will be significantly promoted by the establishment of morphological intelligence models.",

One emerging application is appending structures on existing ones that may have nonplanar surfaces in unconventional orientations.

Herein, the authors present a dexterous conformal material extrusion printing method using a six‐axis robotic arm capable of constructing complex parts onto highly unstructured surfaces with rough topographies. The manufacturing method employs a custom algorithm that generates layers consisting of 3D spatial coordinates of print path as well as the extrusion nozzle oriented in the normal direction of the substrate, thereby enabling conformal motion of the extrusion nozzle to the unstructured surface. The capabilities of the surface‐informed robotic conformal 3D printing method to fabricate structures on surfaces with a variety of topographies in unconventional orientations are demonstrated. Finally, via addition of deposited conductive paths, a high‐strength, functional reinforcement capable of in situ deformation monitoring is appended. This work has the potential for reconstructing, repairing, and reinforcing existing structures in human‐limited or inaccessible spaces.

Nevertheless, how to efficiently predict relaxed atomistic structures and the associated physical fields on each atom or bond under evolving mechanical deformations remains as an essential challenge. To address this issue, a deep neural network architecture is designed to embed the state of applied strains into the defect‐engineered atomistic geometry, so that deformation‐coupled physical fields of interests on atoms or bonds can be predicted or derived over continuous state of deformations. For demonstration, the combination of applied tensile strains and shear strain on monolayer graphene with random distribution of Stone–Wales defects and vacancy defects is considered. The unique advantage of this framework is the development of strain‐embedding concept combined with generative adversarial network, which can be feasibly extended to other material and other conditions.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has proven to be one of the most pivotal components of machine learning given its notable performance in a variety of application domains. Neural networks (NNs) for DL are tailored to specific application domains by varying in their topology and activation nodes. Nevertheless, the major operation type (with the largest computational complexity) is commonly multiply‐accumulate operation irrespective of their topology. Recent trends in DL highlight the evolution of NNs such that they become deeper and larger, and thus their prohibitive computational complexity. To cope with the consequent prohibitive latency for computation, 1) general‐purpose hardware, e.g., central processing units and graphics processing units, has been redesigned, and 2) various DL accelerators have been newly introduced, e.g., neural processing units, and computing‐in‐memory units for deep NN‐based DL, and neuromorphic processors for spiking NN‐based DL. In this review, these accelerators and their pros and cons are overviewed with particular focus on their performance and memory bandwidth.",

This article introduces a high‐performance millimeter scale crawling robot driven by a miniature electromagnetic linear actuator (MELA) with a body length of 5–6 mm and a mass of 80 mg. In this article, the working principle of the micro robot is analyzed and validated, and the influence of current, frequency, and angle α between the direction of actuator's force and the crawling surface on the crawling speed are analyzed through experiments. Results show that the optimal α ranges from 50° to 55°, and a specific current and frequency are identified to achieve maximum crawling speed for robot with particular α . When α is 50°, with a current of 300 mA and a frequency of 200 Hz, the robot reached the maximum speed of 20.2 Body Length s −1 (BL s −1 ). The proposed robot can crawl at 12 BL s −1 with a load of 110 mg, and support a maximum load of 400 mg. Additionally, the robot demonstrated diverse capabilities such as climbing on a 10° slope with a load of 110 mg, jumping on a 1 mm obstacle, and crawling on surfaces of various materials.",

A multiagent system composed of autonomous surface vehicles is proposed herein to efficiently monitor the water quality. To achieve a safe control of the fleet, the fleet policy should be able to act based on measurements and fleet state. It is proposed to use local Gaussian processes and deep reinforcement learning to jointly obtain effective monitoring policies. Local Gaussian processes, unlike classical global Gaussian processes, can accurately model the information in a dissimilar spatial correlation which captures more accurately the water quality information. A deep convolutional policy is proposed, that bases the decisions on the observation on the mean and variance of this model, by means of an information gain reward. Using a double deep Q‐learning algorithm, agents are trained to minimize the estimation error in a safe manner thanks to a Consensus‐based heuristic. Simulation results indicate an improvement of up to 24% in terms of the mean absolute error with the proposed models. Also, training results with 1–3 agents indicate that our proposed approach returns 20% and 24% smaller average estimation errors for, respectively, monitoring water quality variables and monitoring algae blooms, as compared to state‐of‐the‐art approaches.",

The proposed method uses a general design parameterization that works for multiple types of cylindrical origami patterns (Kresling, cylindrical Miura, Yoshimura, and Accordion).

This work introduces a new textile‐based pouch motors with the capacity for biaxial actuation and capacitive sensory functions, achieved through the application of computerized knitting technology using ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene yarn (Spectra) and conductive silver yarns. This method enables the rapid and scalable mass fabrication of robust pouch motors.

Finite element analysis closely matches the experimental data. The capacitance signals in relation to contraction motion are well suited for detecting air pressure levels and hold promise for applications requiring robotic control. Notably, it effectively elevates an ankle joint simulator at a 20° angle, highlighting its potential for applications such assisting individuals with foot drop.

However, challenges in integrating textile strain sensors into wearable sensing devices include the need for outstanding sensing performance, long‐term monitoring stability, and fast, convenient integration processes to achieve comprehensive monitoring. The scalable fabrication technique presented here addresses these challenges by incorporating customizable graphene‐based sensing networks into knitted structures, thus creating sensing sleeves for precise motion detection and differentiation. The performance and real‐world application potential of the sensing sleeve are evaluated by its precision in angle estimation and complex joint motion recognition during intra‐ and intersubject studies. For intra‐subject analysis, the sensing sleeve only exhibits a 2.34° angle error in five different knee activities among 20 participants, and the sensing sleeves show up to 94.1% and 96.1% accuracy in the gesture classification of knee and elbow, respectively. For inter‐subject analysis, the sensing sleeve demonstrates a 4.21° angle error, and it shows up to 79.9% and 85.5% accuracy in the gesture classification of knee and elbow, respectively. An activity‐guided user interface compatible with the sensing sleeves for human motion monitoring in home healthcare applications is presented to illustrate the potential applications.",

Soft capsule microrobots that integrate capabilities such as magnetic navigation, autonomous maneuverability, in situ biodegradation, biosafe imaging, and drug delivery are reported. These microrobots are fabricated within the range of 20–120 μm, with a notable throughput of ≈10 2 –10 3 microrobots per second.

The incorporation of ultrasound contrast agents not only amplifies imaging resolution but also ensures imaging contrast stability in a biological environment for over a period of 3 h. Second, the intentional integration of enzyme‐loaded nanometric polymersomes establishes a self‐contained, biodegradable system, accentuating the microrobots’ capacity to degrade without the addition of high enzyme concentrations.

Geometric parameters of the ETI route are measured, and design requirements of the robot are clarified based on medical images. Kinematic models which reflect the motion coupling of multisegment bending are derived. A prototype is designed and fabricated. Five bending phases of three segments are designed for kinematic validation, and results illustrate that the kinematic models present the same features with actual motions of the robotic stylet captured by optical tracking system. An airway model is built based on medical images and a simulated ETI experiment is conducted. Accomplishing this experiment, the design concept of the robotic stylet is approved, which is bending the tube by the multisegment continuum mechanism for guiding the ETI procedure.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of deep learning enables significant breakthroughs for intelligent edge‐terminal devices. However, neural network training for edge computing is currently overly dependent on cloud service platforms, resulting in low adaptivity for fast‐changing real‐world environments. The training energy efficiency is also strictly constrained by the traditional Von‐Neumann architecture with separate memory and processing units. To improve the adaptability and energy efficiency of edge‐terminal devices, a fully parallel online neural network training scheme based on electrochemical random‐access memory (ECRAM) arrays is proposed and validated. By exploiting the intrinsic linearity and nonlinearity functionalities of ECRAMs brought by varying numbers and amplitudes of programming pulses, a physical implementation of in situ multiplication using pulse‐based training is achieved, realizing fully parallel in situ computation and storage of outer product between two vectors. It can not only greatly accelerate the computation of weight gradients in neural network training but also significantly reduce the time complexity, latency, and energy overheads associated with data handling compared to traditional hardware implementations for this task. The ECRAM‐based online training system reduces the energy overhead of the training process by 30× when compared to the same training process executed on traditional computing hardware.",

Despite being underactuated, with lateral motion not directly controlled, this design reduces complexity and energy consumption. The coupling of rotors reduces angular momentum issues, enhancing stability and efficiency without the challenges associated with tilting each motor individually, which would require higher servo torque due to significant gyroscopic torques. PairTilt's tiltable rotors enable agile maneuvers in confined spaces and reduce drag in high‐speed flight, extending operational range. The system's dynamics are analyzed, and a cascaded controller is implemented to ensure stable flight across various scenarios. Simulations and real‐world tests validate its superior agility, compact hovering, sensor pointing, and energy efficiency compared to conventional quadcopters. The primary contribution of this work lies in PairTilt's distinctive design, which achieves a unique balance of simplicity, efficiency, and agility. This balance is made possible by the pairwise rotor coupling, which reduces complexity and gyroscopic torque effects, and the prioritization of key degrees of freedom. This design approach opens new possibilities for aerial robotics applications requiring both maneuverability and efficient high‐speed flight.",

    "abstract": "Human skin's touch perception, mediated by mechanoreceptors, can perceive tactile stimuli with a spatial resolution higher than the average spacing between mechanoreceptors, known as super‐resolution. This characteristic enables its sensitivity to both stimulus location and velocity. However, existing robotic tactile sensors lag behind human tactile perception, failing to achieve high spatial resolution and rapid response simultaneously. This significantly hinders robots from executing accurate, time‐sensitive interaction tasks, particularly during dynamic slight‐contact events. Here, a 130 μm‐thick flexible tactile sensor array is designed, with spatial resolution enhanced by a tailored deep learning model, multistage attention‐based adaptive spatial–temporal graph convolutional networks (MS‐AASTGCN), simultaneously achieving a dynamic response of ≈30 ms and a super‐resolution factor of 75.19. The tactile sensor array, based on single‐electrode triboelectric nanogenerators, can detect dynamic subtle stimuli. It features a bio‐inspired topological structure, facilitating super‐resolution performance while offering a large perception area with low sensor (taxel) density. Additionally, the MS‐AASTGCN enhances positioning resolution by extracting features fromsensing data and revealing the hidden relationships among taxels. This research provides new insights into haptic perception systems, enabling the execution of precise, time‐sensitive interaction tasks, such as tracking a bouncing table tennis ball.",

The gripper consists of pneumatically driven hierarchical adhesive modules (bio‐toe) with the capability of contact sensing, and rolling inward/outward module (rolling module). The bio‐toe manufactured using soft materials can safely and flexibly cater to curved and flat surfaces. The rolling module developed using four‐bar linkage mechanism allows the opposing bio‐toes to roll inward to enhance adhesion (adhesion forces up to 6.3 N on a flat surface and 23 N on an 18 m −1 curved surface) and roll outward to decrease the force in releasing (less than 3 N and especially less than 0.8 N on the flat surface). Embedded resistive strain gauges provide real time signals for the controller to determine the status of the bio‐toe, such as bending, adhesion/release, and even adhesive contact rates, thereby allowing the gripper to autonomously approach, envelop, adhere to, and release objects of various shapes, with the potential for dynamic adhesion control in the future. The adhesive gripper equipped with adhesive contact sensing and biomimetic inward adhesion/outward release capabilities exhibits a broader grasping range and applicability in smart adhesive grabbing across industrial, agricultural, and human–robot interaction contexts.",

    "abstract": "Soft actuators are necessary for the development of soft robotics. While advances have been made in creating artificial means of motion with compliant materials, challenges remain. Within the area of electromechanically active polymers, forces are often small and limited to wet electrolyte conditions. Herein, textile logics and processes are employed to demonstrate woven, in‐air operating, freestanding, soft textile actuators which can be electrically controlled. In‐air actuating trilayer tape yarn consisting of poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrenesulfonate layers and an ionogel are developed. The former acts as polymeric electroactive electrodes and the latter as a solid‐state electrolyte, providing ions for the actuation. Weaving is used for creating bending fabrics, possible to post‐process like any fabric. By weaving, actuator tape yarns are assembled in parallel to upscale the total output force, or alternated with non‐actuating yarns to make passive and active areas. The weaving method also allows for additional yarn functionalities to be incorporated, e.g., to make conductive pathways, enabling multi‐actuation areas, and individual electrical control. Additionally, tape yarns are arranged to create textile structures with both actuation and sensing. As a proof‐of‐concept, the developed fabric actuators enable novel wearable robotic devices for future applications that are inherently soft, lightweight, and multifunctional.",

While existing systems for autonomous calibration have demonstrated success in calibrating for a single objective, users may need to balance multiple conflicting objectives. Herein, an easily deployable, camera‐based system for autonomous calibration of FDM printers that optimizes for both part quality and completion time is presented. Autonomous calibration is achieved through a novel, multifaceted computer vision characterization and a multitask learning extension to Bayesian optimization. The system is demonstrated on four popular filament types using two distinct 3D printers. The results show that the system significantly outperforms manufacturer calibration across the machine and material configurations, achieving an average improvement of 32.2% in quality and a 31.2% decrease in completion time with respect to a popular benchmark.",

Herein, a photometric stereo‐based modeling, optimization, and evaluation system is proposed to explore the best illumination for typical camera‐based tactile sensors. First, this article constructs a tactile benchmark dataset, simulates the contact deformation of elastomer surface, rendering the tactile imaging under various illuminations, and constructs a metrics system to evaluate the performance. Then, the relationship between reconstruct accuracy and illumination direction distribution on the benchmark is depicted, and the best illumination is optimized. The optimized sensor is fabricated and evaluated by standard metrology experiments, which exhibits high reconstruction accuracy and convincingly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design and optimization approach. Furthermore, intensive experiments are conducted on diverse objects, which additionally indicate the generality and adaptability of the designed sensor.

Although the application of liquid metals (LM) and their composites has improved the stretchability of various tactile sensors, there remains a considerable gap between the performance of current flexible tactile sensors and human skin, attributed to their limited sensitivity and narrow working range. In this work, a liquid metal droplet (LMD)‐based flexible tactile sensor that achieves both high‐pressure sensitivity of 3 × 10 −2 kPa −1 and a wide working range from 50 Pa to 1.2 MPa is proposed. The novel sensor consists of an LMD array in which each pair of droplets is connected by an electrolyte solution within the polydimethylsiloxane microchannel grid. It is demonstrated that the 2‐LMD sensor is capable of detecting human motion and physiological signals, while the electrical impedance tomography‐based 3.5 × 3.5 cm sensor can detect the shape and position of single‐point, multipoint, and other complex contact using only eight evenly distributed electrodes along the sensor's edge.

This article presents a novel vine robot design powered by magnetic fluid. The fluid drives both vine growth through pressurization and enables precise steering and manipulation using external magnetic fields. Unlike previous designs, the robot's high magnetic volume ensures precise control even under pressure, while maintaining a fully soft structure. This allows for controlled needle movements during biopsies. Additionally, the robot achieves passive stabilization by pressing against surrounding walls. This stabilization, combined with magnetic forces, can exert up to 1.26 N of insertion force at the tip, enabling effective tissue penetration. Experiments are conducted with a 5 mm diameter, 145 mm long magnetic fluid‐driven vine robot, demonstrating movement in free space, through narrow constrictions, and within phantoms modeled after human bronchial anatomy.

However, large arrays of those sensors remain challenging to produce, as they require high‐resolution patterning of electrodes and routing of long and thin electrical connections. These two tasks remain difficult or costly for the high‐resistivity compliant electrodes of soft and stretchy capacitive sensors. Instead of relying on the complex patterning of arrays to provide location resolution, a plain, unstructured sensor with a single pair of electrodes is used and relied on computation to infer pressure location and amplitude from multifrequency sensing signals. Herein, a machine learning–based approach, which enables us to identify pressure location on a continuous 1D sensor split into 5 sensing zones with an accuracy greater than 97%, is proposed.

A set of SMA wires can increase the BM's triggering force to handle high contact speeds, while a set of SMA springs attached to the suction cup's edges can pull the cup to handle orientation misalignment. Experiments are conducted to characterize how the SMA actuators influence the BM's triggering force and the suction cup's displacement under continuous steady‐state low‐voltage heating. Additional experiments demonstrate fast tuning using momentary high‐voltage heating of the SMA actuators to enhance energy efficiency. The mechanism enables successful perching on smooth surfaces and adapt to varying contact speeds and misalignments when properly tuned for three scenarios: pendulum‐based perching, ground perching, and ceiling perching. With its tuning capability, the perching mechanism can alleviate the need for precise motion control for an aerial robot during perching, expanding the applications of aerial robots in areas like environmental monitoring or infrastructure inspection.",

    "abstract": "For miniature actuators, manipulating objects to achieve multi‐degree‐of‐freedom (multi‐DOF) motions is a critical skill for multitasking. However, equipping actuators with this capability in compact configurations is challenging while balancing operational efficiency. Inspired by the eye movements of humans, a miniature piezoelectric actuator with a square‐circular ring structure is reported. This combination‐customized design solution allows the driving feet to generate multidimensional oscillating trajectories, thus enabling 3‐DOF motions of different movers. A prototype measuring 31 × 31 × 4 mm 3 and weighing 7.18 g is fabricated. At 200 V p‐p , the spherical mover is driven to rotate at 26.51 rad s −1 , while the flat mover achieves linear and rotational speeds of 110.33 mm s −1 and 5.73 rad s −1 , respectively. Moreover, this actuator can manipulate these movers with rotational and linear resolutions at the sub‐milliradian and sub‐micron levels, respectively. The drivable load weighs up to 43.6 times that of the prototype, far exceeding the capabilities of comparable actuators with similar structural configurations. Notably, the actuator realizes multi‐DOF actuation without additional stators or transmission mechanisms, enabling its application in fault inspection of electronic components. This study provides a novel idea for developing multi‐DOF miniature actuators.",

Their bioinspired internal architecture mimics the asymmetric stacking of pinecone scales. MA‐EPR/CF composites show limited actuation in water but strong responsiveness in isooctane and toluene. PVA/CF materials are more sensitive to water while retaining functionality in hydrocarbons. Importantly, their actuation is reversible and stable through multiple cycles of environmental aging, and the carbon fibers provide significant load‐bearing capabilities, with stiffening effects when passing from dry to wet and immersed states.",

Standard treatment for patients with severe diaphragm dysfunction is permanently tethering the airway to a mechanical ventilator, which greatly impacts patient autonomy and quality of life. Soft robots are ideal to assist in complex biological functions, such as diaphragm contraction. This article introduces a soft robotic diaphragm‐assist device designed as a therapeutic treatment for diaphragm dysfunction, moreover a clinically relevant respiratory simulator is designed and proposed as a validation and testing tool for this treatment. The device uses fabric‐based pneumatic actuators to provide targeted mechanical assistance during inhalation. A two‐step control system is implemented to optimize synchronization and support: 1) detecting breath intention from the pleural pressure signal to trigger the device and 2) regulating the device's input pressure to assist in inhalation. Using the respiratory simulator, the device demonstrated the ability to restore pleural and abdominal pressures and significantly increased transdiaphragmatic pressure during simulated conditions of diaphragm dysfunction. This research advances the field of soft robotics in respiratory care, providing a foundational platform for the development of next‐generation therapeutic devices aimed at improving the quality of life for patients with diaphragm dysfunction.",

While electrical stimulation has been widely used for cyborg insect control, challenges such as habituation and integration with the insects’ natural behaviors remain areas of ongoing research. To address these limitations, this study introduces a control method based on insect visual perception, specifically using their natural aversion to ultraviolet (UV) light. A wearable UV helmet is designed with two UV light‐emitting diodes near the insect's left and right compound eyes. Targeted stimulation of the compound eyes results in directional turning behaviors such as left eye stimulation‐induced right‐turning and right eye stimulation‐induced left‐turning. This study's experiments show that increased UV intensity correspond to larger turning angles, with no evidence of habituation even after repeated trials. Additionally, this method minimizes stimulation by relying on the insect's natural movement patterns, activating the UV stimulus only when the insect is inactive. Compared to electrical stimulation‐based systems, the UV‐based approach significantly reduces the frequency of stimulations while maintaining consistent and reliable control. This finding suggests that noninvasive feedback methods are viable alternatives for guiding cyborg insects in unknown environments.",

However, costly, expertise‐dependent trial‐and‐error methods hinder efficient drug formulation, posing challenges for tailoring treatments to individual patients. To address this, a novel pipeline is developed for 3D printing using selective laser sintering (SLS), replacing laborious steps with advanced computational methods. A differential evolution‐based optimizer generates formulations for the desired drugs, while a deep learning ensemble predicts the optimal printing parameters along with associated confidence intervals. Manual handling is only required for the final formulation preparation and printing processes. The pipeline successfully generates diverse formulations, composed of a wide variety of materials and with high printability probabilities. This was validated by successfully printing 80% of the generated drug formulations and achieving 92% accuracy in predicting printing parameters. Notably, the time required to develop and print a new drug formulation is decreased to a single day. This study is the first to demonstrate a semiautomated, 3D printing drug formulation design and printing parameter selection pipeline. Furthermore, the pipeline is not limited to SLS printing but can also be adapted for the optimization of other 3D printing technologies or formulation platforms.",

The training and the validation of the regressor are performed by using theoretical curves derived from a contact mechanics model that combined power–law rheology with bottom effect corrections and functional data analysis.

Experiments with both a physical robot and simulations reveal that, with appropriate viscoelasticity, the flexible structure can discriminate object softness and retain that information through behavior. Drawing on these findings and anatomical insights from the ostrich neck, a haptic perception system is proposed that exhibits both separability and behavioral memory in flexible structures, enabling rapid learning and real‐time inference. The results demonstrate that through the dynamics of flexible structures, diverse functions can emerge beyond their original design as manipulators.",

    "abstract": "In order to control the posture of soft robots in dynamic environments, the movement of soft actuators such as McKibben artificial muscles must be monitored in real time. Researchers have developed various McKibben artificial muscles with embedded sensing components to achieve such monitoring. However, incorporating sensors into McKibben artificial muscles makes the system configuration more complicated and reduces the actuator's contraction rate. Furthermore, complex processing and circuitry are required, which limits applications. This study introduces a thin McKibben artificial muscle with an embedded resistive stretchable textile sensor (TES‐MAM), which does not require specialized measuring instruments. TES‐MAM measures displacement without additional sensing components outside the thin McKibben artificial muscle by incorporating a stretchable textile sensor inside the McKibben artificial muscle. The textile sensor exhibits excellent stretchability and does not degrade the contraction ratio. By fully embedding the textile sensor within the McKibben artificial muscle, which has an outer diameter of 4.5 mm, the structure of McKibben artificial muscle remains compact. TES‐MAM provides a clear and stable resistance response during repeated pressurization and release cycles under various displacement inputs. Using TES‐MAM, a single‐degree‐of‐freedom robotic arm is constructed and its ability to measure joint posture in real time is successfully demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework to accurately identify human peripheral blood cells. Our approach includes Big Transfer (BiT) models, combining the extracted features with classifiers: the traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), the Efficient Kolmogorov‐Arnold Network (EfficientKAN) and our hybrid method (HybridMLPEfficientKAN). Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset of 17092 images covering eight cell types is preferred. BiT models provide high‐dimensional features for classifications pipelines. Results show that combining MLP and EfficientKAN provides strong classification accuracy while reducing training overhead often seen in standalone EfficientKAN. Training durations in HybridMLPEfficientKAN remain close to MLP training, in the range of 100‐250 seconds, instead of longer durations of over 700 or even 2000 seconds in EfficientKAN. HybridMLPEfficientKAN surpasses EfficientKAN in overall accuracy, exceeding 97% in BiT models. We also evaluate class‐wise performance using recall, F1‐score, specificity and Matthews Correlation‐Coefficient (MCC). Hybrid approach effectively balances computational cost and prediction performance, making it an attractive solution for clinical settings where classification speed and accuracy are critical. This study highlights how BiT‐based feature extraction combined with carefully designed models can provide efficient PBC recognition. The integration of MLP‐level efficiency with KAN‐style adaptability offers a promising avenue for developing high‐accuracy, low‐latency cell classification systems in hematological analysis.",

    "abstract": "Miniaturized bistable actuators are of notable relevance for applications in microfluidics or the manipulation of delicate objects. Many applications require actuators to be multistable, meaning that they can hold specific positions without continuous energy input. However, reversibly controllable soft actuators, especially those based on thermoresponsive materials, typically lack this capability. To overcome this challenge, bistable soft microactuators fabricated by two‐photon polymerization at micrometer precision are demonstrate here, allowing for arbitrary 3D shapes. The bistability is given by material composition, that is, poly( N ‐isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) and a light‐responsive azobenzene compound. The incorporation of an azobenzene into pNIPAM photoresin enables the modification of its lower critical solution temperature (LCST) through the ( E )–( Z )‐isomerization, allowing for two states: a swollen and shrunken state. Hereby, actuation, in terms of shrinking and swelling, is controlled by photoswitching, allowing for the actuation of Azo_pNIPAM microactuators within a constant ambient temperature regime. Moreover, the pNIPAM moiety also allows thermal actuation when it contains either isomer, (( E ) or ( Z )), when the ambient temperature exceeds the LCST. Temperature and light changes are applied to characterize the bistable nature of the microactuators and an application of those bistable microactuators in a lab‐on‐a‐chip device is shown.",

The common method of running evolutionary algorithms off‐line to automatically discover controllers in simulation suffers from two disadvantages: the generation of controllers is not situated in the swarm and so cannot be performed in the wild, and the evolved controllers are often opaque and hard to understand. A swarm of robots with considerable on‐board processing power is used to move the evolutionary process into the swarm, providing a potential route to continuously generating swarm behaviors adapted to the environments and tasks at hand. By making the evolved controllers human‐understandable using behavior trees, the controllers can be queried, explained, and even improved by a human user. A swarm system capable of evolving and executing fit controllers entirely onboard physical robots in less than 15 min is demonstrated. One of the evolved controllers is then analyzed to explain its functionality. With the insights gained, a significant performance improvement in the evolved controller is engineered.",

To realize liquid transportation in these TMAs, LCPs should have excellent photodeformation property and suitable mechanical properties. Herein, linear liquid crystal polymers (LLCPs) with different mesogen orientations are used to prepare TMAs to study their liquid transportation behaviors. The mesogen orientation in each LLCP is formed spontaneously and varies with the spacer length, leading to different deformations of LLCP films. It is found that only LLCPs with mesogens oriented out‐of‐plane realize self‐support of the TMAs, whereas the TMAs with mesogens oriented in‐plane are so weak that they collapse in the radial direction, indicating the importance of mesogen orientation in fabricating three‐dimensional structures. Upon attenuated 470 nm light irradiation, the TMAs deform to an asymmetric conical structure, leading to the motion of liquid slug toward the narrow side. The liquid motion is accelerated in the TMA with longer spacer, showing the control of liquid speed by the mesogen orientation. These photocontrolled TMAs are expected to be applied in biological applications, such as whole blood analysis and flow cytometry, for precise liquid manipulation.",

Here, the oxygen vacancy transport in Au/SrTiO 3 (STO)/La 0.67 Sr 0.33 MnO 3 (LSMO) tunnel junctions is exploited to mimic neurotransmission processes in an artificial ionic electronic device. Using voltage pulses of varying number, amplitude, and polarity, it is demonstrated that reversible oxygen vacancy migration across the STO/LSMO interface provides stable multilevel resistance switching for octal memory devices and resembles the quantal, stochastic, and excitatory or inhibitory nature of neurotransmitter release dynamics. Moreover, fundamental synaptic behaviors including long‐term potentiation/depression and various types of spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity characteristics are emulated, opening a promising biorealistic approach to the design of neuromorphic devices.",

An electrostatic actuator is first developed using a buckled beam that can deform by up to 68% of its height under an applied voltage. A centimeter‐scale robotic bug is then designed that shows superb flexibility, adaptability, and maneuverability by incorporating origami structural elements. For instance, the robotic bug can be completely smashed and still recover its mobility, walk on various terrains, slopes (up to 30°) and narrow spaces, overcome hurdles, make turns, and even move backward with a crawling (linear) and turning (rotation) speed up to 40 mm s −1 and ≈45° s −1 , respectively. Such remarkable characteristics are controlled by a set of parameters such as the amplitude and frequency of the input voltage and/or the origami geometries. The facile and tunable design and the actuation principle can potentially enable ample opportunities for the development of the next‐generation soft robotics.",

    "abstract": "Many‐robot systems are becoming a reality for large companies that can invest in bespoke solutions. These systems often require carefully engineered infrastructure and a central planner to coordinate the robots. Outside these controlled environments, robots typically generate a shared situational awareness of the world and state of their task. This requires sophisticated mapping, perception, and control, with changes to the environment or tasks causing challenges to robot deployment. The assumption that centralized situational awareness is needed to deal with real‐world complexity may be holding back the field from deploying many‐robot systems. Yet potential applications are wide‐ranging, including environmental monitoring, construction, agriculture, and logistics. Mainstream adoption requires usability out‐of‐the‐box, in unstructured environments, at a reasonable cost. Distributed situational awareness is proposed as a method to design many‐robot systems differently. Distributed situational awareness allows swarms of low‐cost robots to rapidly and accurately capture the state of an environment and act accordingly, with no central data storage, modeling, or control. Its distributed nature enhances resilience and redundancy while reducing reliance on infrastructure and central planners. Deploying distributed situational awareness however requires new tools to design hardware and algorithms, demonstrate that it works and is safe, and is intuitive for users of the swarm.",

Herein, a novel design concept of robust three‐component elastomer–particle–fiber composite system with tunable mechanical stiffness and electrical conductivity is introduced. These smart materials are capable of changing their mechanical stiffness rapidly and reversibly when powered with electrical current. One implementation of the composite system demonstrated here is composed of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix, Field's metal (FM) particles, and nickel‐coated carbon fibers (NCCF). It is demonstrated that the mechanical stiffness and the electrical conductivity of the composite are highly tunable and dependent on the volume fraction of the three components and the temperature, and can be reasonably estimated using effective medium theory. Due to its superior electrical conductivity, Joule heating can be used as the activation mechanism to realize ≈20× mechanical stiffness changes in seconds. The performance of the composites is thermally and mechanically robust. The shape memory effect of these composites is also demonstrated. The combination of tunable mechanical and electrical properties makes these composites promising candidates for sensing and actuation applications for soft robotics.",

To confirm this prediction, herein, the detection of wind flow from the flapping‐wing motion of a bird robot using an integrated flexible strain sensor on its wing and a physical reservoir computing analysis is presented. In the presence of different wind directions, the movement of the flapping‐wings is measured using flexible strain sensors, and the current wind direction is detected by capitalizing on the intrinsic wing dynamics. As a result, it is found that the detection accuracy using our embedded flexible strain sensors is significantly high, showing a similar level of accuracy with a high‐speed camera recorded from the fixed position in the environment. The results indicate that flapping‐wing unmanned aerial vehicles can recognize wind direction by exploiting the natural dynamics of their wings.",

Herein, an ETA composed of a silver nanowire (AgNW) layer and an ultrathin linear low‐density polyethylene (LLDPE) film with all the aforementioned features is designed. Due to the high conductivity of the AgNW layer and the great difference between the coefficients of thermal expansion of AgNW layer and LLDPE film as well as the huge change in the heat transfer coefficient between flat and rolled ETA, the obtained ETA exhibits an ultrafast response speed of 0.08 s for a bending angle of 360° with a FoM of 0.46% at a low driving voltage of 1 V, over one order of magnitude larger than those of reported ETAs. As a proof‐of‐concept application, the as‐prepared ETAs can be used as intelligent mechanical devices with excellent performance.",

Herein, the perovskite/MoO 3 /Ag synaptic device exhibits very uniform electrical characteristics, a low operation voltage, and linear and repeatable analog switching. Important synaptic functions such as paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF) and short‐ and long‐term potentiation (STP/LTP) are all successfully and stably implemented in the device. The diffusion of Ag + and I − ions is believed to contribute to the synaptic behavior of the device. Furthermore, the uniform and stable volatile characteristics are utilized in a proof‐of‐concept reservoir‐computing‐based simulation program using all the experimental parameters; the results strongly suggest that the neuromorphic computing that utilizes such components can simultaneously reduce the circuitry complexity and increase its recognition accuracy with noisy inputs. The findings of this work promise to significantly facilitate the utilization of highly homogeneous vacuum‐deposited perovskite/metal oxide structures in high‐performance neuromorphic computing systems.",

It has, therefore, become commonplace to train them “ex situ” and transfer the resulting model to a dedicated inference hardware. Resistive memory arrays are of particular interest for realizing such inference hardware, because they offer an extremely low‐power implementation of the dot‐product operation. However, the transfer of high‐precision software parameters to the imprecise and random conductance states of resistive memories poses significant challenges. Here, it is proposed that Bayesian neural networks can be more suitable for model transfer, because, such as device conductance states, their parameters are described by random variables. The ex situ training of a Bayesian neural network is performed, and then, the resulting software model is transferred in a single programming step to an array of 16 384 resistive memory devices. On an illustrative classification task, it is observed that the transferred decision boundaries and the prediction uncertainties of the software model are well preserved. This work demonstrates that resistive memory‐based Bayesian neural networks are a promising direction in the development of resistive memory compatible edge inference hardware.",

Over the past years, the field of miniaturized robotics has rapidly expanded with many research groups contributing to the numerous challenges inherent to this field. Smart materials have played a particularly important role as they have imparted miniaturized robots with new functionalities and distinct capabilities. However, despite all efforts and many available soft materials and innovative technologies, a fully autonomous system‐engineered miniaturized robot (SEMR) of any practical relevance has not been developed yet. In this review, the foundation of SEMRs is discussed and six main areas (structure, motion, sensing, actuation, energy, and intelligence) which require particular efforts to push the frontiers of SEMRs further are identified. During the past decade, miniaturized robotic research has mainly relied on simplicity in design, and fabrication. A careful examination of current SEMRs that are physically, mechanically, and electrically engineered shows that they fall short in many ways concerning miniaturization, full‐scale integration, and self‐sufficiency. Some of these issues have been identified in this review. Some are inevitably yet to be explored, thus, allowing to set the stage for the next generation of intelligent, and autonomously operating SEMRs.",

This strategy eliminates the need for external SMA wires with extra mechanical components. Various experiments with different excitation voltages are performed to show the actuator's performance. In a horizontal setup, the soft actuator reaches a bending angle of 270° at a power input of 18 W. The integrated sensor reflects the actuator's position but is also influenced by the temperature increase during activation. Moreover, an equivalent circuit model is proposed that includes the actuator, sensor, and mechanical support structure in one model.

Herein, some of the key advantages of deploying untethered soft robots for future planetary explorations are discussed. Also, some brief insights into how the environmental conditions on extraterrestrial terrains may affect the actuation, fabrication, and locomotion of soft robots are provided.

However, the introduction of supramolecular networks to achieve self‐healing ability based on reversible dynamic noncovalent bonds usually leads to relatively low strength, while the conflict between high mechanical properties and high self‐healing efficiency is still a great challenge. Moreover, the lack of efficient interfacial interaction between functional layer and self‐healable polymer matrix leads to a permanent function loss during the healing of matrix. Herein, a brief overview of self‐healable sensors and actuators based on recent strategies including multiple noncovalent interactions, covalent–noncovalent interactions, and interfacial supramolecular crosslinking is presented.

Herein, a capacitive and piezoresistive hybrid sensor for long‐distance proximity and wide‐range force detection in HRC is reported. The sensor composes a pair of interdigital copper foil worked as the electrode for both coplanar capacitors and resistors, while a carbon black in polymer matrix works as the piezoresistive material. As‐prepared hybrid sensor can detect the object approaching as far as 100 mm, while a contact force covers from 0 to 450 N.

Significantly, the proposed hybrid sensor is feasible and scalable integration for the electronic‐skins (e‐skins) with superior stability, mechanical flexibility and deformability, which can withstand large compression, bending and torsion in applications.

The DS behavior is achieved by means of a novel DS strut that is rigid, but can buckle without breaking under high loads, thus preventing damage to the robot. Compression tests and finite element method simulations show that both the DS struts and DS tensegrities undergo substantial stiffness change with maximum load‐bearing ratios up to 10.5 and 5.74, respectively, before and after buckling. These DS tensegrity structures are integrated into two types of robots, a drone and a rover, that are shown to withstand falls from 2 and 5 m, respectively.

The proposed DRL controller utilizes 3D convolutional neural networks and is capable of learning control policies directly from raw 3D sensory data. It is shown that such a control scheme achieves effective and robust decision‐making within unseen, diverse complicated environments and offers flexibility for customizable task routines. This study provides a proof of principle for designing intelligent control systems for autonomous navigation in vascular networks for microrobots.",

    "abstract": "2D metal–organic frameworks (2D‐MOFs) have been extensively studied as promising materials in the fields of electrocatalysis, drug delivery, electronic devices, etc. However, few studies have explored the application potential of 2D‐MOFs in novel neuromorphic computing devices. Herein, an optoelectronic neuromorphic transistor based on a 2D‐MOF/polymer charge‐trapping layer is reported. It is found that the large specific surface area, stable crystal structure, and highly accessible active sites in 2D‐MOFs make them excellent charge‐trapping materials for the devices, which are beneficial for mimicking the memory and learning functions observed in the organism's nervous systems. Different types of synaptic behaviors have been realized in the 2D‐MOF‐based neuromorphic devices under stimuli signal, e.g., paired‐pulse facilitation, excitatory postsynaptic current, short‐term memory, and long‐term memory. More interestingly, emotion‐adjustable learning behavior is realized by changing the value of the source–drain voltage. This work can shed light on the application of 2D‐MOFs in neuromorphic computing and will contribute to the further development of neuromorphic computing devices.

Decision‐making process for switching and routing of signals is fundamental for computing as it enables the transfer of information from one to many (or single) blocks within a system. Herein, a technique is proposed for the design of pulse‐based switching devices for the computing of fundamental decision‐making processes. Information is encoded from multiple channels as transverse electromagnetic (TEM) pulses of varying amplitudes and polarities propagating through interconnected parallel plate waveguides modeled as simple transmission lines. An in‐depth description of the technique is presented showing how switching and routing of information can be engineered by exploiting the linear splitting and superposition of multiple pulses traveling through waveguide junctions. To demonstrate the potential of the technique, two devices are developed: a comparator which can calculate the largest value between two real‐valued numbers and a pulse director which exploits the reciprocity of waveguide junctions to create a similar yet different performance of a traditional AND gate (emulating its performance via the analogue linear system). These findings may open new pathways for high‐speed electromagnetic pulse‐based computing systems.",

Bioinspired mimicry of muscular systems is of great interest in soft robotics and biomedicine. Currently a broad range of synthetic macromolecules and natural or modified biomacromolecules imitate muscular systems, but no protein muscles with mechanoactive protein components are realized. Biomimetic bio‐based muscle systems allow to combine the potential of nature's high‐performance proteins, for example, silk, resilin, elastin, or titin, with novel adaptive and functional properties and sustainable biotechnological production. While biological protein motors and muscles are powered by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate, no synthetic bio‐based muscles are described, operating autonomously using chemical energy to exert directional movements. Herein, an artificial protein muscle is introduced, exerting rhythmic autonomous movements via nonequilibrium states driven by chemically fueled pH oscillation reactions. Key to the design are recombinantly produced human matrix proteins selectively reengineered to respond to different stimuli. The results also show how directional movements can be independently triggered by changes in pH and temperature including a selective on‐switch and a combination of nonequilibrium states enabling “learning and oblivion”‐like material effects. This paves the road for the next generation of autonomous materials in pharmacy, soft robotics and living matter.",

This is done by placing a vacuum‐based actuator inside a hyperbaric chamber which enables both the large deformations possible using negative pressure, and large forces through the action of high pressure differential, exceeding those possible using only negative pressure. This actuator can lift heavy payloads (up to 80 kg) for its entire contraction range, with large deformations (89.1% contraction of the active length) and high power (maximum power of 101.3 W), while using relatively low pressures, which can be supplied by a portable pneumatic pump. By exchanging air between the two chambers in closed‐loop pneumatic actuation, this actuator can also be driven using a single pump without exchanging air with the environment and its position can be controlled using a single pneumatic regulator.",

However, these microfluidic networks typically operate with small volumes, low flow rates, and low pressures relative to what is needed to power fluidic soft actuators. This article presents the design, fabrication, and analysis of a soft, fluidic amplifier as the “missing link” between microfluidic analogies of microcontrollers and the high fluidic power loads representative of soft actuators. The article demonstrates amplification gains of pressure signals up to a factor of four. The amplifier is a step toward fully autonomous soft robots by allowing designers to develop control strategies from soft materials with minimal additional rigid components or tethering.",

Generally, the beam control functions of a reconfigurable intelligent surface require the independent phase control of the unit cells, and each unit cell requires an active device. Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces are considered a promising solution for 5G and sixth‐generation (6G) wireless communication, their practical implementation faces a bottleneck at high frequencies (e.g., with the millimetre‐wave spectrum) because they require a large number of active devices, leading to high costs, parasitic effects, increased design complexity, and modulated signal distortion. Herein, a mechatronic reconfigurable intelligent surface is reported for indoor millimetre‐wave wireless communication. Our mechatronic device strengthens the innovative reflective beam control functions through rotatable unit structures and rack gear systems. Furthermore, the criteria required for future 5 G wireless communication are experimentally verified by transmitting and receiving quadrature phase‐shift keying 16‐/32‐/64‐quadrature amplitude modulation signals based on 5 G new radio (NR) frequency range two standards for indoor environments.",

Inspired by how humans recognize noisy images and the flexible modulation on the timescale of ion dynamics inside an emerging memtransistor, a novel neuromorphic vision system is reported based on the ion‐modulated memtransistors. By controlling the ion‐doping processes under adequate stimuli strengths, both short‐term and long‐term ion dynamics can be utilized to deliver energy‐efficient data processing. When dealing with image reconstructions, the short‐term accumulation effect of the device can help filter noises in a set of received noisy images while enhancing the original pattern information. The increased contrast can help distinguish the actual contents. To demonstrate systematic performances with the reconfiguration of devices, the nonlinear relationship between channel conductance variation and the amplitude of gate pulses into the network‐level simulation is extracted. Also, with the nonvolatile conductance change characteristic, the task of recognizing noisy images is performed to verify the versatility of ion‐modulated memtransistors in the neuromorphic artificial vision systems.

MUTES combines multiple sensor modules including microphone array, camera, and lidar. The 64‐channel microphone array provides semispherical surveillance with high signal‐to‐noise ratio of sound source estimation, while the long‐range lidar and the telephoto camera are capable of subsequent precise target localization in a narrower but higher definition field of view. MUTES employs a coarse‐to‐fine, passive‐to‐active localization strategy for wide‐range detection (semispherical) and high‐precision 3D tracking. To further increase the fidelity, an environmental denoising model is trained, which helps to select valid acoustic features from a drone target, thus overcomes the drawbacks of the traditional sound source localization approaches when facing noise interference. The effectiveness of the proposed sensor‐fusion approach is validated through field experiments. To the best of the knowledge, MUTES provides the farthest detection range, highest 3D position accuracy, strong anti‐interference capability, and acceptable cost for unverified drone intruders.",

As a complement to underwater camera, tactile perception becomes especially important in situations where machine vision is limited. However, tactile sensors utilized in deep sea, which should be able to detect pressure changes of only hundreds of pascals under high hydrostatic pressure, are still lacking. To tackle the challenge imposed by hydrostatic pressure, a simulated deep‐sea environment flexible sensor (SDEFS) is proposed, consisting of a force sensor array and a bending sensor based on hydrogels for tactile sensing in 50 MPa hydrostatic pressure environments. The force sensor is unaffected by the hydrostatic pressure and achieves high sensitivity of 82.62 N −1 under 100 MPa hydrostatic pressure. The SDEFS is utilized to classify objects based on the difference in hardness. It can accurately classify seven objects on the ground, and three objects in an underwater environment with hydrostatic pressure of 50 MPa, with total recognition accuracies of 98.3% and 96%, respectively. With high force measurement sensitivity and accurate recognition ability under water, the SDEFS is expected to provide very valuable haptic sensing and feedback in deep‐sea exploration.",

Due to the advantageous role of flexible propulsors, they are widely adopted in previous swimming robots. As an optimal propulsor, stiffness is highly dependent on its beating frequency, and stiffness modulation is crucial when a robot is swimming with multiple beating frequencies. Herein, a novel swimming paddle that can switch two different stiffness states by sliding a laminate inside and its application to a swimming robot is studied. This paddle has 8 articulated joints and 20 passive flaps to achieve drag asymmetry with minimum control effort. A semiempirical model to estimate the stiffness change in good accuracy is also studied. The thrust modulation caused by stiffness change is comprehensively studied by varying frequency and range of motion. In addition, a nontethered swimming robot propelled by a bilateral pair of paddles is developed to investigate when and how the stiffness adjustment is useful. There is a threshold frequency dividing two regimes where one stiffness excels the other stiffness with respect to cost of transport. Finally, it is shown that the paddle thickness is closely related to the necessity of stiffness change mechanism.",

Researchers have developed a series of nanomotors with different architectures and propulsion mechanisms and have also explored the application prospects of nanomotors in many fields. Yet, the present nanomotors with simple component and motion behaviors are still far from the ultimate goal of nanoscale robots with controlled sophisticated motions. With this goal in mind, researchers are no longer satisfied with just making nanoparticles move actively, but looking forward to achieving precise control of the motion behavior of nanomotors. With the advance in nanofabrication techniques, tuning the nanomotors’ motion by modulating the structure of nanoparticles has become a widely welcomed approach. This article reviews the self‐propelling mechanisms and the various synthesis methods of nanomotors. It is also systematically summarized how the composition, surface properties, size, and morphology of nanoparticles affect their motion behavior. Some outstanding works are highlighted, the shortcomings, challenges, and opportunities in the field are also discussed.

    "abstract": "The application of explainable artificial intelligence in nanomaterial research has emerged in the past few years, which has facilitated the discovery of novel physical findings. However, a fundamental question arises concerning the physical insights presented by deep neural networks; the model interpretation results have not been carefully evaluated. Herein, explainable artificial intelligence and quantum mechanical calculations is bridged to investigate the correlation between light scattering and emission in a WSe 2 monolayer. Convolutional neural networks using light scattering and emission data are first trained, while expecting the networks to determine the relationships between them. The trained models are interpreted and the specific phonon contribution during the exciton relaxation process is derived. Finally, the findings are independently evaluated through quantum mechanical calculations, such as the Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulation and density functional perturbation theory. The study provides reliable fundamental physical insight by evaluating the results of neural networks and suggests a novel methodology that can be applied in materials science.",

    "abstract": "Advanced wireless communication with high spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency has always fascinated humanity, especially with the explosive increase of global mobile data services. Index modulation (IM) has recently been found to be a promising technique due to the transmission of additional data bits via the indices of the available transmit entities. However, the practical implementation of IM remains a great challenge associated with complicated radio components. Herein, IM with intelligent spatiotemporal metasurfaces is experimentally demonstrated. The spatiotemporal metasurfaces provide a natural and versatile platform to achieve IM in a green and lightweight manner. The whole system is driven by a built‐in inverse‐design agent that automates spatiotemporal metasurfaces to cater to diverse application demands. In doing so, how to mitigate the inherent nonuniqueness issue and how to setup the input target from practical scenes are concretely discussed. In the microwave experiment, the spatiotemporal metasurfaces are fabricated and demonstrate the feasibility by harvesting two harmonic waves as communication channels. An intelligent electromagnetic platform that can manipulate electromagnetic waves in multidimensions is provided, meriting other numerous intelligent meta‐devices that avoid overburdening data analysis networks in smart cities of the future.",

However, EOG signals are susceptible to the sensor's skin‐contact quality, limiting the precise detection of eye angles and gaze. Herein, a two‐camera eye‐tracking system and a data classification method for persistent human–machine interfaces (HMIs) are introduced. Machine‐learning technology is used for a continuous real‐time classification of gaze and eye directions, to precisely control a robotic arm. In addition, a deep‐learning algorithm for classifying eye directions is developed and the pupil center‐corneal reflection method of an eye tracker for gaze tracking is utilized. A supervisory control and data acquisition architecture that can be universally applied to any screen‐based HMI task are used by the system. It is shown in the study that the classification algorithm using deep learning enables exceptional accuracy (99.99%) with the number of actions per command (≥64), the highest performance compared to other HMI systems. Demonstrating real‐time control of a robotic arm captures the unique advantages of the precise eye‐tracking system for playing chess and manipulating dice. Overall, this paper shows the HMI system's potential for remote control of surgery robots, warehouse systems, and construction tools.",

The proposed FBG sensor utilizes two tiny nitinol rods as a backbone to attach the long‐grating FBG element fiber, enabling high strain transfer, shape sensing for large bending deformation, and preventing chirping failure and fiber sliding when bending. Its distal end is set free to slide and synchronizes with the extended length and reflects shapes for large bending deformation (up to 320° with a linearity of 99.96%), while its proximal end is fixed. The small packaged sensor unit enables modular design, easy assembly, and high repeatability with negligible effects on the soft finger's bending performances. The artificial neural network model is utilized to process the input of two sensing modalities, reducing errors from material nonlinearity, fabrication, and assembly of soft fingers while improving shape estimation's accuracy and transferability with average errors of 0.90 mm (0.69%) and 1.55 mm (1.19%) for whole shape and distal end position, respectively.

While both procedures use 99m Tc‐isotopes, the two vary in signal and background intensity. To understand how the different levels of image guidance impact surgical decision‐making, computer‐vision algorithms are used to extract the DROP‐IN probe kinematic form clinical videos. 44 PCa patients undergo SLN (25) and PSMA‐targeted (19) resections. PSMA‐PET/CT and SPECT/CT create preoperative roadmaps, and intraoperative probe signal intensities are recorded. Using neural network‐based software, probe trajectories are extracted from videos to extract multiparametric kinematics and generate decision‐making and dexterity scores. PSMA‐targeted resections yield significantly lower nodal signal intensities in preoperative SPECT‐CT scans (three‐fold; p = 0.01), intraoperative probe readouts (eight‐fold; p &lt; 0.001), and signal‐to‐background ratios (SBR; two‐fold; p &lt; 0.001). Kinematics assessment reveal that the challenges encounter during PSMA‐targeted procedures converted to longer target identification times and increase in probe pick‐ups (both five‐fold; p &lt; 0.001). This results in a fourfold reduction in the decision‐making score ( p &lt; 0.001). Reduced signal intensities and intraoperative SBR values negatively affect the impact that image‐guided surgery strategies have on the surgical decision‐making process.",

These tasks are generally performed by teleoperation based on the visual feedback, rather than the soft actuators’ sensing information. However, vision sensors’ function may be restricted in some complex underwater environments with poor visibility and narrow spaces. This will greatly reduce the efficiency of the underwater operations. Therefore, soft actuators strongly require an organism‐like perception system to sense environmental stimuli and can be applied to complex underwater environments. To address the problem, a multidirectional external perception soft actuator based on two flexible optical waveguide sensors is developed and machine learning methods are utilized to build its perceptual model herein. The experimental results indicate that the soft actuator can recognize 12 contact positions based on the sensing model, and the identifying accuracy is up to 99.82%. Additionally, according to the contact location feedback, teleoperation can be more efficiently completed in unknown underwater environments.",

Soft resistive sensors are susceptible to mechanical stimuli and detecting temperature selectively remains a challenge. In this study, soft flexible thermistors are developed for detecting temperature changes based on the positive temperature coefficient (PTC) effect, selectively. By thermomechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, it is observed that thermoplastic elastomers with higher thermal expansion and semicrystalline morphology result in a sensitive thermistor response. To achieve a high sensitivity in temperature and low sensitivity in the detection of mechanical stimulus, a low‐carbon filler content is required. The opposite trend is seen for the piezoresistive sensors for mechanical strain detection. Both sensory material types are compatible with thermoplastic material extrusion‐based additive manufacturing. The method is used for the fabrication of the sensing elements and an open‐source prosthetic hand. The strain sensor detects the bending of the fingers and the temperature sensor detects the temperature when in contact with a heated surface, successfully. In addition, the temperature sensor is used as a tactile sensor to detect contact with a non‐heated surface. Combining selective multisensory capabilities will significantly affect the future development of sensorized prosthetic devices and wearable electronics.",

Vigorous research in the past three decades has enriched neuromorphic systems for realizing this ambitious goal. Reverse engineering the brain essentially implies the inference and learning capabilities of a standalone neuromorphic system—particularly, the latter is referred to as embedded learning. The reconfigurability of a neuromorphic system is also pursued to make the system field‐programmable. Bearing these desired attributes in mind, recent progress in digital neuromorphic hardware is overviewed, with an emphasis on real‐time inference and adaptation. Real‐time adaptation, that is, learning in realtime, highlights the feat of spiking neural networks with inherent rich dynamics, which allows the networks to learn from environments embodying an enormous amount of data. The realization of real‐time adaptation imposes severe constraints on digital neuromorphic hardware design.

    "abstract": "In nature, most microorganisms have motility, which is essential for their survival or reproduction. To move, some microorganisms have evolved soft spiral‐shaped flagella, which rotate through specialized motors. Many of these microorganisms can change the morphology of their spiral‐shaped flagella to control their motility. Herein, by mimicking these flagella, spiral‐shaped microswimmers are developed for various applications, such as target drug delivery, micro‐object transport, and micro‐fluid manipulation. In previous studies, numerous fabrication methods of spiral‐shaped microswimmers are developed. However, the swimming direction and velocity are controlled only by external systems, such as magnetic fields, because the spiral body is not able to deform. Therefore, this soft spiral‐shaped microswimmer for autonomous swimming control by detecting surrounding stimuli is proposed. The velocity of microswimmer largely depends on the geometry of the microswimmer's body. Through usage of a stimuli‐responsive hydrogel in the microswimmer, the geometry autonomously changes in response to the surrounding stimuli. Using finite‐element simulation, it is revealed that the pattern angle is an important parameter for acceleration/deceleration of the microswimmer.

The 3D horizontal and vertical manipulation of a magnetic LM can be realized via an external magnetic field. The magnetically actuated LM is not only manipulated on various complex pathways in the horizontal plane, but also vertically in 3D space without the use of electrolytes and electrodes. As a proof‐of‐principle, an intelligent delivery vehicle that can avoid obstacles and traps horizontally and overcome gravity vertically to offload a cargo is designed and implemented successfully. Furthermore, a biomimetic soft robotics that can realize both in‐plane and out‐of‐plane locomotion is demonstrated using only magnetic field. The novel 3D motion of the demonstrated system facilitates the development of practical LM‐based smart structures and devices.",

    "abstract": "Particles under a perpendicularly applied alternating current (AC) electric field assemble into complex structures and exhibit tunable locomotion. Although they possess very similar physical properties, silica particles form two‐dimensional (2D) close‐packed crystals in deionized water, whereas polystyrene (PS) spheres repel each other. Using nanoparticle tracers, it is shown that the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flow around silica particles is contractile, whereas it is extensile around PS particles. The Stern‐layer conductivities of PS and silica spheres are further measured experimentally and used in theoretical models to calculate the EHD flow surrounding them, which matches well with experiments. Therefore, the incorporation of Stern‐layer conductivity resolves the puzzle that EHD flow surrounding a particle with moderate zeta potentials is extensile. The impacts of zeta potential, Stern‐layer conductivity, salt concentration, and particle size on the EHD flow are examined herein. It is found that particles with high zeta potential, small diameter, or immersed in low salt concentration solutions tend to have extensile EHD flow surrounding them because the enhanced surface conductivity in the double layer makes the particles effectively more polarizable than the solvent. Herein, it is further shown that asymmetric EHD motors made from PS and silica particles exhibit behaviors that are consistent with the model predictions.",

However, a convincing real‐world application for in‐memory logic and its experimental validation are still lacking. Herein, the application of database query where a database is stored in an array of binary memristive devices is presented. The queries are formulated in terms of bulk bit‐wise operations and are executed in memory by exploiting Kirchhoff's current summation law. The concept is experimentally demonstrated by executing error‐free queries on a small 4 × 8 selector‐less phase‐change memory crossbar. The impact of crossbar size, resistance of routing wires, and interdevice variability on the accuracy of the logical operations are studied through numerical and circuit‐level simulations. Finally, a system for cascaded query is proposed that combines the in‐memory logic with conventional digital logic and its functionality is verified on a healthcare‐related database. It is estimated that an 11‐step long query is executed in 36 ns, consuming 560 μW, thus achieving an energy efficiency of 166 TOPS/W.",

It implements the binary neural network algorithm with an analog circuit and completes the recognition of the transmission signal at the hardware level. The chip possesses a low power consumption which is less than 1.8 mW.

By combining a crosspoint array and feedback amplifiers, it is possible to compute matrix eigenvectors in one step without algorithmic iterations. In this work, time complexity of the eigenvector computation is investigated, based on the feedback analysis of the crosspoint circuit. The results show that the computing time of the circuit is determined by the mismatch degree of the eigenvalues implemented in the circuit, which controls the rising speed of output voltages. For a dataset of random matrices, the time for computing the dominant eigenvector in the circuit is constant for various matrix sizes, namely the time complexity is O(1). The O(1) time complexity is also supported by simulations of PageRank of real-world datasets. This work paves the way for fast, energy-efficient accelerators for eigenvector computation in a wide range of practical applications.",

Inspired by the structure and functions of biological synapses and neurons in the brain, neural network algorithms that can realize highly parallel computations have been implemented on conventional silicon transistor‐based hardware. However, synapses composed of multiple transistors allow only binary information to be stored, and processing such digital states through complicated silicon neuron circuits makes low‐power and low‐latency computing difficult. Therefore, the attractiveness of the emerging memories and switches for synaptic and neuronal elements, respectively, in implementing neuromorphic systems, which are suitable for performing energy‐efficient cognitive functions and recognition, is discussed herein. Based on a literature survey, recent progress concerning memories shows that novel strategies related to materials and device engineering to mitigate challenges are presented to primarily achieve nonvolatile analog synaptic characteristics. Attempts to emulate the role of the neuron in various ways using compact switches and volatile memories are also discussed.

Herein, a new method for achieving controllable adhesion by vibrating a flexible plate near a surface, which generates a strong and controllable attraction force, is presented. This adhesion mechanism has the unique property of providing strong adhesion normal to a surface, but very low resistance to motion parallel to the surface, making it attractive for mobile robots. Adhesive capabilities of vibration‐based adhesion (VBA) to characterize adhesive force dependence on vibration frequency and surface size are studied. Spatial pressure measurements within the adhesive zone, in combination with visualization of surface vibration modes, demonstrate that adhesion is localized to the center of the disk and decreases radially. A mobile robot to highlight the capabilities and robustness of VBA for payload transport, climbing to inversion transitions, and adhesion control is developed.

Due to the additive and discrete nature of the digital manufacturing process, AM needs to find a trade‐off between process resolution and production efficiency. Traditional AM processes balance the resolution and efficiency by tuning the processes either in the temporal domain (e.g., higher speed in serial processes) or in the spatial domain (e.g., more tools in parallel processes). To improve the resolution without sacrificing efficiency, a data‐driven mask image planning method based on subpixel shifting in a split second by tuning the process in both temporal and spatial domains is presented. The method is based on the optimized pixel blending principle and a fast error diffusion‐based optimization model. Various simulation and experimental tests are carried out to verify the developed subpixel shifting method. The experimental results demonstrate the data‐driven‐based mask image calibration and planning techniques significantly improve the fabricated part quality without compromising the process efficiency.

Reinforcement learning (RL) methods provide a promising solution for these cases. However, training robots with RL can be a data‐extensive, time‐consuming, and potentially unsafe process. In contrast, classical control strategies can have near‐optimal performance without training and be certifiably safe. However, this is achieved at the cost of assuming that the environment is known up to small uncertainties. Herein, an architecture aiming at getting the best out of the two worlds, by combining RL and classical strategies so that each one deals with the right portion of the assembly problem, is proposed. A time‐varying weighted sum combines a recurrent RL method with a nominal strategy. The output serves as the reference for a task space impedance controller. The proposed approach can learn to insert an object in a frame within a few minutes of real‐world training. A success rate of 94% in the presence of considerable uncertainties is observed. Furthermore, the approach is robust to changes in the experimental setup and task, even when no retrain is performed. For example, the same policy achieves a success rate of 85% when the object properties change.",

Herein, a novel two‐phase modeling methodology is proposed for fatigue life prediction based on in situ monitoring of thermal history. Phase (I) includes a convolutional neural network designed to detect the relative size of the defects (i.e., small gas pores and large lack‐of‐fusions) by leveraging processed thermal images. Subsequently, a fatigue‐life prediction model is trained in Phase (II) by incorporating the defect characteristics extracted from Phase (I) to evaluate the fatigue performance. Estimating defect characteristics from the in situ thermal history facilitates the fatigue predicting process.",

    "abstract": "For physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) where multi‐contacts play a key role, both robustness to achieve robot‐intended motion and adaptability to follow human‐intended motion are fundamental. However, there are tradeoffs during pHRI when their intentions do not match. This paper focuses on bipedal walking control during pHRI, which handles such tradeoff when a human and a humanoid robot having different footsteps locations and durations. To resolve this, a force‐reactive walking controller is proposed by adequately combining ankle and stepping strategies. The ankle strategy maintains the robot's intention based on an analytically‐optimal center of pressure, leading the robot to oppose resistance to multiple contacts from the human. Based on the robot's kinodynamic constraints and/or the confidence of the robot's intention, the stepping strategy updates the robot's footsteps based on the human's intention implied by the multiple contact forces. Consequently, the proposed walking control on pHRI mutually exchanges human–robot intentions in real‐time, thereby achieving coordinated steps. With a full‐sized humanoid robot that is able to detect multi‐contacts in real‐time, we succeeded in performing a long‐term “box‐step” with multi‐contacts pHRI, demonstrating the robustness of our approach.",

The folding of circular rings has shown bistable snap‐through deformation under simple twisting motion and demonstrates a large area change to 11% of its undeformed configuration. Motivated by the large area change and the self‐guided deformation through snap‐folding, it is intended to design ring origami assemblies with unprecedented packing ratios. Herein, through finite‐element analysis, snap‐folding behaviors of single ring with different geometries (circular, elliptical, rounded rectangular, and rounded triangular shapes) are studied for ring origami assemblies for functional foldable structures. Geometric parameters' effects on the foldability, stability, and the packing ratio are investigated and are validated experimentally. With different rings as basic building blocks, the folding of ring origami assemblies including linear‐patterned rounded rectangular rings, radial‐patterned elliptical rings, and 3D crossing circular rings is further experimentally demonstrated, which show significant packing ratios of 7% and 2.5% of the initial areas, and 0.3% of the initial volume, respectively. It is envisioned that the reported snap‐folding of origami rings will provide alternative strategies to design foldable/deployable structures and devices with reliable self‐guided deformation and large area change.",

    "abstract": "Compliance in jumping robots improves gait stability and enables energy‐efficient locomotion. Here, 3D printable auxetic tubular springs from thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) for rapid and sustainable hopping are developed. Because the springs have negative Poisson's ratios, they become stiffer as compression proceeds and theoretically stores 35.2% more energy than a linear spring with the same stiffness. As the stress concentrates on the hinges, it is revealed through experimental, numerical, and analytical investigations that hinge geometries, for example, the lattice angle and hinge radius, governs the global stiffness and robustness of the springs. The hopping robot leg composed of three auxetic tubular springs in parallel sustains more than 1,000 cycles of repeated, one‐degree‐of‐freedom (1‐DOF) vertical hopping and two‐degree‐of‐freedom (2‐DOF) forward hopping. The 2.5 kg‐robot system requires minimum 420 mJ of elastic energy for repeated hopping. The springs are pre‐compressed by tendon‐driven actuators and stores 1.08 J during jumping and release the springs when touching the ground. The power stroke is calculated as 15–18 W. The average velocity of the hopping robot reaches 0.06 m s −1 with the increase of touchdown angle to 0.125 rad. The cost of transport is calculated as 6.7, similar to those of the living organisms.",

Finally, through an in vitro therapeutic effect test, the death of tumor cells using the proposed patch is confirmed. As a result, the possibility that the multiple mucoadhesive patches can be delivered to target lesions in a digestive tract through a magnetically actuated capsule and can treat the lesions through hyperthermia and active drug release using an AMF stimulation is verified.",

Herein, a bioinspired design to create soft–rigid hybrid mechanoreceptive actuators (HMAs) and grippers is reported, imitating the musculoskeletal structure and embedded mechanoreception of human fingers, via careful ink preparation and a multimodality all‐3D‐printing technology. The HMAs consist of multiple rigid segments between joints, imitating phalanges, to mount flexible mechanoreceptive sensors in a flexible‐on‐rigid (FOR) design, yielding a bending‐insensitive unambiguous mechanoreception. The printed sensors exhibit a humanoid high sensitivity for low contact force and a wide low‐sensitivity linear detection range, combined with excellent long‐term stability and low hysteresis. As a result, the HMA gripper not only shows greatly enhanced output force due to the soft–rigid hybrid design, but also enables multifunctional mechanoreceptive sensing including contact identification, gentle grabbing, and the estimation of size, weight, and stiffness of the grasped objects. This integrated approach of constructing soft robots with mechanoreception can provide a pathway toward feedback control, integrative biomimetic functions, and human–machine interface for all soft devices.",

The vast colloidal synthesis and processing parameters of LHP NCs in combination with the batch‐to‐batch and lab‐to‐lab variation problems further complicate their progress. In response, a self‐driving fluidic micro‐processor is presented for accelerated navigation through the complex synthesis and processing parameter space of NCs with multistage chemistries. The capability of the developed autonomous experimentation strategy is demonstrated for a time‐, material‐, and labor‐efficient search through the sequential halide exchange and cation doping reactions of LHP NCs. Next, a machine learning model of the modular fluidic micro‐processors is autonomously built for accelerated fundamental studies of the in‐flow metal cation doping of LHP NCs. The surrogate model of the sequential halide exchange and cation doping reactions of LHP NCs is then utilized for five closed‐loop synthesis campaigns with different target NC doping levels. The precise and intelligent NC synthesis and processing strategy, presented herein, can be further applied toward the autonomous discovery and development of novel impurity‐doped NCs with applications in next‐generation energy technologies.",

Herein, a drone that can squeeze its way through arbitrarily long passages that are half its width is presented. This is achieved by developing a quadrotor that synergistically embodies a soft foldable frame, multimodal mobility, and autonomous navigation. The drone exploits visual perception to detect the entrance of the gap and aerial mobility to align and fly toward it. The entry is made possible by the soft design of the frame, which passively folds without breaking when the drone flies and then collides at a controlled speed with the entrance of the passage, i.e., the “crash to squash” entry maneuver. Once inside, the quadrotor uses terrestrial locomotion for the traversal. The mechanical design of the drone and the performance of the “crash to squash” entry maneuver in passageways of different sizes are experimentally characterized. Finally, the control method is validated by indoor autonomous flights.",

A neuromorphic metamaterials class embodying bioinspired mechanosensing, memory, and learning functionalities obtained by leveraging mechanical instabilities integrated with memristive materials is reported. The prototype system comprises a multistable metamaterial whose bistable dome‐shaped units collectively filter, amplify, and transduce external mechanical inputs over large areas into simple electrical signals using embedded piezoresistive sensors. Dome deformations in nonvolatile memristors triggered by the transduced signals, providing a means to store loading events in measurable material states are recorded. Sequentially applied mechanical inputs result in accumulated memristance changes that allow us to physically encode a Hopfield network into the neuromorphic metamaterials. This physical network learns the history of spatially distributed input patterns. Crucially, the neuromorphic metamaterials can retrieve the learned patterns from the memristors’ final accumulated state. Therefore, the system exhibits the ability to learn without supervised training and retain spatially distributed inputs with minimal external overhead. The system's embodied mechanosensing, memory, and learning capabilities establish an avenue for synthetic neuromorphic metamaterials that learn via tactile interactions. This capability suggests new types of large‐area smart surfaces for robotics, autonomous systems, wearables, and morphing structures subjected to spatiotemporal mechanical loading.",

Such tetherless control may enable new ultraminimally invasive surgical manipulations in clinical settings. While wireless actuation offers advantages in medical applications, the challenge of providing sufficient force to magnetic needles for tissue penetration remains a barrier to practical application. Applying sufficient force for tissue penetration is required for tasks such as biopsy, suturing, cutting, drug delivery, and accessing deep‐seated regions of complex structures in organs such as the eye. To expand the force landscape for such magnetic surgical tools, an impact force‐based suture needle capable of penetrating in vitro and ex vivo samples with 3‐degrees‐of‐freedom (DOF) planar motion is proposed. Using custom‐built 14 and 25 G needles, generation of 410 mN penetration force is demonstrated, a 22.7‐fold force increase with more than 20 times smaller volume compared with similar magnetically guided needles. With the Magnetic Pulse Actuated Collisions for Tissue‐penetrating (MPACT)‐Needle, gauze mesh suturing onto an agar gel is demonstrated. In addition, the tip size is reduced to 25 G, a typical needle size for eye interventions, to demonstrate ex vivo penetration in a rabbit eye towards corneal injections and transscleral drug delivery.",

Medical procedures, such as colonoscopies and imaging techniques, are used to diagnose a disease, but are not easily accessible for repeat measurements. In contrast, liquid biopsies, e.g., blood, urine, or fecal samples, have become important sampling strategies to identify health concerns. Herein, a robotic pill is designed for collecting relevant biomarkers from the GI tract over prolonged sampling periods. The robotic pill is comprised of a magnetic core for locomotion, a delayed gate mechanism that controls sampling location based on changes in its environment, and an enrichment module that traps biomarkers in an absorbent matrix while enabling biofluid to pass through the chamber. The robotic pill was assessed to sample microparticles, proteins, and bacteria from the solution. Moreover, the robotic pill was capable of directed locomotion in complex environments and docking in a targeted region against fluid flow. The utilization of an untethered robotic sampling system could provide a tool to investigate aspects of disease initiation and progression for early diagnosis and therapy monitoring.

This imposes a big challenge to conventional digital hardware because of physically separated memory and processing units and the transistor scaling limit. Memristors are deemed a solution for efficient and portable deep learning. However, their ionic resistive switching incurs large programming stochasticity and energy, compromising their advantages in real‐time learning spatiotemporal signals. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel hardware–software codesign. Hardware‐wise, the stochasticity in memristor programming is leveraged to produce random matrices for efficient in‐memory computing. Software‐wise, random convolutional‐pooling architectures are integrated with echo‐state networks that compute with the hardware random matrices and make real‐time learning affordable. The synergy of the hardware and software not only improves the performance over conventional echo‐state networks, that is, 90.94% and 91.67% (compared to baselines 88.33% and 62.50%), but also retains 187.79× and 93.66× improvement of energy efficiency compared to the digital alternatives on the representative Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (HAR) and CRICKET datasets, respectively. These advantages make random convolutional echo‐state network (RCESN) a promising solution for the future smart edge hardware.",

Many recent works focus on improving the efficiency of executing neural networks in diverse applications. Researchers have advocated processing‐in‐memory (PIM) architecture as a promising candidate for training and testing neural networks because PIM design can reduce the communication cost between storage and computing units. However, there exist noises in the PIM system generated from the intrinsic physical properties of both memory devices and the peripheral circuits. The noises introduce challenges in stably training the systems and achieving high test performance, e.g., accuracy in classification tasks. This review discusses the current approaches to tolerating noise effects for both training and inference in PIM systems and provides an analysis from a hardware–software codesign perspective. Noise‐tolerant strategies for PIM systems based on resistive random‐access memory (ReRAM), including circuit‐level, algorithm‐level, and system‐level solutions are explained. In addition, we also present some selected noise‐tolerate cases in PIM systems for generative adversarial networks and physical neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Internet‐of‐things (IoT) edge devices with a memristive neuromorphic system can more effectively enhance daily lives. However, cyberattacks remain critical concerns for smart IoT edge devices that process a vast body of information via networks. Herein, a highly secure neuromorphic system is reported, which can be implemented using a physically unclonable function (PUF) that exploits the high entropy achieved via the stochastic switching of a poly(1,3,5‐trivinyl‐1,3,5‐trimethyl cyclotrisiloxane) (pV3D3)‐based memristor. The excellent insulating property of pV3D3 enhances the stochasticity of the tunneling distance for randomly ruptured Cu filaments. The pV3D3 memristor‐based PUF (pV3D3‐PUF) achieves near‐ideal 50% averages for uniformity and uniqueness, excellent reliability under conditions of mechanical stress and water immersion, and reconfigurability‐bolstering security without additional hardware. Using stochastic in‐memory computing, the pV3D3‐PUF shows resilience to machine learning attacks. Furthermore, a cryptography protocol is demonstrated, which enables artificial intelligence service implementation without security issues for PUF‐integrated pV3D3 memristor‐based neuromorphic systems.",

Current state‐of‐the‐art sensors placed on fingers or embedded into gloves are incapable of fully capturing all hand gestures and are often uncomfortable for the wearer. Herein, a flake‐sphere hybrid structure of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) doped with polystyrene (PS) spheres is fabricated to construct the highly sensitive, fast response, and flexible piezoresistive sensor array, which is ultralight in the weight of only 2.8 g and possesses the remarkable curved‐surface conformability. The flexible wrist‐worn device with a five‐sensing array is used to measure pressure distribution around the wrist for accurate and comfortable hand gesture recognition. The intelligent wristband is able to classify 12 hand gestures with 96.33% accuracy for five participants using a machine learning algorithm. To showcase our wristband, a real‐time system is developed to control a robotic hand via the classification results, which further demonstrates the potential of this work for HMI applications.",

In contrast to rigid tools, the presented custom magnetic fetoscope is highly flexible, dexterous, and has considerable advantages, including safety and precision.

One potential application is to add new components directly onto existing structures. Herein, a versatile, reconfigurable direct ink writing (DIW) manufacturing method is developed in tandem with a two‐stage hybrid ink designed to fabricate high‐strength, self‐supporting parts in unconventional printing spaces such as underneath a build surface or horizontally. This two‐stage hybrid DIW ink combines a photopolymer and a tough epoxy resin. The photopolymer can cure rapidly to enable layer‐by‐layer printing of complex structures. It also possesses adequate adhesion to allow the fabrication of large volume structures on a diversity of substrates including acrylic, wood, glass, aluminum, and concrete. The epoxy component can cure after 72 h in ambient conditions with further increased adhesion strengths. The capabilities of the reconfigurable DIW extrusion nozzle method to print complex structures in inverted and horizontal environments are demonstrated. Finally, via addition of DIW‐deposited conductive paths, a functional 3D‐printed structure capable of in situ deformation monitoring is created. This work has the potential to be used for applications such as appending new parts to existing structures for increasing functionality, repair, and structure health monitoring.",

LME composites consisting of highly deformable materials and low conductive filler ratios offer high stretchability and good strain‐tolerant conductance, while not compromising the functionality of their host systems. Despite advances, actively achieving electrical conductivity for LME composites with a low ratio of fillers is challenging, especially in highly deformable elastomers. Herein, a new fabrication strategy that turns nonconductive LME composites with highly deformable elastomers into conductive ones using a small amount of magnetic Ni‐doped LM is introduced. By actively manipulating conductive fillers with an external magnetic field, electrically conductive traces can sustainably be achieved at any desired location. Experimental results show that conductive traces have high conductivity of 2.55 × 10 5 S m −1 , high stretchability (&gt;450%), good strain‐tolerant conductance ( R / R 0 ≈ 1.56 at 250% strain), and especially a tensile modulus as low as 60.1 kPa at a very low loading ratio (9.7% by volume). The noncontacting magnetic fabrication also enables the creation of diverse configurations in 1D, 2D, and 3D, offering a broad range of potential applications from robotics, stretchable electronics, wearable devices, smart garments to biomedical systems.",

    "abstract": "Natural agents display various adaptation strategies to damages, including damage assessment, localization, healing, and recalibration. This work investigates strategies by which a soft electronic skin can similarly preserve its sensitivity after multiple damages, combining material‐level healing with software‐level adaptation. Being manufactured entirely from self‐healing Diels–Alder matrix and composite fibers, the skin is capable of physically recovering from macroscopic damages. However, the simultaneous shifts in sensor fiber signals cannot be modeled using analytical approaches because the materials viscoelasticity and healing processes introduce significant nonlinearities and time‐variance into the skin's response. It is shown that machine learning of five‐layer networks after 5000 probes leads to highly sensitive models for touch localization with 2.3 mm position and 95% depth accuracy. Through health monitoring via probing, damage and partial recovery are localized. Although healing is often successful, insufficient recontact leads to limited recovery or complete loss of a fiber. In these cases, complete resampling and retraining recovers the networks’ full performance, regaining sensitivity, and further increasing the system's robustness. Transfer learning with a single frozen layer provides the ability to rapidly adapt with fewer than 200 probes.",

Two design principles govern the rendering of believable and intuitive haptic feedback: movement through open space must feel “free” while contact with virtual objects must feel stiff. Herein, a novel multisensory approach that conveys proprioception and effort through illusory visual feedback and refers to the wrist, via a bracelet interface, discrete and continuous interaction forces that would otherwise occur at the hands and fingertips, is presented. Results demonstrate that users reliably discriminate the stiffness of virtual buttons when provided with multisensory pseudohaptic feedback, comprising tactile pseudohaptic feedback (discrete vibrotactile feedback and continuous squeeze cues in a bracelet interface) and visual pseudohaptic illusions of touch interactions. Compared to the use of tactile or visual pseudohaptic feedback alone, multisensory pseudohaptic feedback expands the range of physical stiffnesses that are intuitively associated with the rendered virtual interactions and reduces individual differences in physical‐to‐virtual stiffness mappings. This multisensory approach, which leaves users' hands unencumbered, provides a flexible framework for synthesizing a wide array of touch‐enabled interactions in XR, with great potential for enhancing user experiences.",

To provide a simpler but efficient grasping methodology, a soft enveloping gripper is presented and investigated how its morphological adaptability improves the grasping ability by comparing its performance with fingered grippers. Results show that this enveloping gripper can omnidirectionally envelop objects via active–passive interaction, which allows the gripper to 100% grasp the object located at different positions within range and keep their orientations. However, the grasping success rate and orientation error of the fingered grippers highly depend on the relative position and angle of the objects to the grippers, as well as the number of fingers. The dynamic vibration and decay time of the enveloping gripper when grasping a 500 g weight are, both, approximately one‐sixth of those of the two‐fingered gripper when grasping a 12.37 g cube. This enveloping gripper can automatically grasp objects (including deformable ones) lying in different poses without posture estimation and force control with a simple vision‐based automatic grasping method. The enveloping grasping method may open an avenue for simple, low cost yet powerful automatic grasping applications.",

    "abstract": "Surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has shown highly promising for existing cancer screening. However, previous “proof‐of‐concept” studies ignored the natural imbalance of cancer types in the population, leading the model to be biased toward learning more features in majority class during the learning process at the expense of ignoring minority class. Herein, a power‐law‐based synthetic minority oversampling technique (PL‐SMOTE) method is proposed to guide the resampling of multiclass serum SERS data by analyzing the long‐tailed (power‐law) distribution of cancer prevalence in the population. The proposed PL‐SMOTE method balances the number of minorities to resample and the number of overlaps between classes by introducing modulating factor. Modeling on resampled datasets synthesized by PL‐SMOTE verifies the effectiveness of proposed PL‐SMOTE method. After further fine‐tuning, the parameters of the deep neural network model and PL‐SMOTE method, an optimal cancer screening model with an optimal macroaveraged Recall score of 97.24% and an optimal macroaveraged F2‐Score of 97.38% is obtained. A new method for multiclass imbalanced resampling is provided, which has significant improvement on model performance in terms of SERS cancer screening. The method also inspires in other multiclass imbalanced scenario, such as biological medicine, abnormal detection, and disaster prediction.",

An innovative gray‐tone lithography method using the two‐photon polymerization of photosensitive poly( N ‐isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel is developed to print the voxels. Bending, compression, and twisting voxels are designed, printed, and characterized. A voxel consists of an isotropically shrinking active material reinforced adequately with a passive pattern.

With a side length of 40 μm, the bending voxel achieves a bending angle of 25º or curvature of . The compression voxel reaches an actuation strain of 40%, and the twisting voxel bends up to 18º. Advanced kinematics are demonstrated by printing complex structures composed of multiple elementary voxels.

    "abstract": "As robots more frequently fraternize with humans in everyday life, aspects such as safety, flexibility of tasks, and appearance become increasingly important. Soft robotics is attractive for new human‐close applications, but soft actuators constitute a major challenge both in terms of actuation force and speed, and in terms of control and accuracy of the deformable soft actuator body. Herein, several of these challenges are addressed by developing versatile ultrasoft electromagnetic actuators that operate in absence of external magnetic fields, while simultaneously monitoring their states by internal strain sensors. The versatile actuators can compress to less than 50% of their initial length with strain‐independent contraction force and operate in both contraction and expansion modes up to 200 Hz frequency while conforming to curved surfaces. The soft multilayer conductive cellulose‐based foams are lightweight (3 mg cm −3 ) and provide internal strain‐sensing capability and structural support, thereby improving the monitoring and controllability of the actuators while maintaining an axial softness of 0.6 kPa. It is believed that the concept of soft versatile electromagnetic actuators with integrated lightweight strain‐sensing foams is promising for a wide range of applications within soft robotics.",

They utilize the kinematic structure and passive dynamics of the body to adapt to objects of varying shapes and properties. However, these soft passive interactions make the state of the robotic device influenced by the environment, making control generation and state estimation difficult. This work presents a closed‐loop framework for dynamic interaction‐based grasping that relies on two novelties: 1) a wrist‐driven passive soft anthropomorphic hand that can generate robust grasp strategies using one‐step kinaesthetic teaching and 2) a learning‐based perception system that uses temporal data from sparse tactile sensors to predict and adapt to failures before it happens. With the anthropomorphic soft design and wrist‐driven control, it is shown that controllers can be generated robust to novel objects and location uncertainty. With the learning‐based high‐level perception system and 32 sensing receptors, it is shown that failures can be predicted in advance, further improving the robustness of the entire system by more than doubling the grasping success rate. From over 1000 real‐world grasping trials, both the control and perception framework are also seen to be transferable to novel objects and conditions.

By recording these dynamics with a high‐resolution camera and image processing program and then using linear regression for training, it is shown that the origami reservoir has sufficient computing capacity to estimate the weight and position of a payload. It can also recognize the input frequency and magnitude patterns. Furthermore, multitasking is achievable by simultaneously applying two targeted functions to the same reservoir state matrix.

    "abstract": "While vacuum grippers offer an economical solution, the environmental impact of energy waste through their suction cups (SCs) cannot be overlooked. This waste stems from three key factors: i) air losses from idle SCs arranged in arrays, ii) inadequate sealing on target surfaces leading to air leaks, and iii) damage from sharp objects resulting in leaking perforations. To overcome these challenges, in this article, a comprehensive approach is presented that involves the development of a i) self‐closing, ii) multi‐material, and iii) self‐healing system based on reversible elastomers cross‐linked via the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction. The system incorporates a fully autonomous self‐closing mechanism to prevent energy waste in SC arrays during periods of non‐contact. Fluid–structure interaction simulations are utilized to analyze the design. Versatility and stability are achieved by incorporating hyper‐flexible and stiff elastomers in a multi‐material design, supported by covalent DA cross‐links that ensure robustness through high‐strength multi‐material interfaces. These DA cross‐links also enable self‐healing capabilities, allowing the SCs to recover from macroscopic damages within 1 day at ambient conditions or in a single hour with mild heating (80–90 °C), restoring full performance. Additionally, in the article, a recycling method is introduced for multi‐material SCs based on the mechanical separation of reversible polymers.",

    "abstract": "The impressive capabilities of living organisms arise from the way autonomy is materialized by their bodies. Across scales, living beings couple computational or cognitive intelligence with physical intelligence through body morphology, material multifunctionality, and mechanical compliance. While soft robotics has advanced the design and fabrication of physically intelligent bodies, the integration of information‐processing capabilities for computational intelligence remains a challenge. Consequently, perception and control limitations have constrained how soft robots are built today. Progress toward untethered autonomy will require deliberate convergence in how the field codevelops new materials, fabrication methods, and control strategies for soft robots. Here, a new perspective is put forward: that researchers should use tasks alone to impose material and information constraints on soft robot design. A conceptual framework is proposed for a task‐first design paradigm that sidesteps limitations imposed by control strategies. This framework allows emergent synergies between material and information processing properties of soft matter to be readily exploited for task‐capable agents. Particular attention is paid to the scale dependence of solutions. Finally, an outlook is presented on emerging research opportunities for achieving autonomy in future soft robots as large as elephant trunks and as small as paramecia.",

    "abstract": "Aerial–aquatic robots have promising applications due to their ability to operate in air and water with different motion modes. However, challenges such as water/air transition and multimedia movement still limit their development. Inspired by the aerial–aquatic behavior of wild ducks, an aerial–aquatic robot with tunable tilting motors and a delta wing is introduced. The robot can perform multimode motion, including flying in air, swimming on the water surface, transitioning between air and water, and diving underwater. Besides, the buoyancy design enables the robot to float at the air–water interface without consuming energy. Herein, the performance of the robot, including vertical and horizontal cross‐media performance, power consumption, and endurance in various motion modes, is evaluated. The field experiments show that the proposed robot possesses multimode motion and high maneuverability. This study provides a new idea for the structural design of next‐generation practical aerial–aquatic robots.",

    "abstract": "Flexible force sensors have been widely applied in robotics for object exploring, remote controlling, and human–machine interactions. The tri‐axis force sensors for accurate measurement of normal and shear forces are generally in urgent demand. Most tri‐axis force sensors rely on signal analyzation between multiple elements to achieve force components, which may need numerous leading wires and limit the force angular sensing performance. Herein, a novel flexible centralized force sensor is developed based on a novel tri‐axis force refactoring method. Normal force is detected by the central parallel‐plates capacitor, and both the angle and amplitude of shear force can be extracted through the resistance changes. The normal force performance is characterized with a sensitivity of 0.057 N −1 and a detection range of 0–12 N, and the effective detection range of shear force is about 0.5–0.67 N. The minimum distinguished shear angle difference is about 7.3°, which can be further improved by increasing the sensing material's resistivity. Then, robotic grasping tests are performed and show that the sensor can accurately measure the normal and shear forces and applied shear force angle, which indicates its promising applications in potential robotic manipulation and interactions.",

Here, two types of organic synaptic transistors (OSTRs), OSTR‐A and OSTR‐B, are fabricated on either glass or polymer film using water‐processable charge‐trapping gate‐insulating layers that are prepared by reacting ethylenediamine (EDA) and poly(2‐acrylamido‐2‐methyl‐1‐propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPSA). OSTR‐A is designed to function as a basic artificial synapse by gate pulse stimulation only, while OSTR‐B has additional near‐infrared (NIR)‐absorbing conjugated polymer layers for further sensing of NIR light upon gate voltage stimulations. The PAMPSA:EDA films are found to contain permanent charge bridges (ion pairs of –SO 3 − + NH 3 ‐) that play a charge‐trapping role in OSTRs. Both devices with the PAMPSA:EDA layers exhibit clear postsynaptic current (PSC) signals upon gate voltage pulses, leading to long‐term potentiation/depression characteristics. The flexible OSTR‐B devices can sense the NIR light (905 nm) upon gate pulse stimulation and their PSC signals are well maintained even after bending (&gt;5000 times). Artificial neural network simulations disclose that the flexible OSTR‐B devices can stably perform synaptic operations under the NIR light with high accuracy (&gt;90%) even after repeated bending (5000 times), indicative of potential use in artificial neuromorphic skin applications.",

However, combining these capabilities into a single robot skillfully is challenging, particularly in the domain of miniature structural design. Inspired by the amphibious motion of crocodiles in nature, a hollow piezoelectric miniature robot (HPMR) is proposed. The key benefit of the HPMR is to concurrently output the oscillating motion of the driving foot (oscillating mode) and the rotating motion of the internal rotor (rotating mode). That is, the mode of single‐energy‐input‐multimotion output allows the robot to balance the requirements of speed and adaptability. In the oscillating mode, HPMR can run at speeds of up to 12.3 BL s −1 and realize a displacement resolution of 0.3 μm. Following the conical rotor assembly, the rotor can operate at a speed of 890 rpm, with a displacement resolution of 7.28 mrad. In the rotating mode, the robot demonstrates its multitasking ability in moving amphibiously, carrying loads, running on surfaces with varying roughness, crossing obstacles, and resisting shocks. The results show that the HPMR is capable of fast, high‐resolution moving combined with high adaptability, opening up the possibility of using it for mobile detection tasks in real‐world settings.",

This article introduces ASTK, a software package covering upstream and downstream analysis of AS. Initially, ASTK offers a module to perform enrichment analysis at both the gene‐ and exon‐level to incorporate various impacts by different spliced events on a single gene. We further cluster AS genes and alternative exons into three groups based on spliced exon sizes (micro‐, mid‐, and macro‐), which are preferentially associated with distinct biological pathways. A major challenge in the field has been decoding the regulatory codes of splicing. ASTK adeptly extracts both sequence features and epigenetic marks associated with AS events. Through the application of machine learning algorithms, we identified pivotal features influencing the inclusion levels of most AS types. Notably, the splice site strength is a primary determinant for the inclusion levels in alternative 3’/5’ splice sites (A3/A5). For the alternative first exon and skipping exon classes, a combination of sequence and epigenetic features collaboratively dictate exon inclusion/exclusion. Our findings underscore ASTK's capability to enhance the functional understanding of AS events and shed light on the intricacies of splicing regulation.",

To facilitate the HRC system, the first priority is to ensure safety in the event of accidents, such as collisions between robots and humans. Therefore, a protective and collision‐sensitive robot skin, named Gel‐Skin is proposed to guarantee the safety in HRC. The Gel‐Skin is composed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel, which is a functional material with piezoresistive characteristics and impact absorption capability. In particular, the PVC gel has a distinctive piezoresistive property that the relation between mechanical pressure and electrical resistance is tunable depending on an applied voltage. When a voltage is applied to the PVC gel, the electrical charges are accumulated around the anode and it shows increased piezoresistive sensitivity. In this study, it is verified for the PVC gel to exhibit the 4.78 times higher sensitivity by simply applying a voltage. This novel physical phenomenon enables the Gel‐Skin to detect the collision rapidly. Finally, the Gel‐Skin is applicated to a real robot system and it is verified that the Gel‐Skin can detect a collision and absorb impact to ensure safety.",

It is not only used for actuation but also used as channels for additional features such as soft piezoresistive sensors with enhanced sensitivity to STMs’ pressure‐induced elongation, or VSSs of either low‐melting‐point alloys or a new thermo‐responsive epoxy with low viscosity and transition temperature.

Within this work, liquid rope coiling is used to 3D‐print soft graded porous actuators. By fabricating these actuators from a conductive thermoplastic elastomer, piezoresistive sensing is directly integrated. These sensor‐integrated actuators exhibit nonlinearities and hysteresis in their resistance change. To overcome this challenge, a novel approach that uses identified Wiener–Hammerstein (WH) models is proposed to estimate the strain based on the resistance change. Three actuator types were investigated, namely, a bending actuator, a contractor, and a three degrees of freedom bending segment. By using the design freedom of additive manufacturing to set the porosity, the actuation and sensing behavior of a contracting actuator can be programmed. Furthermore, the WH models can provide strain estimation with on average high fits (83%) and low root mean square (RMS) errors (6%) for all three actuators, which outperformed linear models significantly (76.2/9.4% fit/RMS error). In these results, it is indicated that combining 3D‐printed graded porous structures and system identification can realize sensor‐integrated actuators that can estimate their strain but also tailor their behavior through the porosity.",

    "abstract": "Teleoperated robotic surgery is a rapidly growing field that promises to overcome geographical barriers and share expertise over long distances for a variety of minimally invasive procedures. A particularly promising technology for teleoperation is robotic magnetic navigation. In contrast to conventional surgical robots, a robotic magnetic navigation system generates external magnetic fields to safely and dexterously steer soft magnetic devices within the human body, enabling a versatile, economical, and accessible telesurgery platform for a variety of procedures. This perspective highlights the recent research efforts in robotic magnetic platforms for telesurgery and their translation to clinical settings in the context of endoscopic procedures. This discussion is supported by a case study performed at the Multi‐Scale Medical Robotics Center in Hong Kong, where an in vivo gastroscopy in a porcine model is performed in tandem with two operators, alternating between a clinician controlling the procedure from the operating room in Hong Kong and a remote expert controlling the procedure from an operator console in Zurich. The achievements and challenges of this study highlight the capabilities and future potential of robotic magnetic navigation for telesurgery.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a biomechanics‐based, user‐adaptive variable impedance controller designed to enhance the performance of coupled human–robot systems during motion. The controller integrates the biomechanical characteristics of human limbs and dynamically adjusts the robotic impedance parameters—specifically damping, stiffness, and equilibrium trajectory—based on real‐time estimations of the user's intent and direction of motion. The primary goal is to minimize the energy expenditure of the coupled human–robot system while maintaining system passivity. To address uncertainties in human behavior and noisy observations, the controller employs Bayesian optimization combined with a Gaussian process. To validate the proposed approach, human experiments are conducted using a standard robotic arm manipulator. The results demonstrate that the controller eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, a process that is typically time‐consuming. A comparative analysis against two variable impedance controllers without user‐adaptive parameter adjustments reveal significant benefits, with the controller improving combined performance metrics—such as accuracy, speed, user effort, and smoothness—by over 13%. Notably, all participants in the study preferred the optimized controller over the alternatives. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the biomechanics‐based, user‐adaptive variable impedance control approach and its potential to enhance physical human–robot interaction in various applications that involve repetitive or continuous motion.",

The T‐TENG‐based sensory system outputs distinct voltage signals upon exposed to different material and structural conditions, for which a 1D‐convolutional neutral network algorithm is exposed to process with the sequential signals.

Self‐folding is the ability of flat sheets of materials to respond to external stimuli (light, heat, magnetic fields, etc.) and rapidly change shape without human intervention. Herein, the self‐folding of metals is reviewed, which is particularly important for opening up new applications in robotics, medicine, and reconfigurable electronics.

Herein, it is shown how the actuation dynamics of reconfigurable microdevices made by assembly of patchy magnetic microcubes, which are referred to as “microbots,” can be modulated by their interactions with the anisotropic viscoelastic environment of a liquid crystal (LC). The free energy arising from the elastic strain of LC and formation of topological defects around the microbots influences their folding dynamics, which can be tuned by tailoring both the far‐field orientation of the LC and the local ordering of the LC at the microbot surfaces. These findings represent a first step toward establishing a general set of design rules to control the dynamics of microbots using complex anisotropic fluids.",

An in situ unsupervised learning method is applied to make greater use of array structure and competitions between neurons, demonstrating significant performance improvement in memory capacity and noise tolerance compared with existing supervised approaches. By extending to continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs), working memory is realized based on memristors for the first time via simulation, and the write and read noises in memristor arrays are found to have different impacts on the ability of CANN in maintaining dynamic information.

Friction anisotropy is observed at the interfaces between the burrowing robots and different granular materials. Its effects on the pulling resistance and burrowing characteristics are studied. The results demonstrate that the development of friction and friction anisotropy is affected by the characteristics of the granular material, the asymmetric skins, and the relative size of the asymmetric features to the granular particles. Robots with scales or spikes aligned along the upward direction burrow faster than those aligned against the upward direction, especially in relatively coarser granular materials. Particle image velocimetry analysis on the particle displacement fields around the actuator reveals the complexity of dry granular material interactions with soft robots, implying that aligned scales or spikes can impact the distribution of friction preferentially, opening up many possibilities for thoughtful material and geometry‐based manipulation of friction in the design and optimization of future soft burrowing robots for more versatile locomotion capabilities.",

The driving force is the absorption or release of water or another solvent, which results in swelling and shrinking motions, leading in turn to more complex functionalities. However, practical hydrogel actuators that can be controlled locally, such as ones that allow local actuation around the joints in rigid‐bodied robots, do not exist. Herein, the driving target of a thermo‐responsive hydrogel, poly( N ‐isopropyl acrylamide), is integrated with the stimulation module using a liquid metal. The stimulation module provides heat as an external stimulus to the hydrogel actuator. The motion of the actuator is triggered by the heat supplied by an ultrasoft hydrogel coil, with liquid metal surrounding the driving target. The heat generated by current flowing through the liquid metal changes the temperature only around the desired part of the actuator, which enables the electrical control of an individual part of the hydrogel actuator. The concept of integrating the driving target and stimulator is expected to facilitate functional movement of actuators and expand the range of potential applications of hydrogels.",

In this context, this article proposes a learn‐and‐replay (LAR) paradigm that consists of two phases: a therapist‐in‐loop (interactive) phase where the therapist interacts through the haptic teleoperation loop with the patient to perform the cooperative therapy task, and a therapist‐out‐of‐loop (standalone) phase where the therapist's task is played by the patient‐side robot in future repetitions. During the interactive phase, the therapist demonstrates impedance during cooperating with the patient. During the standalone phase, the patient‐side robot is automatically controlled to mimic the therapist's demonstrated impedance which is learned in the interactive phase. The direct force reflection (DFR) architecture is utilized as the control method for the bilateral telerehabilitation system. Case studies involving 1‐degree‐of‐freedom and 2‐degree‐of‐freedom cooperative manipulation tasks are tested for proof of concept. The results show that the impedance of the therapist's arm can be replicated by the patient‐side robot for both tasks and proposed LAR telerehabilitation paradigm that assists the therapist in the rehabilitation procedure to take care of other tasks or attend to other patients.",

There is great attention for developing technology to accurately extract defect information from the image using a computing system without human error. However, image analysis using conventional computing technology based on Von Neumann structure is facing bottlenecks to efficiently process the huge volume of input data at low power and high speed. Herein efficient defect identification is demonstrated via a morphological image process with minimal power consumption using an oxide transistor and a memristor‐based crossbar array that can be applied to neuromorphic computing. Using a hardware and software codesigned neuromorphic system combined with a dynamic Gaussian blur kernel operation, an enhanced defect detection performance is successfully demonstrated with about 10 4 times more power‐efficient computation compared to the conventional complementary metal‐oxide semiconductor (CMOS)‐based digital implementation. It is believed the back end of line (BEOL)‐compatible all‐oxide‐based memristive crossbar array provides the unique potential toward universal artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) applications where conventional hardware can hardly be used.",

    "abstract": "Many biophysical and biochemical properties of pathogenic tissues are different from those of healthy tissues. These disease symptom‐associated properties include pH, reduction–oxidation conditions, enzyme generation and expression, blood glucose concentration, mechanical stiffness and strain, and temperature. Autonomous drug release that uses one or more of these disease symptom‐associated properties as the release trigger minimizes the delay in treatments and allows for the release of medications with precisely controlled amounts and with desired spatiotemporal patterns. Herein, a comprehensive assessment of current research progress on autonomous drug release systems (ADRS) is provided. The representative symptoms‐associated properties that can be potentially used as the endogenous stimuli are introduced. The autonomous drug systems that utilize these symptom‐associated signals as the endogenous stimulation signals are discussed, followed by the discussion of current challenges and opportunities in this field, as well as possible future directions in ADRS.",

    "abstract": "Flexible and transparent electrodes are highly useful in wearable optoelectronic systems for healthcare and biosensing applications for conducting multimodal assessments with electrophysiological and optical measures. In such systems, the electrodes should exhibit a low sheet resistance, high visible transmittance, and small feature size, for reliable electrical sensing, optical observation of attached objects, and integration of devices for mapping local biology events, respectively. Herein, fine‐printed, flexible, and transparent microelectrodes that allow biosensing and device integration are reported. The microelectrodes containing cross‐aligned silver nanowire (AgNW) networks are patterned via a selective wetting deposition technique on a 1 μm‐thick polymer substrate. A low sheet resistance of 25 Ω sq −1 and a visible transmittance of 96%–99% are achieved with a small pattern width of 25 μm. The biosensing application is demonstrated by detecting the leaf electric potential; the leaf cells under the microelectrodes are observed because of visible transparency. Furthermore, device integration is demonstrated by electronic circuits with ultrathin and transparent organic transistors. The transistors exhibit white‐light illumination stability and mechanical stability to bending stress. These demonstrations provide a basis for developing ultraimperceptible wearable sensor systems with ultrathinness and high visible transmittance.",

To realize intelligent soft robotic systems, real‐time monitoring of their deformation and interactions with surrounding objects including shape and proximity is important. Thus, integration of sensors into FEAs while considering cost reduction and mass production is required. Because paper features low cost and recyclability, herein, two paper‐based sensors, resistive strain sensors (RSSs) and capacitive proximity sensors (CPSs), are incorporated into FEAs as the strain‐limiting layers. The RSS exhibits the ability to detect the actuated bending angle with hysteresis ≈0.01% and high repeatability for 30 cycles. The RSS is also able to detect different object sizes being grasped by the FEA. In contrast, the CPS starts detecting object proximity 8 mm away from the sensor surface and functions well at various approaching speeds. The CPS is also capable of distinguishing objects of different materials by their permittivity. Finally, an intelligent soft gripper which carries these two sensors is demonstrated, where bending curvature, object proximity, contact, and release are monitored in real time. The results provide a pathway for the development of low‐cost sensorized soft robotic systems with advanced sensing functionalities.",

However, realizing beneficial traits such as high‐speed motion, high load capacity, an internal driving source, and environmental suitability in one small robot is still challenging. Inspired by kangaroo hopping, a small robot is designed with a two‐mass soft structure and driven by electromagnetic force. With the synergistic effect of the hopping motion, the soft robot displays two unique properties: 1) the loaded speed is larger than the unloaded one (0–10 times its body weight) and 2) by changing the driving frequency, the moving direction of the robot, i.e., forward or backward, can be controlled. In addition, the robot displays multiple leading properties, including a high‐motion speed (≈21.5 body lengths s −1 ) and large load capacity (≈32.5 times its body weight), compared to other robots on the same scale. Furthermore, the robot displays exceptional adaptive capabilities under different circumstances: it traverses slopes, rough and soft surfaces, and even maneuvers underwater. The design strategy and dynamic model adopted in this research provide a reference for future designs and lay a solid foundation for the practical application of high‐performing small robots.",

Combination of magnetically driven locomotion and stimuli‐responsive shape morphing is an effective strategy to realize these microrobots. However, most existing microrobots fabricated by the combination strategy are of low locomotion efficiency due to the limited amount of magnetic material loaded. Herein, a novel scheme for coating the magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of microrobot is proposed to increase the magnetic material loading amount. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that, below a critical size at microscale, surface coating NPs can load more magnetic material than embedding NPs into the volume due to the high surface area‐to‐volume ratio. Microrobots with both shape morphing and enhanced magnetically driven locomotion are fabricated by coating magnetic NPs on the surface of stimuli‐responsive hydrogel microstructures. It is experimentally demonstrated that surface coating ensures that the microstructure has not only an efficient locomotion but also an excellent deformability. A four‐claw microgripper is fabricated, which is smaller and has higher magnetically driven locomotion speed than the most existing shape morphing microrobots. This microgripper demonstrating carrying and delivery capabilities is of immediate interest to microobject manipulation and minimally invasive surgery.",

Despite these multiple functionalities, a broader utilization of such actuators is hindered by the high cost and equipment-intensive nature of currently available manufacturing processes. Herein, a simple fabrication route for magneto-responsive soft actuators is described using cost-effective and broadly available raw materials and equipment. The method utilizes castable silicone resins that are loaded with magnetic particles and subsequently magnetized under an external magnetic field. The experimental investigation of silicone-based composites prepared with particles of distinct chemistries, sizes, and morphologies enables the identification of the raw materials and magnetization conditions required for the process. This leads to functional soft actuators with programmable magnetic patterns that are capable of performing pick-and-place, lifting, catching, and moving tasks under the remote action of an external magnetic field. By removing manufacturing hurdles associated with costly raw materials and equipment, the proposed approach is expected to facilitate the design, implementation, and exploitation of the unique functionalities of magneto-controlled soft actuators in a wider number of applications.",

The properties of degradability and mechanical strength are contradictory for many materials used to make microrobots. This article proposes a new design that can result in 3D cell culture microrobots with improved degradability and mechanical strength from the following perspectives. First, the mechanical strength of a microrobot is improved using triangle patterns to replace hexagon pattern in the microrobot structure, which can provide more supporting grids to obtain increased mechanical strength. Second, the relationship between structural design and material composition in relation to the mechanical strength of microrobot is investigated. The study reveals that triangle‐patterned microrobots have increased mechanical strength compared with hexagon‐patterned microrobots, thereby allowing high composition of degradable material that leads to the fast degradation of the microrobot. It is also shown that the triangle‐patterned microrobots can maintain the same structural integrity and cell capacity as hexagon‐patterned microrobots. Finally, the demonstration shows that the triangle‐patterned microrobot can be precisely navigated in microfluidic channels. This article successfully demonstrates that the degradability and mechanical strength can be improved simultaneously through the microrobot structural design.",

This added bulk can often hinder a robot's ability to be untethered, perform complex tasks, or bring challenges when it comes to maintenance or upgradeability. To address these limitations, herein, a simple and highly modular bidirectional soft robotic appendage is presented that integrates the pump, flow lines, and actuator into a compact, closed hydraulic system, which is driven by an integrated stepper motor, allowing for positional control and fast response times. The actuator can also be swapped in under five seconds, allowing for rapid reconfiguration. Each component has been thoroughly characterized to determine an overall electrical to mechanical efficiency of the system, and from these calculations, it is demonstrated that the actuator utilizes only 1/15th the required energy to achieve a specific bending angle, and is four‐fold more power‐efficient than similar‐sized soft actuators and pumping systems reported in the literature. The integrated actuator and fluidic engine construct presented here thus represents a major departure from previous soft actuator control platforms in that everything is simplified down to a single self‐contained unit, demonstrating unparalleled versatility and modularity.",

To enable robust tracking with pulsatile flow, a tracking strategy consisting of tracking in and perpendicular to the image plane is designed.

Herein, a method that exploits the dynamic coupling between soft structures and a water medium to allow for the transfer of computation to spatially distant locations is proposed. This technique is implemented by introducing the concept of remote reservoirs that can autonomously alter their physical constituents in real time rather than using reservoirs with predefined, fixed physical constituents. These remote reservoirs self‐organize by including many ad hoc physical substrates in the environment, making the framework more flexible for soft robotic applications. Using a simple experimental platform consisting of silicone rubber strips containing embedded flexible strain sensors, it is demonstrated that the dynamics of passive silicone rubber strips located at a distance from the actuation point can be successfully exploited for computation through generalized synchronization realized via the medium of water. Future application scenarios are illustrated, in which the proposed technique is applied in emergency situations as a communication tool for transferring a message to a location that humans cannot easily access.

    "abstract": "Miniaturization of polymeric robots leads to difficulties in actuation inside viscous media due to the increased surface drag on the diminutive robot bodies. Herein, agile underwater swimming of polymeric microrobots is presented with the investigation of correlation between the magnetic propulsion and viscous drag on the robot. The polymeric microrobots swim with pivoting and tumbling motions during underwater rotation by in‐plane rotation of two permanent magnets underneath the plane, which results in orbital revolution‐type locomotion with a maximum swimming velocity of 56 body lengths per second (BL s −1 ). The rotational ability and orbital velocity of the polymeric microrobots are determined by correlated variables, i.e., liquid viscosity and frequency of magnet rotation, as elucidated by experimental results and theoretical analysis. Based on the understanding of underwater orbital maneuvers, the polymeric microrobots achieve agile swimmability at a viscosity similar to that of normal whole blood and self‐correcting maneuverability in diverse vascular‐like environments, including a stenosed tube with a coarse granular hill and a rough‐walled artificial blood vessel. Agile underwater swimming can improve versatile aquatic performances of miniaturized robots in blood vessels with arteriosclerosis or blood clots.",

However, the introduction of connection mechanisms will always either reduce the structural compliance or need extra actuation appendages, resulting in the complexity of the structure and system of the robot. To address these issues, herein, a compliant and passive connection strategy is demonstrated, which is accomplished utilizing the reclosable fasteners (RFs), and other varieties including hook‐and‐loop fasteners, as the connection mechanisms to the soft modules for the rapid assembly of various soft machines. The module is a pneumatic soft actuator with both ends designed with a multifaceted structure to attach the RFs in different orientations, resulting in various assembling patterns, including linear connection, orthogonal connection, and oblique connection. Moreover, an alignment mechanism is also designed to improve the alignment precision between two assembled modules. The versatility of the RF enables soft modules capable of assembling not only between identical modules but also with diverse additional accessories for various application scenarios. Different functional assemblies are demonstrated including soft grippers, soft walking robots, and shape‐morphing electrical devices. This approach to the connection mechanisms provides routes to new modular soft robots and devices.",

This technique does not require the use of exogenous contrast agents. The technique can be effectively used to realize endogenous and exogenous imaging of microvasculature. However, the depth of focus (DOF) realized using OR‐PAM is low and inadequate to cover the entire 3D data for microvasculature imaging. A varying extent of signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) is recorded when varying depths of the 3D sample are studied. This significantly hindered the processes of image recognition, segmentation, and analysis. Herein, a deep learning‐based OR‐PAM technique to image and analyze 3D datasets is proposed. Endogenous and exogenous multi‐organ imaging data are sequentially imaged and segmented, and excellent generalization ability is observed. Wide‐field and ultradense exogenous 3D imaging of mouse brain vasculature located at different depths is obtained and segmented by OR‐PAM for the first time. The results reveal that the proposed method can be used for effectively imaging the entire microvasculature. The method can be potentially used for imaging the microcirculation system in clinics.",

The application of deep learning (DL) methods to detect recurrent RD with ultra‐widefield (UWF) fundus images is promising, but the feasibility and efficiency have not been studied. A DL system with ResNet‐50 and Inception‐ResNet‐V2 is developed and internally validated to identify recurrent RD and retina reattachment after surgery. The performance is further validated and compared with human ophthalmologists in a prospective dataset assessed by area under curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Five hundred fifty‐four UWF fundus images from 173 RD patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 39.2 ± 16.2 years; male: 115 [66.5%]) are used to develop the DL system. DL shows AUCs of 0.912 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.855–0.968) and 0.906 (95% CI: 0.818–0.995) for the two models. Eighty‐nine UWF fundus images from 23 RD patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 31.4 ± 12.3 years; male: 15 [65.2%]) are collected as prospective dataset. DL also shows the ability to detect recurrent RD with the AUCs of 0.929 and 0.930 for the two models, respectively.

Soft materials offer innovative opportunities to develop robotic manipulators that are inherently compliant, physically robust, and interact safely with humans. Herein, a soft‐material‐based musculoskeletal module is reported. Inspired by the human shoulder complex, a lightweight and compact three‐degree‐of‐freedom (three‐DOF) membrane‐covered passive joint with a large range of motion (&gt;180°) in all DOFs, small rotational resistance (&lt;0.2 Nm), and large axial load‐bearing capacity (&gt;80 N) benefiting from the hydrostatic stress of its filled liquid is developed. To actuate the joint, a helical‐structured pneumatic artificial muscle fiber (HPAMF) with a high energy density of 36 J kg −1 is designed. Moreover, it is investigated how to eliminate the Mullins effect of fibers made from silicone rubber to increase the repeatability and consistency between fibers and ensure the musculoskeletal system achieves stable motion by overcoming the snap‐through instability. Finally, the musculoskeletal system achieves open‐loop controlled three‐DOF motion with load‐bearing capacity in a compact space via pre‐stretching and antagonistic arrangement of 60 HPAMFs as 12 independent bundles. It is believed that the proposed musculoskeletal module can be assembled and developed as a soft manipulator to assist people in their activities of daily living.",

    "abstract": "Crossbars of resistive memories, or memristors, provide a road to reduce the energy consumption of artificial neural networks, by naturally implementing multiply accumulate operations, their most basic calculations. However, a major challenge of implementing robust hardware neural networks is the conductance instability over time of resistive memories, due to the local recombination of oxygen vacancies. This effect causes resistive memory‐based neural networks to rapidly lose accuracy, an issue that is sometimes overlooked. Herein, this conductance instability issue is shown, which can be avoided without changing the material stack of the resistive memory by exploiting an original programming strategy. This technique relies on program‐and‐verify loops with appropriately chosen wait times and ensures that the resistive memories are programmed into states with stable filaments. To test the strategy, a 32 × 32 in‐memory computing system, fabricated in a hybrid complementary metal‐oxide‐semiconductor (CMOS)/hafnium oxide technology, is programmed to classify heart arrhythmia from electrocardiogram. When the resistive memories are programmed conventionally, the system loses accuracy within hours. In contrast, when using this technique, the system maintains an accuracy of 95% over more than 2 months. These results highlight the potential of resistive memory for the implementation of low‐power neural networks with long‐term stability.",

    "abstract": "The interest in soft pneumatic actuators has been growing rapidly in robotics, owing to the contact adaptability with the material softness. However, these actuators are mostly controlled by rigid electronic pneumatic valves, which can hardly be integrated into the robot itself, limiting its mobility and adaptability. Recent advances in soft or electronics‐free valve designs provide the potential to achieve an integrated soft robotic system with reduced weight and rigidity. Nevertheless, the challenge in valve response remains open. To enable dynamic control of a soft pneumatic actuator (SPA), a fast‐response proportional valve is needed. Herein, the potential of Ecoflex‐based magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) membrane to create a proportional valve that can be used in the control of a soft robot made from the same silicone material is explored. Experimental characterization shows that the proposed MRE valve (30 mm × 30 mm × 15 mm, 30 grams) can hold pressure up to 41.3 kPa and regulate the airflow in an analog manner. The valve is used to perform closed‐loop proportional–integral–differential (PID) control with 50 Hz on a SPA and is able to control the pressure within the actuator chamber with a root‐mean‐square error of 0.05 kPa.",

However, the sensitivity loss at large strain and the complicated process of fabrication technology limit related applications. Herein, inspired by gradient and hierarchical structures in biological systems and using porous materials with different stiffness, a capacitive flexible sensor with both proximity and pressure sensing abilities is proposed. Such hierarchical structures effectively reduce the attenuation of sensitivity as the pressure increases, realizing an ultrawide detection range with high sensitivity. A theoretical mathematical model is developed and the corresponding capacitive sensor is fabricated by using the high‐performance porous impregnated dust‐free paper as the electrode and expandable polyethylene (EPE)/loofah‐like polyurethane sponge (LPS) as double‐layer porous dielectric. This sensor has an ultrawide detection range up to 3000 kPa with a significantly low sensitivity loss of 0.0195% kPa −1 and the noncontact sensing mode reaches a sensing range up to 28 cm (0.122 cm −1 ). Notably, a strategy is provided to design the high sensitivity sensor over an ultrawide detection range from approaching to pressuring, and eventually its promising application is presented as human–computer interaction.",

Herein, a Peano‐hydraulically amplified self‐healing electrostatic actuator is constructed by innovatively integrating a bilayer polymer shell for combined favorable properties of high dielectric strength, dielectric permittivity, and elastic modulus. Compared with a traditional single‐layer shell actuator, the new bilayer actuator architecture generates an increased strain (164%) at 5 kV and improves load‐bearing capability (620 mN) at 6 kV, thereby providing a significantly enhanced actuation performance. The new actuator is further applied in driving a ratchet system, which converts the reciprocating motion of the actuator into a rotating motion and a flexible output torque, in order to protect the rotating components from impact. The high strain and load characteristics of the bilayer configuration and the easy‐to‐deform characteristics of the new actuator design make it an attractive approach to fabricate complex geometries and achieve a variety of motion modes in soft systems.",

Although extraordinarily successful at completing intended mission goals, because of the limitations of wheeled locomotion, they have been largely limited to benign, solid terrain and avoided extreme terrain with loose soil/sand and large rocks. Unfortunately, such challenging terrain is often scientifically interesting for planetary geology. Although many animals traverse such terrain at ease, robots have not matched their performance and robustness. This is in major part due to a lack of fundamental understanding of how effective locomotion can be generated from controlled interaction with complex terrain on the same level of flight aerodynamics and underwater vehicle hydrodynamics. Early fundamental understanding of legged and limbless locomotor-ground interaction has already enabled stable and efficient bio-inspired robot locomotion on relatively flat ground with small obstacles. Recent progress in the new field of terradynamics of locomotor-terrain interaction begins to reveal the principles of bio-inspired locomotion on loose soil/sand and over large obstacles. Multi-legged and limbless platforms using terradynamics insights hold the promise for serving as robust alternative platforms for traversing extreme extraterrestrial terrain and expanding our reach in planetary exploration.",

Lasers have already become a widespread tool in numerous surgical applications. They are proposed as a replacement for traditional tools (i.e., scalpels and electrocautery devices) to minimize surgical trauma, decrease healing times, and reduce the risk of postoperative complications. Compared to other energy sources, laser energy is wavelength‐dependent, allowing for preferential energy absorption in specific tissue types. This potentially leads to minimizing damage to healthy tissue and increasing surgical outcomes control and quality. Merging robotic control with laser techniques can help physicians achieve more accurate laser aiming and pave the way to automatic control of laser–tissue interactions in closed loop. Herein, a review of the state‐of‐the‐art robotic systems for laser surgery is presented. The goals of this paper are to present recent contributions in advanced intelligent systems for robot‐assisted laser surgery, provide readers with a better understanding of laser optics and the physics of laser–tissue interactions, discuss clinical applications of lasers in surgery, and provide guidance for future systems design.",

Combined with theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, the origami structure is adopted which exhibits a high recoverability compared with the flat structure because the design finds a structure–material balance by increasing structural flexural rigidity (2 times of that flat structure) for improving the restoring force while maintaining the deformation of materials within the elastic region during the actuation. The three modules in the origami actuator are independent and perform their functions individually. The combined system can also become a module that provides a driving force in other devices.

By leveraging the contact interference of the ridges and tensioning of the ligaments, the lateral stiffness of the BSH finger can be autonomously enhanced through finger flexion. During its natural stage, the lateral stiffness is relatively low to ensure mobility and compliance, while in its flexion stage, its lateral stiffness can increase to resist lateral deflection and high payload. To further investigate the advantages of the design, four BSH fingers are assembled into a robotic hand prototype with three grasping types including enveloping grasp, precise pinch, and power grasp. Experimental results demonstrate that the robotic hand prototype is capable of grasping various objects with a wide range of diameters, lengths, thicknesses, and weights, which will verify the effectiveness of the design methodology.",

    "abstract": "There are millions of amputees worldwide, and amputation has significantly affected their lives. People with hand losses have difficulties performing the activities of daily living (ADLs). Prosthetic hands have been developed to perform the functions of a human hand by grasping various objects. However, mimicking the actual grasping function of a human hand is still an unresolved research topic. Researchers continue to improve the functionality of hand prostheses to create more efficient and closer to human motion. Herein, the current challenges and approaches for enhancing the grasping function of 3D‐printed hand prostheses are investigated. Three technology sectors are discussed for the efficient grasping motion of hand prosthetics: 1) how to recognize the user's desired grasping gestures by sensing systems; 2) how to power the prosthesis for grasping objects through different actuation systems; and 3) how to perform the grasping motion by 3D design and mechanisms. This article reviews valuable information regarding the current innovations toward improving prosthetic hands’ grasping function to help researchers design more functional hand prostheses.",

    "abstract": "Event cameras are emerging vision sensors and their advantages are suitable for various applications such as autonomous robots. Contrast maximization (CMax), which provides state‐of‐the‐art accuracy on motion estimation using events, may suffer from an overfitting problem called event collapse. Prior works are computationally expensive or cannot alleviate the overfitting, which undermines the benefits of the CMax framework. A novel, computationally efficient regularizer based on geometric principles to mitigate event collapse is proposed. The experiments show that the proposed regularizer achieves state‐of‐the‐art accuracy results, while its reduced computational complexity makes it two to four times faster than previous approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this regularizer is the only effective solution for event collapse without trading off the runtime. It is hoped that this work opens the door for future applications that unlocks the advantages of event cameras. Project page: https://github.com/tub‐rip/event_collapse",

To maximize the heat‐induced change in curvature, the thermal expansion shall be large in one and small in the other material. Semicrystalline polymers display a large nonlinear thermal expansion across their melting transition, but as their mechanical integrity is lost upon melting, they cannot readily be used in bilayer actuators. To overcome this limitation, segmented polyurethanes (PUs) with crystallizable polyethylene glycol (PEG) soft segments and hard segments formed by the reaction of 1,6‐hexane diisocyanate and 1,4‐butanediol (BDO) is developed. The latter serve as physical cross‐links and inhibit flow at temperatures where the domains formed by the PEG segments have melted. The molecular weight of the PEG segments and the hard‐segment content in the polymer are systematically varied. As the nonlinear expansion of the PEG–PUs is associated with the melting of the crystalline PEG domains, the thermal expansion of these materials is correlated with their crystallinity and is highest for the polymers with the lowest BDO content and the highest PEG molecular weight. Electro‐thermally controlled bilayer bending actuators based on the new materials display high deflection and low switching temperatures.",

This data can be utilized to develop mathematical ecology models to understand the impact of climate change on the habitat. In case of drone malfunction, the incorporated materials can threaten vulnerable environments. The recent introduction of transient robotics enables the development of biodegradable, environmental‐sensing drones capable of degrading in their environment. However, manufacturing methods for environmental‐sensing transient drones are rarely discussed. Herein, a manufacturing framework and material selection process featuring biopolymer‐based, high‐strength composite cryogels, and printed carbon‐based electronics for transient drones are highlighted. It is found that gelatin‐ and cellulose‐based cryogels mechanically outperform other biopolymer composites while having a homogeneous microstructure and high stiffness‐to‐weight ratio. The selected materials are used to manufacture a flying‐wing air‐frame, while the incorporated sensing skin is capable of measuring the elevons’ deflection angles as well as ambient temperature. It is demonstrated in the results how gelatin–cellulose cryogels can be used to manufacture lightweight transient drones, while printing carbon‐conductive electronics is a viable method for designing sustainable, integrated sensors. The proposed methods can be used to guide the development of lightweight and rapidly degrading robots, featuring eco‐friendly sensing capabilities.

The working of the actuator is based on an electrohydraulic principle, which is similar to that of hydraulically amplified self‐healing electrostatic actuators. The actuator developed in this study consists of a dielectric film made of polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate ‐co ‐terephthalate (PBAT), with soybean oil as the dielectric liquid and electrodes made from a mixture of gelatin, glycerol, and sodium chloride (NaCl). The synthesized biodegradable electrode material exhibits a Young's modulus of 0.06 MPa and resistivity of 258 Ω·m when the mass fraction of NaCl relative to the amount of gelatin and glycerol is 10 wt%. The softness and resistivity of the electrode material results in actuation strain values of 3.2% (at 1 kV, corresponding to 1.2 kV mm −1 ) and 18.6% (at 10 kV, corresponding to 9.6 kV mm −1 ) for the linear‐type and circular‐type actuators, respectively.

Herein, this bio‐inspired intelligent strategy is integrated into a soft pneumatic gripper for transporting dispersed granules. To evaluate the critical actuation pressures while grasping granules, a library is constructed experimentally, and the effects of the initial relative height and relative lifting speed on the grasping success rate are examined. It is indicated in the experimental results that this trunk‐inspired robotic strategy leads to a success rate of over 90% and saves ≈50% duration of manipulation compared to the individual gripping fashion.

A dataset of transmission spectra and structural parameters of NAs is generated using finite‐difference time‐domain (FDTD) calculations and is converted to vivid structural colors using the corresponding transmission spectrum. A bidirectional neural network is used to train the transmission spectrum and structural color together. The accuracy of predicting the structural parameters using a desired spectrum is tested and found to be up to 0.99, with a determination coefficient of reproducing the desired spectrum and color to be 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. These values are higher compared to those when only training for spectrum, but requiring less training time. This strategy is able to inverse design the NAs in less than 1 s to maximize surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement by matching transmission resonance and laser excitation wavelength, and accurately regenerate colored images in 7.5 s, allowing for nanoscale printing at a resolution of approximately 100 000 dots in −1 .

    "abstract": "The advancement of future large-scale wireless networks necessitates the development of cost-effective and scalable security solutions. Conventional cryptographic methods, due to their computational and key management complexity, are unable to fulfill the low-latency and scalability requirements of these networks. Physical layer (PHY) security has been put forth as a cost-effective alternative to cryptographic mechanisms that can circumvent the need for explicit key exchange between communication devices, owing to the fact that PHY security relies on the physics of the signal transmission for providing security. In this work, a space-time-modulated digitally-coded metamaterial (MTM) leaky wave antenna (LWA) is proposed that can enable PHY security by achieving the functionalities of directional modulation (DM) using a machine learning-aided branch and bound (B&B) optimized coding sequence. From the theoretical perspective, it is first shown that the proposed space-time MTM antenna architecture can achieve DM through both the spatial and spectral manipulation of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal received by a user equipment. Simulation results are then provided as proof-of-principle, demonstrating the applicability of our approach for achieving DM in various communication settings. To further validate our simulation results, a prototype of the proposed architecture controlled by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is realized, which achieves DM via an optimized coding sequence carried out by the learning-aided branch-and-bound algorithm corresponding to the states of the MTM LWA's unit cells. Experimental results confirm the theory behind the space-time-modulated MTM LWA in achieving DM, which is observed via both the spectral harmonic patterns and bit error rate (BER) measurements.",

Recent advancements in deep learning, data mining, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have paved the way for exploring new 2D material candidates. Herein, a generative material design pipeline known as the material transformer generator (MTG) is proposed. MTG leverages two distinct 2D material composition generators, both trained using self‐learning neural language models rooted in transformers, with and without transfer learning. These models generate numerous potential 2D compositions, which are plugged into established templates for known 2D materials to predict their crystal structures. To ensure stability, DFT computations assess their thermodynamic stability based on energy‐above‐hull and formation energy metrics. MTG has found four new DFT‐validated stable 2D materials: NiCl 4 , IrSBr, CuBr 3 , and CoBrCl, all with zero energy‐above‐hull values that indicate thermodynamic stability. Additionally, GaBrO and NbBrCl 3 are found with energy‐above‐hull values below 0.05 eV. CuBr 3 and GaBrO exhibit dynamic stability, confirmed by phonon dispersion analysis. In summary, the MTG pipeline shows significant potential for discovering new 2D and functional materials.",

Organisms are able to navigate such unstructured environments with the ability to rapidly change shape, move swiftly in multiple locomotion modes, and do this efficiently and reversibly without external power sources, feats which are difficult for robots. Herein, a bio‐inspired latch‐mediated, spring‐actuated (LaMSA) morphing mechanism is harnessed to near‐instantaneously and reversibly reconfigure a multifunctional robot to achieve driving and flying configurations.

The adaptive robotic vehicle can move through confined spaces and rough terrain which are difficult to pass by driving or flying alone, and expands the potential range through power savings in the driving mode. This work provides a powerful scheme for LaMSA in robots, in which controlled, small‐scale LaMSA systems can be integrated as individual components to robots of all sizes to enable new functionalities and enhance performance.",

In addition, to combine the two signals of the sensor (the resistance changes of the heaters) and predict the output (airflow rate), three different ML multivariate regression models, i.e., multiple linear regression (MLR), k‐nearest neighbor (KNN), and deep neural network (DNN) models, are trained and compared using 8400 experimentally obtained data. Using sensor fusion techniques, the average mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) of the KNN model are determined to be 0.01522 and 0.00132, respectively, in the range of 0–5.07 standard liters per minute. Compared with the average results obtained using only a single input, those obtained using a dual input indicate a significant decrease in the MAE and MSE by 85.69% and 96.68%, respectively. Furthermore, a transient analysis of the ML‐based flow sensor is conducted to investigate the response time and transient characteristics of the MLR, KNN, and DNN models. The results of this study contribute to the advancement of airflow management systems for various industrial applications, such as building ventilation, gas leakage detection, and energy systems.",

However, a comprehensive understanding of the physics behind it is lacking due to the limited development of theoretical models and insufficient experimental data to validate them. This article proposes a new and systematic approach based on electrical impedance measurements to infer the electrostatic forces between two dielectric materials under EA. The proposed approach is applied to tactile displays, where skin and voltage‐induced touchscreen impedances are measured and subtracted from the total impedance to obtain the remaining impedance to estimate the electrostatic forces between the finger and the touchscreen. This approach also marks the first instance of experimental estimation of the average air gap thickness between a human finger and a voltage‐induced capacitive touchscreen. Moreover, the effect of electrode polarization impedance on EA is investigated. Precise measurements of electrical impedances confirm that electrode polarization impedance exists in parallel with the impedance of the air gap, particularly at low frequencies, giving rise to the commonly observed charge leakage phenomenon in EA.",

This study compares three manipulation modes: a traditional mode using 2D displays, VR mode using a VR headset and touch controllers, and VR autonomous programmed maneuvering. It is shown that VR‐assisted modes reduce the manipulation time by improving spatial awareness. Nanoparticles in a VR environment are also manipulated. The proposed method will find applications in terms of intuitive, immersive microrobots or magnetic nanoparticle control in complex biological environments, thus in many medical procedures and for drug and cell delivery. The immersive nature of this approach enhances the ability of the user to perceive and understand complex anatomical structures, facilitating better navigation within delicate environments; both dexterity and spatial awareness are improved.

Thus, soft fluidic actuators have seen an expansion in their fields of application. Closed‐cycle hydraulic systems are pressure agnostic, enabling their deployment in extremely high‐pressure conditions, such as deep‐sea environments. However, soft actuators have not been widely adopted on unmanned underwater vehicle control surfaces for deep‐sea exploration due to their unpredictable hydrodynamic behavior when camber‐morphing is applied. This study presents the design and characterization of a soft wing and investigates its feasibility for integration into an underwater glider. It is found that the morphing wing enables the glider to adjust the lift‐to‐drag ratio to adapt to different flow conditions. At the operational angle of attack of 12.5°, the lift‐to‐drag ratio ranges from −70% to +10% compared to a rigid version. Furthermore, it reduces the need for internal moving parts and increases maneuverability. The findings lay the groundwork for the real‐world deployment of soft robotic principles capable of outperforming existing rigid systems. With the herein‐described methods, soft morphing capabilities can be enabled on other vehicles.",

This study introduces a multi‐modal and multi‐scale feature fusion (MMFF) framework, a new framework for automating gait dysfunction assessment in children with CP.

This study presents a new support vector machine model for pose classification, called “ClassyPose”, which predicts the probability that a receptor‐bound ligand conformation could be near‐native, without any additional pose optimization step. Trained on protein‐ligand extended connectivity features extracted from over 21 600 crystal and docking poses of diverse ligands, this model outperformed other machine‐learning algorithms and three existing SFs in terms of docking power, identifying the native ligand pose as top‐ranked solution for more than 90% of entries in two test sets. It also achieved high specificity (above 0.96), and improved VS performance when used for pose selection.

    "abstract": "Histopathology image analysis plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis. However, training a clinically applicable segmentation algorithm requires pathologists to engage in labor‐intensive labeling. In contrast, weakly supervised learning methods, which only require coarse‐grained labels at the image level, can significantly reduce the labeling efforts. Unfortunately, while these methods perform reasonably well in slide‐level prediction, their ability to locate cancerous regions, which is essential for many clinical applications, remains unsatisfactory. Previously, CAMEL is proposed, which achieves comparable results to those of fully supervised baselines in pixel‐level segmentation. However, CAMEL requires 1280 × 1280 image‐level binary annotations for positive WSIs. Here, CAMEL2 is presented, by introducing a threshold of the cancerous ratio for positive bags, it allows one to better utilize the information, consequently enabling us to scale up the image‐level setting from 1280 × 1280 to 5120 × 5120 while maintaining accuracy. The results with various datasets demonstrate that CAMEL2, with the help of 5120 × 5120 image‐level binary annotations, which are easy to annotate, achieves comparable performance to that of a fully supervised baseline in both instance‐ and slide‐level classifications.",

Herein, a novel design and rapid fabrication by 3D printing of a mechano‐optic force sensor with a large dynamic range, sensitivity, and linear response, enabled by metamaterials‐based structures, is presented. A simple approach for programming the metamaterial's behavior based on mathematical modeling of the sensor under dynamic loading is proposed. Machine learning models are utilized to predict the complete force–deformation profile, encompassing the linear range, the onset of nonlinear behavior, and the slope of profiles in both bending and compression‐dominated regions. The design supports seamless integration of the sensor into soft grippers, enabling 3D printing of the soft gripper with an embedded sensor in a single step, thus overcoming the tedious and complex and multiple fabrication steps commonly applied in conventional processes. The sensor boasts a fine resolution of 0.015 N, a measurement range up to 16 N, linearity (adj. R 2 –0.991), and delivers consistent performance beyond 100 000 cycles. The sensitivity and range of the embedded mechano‐optic force sensor can be easily programmed by both the metamaterial structure and the material's properties.",

While existing techniques struggle to learn useful representations from the temporal correlations, the high dimensionality in spatial domain is always considered as obstacle, leading to the curse of dimensionality and excessive resource consumption. This work designs a novel structure‐aware reservoir computing aiming at enhancing the predictability of coupled time series, by incorporating their historical dynamics as well as structural information. Paralleled reservoir computers with redesigned mixing inputs based on spatial relationships are implemented to cope with the multiple time series, whose core idea originates from the principle of the celebrated Granger causality.

This study is proposed to address the independent control of multiple magnetic millirobots using an array of electromagnetic coils. Herein, each of the fabricated magnetic millirobots is magnetized with a dissimilar magnetization profile. Further, these millirobots are independently controlled using the mentioned magnetization strategy in addition to the supply of controlled current to each electromagnetic coil. To explore the physics of this combined stepwise approach in controlling the millirobots, theoretical and numerical investigations are carried out that further ensure the practical significance for broad applications. For demonstration purposes, three different shear‐induced flow manipulation experiments, including the particle manipulation task, fluid color transition task, and micromixing task, are conducted using more than one millirobot with distinct motions. A maximum of three millirobots controlled with different motions are employed in the micromixing task, and further, it is observed to achieve nearly 80% mixing efficiency within 45 s. The presented work with the introduced actuation system and motion control strategies can strengthen the existing methods of small‐scale robots for various applications, particularly for tasks that demand multiple millirobots.",

Herein, threshold switching in oxyvanite (V 3 O 5 ) memristors and their application as a leaky integrate‐and‐fire (LIF) neuron are explored. The spiking response of individual neurons is examined as a function of circuit parameters, input pulse train, and temperature and reveals a pulse height‐dependent spike rate in which devices exhibit excitatory spiking behavior under low input voltages and protective inhibition spiking under high voltages. Resistively coupled LIF neurons are shown to exhibit additional neural functionalities (i.e., phasic, regular and adaptation, etc.) depending on the input voltage and circuit parameters. The behavior of both individual and coupled neurons is shown to be described by a physics‐based lumped element circuit model, which therefore provides a solid foundation for exploring more complex systems. Finally, the performance of a perceptron SNN employing these LIF neurons is assessed by simulating the classification of image recognition algorithm. These results advance the development of robust solid‐state neurons with low power consumption for neuromorphic computing.",

Liquid metals (LMs), known for their high deformability and tunable morphology, demonstrate remarkable actuating capabilities through controllable surface tension. Inspired by the predation method of chameleons, this work introduces a bioinspired LM actuator (BLMA) by modulating the morphology of LM. This BLMA enables high‐strain (up to 170%) actuation by precisely directing LM droplets toward an electrode. Various parameters affecting the BLMA's actuating performance are explored. Notably, the application of a reductive voltage induces rapid solidification of supercooled LM, facilitating phase transition at room temperature. The solidified LM enhances its holding force of BLMA by over 1000 times. To underscore the superior capabilities of the BLMA, diverse applications, such as a complex two‐dimensional plane actuator, a stepper motor with adjustable step intervals, a phase transition‐controlled relay, and a laser code lock actuation gate set, are presented. It is anticipated that the exceptional characteristics of the BLMA will propel advancements in the realms of soft robotics and mechatronics.",

However, current neuroimaging techniques face several challenges when it comes to imaging the deep brain. These challenges include limited imaging depth, a narrow field of view, low resolution, and a lack of real‐time imaging and stereotactic deployment capabilities. To address these challenges, a patient‐mounted neuro optical coherence tomography (neuroOCT) system that combines a lightweight 5 degrees‐of‐freedom skull‐mounted robot (Skullbot) with a neuroendoscope measuring ≈0.6 mm in diameter is introduced. This innovative system enables targeted and minimally invasive neuroimaging with an axial resolution of ≈2.4 μm and a transverse resolution of around 4.5 μm. The Skullbot can be securely attached to the head and precisely deploys the neuroendoscope with an accuracy of ±1.5 mm in the transverse direction and ±0.25 mm in the longitudinal direction. This allows for motion‐insensitive stereotactic imaging within the brain. By utilizing the neuroOCT system, targeted imaging of a tumor in a brain phantom is successfully demonstrated. Furthermore, the system's capability for in vivo micro‐resolution volumetric neuroimaging of fine structures within a mouse brain is validated.",

Initially, the concept of a virtual surface is introduced, which is assumed to be at some constant distance from the desired end‐effector trajectory. This virtual surface generates a virtual contact force when interacting with the torque‐controlled robot end‐effector. The interaction is then manipulated using an impedance control model to track a constant desired force. If the robot end‐effector deviates from the desired trajectory, the constant force‐tracking impedance control generates a compliance trajectory that regulates the end‐effector movements, constraining it to the desired trajectory. For robust force tracking, impedance parameters are optimally tuned using a closed‐loop dynamic model incorporating both robot and impedance dynamics. Additionally, super twisting sliding mode control (STSMC) is integrated to overcome uncertainties and the impact of robot dynamics on force‐tracking performance. Experimental validation confirms the theoretical claims of the proposed approach. It demonstrates that force‐tracking impedance control improves the end‐effector trajectory tracking by quickly reacting to the dynamic trajectories compared to position control only and effectively maintains it on the desired trajectories.",

Moreover, the memristive circuit in the vehicle demonstrates a very short response latency (≈56 ns) to input sensory information. Herein, an alternative promising solution to build self‐adaptive robots and pave the way for the realization of autonomous robots based on memristive neuromorphic circuits is offered.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the performance of rechargeable batteries in real time is of great importance to battery research and industrial production, and hence has been a long pursuit. Previously, sophisticated apparatus is required to measure indicator properties of performance, while machine learning approaches based on feature engineering procedures require a priori expertise that is challenged by the complicated environment of real‐world applications. Here, for a more effective real‐time prediction of battery life and failure, a novel end‐to‐end unsupervised machine learning approach is shown; this approach is free from feature engineering and uses only the raw images of the charge–discharge voltage profiles. This model enables unsupervised real‐time automatic extraction of latent physical factors that control the performance of Na‐ion batteries to classify good or bad cycling performance by using only the voltage profile of the first cycle. This model can also monitor the safety of Li‐metal battery systems by giving warnings when the battery is approaching a failure. With the beyond expert‐level prediction ability, the abovementioned framework can be a promising prototype to further develop and enable high accuracy predictions of battery performance for real‐world applications in the future.",

    "abstract": "The use of active materials for the actuators in soft robots allows for safe interactions and adaptable locomotion. However, stimulating the behavior of soft robots as well as reprogramming them and implementing reversible control in them remains a challenge. Herein, a method for fabricating soft, bio‐inspired, untethered, infrared‐driven actuators that exhibit reversible and reprogrammable behaviors is proposed. By exploiting the mismatch in the infrared‐driven thermomechanical responses of the two active materials constituting the bilayered soft actuator, reversible actuation can be realized. More importantly, the shape of robots based on this actuator can be reprogrammed such that they exhibit bio‐inspired locomotion specific to the environment. For instance, a soft robot based on the actuator can be made to exhibit several bio‐inspired functions, such as crawling, rolling, and object manipulation, in a complex environment. Furthermore, reversible and reprogrammable actuation can be achieved in untethered soft bio‐inspired robots using the bilayer of infrared‐actuated thermoresponsive materials, suggesting that other materials with similar properties can also be adopted in a similar method. The proposed method allows for the integration of different active materials toward the realization of infrared‐driven, untethered reversible, and reprogrammable actuators for soft bio‐inspired robots.",

    "abstract": "Stimuli responsive self‐folding structures with 2D layered materials (2DLMs) are important for flexible electronics, wearables, biosensors, bioelectronics, and photonics. Previously, strategies have been developed to self‐fold 2D materials to form various robots, sensors, and actuators. Still, there are limitations with scalability and a lack of design tools to obtain complex structures for reversible actuation, high integration, and reliable function. Herein, a mass‐producible strategy for creating monolayer graphene‐based reversible self‐folding structures using either gradient or differentially cross‐linked films of a negative epoxy photoresist widely used in microfluidics and micromechanical systems, namely, SU8 is demonstrated. Wafer‐scale patterning and integration of complex and functional devices in the form of rings, polyhedra, flowers, and bidirectionally folded origami birds are achieved. Also, gold (Au) electrodes to realize functional graphene–Au Schottky interfaces with enhanced photoresponse and 3D angle sensitive detection are integrated. The experiments are guided and rationalized by theoretical methods including coarse‐grained models, specifically developed for the tunable mechanics of this photoresist that simulate the folding dynamics, and finite element method (FEM) electromagnetic simulations. This work suggests a comprehensive framework for the rational design and scalable fabrication of complex 3D self‐actuating optical and electronic devices through the folding of 2D monolayer graphene.",

The building block is a multifunctional stimuli‐responsive nanoactuator that consists of a magnetized gold nanorod encapsulated by a thermoresponsive hydrogel. The metallic core serves as a photonic nanoheater that transduces thermal energy from near‐infrared (NIR) light and a magnetic nanomotor that generates motion while driven by magnetic fields. Rapid control of temperature enables collective manipulation of nanoactuators through thermocapillary flows. In addition, catalytic activity of the nanorod instantiates a chemical reaction that covalently binds amine groups displayed on the surface of the surrounding soft gel capsule. A combination of optical and magnetic excitation realizes both reversible and permanent in situ assembly of microactuators within seconds that can perform both spatiotemporally controlled muscle‐like contraction (up to 30% strain) and motion. It is demonstrated that by linking nanoactuators with rationally designed compliant microstructures, more complex devices such as micromanipulators can be both fabricated and operated remotely. Colloidal assembly of microactuators ensures homogenous distribution of materials and functionality, thus preserving high performance provided by nanotechnology at multiple scales.",

The skin is an integration of sponge force sensors and pneumatic actuators. By altering the internal air pressure in pneumatic actuators, the developed robot skin can provide more than ten times tunable stiffness and sensitivity. In addition, the skin can reduce the peak force of the collision and achieve the actuating function. Using three‐dimensional printing and computer‐aided design, the skin is fabricated and attached to a collaborative robot conformally. Drawing upon the data acquisition and control system, the experiment for illustrating the applications of the CoboSkin is successfully performed. The skin provides the robot with multi‐functions, which are similar to the human muscle and skin attached to human bones.

As an important aspect of smart devices, the on‐demand output capability of flexible/stretchable electronic devices, characterized by stimulation or actuation, enables active feedback and interaction to form a closed‐loop system, in combination with versatile sensing capabilities. This review summarizes some of the most important progresses on the stimulating/actuating capabilities (e.g., electrical, thermal, mechanical, optical, and chemical stimulation) of flexible/stretchable electronics, covering different mechanisms of stimulation and actuation, as well as diverse venues of applications. The stimulating/actuating capabilities in flexible/stretchable electronics play crucial roles in driving both fundamental and applied advances in research, such as medical measurement, biological study, medical therapy, and human–machine interface. Most of the existing flexible/stretchable systems use functional components to fulfill the demand of stimulation and/or actuation, with intricate strategies for system integration. Sustained advances in mechanics design concepts and high‐performance materials are the key to ensuring the evolution of flexible/stretchable electronics with enhanced stimulation and actuation capabilities.

Existing hematology analyzers require labor‐intensive work and a panel of expensive reagents. Herein, an artificial‐intelligence‐enabled reagent‐free imaging hematology analyzer (AIRFIHA) modality is reported that can accurately classify subpopulations of leukocytes with minimal sample preparation. AIRFIHA is realized through training a two‐step residual neural network using label‐free images of isolated leukocytes acquired from a custom‐built quantitative phase microscope. By leveraging the rich information contained in quantitative phase images, not only high accuracy is achieved in differentiating B and T lymphocytes, but also CD4 and CD8 T cells are classified, therefore outperforming the classification accuracy of most current hematology analyzers. The performance of AIRFIHA in a randomly selected test set is validated and is cross‐validated across all blood donors. Due to its easy operation, low cost, and accurate discerning capability of complex leukocyte subpopulations, AIRFIHA is clinically translatable and can also be deployed in resource‐limited settings, e.g., during pandemic situations for the rapid screening of infectious diseases.",

The well‐defined micro/nanoporous gradient and patterned structures related to selective liquid stratification and interfacial diffusion favor the fast response and accurate programmable deformation of hydrogels under temperature stimuli. Inspiringly, this simple diffusion‐driven tactic can be perfectly applicable for different responsive hydrogels with programmable multifunctionality by adding functional nanomaterials into the diffusible liquid. This green, general, and facile diffusion‐driven strategy provides significant guidance for fabricating environmentally responsive hydrogels with tailorable functionality for their multipurpose applications in drug delivery, bioengineering, smart actuators, and soft robots.",

The method relies on quantitative stain‐free interferometric imaging, providing unique topographic structural and content maps of the cell, becoming available for the first time for clinical use, together with deep‐learning frameworks and least‐squares linear approximation. In the common clinical practice, only motility evaluation can be carried out on live human cells, while full morphological evaluation and DNA fragmentation assays require different staining protocols, and therefore cannot be performed on the same cell, resulting in inconsistencies in fertility evaluation. A clinic‐ready interferometric module is used to acquire dynamic sperm cells without chemical staining, together with deep learning to evaluate all three scores per cell with accuracy of 93.1%, 88%, and 90% for morphology, motility, and DNA fragmentation, respectively. It is shown that the expected number of cells that pass all three criteria based on the current evaluations performed separately does not correspond with the number of cells that pass all criteria, demonstrating the importance of the suggested method.

    "abstract": "Scene flow tracks the 3D motion of each point in adjacent point clouds. It provides fundamental 3D motion perception for autonomous driving and server robot. Although red green blue depth (RGBD) camera or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) capture discrete 3D points in space, the objects and motions usually are continuous in the macroworld. That is, the objects keep themselves consistent as they flow from the current frame to the next frame. Based on this insight, the generative adversarial networks (GAN) is utilized to self‐learn 3D scene flow without ground truth. The fake point cloud is synthesized from the predicted scene flow and the point cloud of the first frame. The adversarial training of the generator and discriminator is realized through synthesizing indistinguishable fake point cloud and discriminating the real point cloud and the synthesized fake point cloud. The experiments on Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) dataset show that our method realizes promising results. Just as human, the proposed method can identify the similar local structures of two adjacent frames even without knowing the ground truth scene flow. Then, the local correspondence can be correctly estimated, and further the scene flow is correctly estimated.

Inspired by nature's Marangoni‐propulsion principles, various Marangoni‐propulsion untethered micro‐robots are achieved to propel with small energy storage. For practical use of Marangoni‐propulsion micro‐robots, it is required to have the intelligence to detect the external environment. However, previous Marangoni‐propulsion micro‐robots integrated with wireless micro‐scale sensors that can sense the external environment and transmit the obtained information are not achieved. Herein, Marangoni propulsion micro‐robots integrated with a wireless photonic gel sensor for exploring the aquatic environment and transmitting the environmental information are proposed. The proposed micro‐robots can propel at the water–air interface by the Marangoni effect. The integrated photonic gel sensor can sense the external stimuli and transmit the information by the color change. In this research, the responsivity of the micro‐robots is evaluated by the propulsion velocity and the response time of the photonic gel. It is shown that the propulsion velocity is changed by the outlet area. The response time decreased as the diameter of the photonic gel decreased. Finally, it is demonstrated that the photonic gel sensor can dynamically sense the external stimuli while the micro‐robots propel.",

However, the deviation of the electrical behavior of memristors causes errors in the execution process of the stateful logic. Consequently, a reliability issue arises that must be carefully addressed. Here, a method of error detection and correction (EDC) based on memristor‐based stateful logic operation is proposed for the IMP stateful logic gate (PMR‐two‐2IMP). Leveraging the concept of redundancy, error detection is achieved with the assistance of a stateful NOR logic gate, while a composite stateful OR logic gate is used for error correction. In the simulated validation, the concept of redundancy is employed to improve the accuracy of EDC.

Studies have revealed neuronal spike‐rate adaptation owing to intrinsic plasticity that neurons will adapt to the spiking patterns and store the events in the background spiking through clustered neuronal spiking. The event can be reactivated by specific retrieval clues instead of solely relying on synaptic plasticity. However, the neural adaptation, as well as the interactive adaptations of neuronal activity for information processing, have not been implemented. Herein, an artificial adaptive neuron via in materia modulation of the VO 2 /HfO 2 based dual‐mode memristor is demonstrated. By changing the conductance of the HfO 2 layer, the firing threshold can be modulated, thus the excitability and inhibition can be adjusted according to the previous stimuli without any complex peripherals, showing an adaptive firing rate even under the same stimuli. The artificial neuron clusters can emulate the concept of neuronal memory and neural adaptation, demonstrating spatiotemporal encoding capabilities via the correlated neural firing patterns. This conceptual work provides an alternative way to expand the computation power of spiking neural networks by exploiting the neural adaptation and could be enlightenment to maximize the synergy across both synapse and neuron in neuromorphic computing systems.",

It is a significant challenge to converge microagents to the desired position without sufficient support of real‐time imaging feedback. Herein, a new drive solution is proposed, which generates a rotating gradient‐based magnetic field by sequentially energizing each coil of the electromagnetic coil system. With this method, a high magnetic field gradient concentrated onto a specific target site is generated, which will attract microagent swarms to automatically converge to the target site from different directions. Based on the established model of rotating gradient magnetic field actuation, the relationship between the current inputs of coils and the location of the aggregation center is characterized, so that the target site can be adjusted in the entire workspace by changing the coil current inputs. The method drives microagents to rotate while moving forward, thereby reducing the viscous resistance and friction on microagents. It does not rely on specific trajectory planning and real‐time visual guidance to navigate microagents, and can drive magnetic microagents with different characteristics such as size, shape, and materials. This research provides a basis for using microagent delivery in clinical applications and precision‐targeted therapy.",

However, the design of metamaterials with prescribed nonlinear mechanical properties is challenging due to the difficulty in accurately predicting nonlinear mechanical responses such as buckling and self‐contact, as well as geometric and material uncertainties. Herein, additive manufacturing (AM) with machine learning (ML) to demonstrate data‐driven modeling and the design of nonlinear elastomeric springs with a broad stress plateau is combined. 243 elastomer chi ( χ ) spring parts with different design parameters fabricated by AM are tested. A Gaussian process (GP) model is trained on key features of the measured mechanical response and predicts the mechanical response within a 3% error with as few as 97 parts. To account for the geometric and material uncertainties, the GP model to develop an uncertainty‐aware design optimization approach to tailor the mechanical response based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA‐ES) is utilized. Excellent agreement is demonstrated between the designed response and measured response over the range of plateau stress considered.

A hyperelastic material is proposed for building a soft growing robot. Several problems associated with conventional soft growing robots are addressed using a hyperelastic material that offers the required properties for each part of the soft growing robot, while maintaining its intrinsic advantages. Two unique features of hyperelastic materials, bulging and shape‐locking, are introduced. The advantages that these two features offer to soft growing robots are investigated and analyzed. A soft growing robot, utilizing these features, can easily achieve shape locking, small tail tension, easy retraction, uniform circular inner channel, and wrinkle‐free curve formation, without additional hardware. The initial concept of the growing and steering mechanisms of a hyperelastic soft growing robot is proposed and demonstrated using a prototype.",

However, due to the lack of guidance by appropriate theoretical models, the development of previous magnetic tactile sensors relies either on a trial‐and‐error manner or tedious point‐by‐point experimental calibrations, which are costly and time‐inefficient. Here, a theoretical model integrating magnetics, artificial neural networks, and nonlinear solid mechanics is proposed for the first time to guide the design of 3D magnetic tactile sensors. Then, a button‐shaped magnetic tactile sensor prototype that can detect subtle triaxial force changes is fabricated, which relates the nonlinear magnetic flux density to the external force, without burdensome calibration procedures. The sensor can achieve an axial measurement error of less than 1% and an in‐plane error of less than 3.7% with excellent durability. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of magnetic tactile sensors and sheds light on their applications in soft robotics, intelligent manipulation, and human–robot interaction (HRI).",

As a result, a hierarchical structure in terms of wrinkled film overlaid by nano‐dome array is obtained in the flexile surface. Experiments find that subject to biaxial strains from 0% to 60%, the hierarchical surface first experiences a transition from nontransparent to transparent owing to the flattening of the wrinkles and then exhibits iridescence structure color shifting from blue to red. The switchable and dynamical tunable mechanochromic characteristics are demonstrated in a smart window, offering potentials for developing flexible devices with optical multiple functionality.",

One of the recent advances in robotics is lower limb assistive/rehabilitative devices that can make independent living possible.

This paper describes the current state of the art in intelligent motion planning and control of lower limb assistive devices, which have addressed some of these challenges. Adaptable central pattern generators and the divergent component of motion are introduced as methods for personalized motion planning based on physical human–robot interaction (pHRI). Uncertainty analysis for neural networks is introduced to increase safety in motion planning based on pHRI. For the case that a user cannot apply physical interaction, a reinforcement‐learning‐based approach is introduced to switch between different modes of walking based on the user's input via a push button embedded in a walker. Moreover, a smart walker is introduced as a device that can be synchronized with the lower limb exoskeleton to assist users with their daily activities. Also, a roadmap for future steps that can make lower limb assistive/rehabilitative devices a good fit for home use is introduced.",

There have been previously studies on the use of LCEs for reversible changes in surface topography. However, surface protrusions have typically been limited to the order of 1 μm or depend on light, heat, or electrical stimulation that are difficult to locally control or require relatively high voltage. This article presents a novel operation mode of LCE actuators based on the wrinkling behavior of an LCE‐elastomer bilayer architecture. Embedding a liquid‐metal‐based conductive ink within the LCE enables electrical control of surface wrinkling through Joule heating. The actuator cells can generate wrinkles with amplitudes ranging from 17 to 45 μm within 30 s under an input power of 2 W and a voltage on the order of 1 V. As the bilayer is composed entirely of soft materials, it is highly deformable, flexible, and can be integrated into a multi‐cell array capable of bending on curved surfaces.",

Moreover, doped HfO x ‐based FTJs are in the spotlight in terms of neuromorphic engineering as a way of advancing from the von Neumann structure. In particular, Al dopant is effective for inducing ferroelectric properties due to its smaller radius than that of Hf.

The characteristics in different frequency regions are also studied to satisfy the demand for fast switching.

Whereas, how to control the spreading process and accelerate the spreading speed is a major challenge. The rock‐climbing fish is characterized by its alepidote feature that lives in stream habitats dominated by strong currents. The mucus on its body surface plays a vital role in its adherence and maintenance of antifouling and antibacterial properties. However, the rapid, uniform, and efficient spreading mechanism of mucus on the fish body surface remains largely unknown. Herein, it is revealed that the surface of the rock‐climbing fish is overlaid fully by the microhexagonal texture structure. This hexagonal structure shows a superspreading effect on liquid diffusion, resulting from testing with bionic microfabrication inspired by the rock‐climbing fish. It is demonstrated that the microhexagonal‐textured surface can enhance liquid spreading quickly and evenly on the surface by regulating the moving contact line of the liquid. This kind of superspreading mechanism has great potential applications in the antifouling, electroencephalogram electrode interfaces, flexible skin sensors, and interfacial lubrication of underwater surfaces.",

Closed‐loop control methods based on complex, time‐varying acoustic fields have been demonstrated, but usually require accurate models of the acoustic fields or many training experiments for successful manipulation. Herein, a new adaptive control method is proposed for the acoustic manipulation of single and multiple particles inside microfluidic chips. The method is based on online machine learning of the acoustic fields. Starting with no knowledge of the fields, the controller can manipulate particles even on the first attempt, and its performance improves in subsequent attempts, yet can still readapt if the models are invalidated by a sudden change in system parameters. The controller can generalize: it can use information learned from one task to improve its performance in other tasks. Despite the machine‐learning nature of the controller, the internal models of the controller have a physical interpretation and correspond to the experimentally observed acoustic fields. The online adaptiveness of the controller should make it easier to use in practical applications, such as particle and cell sorting, microassembly, labs‐on‐chips, and diagnostic devices, as the method does not require extensive training or prior models.",

However, existing analog memristors are still far from accurate tuning of multiple conductance states, which are crucial from the device‐level view. Herein, a reliable analog memristor based on ion‐slicing single‐crystalline LiNbO 3 (LNO) thin film is demonstrated. The highly ordered LNO crystal structure provides a stable pathway of oxygen vacancy migration, which is contributed to a stable Mott variable‐range hopping process in trap sites. Excellent analog switching characteristics with high reliability and repeatability, including long retention/great endurance with small fluctuation (fluctuated within 0.22%), a large dynamic range of two orders of magnitude, hundreds of distinguishable conductance states with tunable linearity, and ultralow cyclic variances for multiple weight updating (down to 0.75%), are realized with the proposed memristor. As a result, a multilayer perceptron with a high recognition accuracy of 95.6% for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset is realized. The proposed analog memristive devices based on ion‐slicing single‐crystalline thin films offer a novel strategy for fabricating high‐performance memristors that combined linear tunability and long‐term repeatability, opening a novel avenue for neuromorphic computing application.",

It consists of a few microns thick polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane in which an array of magnetic microdisks is embedded. These membranes have a large tuneable flexibility, and they are transparent, biocompatible, and waterproof. They are usable in biology and optics, both potentially combined. The membrane deformations under magnetic field have been experimentally characterized and modeled. By growing pancreatic cells on such membranes, it has been demonstrated that insulin production from the cells can be enhanced thanks to the mechanical stimulation of the cells provided by the actuated membrane.",

    "abstract": "In this article, a novel approach to enhance the maneuverability and adaptability of legged robots in challenging environments is proposed. This approach involves the integration of soft inflatable sensing skin, which provides additional mobile modes and environmental adaptability. The inflated skin's structural properties, such as buoyancy, volumed shape, and physical compliance, enable quadruped robots to extend their mobility to stable swimming and crawling modes. The inflated skin also offers physical protection through cushioning and backing effects, allowing robots to roll down stair‐like structures. Furthermore, the integration of tactile sensors provides the host robot with accurate and intuitive contact information, enabling increased environmental adaptability and responsive behavior. The robot can protect itself from impacts, detect and detour obstacles, and dynamically interact with its surrounding environment. Overall, the proposed approach offers a synergistic integration of soft inflatable sensing skin and tactile sensors to enhance legged robots’ maneuverability and adaptability in harsh environments. The integrated system enables robots to achieve challenging missions, extending their capabilities beyond conventional locomotive modes. The proposed approach has significant potential applications in fields such as search and rescue, surveillance, and exploration.",

The article first presents the design of the robot. Next, the quasisteady model theory is used to establish the hydrodynamic force for modeling the deformable caudal fin. Furthermore, three deformation modes are studied and compared: the conventional nondeformable mode, the sine‐based mode, and the instantaneous mode. Finally, a series of extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate various performance metrics of this innovative untethered biomimetic robotic fish, including thrust, swimming speed, yaw stability, turning radius, and turning rate. The results demonstrate that the introduction of active deformation of the caudal fin significantly enhances the swimming performance in the aforementioned indices when compared to the conventional nondeformable mode. Notably, the instantaneous mode exhibits best performance in terms of thrust, swimming speed, turning radius, and turning rate, while the sine‐based mode demonstrates the best yaw stability. Consequently, this research contributes to the advancement of robotic fish design and the development of underwater biomimetic robots.",

It leverages an axis‐asymmetric bowl‐shaped structure and the nonlinear Ag–AgCl reaction, realizing alternating low‐velocity swinging forward and accelerated steering motions for prolonged interaction and large work area. Moreover, the bowl‐shaped microstructure bestows a micro‐vortex above the Ag side due to the competition of electric potential and pressure gradient, also extending interaction time during the acceleration. Consequently, it exhibits at least an order of magnitude larger enhancement of detection signals than the counterparts.

However, as the use of DNNs expands, protecting user input privacy has become increasingly important. Herein, a potential security vulnerability is identified wherein an adversary can reconstruct the user's private input data from a power side‐channel attack even without knowledge of the stored DNN model. An attack approach using a generative adversarial network is developed to achieve high‐quality data reconstruction from power leakage measurements. The analyses show that the attack methodology is effective in reconstructing user input data from power leakage of the analog CIM accelerator, even at large noise levels and after countermeasures. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, an example of CIM inference of U‐Net for brain tumor detection is attacked, and the original magnetic resonance imaging medical images can be successfully reconstructed even at a noise level of 20% standard deviation of the maximum power signal value.

However, such an approach cannot provide specific instructions or facilitate immediate feedback for improvement of the shooting motion. In this article, a method is presented to quantitatively evaluate four key action indicators of shooting basketballs using a machine‐learning model based on Bayesian optimization of a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). Important motion data for the model are collected by micro‐inertial measurement units embedded in a wrist motion sensor and an internet of things (IoT) smart basketball. Basketball shooting motion data are collected from 16 subjects and used for model training and data testing, and four important action indicators that influence the shot quality are selected for quantitative assessment. The LightGBM model is then developed for the regression prediction of the four action indicators of shooting. In the results, it is indicated that for an individual player, the highest correlation scores of the four indexes range from 97.6% to 99.3%. The proposed approach for quantitatively assessing shooting indexes can provide objective and data‐based guidance to improve players’ shooting performance. Foreseeably, the prediction model can be embedded into a chip of a wearable device to evaluate the real‐time shot quality quantitatively.",

This study investigates the transferability of grasping knowledge from on‐land to underwater via a vision‐based soft robotic finger that learns 6D forces and torques (FT) using a supervised variational autoencoder (SVAE). A high‐framerate camera captures the whole‐body deformations while a soft robotic finger interacts with physical objects on‐land and underwater. Results show that the trained SVAE model learns a series of latent representations of the soft mechanics transferable from land to water, presenting a superior adaptation to the changing environments against commercial FT sensors. Soft, delicate, and reactive grasping enabled by tactile intelligence enhances the gripper's underwater interaction with improved reliability and robustness at a much‐reduced cost, paving the path for learning‐based intelligent grasping to support fundamental scientific discoveries in environmental and ocean research.",

However, owing to the lack of depth information, occlusion of instrument, and view direction limitations, visual feedback from the patient to the clinician is typically unintuitive, which affects surgical safety. Herein, an omnidirectional augmented reality (AR)‐assisted robotic telepresence for interventional medicine is developed. A monocular camera is used as an AR device with a manipulator, where virtual key anatomies and instruments are superimposed on video images using multiobject hand–eye calibration, iterative closest point, and images superposition algorithms. The view direction of the camera can be changed via the manipulator, which allows the key anatomies and instruments to be viewed from different directions. Structure‐from‐motion and multi‐view stereo algorithms are used to reconstruct the scene on the patient's side, thus providing a virtual reality (VR) interactive interface for the manipulator's safe teleoperation. Two different phantom experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, an ex vivo experiment involving a porcine lumen is performed, in which the operator can view the interventional flexible robot. The proposed method integrates omnidirectional AR and VR with robotic telepresence, which can provide intuitive visual feedback to clinicians.",

Ultrasound‐powered microrobots, benefiting from a distribution of vibrating microbubbles (1–100 μm in diameters), exhibit localized fluid flow for self‐propulsion. Microbubbles also contribute to the design of acoustic metamaterials, where distributed actuation of bubbles enables exotic material properties (e.g., negative refractive index). Herein, a metamaterial‐inspired microrobot design, which exploits the streaming induced by the collective oscillation of microbubble arrays (&gt; 10), is reported. Such a large distribution of bubbles offers twofold advantages: a mesoscale microrobot allowing ease of handling and motion at a considerably low acoustic driving pressure of 50 kPa. In this work, the oscillatory amplitude of a single bubble that acts as a unit cell of the metamaterial‐based microrobot is first characterized. Thereon, this amplitude is related to the flow generated by the collective vibration of all the bubbles close to the theoretically predicted resonant frequency of the bubbles. Finally, the hovering motion of the microrobot induced by the streaming and flow‐assisted debris clearance is demonstrated. Such auxiliary functionalities of the microrobot can be useful for applications like contactless sample extraction in inaccessible biological environments.",

However, it is challenging to form multistable morphing structures under the same condition. Herein, the programmed deformations of a composite hydrogel into multistable configurations under the same condition are demonstrated. The hydrogel consists of integrated units of through‐thickness and/or in‐plane gradient structures, where the former leads to bending, folding, or twisting with a predetermined direction and the latter buckles upward or downward with equal possibility. The bistability of buckling affords the integrated hydrogel with multiple possible configurations. The composite hydrogel with multiple in‐plane gradient units (number: n ) and through‐thickness gradient ones (number: m ) theoretically has 2 n × 1 m = 2 n configurations under the same condition. Although the integration of units with through‐thickness gradient does not contribute to the diversity of configurations, it favors forming complex and designable configurations. Both experimental and simulation results show that various stable configurations can be obtained in one composite hydrogel under the same condition by controlling the buckling direction of each unit by a selective preswelling step. This concept and strategy are applicable for other intelligent materials and merit their applications in diverse areas.",

The physical mechanism to realize the multiphysics digital coding is the equivalent governing equations behind wave behaviors as well as the boundary conditions with an identical mathematic model. Using split‐ring resonators, 3‐bit multiphysics digital coding elements are created, from which flexible wave‐control devices are realized by simply designing coding sequences. As examples, multiple‐beam generation, scattering reduction, beam steering, and beam forming are numerically demonstrated for both EM and acoustic fields. The anomalous reflection phenomena based on 3‐bit multiphysics coding elements are experimentally performed to validate the design concept.

A spray‐coated silver nanowire (AgNW) is selected as the sensor electrode for high‐resolution patterning. The unique antenna‐shaped electrode pattern results in a capacitance change of 31% when in contact with ground at a baseline of 0.13 pF. The BSEP provides stiffness tunability via an embedded compliant heater. The heater combines interdigitated silver with carbon nanotubes delivering uniform and highly efficient heating to create a tunable device with stiffness between 100s of MPa and tens of kPa, providing a large working flexibility. The efficient resistive heater provides uniform and stable heating over an area of 40 by 40 mm with a rate of 48 °C min −1 at an input voltage as low as 7 V. This research merges intelligent polymeric systems and thin film electronics advancing conformable, skin‐like functional electronics.",

However, most reported photocatalytic micromotors can only be tracked in transparent solutions under bright fields, which greatly limits their applications. Herein, photocatalytic micromotors based on Cu 2 O@carbon dot (CDot) particles with excellent fluorescent properties and precise propulsion capabilities in 3D are reported. In the fully green environment of malic acid, the Cu 2 O@CDot micromotors display efficient propulsion under visible light irradiation (as high as 40.85 μm s −1 ). In addition, the propulsion direction of the Cu 2 O@CDot micromotors can be effectively adjusted by changing the direction of light via positive phototaxis. Interestingly, due to the presence of CDots, these new Cu 2 O@CDot micromotors display excellent and stable fluorescence. This study reports the first photocatalytic micromotors with both novel fluorescence properties and excellent propulsion characteristics in biocompatible environments. Due to their excellent fluorescent properties and precise motion control, these Cu 2 O@CDot micromotors hold great potential to perform complex tasks across diverse practical applications.",

This task would be taken by an emerging concept, nanoarchitectonics, through the combination of nanotechnology concepts with other scientific disciplines such as materials science, supramolecular chemistry, organic chemistry, and bio‐related science and technology.

    "abstract": "The development of magnetically powered microswimmers that mimic the swimming mechanisms of microorganisms is important for lab‐on‐a‐chip devices, robotics, and next‐generation minimally invasive surgical interventions. Governed by their design, most previously described untethered swimmers can be maneuvered only by varying the direction of applied rotational magnetic fields. This constraint makes even state‐of‐the‐art swimmers incapable of reversing their direction of motion without a prior change in the direction of field rotation, which limits their autonomy and ability to adapt to their environments. Also, due to constant magnetization profiles, swarms of magnetic swimmers respond in the same manner, which limits multiagent control only to parallel formations. Herein, a new class of microswimmers are presented which are capable of reversing their direction of swimming without requiring a reversal in direction of field rotation. These swimmers exploit heterogeneity in their design and composition to exhibit reversible bidirectional motion determined by the field precession angle. Thus, the precession angle is used as an independent control input for bidirectional swimming. Design variability is explored in the systematic study of two swimmer designs with different constructions. Two different precession angles are observed for motion reversal, which is exploited to demonstrate independent control of the two swimmer designs.",

In particular, reversibility is emphasized, which enables the fabrication of multiscale systems that would not be possible under traditional techniques. Magnetic, acoustic, optical, and electric fields are the most promising methods for controlling the reversible assembly of biological and synthetic subunits as they can reprogram their assembly by switching on/off the external field or shaping these fields. Capabilities are featured to dynamically actuate the assembly configuration by modulating the properties of the external stimuli, including frequency and amplitude. The design principles are designed, which enable the assembly of reconfigurable structures. Finally, the high degree of control capabilities offered by externally driven assembly will enable broad access to increasingly robust design principles toward building advanced dynamic intelligent systems is foreseen.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing has the great potential to enable faster and more energy‐efficient computing by overcoming the von Neumann bottleneck. However, most emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM)‐based artificial synapses suffer from insufficient precision, nonlinear synaptic weight update, high write voltage, and high switching latency. Moreover, the spatiotemporal dynamics, an important temporal component for cognitive computing in spiking neural networks (SNNs), are hard to generate with existing complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) devices or emerging NVM. Herein, a three‐terminal, Li x WO 3 ‐based electrochemical synapse (LiWES) is developed with low programming voltage (0.2 V), fast programming speed (500 ns), and high precision (1024 states) that is ideal for artificial neural networks applications. Time‐dependent synaptic functions such as paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF) and temporal filtering that are critical for SNNs are also demonstrated. In addition, by leveraging the spike‐encoded timing information extracted from the short‐term plasticity (STP) behavior in the LiWES, an SNNs model is built to benchmark the pattern classification performance of the LiWES, and the result indicates a large boost in classification performance (up to 128×), compared with those NO‐STP synapses.",

    "abstract": "The tunability of conductance states of various emerging nonvolatile memristive devices emulates the plasticity of biological synapses, making it promising in the hardware realization of large‐scale neuromorphic systems. The inference of the neural network can be greatly accelerated by the vector‐matrix multiplication (VMM) performed within a crossbar array of memristive devices in one step. Nevertheless, the implementation of the VMM needs complex peripheral circuits, and the complexity further increases as non‐idealities of memristive devices prevent precise conductance tuning (especially for the online training) and largely degrade the performance of the deep neural networks (DNNs). Herein, an efficient online training method of the memristive deep belief net (DBN) is presented. The proposed memristive DBN uses stochastically binarized activations, reducing the complexity of peripheral circuits, and uses the contrastive divergence (CD)‐based gradient descent learning algorithm. The analog VMM and digital CD are performed separately in a mixed‐signal hardware arrangement, making the memristive DBN highly immune to non‐idealities of synaptic devices. The number of write operations on memristive devices is reduced by two orders of magnitude. The recognition accuracy of 95–97% can be achieved for the MNIST dataset using pulsed synaptic behaviors of various memristive synaptic devices.",

Inspired by humans, realization of sensory adaptation on robots can make them adapt to the environment gradually. The gradual change of sensitivity that depends on recent experience of external stimuli is the most important process for the adaptation. To realize sensory adaptation, such change of sensitivity needs to be realized. It is proposed to fabricate the memristor based on single‐crystalline LiNbO 3 thin film. The resistance of the memristor can be changed monotonically and gradually with the increase in the number of voltage pulses, which can be ascribed to the property of single‐crystalline thin films. Based on the characteristic, it is proposed to use the memristor as artificial synapse of the proposed bioinspired system, using conductance of the memristor to denote susceptibility value to realize the gradual change of sensitivity by recent external stimuli. A novel general excitation method of signals from multimodal sensors on memristor is proposed and utilized in the signal‐coupling module of the system, which makes the system realize sensory adaptation for different stimuli accepted by multimodal sensors. Using artificial sensory memory systems, sensory adaptation on robot is realized for the first time herein.",

Advances in machine learning, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), have been adopted for efficient and intelligent applications to overcome constrained computational environments. Herein, evolutionary algorithms are used to find novel DNNs that are accurate in classifying airway symptoms while allowing wearable deployment. As opposed to typical microphone‐acoustic signals, mechano‐acoustic data signals, which did not contain identifiable speech information for better privacy protection, are acquired from laboratory‐generated and publicly available datasets. The optimized DNNs had a low model file size of less than 150 kB and predicted airway symptoms of interest with 81.49% accuracy on unseen data. By performing explainable AI techniques, namely occlusion experiments and class activation maps, mel‐frequency bands up to 8,000 Hz are found as the most important feature for the classification. It is further found that DNN decisions are consistently relying on these specific features, fostering trust and transparency of the proposed DNNs. The proposed efficient and explainable DNN is expected to support edge computing on mechano‐acoustic sensing wearables for remote, long‐term monitoring of airway symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks have acquired remarkable achievements in the field of artificial intelligence. However, it suffers from catastrophic forgetting when dealing with continual learning problems, i.e., the loss of previously learned knowledge upon learning new information. Although several continual learning algorithms have been proposed, it remains a challenge to implement these algorithms efficiently on conventional digital systems due to the physical separation between memory and processing units. Herein, a software–hardware codesigned in‐memory computing paradigm is proposed, where a mixed‐precision continual learning (MPCL) model is deployed on a hybrid analogue–digital hardware system equipped with resistance random access memory chip. Software‐wise, the MPCL effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and circumvents the requirement for high‐precision weights. Hardware‐wise, the hybrid analogue–digital system takes advantage of the colocation of memory and processing units, greatly improving energy efficiency. By combining the MPCL with an in situ fine‐tuning method, high classification accuracies of 94.9% and 95.3% (software baseline 97.0% and 97.7%) on the 5‐split‐MNIST and 5‐split‐FashionMNIST are achieved, respectively. The proposed system reduces ≈200 times energy consumption of the multiply‐and‐accumulation operations during the inference phase compared to the conventional digital systems. This work paves the way for future autonomous systems at the edge.",

    "abstract": "The Gestalt principles of perceptual learning elucidate how the human brain categorizes and comprehends a set of visual elements grouped together. One of the principles of Gestalt perceptual learning is the law of closure which propounds that human perception has the proclivity to visualize a fragmented object as a preknown whole by bridging the missing gaps. Herein, a letter recognition scheme emulating the Gestalt closure principle is demonstrated, utilizing artificial synapses made of 3D integrated MA 3 Bi 2 I 9 (MBI) perovskite nanowire (NW) array. The artificial synapses exhibit short‐term plasticity (STP) and long‐term potentiation (LTP) and a transition from STP to LTP with increasing number of input electrical pulses. Initiatory ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations attribute the conductance change in the MBI NW artificial synapses to the rotation of MA + clusters, culminating in charge exchange between MA + and Bi 2 I 9 3− . Each device yields 40 conductance states with excellent retention &gt;10 5 s, minimal variation (2 σ /mean) &lt;10%, and endurance of ≈10 5 cycles. MBI NW‐based artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed to recognize fragmented letters alike their distinction in unabridged form and also the gradual withering of synaptic connectivity with engendered missing fragments is demonstrated, thereby successfully implementing Gestalt closure principle.",

    "abstract": "Series elastic actuators (SEAs) and variable elastic actuators (VSAs) provide shock resistance, energy storage, and stable force control. However, they usually require extra springs, mechanical parts, and transmissions, increasing size, weight, number of moving parts, and reducing the mechanical efficiency. In particular, this mechanical complexity is one of the significant challenges in the design of wearable and scalable force feedback devices. In this article, flexure variable stiffness actuators (F‐VSAs), which combine kinematic transmission, elasticity, and stiffness modulation via a network of folding patterns using flexure hinges, are presented. Thus, F‐VSAs allow the creation of robots benefiting from the advantages of SEAs and VSAs without hindering form factor or mechanical efficiency. To illustrate the design strategy of F‐VSAs, a 4‐design‐of‐freedom (DoF) robot that provides stiffness and force output is presented. An analytical model that estimates the inherent stiffness and the end‐effector force output for any given configuration of the folding pattern is proposed. Finally, stiffness modulation and force control of the robot are implemented and good agreement with the predictions from the model is observed. Thus, this novel design strategy allows the creation of compact and scalable robots with stiffness and force output for wearable, rehabilitation, and haptic applications.",

    "abstract": "Despite tremendous progress in the development of untethered soft robots in recent years, existing systems lack the mobility, model‐based control, and motion planning capabilities of their piecewise rigid counterparts. As in conventional robotic systems, the development of versatile locomotion of soft robots is aided by the integration of hardware design and control with modeling tools that account for their unique mechanics and environmental interactions. Here, a framework for physics‐based modeling, motion planning, and control of a fully untethered swimming soft robot is introduced. This framework enables offline co‐design in the simulation of robot parameters and gaits to produce effective open‐loop behaviors and enables closed‐loop planning over motion primitives for feedback control of a frog‐inspired soft robot testbed. This pipeline uses a discrete elastic rods (DERs) physics engine that discretizes the soft robot as many stretchable and bendable rods. On hardware, an untethered aquatic soft robot that performs frog‐like rowing behaviors is engineered. Hardware validation verifies that the simulation has sufficient accuracy to find the best candidates for sets of parameters offline. The simulator is then used to generate a trajectory library of the robot's motion in simulation that is used in real‐time closed‐loop path following experiments on hardware.",

    "abstract": "The 3‐satisfiability Problem (3‐SAT) is a demanding combinatorial problem that is of central importance among the nondeterministic polynomial (NP) complete problems, with applications in circuit design, artificial intelligence, and logistics. Even with optimized algorithms, the solution space that needs to be explored grows exponentially with the increasing size of 3‐SAT instances. Thus, large 3‐SAT instances require excessive amounts of energy to solve with serial electronic computers. Network‐based biocomputation (NBC) is a parallel computation approach with drastically reduced energy consumption. NBC uses biomolecular motors to propel cytoskeletal filaments through nanofabricated networks that encode mathematical problems. By stochastically exploring possible paths through the networks, the cytoskeletal filaments find possible solutions. However, to date, no NBC algorithm for 3‐SAT has been available. Herein, an algorithm that converts 3‐SAT into an NBC‐compatible network format is reported and four small 3‐SAT instances (with up to three variables and five clauses) using the actin–myosin biomolecular motor system are experimentally solved. Because practical polynomial conversions to 3‐SAT exist for many important NP complete problems, the result opens the door to enable NBC to solve small instances of a wide range of problems.",

Studies have been conducted to mimic MCW movement of motile cilia, but the fabrication process is too complicating or there are difficulties in accurately mimicking the shape of the cilia. To overcome these limitations, a self‐assembly method is introduced to fabricate a reprogrammable magnetically actuated self‐assembled (RMS) cilia array that can be reprogrammed by changing the magnetization direction through additional magnetization. Using the RMS cilia array, a unilateral cilia array (UCA) channel and a bilateral cilia array (BCA) channel are constructed, and the motion and fluid flow of the RMS cilia array are analyzed by applying different magnetic fields (strike magnetic field and rotating magnetic field). When a rotating magnetic field is applied to the UCA channel, a distinct MCW appears. In the BCA channel test, fluid pumping is observed when a strike magnetic field is applied, whereas fluid mixing is observed when a rotating magnetic field is applied. Based on these results, it is expected that the proposed RMS cilia array and magnetic field actuation can be applied to lab‐on‐a‐chip or microfluidic channels for fluid mixing and pumping.",

Thus, senseless optoelectronic devices with high response performance under ambient environment have an extensive application space in improving the interfacing between users and computers. Herein, a concept of wearable perovskite‐based shadow recognition sensor is demonstrated for ambient and nonobtrusive human–computer interaction. The multidimensional ordered nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals are promoted by introducing the self‐driving effect of liquid crystal (LC) oligomers. The resulted LC‐doped perovskite film (LC‐PVK) with micrometer‐sized grains can output relatively high photocurrent under indoor ambient light (≈500 lux). The LC‐based device exhibits over a hundred times of on–off ratio and fast response of millisecond level even after storage for more than 1200 h. The device also shows an ultratrace Pb 2+ leakage of 1.02 μg L −1 in water, and still retains more than 90% of the photocurrent intensity after thousands of bending strains. Accordingly, a novel human–computer interaction is achieved by identifying external action commands with the recognition of shadows, which can provide a “haptic” perception for robots.",

Herein, inspired by the human finger, a soft‐rigid structured gripper composed of three variable‐stiffness fingers with the antagonistic mechanism is proposed. Each finger can change its joint stiffness by selectively applying pretension to the springs so that it can exhibit different stiffness gradients to conform to the surfaces. Theoretical models are established to evaluate both the deformation and stiffness properties, and several experiments verify that it can increase the stiffness to 6.4 times after aggravating the antagonistic effect. Based on the variable stiffness, the finger performs sequential motion to conform to different curvatures, resulting in a larger contact area. Moreover, by stiffening joints, the proposed gripper can improve its grasping performance with a large grasping force while providing gentle contact. Furthermore, the gripper presents the capability of handling various objects with the optimal posture and gently grasping fragile objects like the paper ring and plasticine cylinder. Whereas this gripper can coordinate the relationship between high compliance and variable stiffness, the exploration of the gripper provides shed light on robotic design and practical application.",

In particular, in the hovering regime, wings are sensitive to wind currents that can be detrimental to their operational and energetic performances. Tail‐sitters are particularly prone to those wind currents because their wings are perpendicular to the incoming wind during hovering. This wind generates a large amount of drag and can displace and destabilize the vehicle, possibly leading to catastrophic failures. Herein, our morphing strategy demonstrates in a custom‐built 1.8 kg tail‐sitter with morphing wings that can actively resist winds and leverage them to increase its aerodynamic efficiency. It is shown that adaptive wing morphing during hovering in adverse wind conditions can reduce normalized energy consumption up to 85%, increase attitude and positional stability, and leverage wind energy to increase its yaw angular rate up to 200% while decreasing motor saturation levels.",

Herein, a DNA‐incorporated 3D BONe is introduced, where DNA facilitates optimal tuning of d‐band center, and in situ anchoring of PdO 2 subnanoscale clusters (PdO 2 ‐sNCs) on the exfoliated single‐layer reduced graphene oxide (SL rGO), to mimic wrinkled morphology of natural ONe. Unprecedentedly, BONe demonstrates benchmarked H 2 ‐sensing performance (small recovery time of ≈30 s with a limit of detection of 50 ppb) at room temperature with yearlong durability, satisfying prerequisites of safe adoption of H 2 clean energy. The great recovery is innovatively illustrated by the downshift of d‐band center of PdO 2 ‐sNCs and strong electron transport of SL‐rGO network. An adsorption/desorption model is proposed to clarify the sensing mechanism.

However, conventional negative pressure sources (e.g., diaphragm vacuum pumps) suffer from poor scalability from meso‐ to microscale, unavoidable vibration and noise, while the performances of existing smart material‐driven suction cups are often restricted by their bulky structures, poor active adhesive stresses, or high power consumptions. To address these limitations, a monolithic suction pad is proposed where its active adhesion is realized by the electrostatic–hydraulic coupling generated negative pressure cavity and the sealing is achieved by the elastomeric–hydraulic coupled outer rim. This suction pad features a peak pull‐off stress of 7.4 kPa and good switch ability in its adhesive stress of over 12 times. Compared with the existing smart material‐driven suction cups, the proposed suction pad demonstrates clear advantages in its significantly lower profile structure, lower preload stress requirement, and a higher adhesive force to power consumption ratio.

After finishing feature fusion, each robot exchanges its feature vectors with other robots still within sensing range to obtain the next action by the graph neural network model processing. Herein, imitation learning is used to train robots to choose behavioral strategies to maximize team benefit. The experimental results show that GNNHIM can make path planning for multirobot systems more efficient and reliable, enabling all robots to reach their own goal within a limited time in 95.1% of the experimental dataset. Moreover, GNNHIM still has great generalization when applied to unseen scenarios and larger scale robot systems.

However, robot operating conditions are often limited by environmental factors such as extreme temperatures encountered in fire disasters or polar regions. Especially drones face challenges in carrying thermal management systems protecting vital components, due to limited payload capacity compared to ground robots. Herein, a thermally agnostic aerial robot comprising structural thermally insulating material and a phase change material cooling system, inspired by natural thermal regulation principles, is designed, modelled and experimentally validated. Building on the robot development paradigm of physical artificial intelligence, the concurrent development of materials and design enables the creation of novel physiologically adaptive systems. Polyimide aerogel is applied as one of the main structural materials in the drone's design to adapt the robot's structure and properties to extreme temperatures. Glass fiber reinforcement with silica aerogel particles reduces high‐temperature shrinkage and pore structure degradation after exposure to high temperatures and most of the composite aerogel features are preserved. A high technology‐readiness‐level drone prototype, allowing for operation in a broad range of ambient temperatures, is demonstrated. The proposed technology for thermally agnostic drones may unleash the great potential of aerial robotics in multiple industrial and research applications.",

    "abstract": "Optical waveguides create interesting opportunities in the area of soft sensing and electronic skins due to their potential for high flexibility, quick response time, and compactness. The loss or change of light intensities inside a waveguide can be measured and converted into useful sensing feedback such as strain or shape sensing. Compared to other approaches such as those based on microelectromechanical system modules or flexible conductors, the entire sensor state can be characterized by fewer sensing nodes and less encumbering wiring, allowing greater scalability. Herein, simple light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors (PDs) combined with an intelligent shape decoding framework are utilized to enable 3D shape sensing of a self‐contained flexible substrate. Multiphysics finite element analysis is leveraged to optimize the PDs/LEDs layout and enrich ground‐truth data from sparse to dense points for model training. The mapping from light intensities to overall sensor shape is achieved with an autoregression‐based model that considers temporal continuity and spatial locality. The sensing framework is evaluated on an A5‐sized flexible sensor prototype and a fish‐shaped prototype, where sensing accuracy (RMSE = 0.27 mm) and repeatability (Δ light intensity &lt;0.31% over 1000 cycles) are tested underwater.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of intelligent decision‐making for command‐and‐control systems in air defense combat operations. Current autonomous decision‐making systems suffer from limited rationality and insufficient intelligence during operation processes. Recent studies have proposed methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address these issues. However, DRL methods typically face challenges related to weak interpretability, lack of convergence guarantees, and high‐computing power requirements. To address these issues, a novel technique for large‐scale air defense decision‐making by combining a DRL technique with game theory is discussed. The proposed method transforms the target assignment problem into a potential game that provides theoretical guarantees for Nash equilibrium (NE) from a distributed perspective. The air‐defense decision problem is decomposed into separate target selection and target assignment problems. A DRL method is used to solve the target selection problem, while the target assignment problem is translated into a target assignment optimization game. This game is proven to be an exact potential game with theoretical convergence guarantees for an NE. Having simulated the proposed decision‐making method using a digital battlefield environment, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the oldest healing systems, which plays an essential role in daily health management. However, TCM is frequently controversial due to its subjectivity and lack of scientific quantification. Modern sensing technologies, enabling the detection of various physiological signals, have the remarkable performance of multifunctionality, superintegration, and ultraminiaturization. Combining with modern sensing technology is a good opportunity for the modernization, objectification, and scientization of TCM. This article proposes an intelligent wristband for simultaneous multiparameter measurement of pulse, skin temperature, and perspiration, essential physiological signals in TCM. As a significant functional material, a carbon nanotube/poly(dimethylsiloxane) nanocomposite with 3D interpenetrating network structures exhibits great electrical conductivity, stress effect, and thermoresistive effect, ensuring intelligent wristband's high accuracy, high sensitivity, and good stability for pulse and temperature measurements. Furthermore, the perspiration sensing unit is also integrated. The as‐prepared intelligent wristband is applied during fumigation and washing therapy, and artificial intelligence is introduced to judge whether the user is during fumigation and washing therapy or in the resting state by classifying the user's physiological state, with an accuracy of up to 100%. This work offers a unique strategy for TCM and wearable sensing technology with an important practical significance.",

This study aims to develop a reliable, home‐based point‐of‐care testing (POCT) tool for early screening of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) coinfected with Talaromyces marneffei infection. Employing a “From weak to strong” deduction strategy for feature selection, data from 464 AIDS patients across four cohorts between February 5th, 2014, and January 8th, 2022, are analyzed. The top three features consistently observed are D‐dimer, cluster of differentiation 4+, and aspartate transaminase. Based on these features, the simplest risk‐scoring model is constructed, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.91, 0.80, and 0.69 in the hold‐out cohort, external cohort 1, and external cohort 2, respectively. This “From weak to strong” deduction strategy identifies advantageous clinical features, enabling the development of simplified clinical risk scores with multiple biomarkers. To facilitate practical implementation, enhanced POCT tools are introduced, specifically a strip with segmented testing capabilities that demonstrates sensitivity and strong correlation with clinical scoring models. Furthermore, an open‐access website and a free Android mobile app are created to support community utilization. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the innovative deduction strategy and enhanced test strips, which enable bedside measurements without laboratory dependency.",

Neuromorphic engineering seeks to mimic the basic principles of the brain to develop systems capable of achieving such capabilities.

This work proposes a spike‐based robotic navigation and environment pseudomapping system formed by a bioinspired hippocampal memory model connected to a posterior parietal cortex (PPC) model. The hippocampus is in charge of maintaining a representation of an environment state map, and the PPC is in charge of local decision‐making. This system is implemented on the SpiNNaker hardware platform using spiking neural networks. A set of real‐time experiments are applied to demonstrate the correct functioning of the system in virtual and physical environments on a robotic platform. The system is able to navigate through the environment to reach a goal position starting from an initial position, avoiding obstacles and mapping the environment. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first implementation of an environment pseudomapping system with dynamic learning based on a bioinspired hippocampal memory.",

Therefore, this article proposes a new decision‐making and path‐planning framework, based on game theory, that considers the multistate future actions of surrounding vehicles. First, multistate future actions of neighboring vehicles, whose driving styles vary, are estimated and fed into a decision‐making module for risk assessment. Then, based on the Stackelberg game theory, the ego vehicle and the rear object vehicle are modeled as two players in the game, and their optimal decisions are obtained. In addition, the path‐planning model incorporates a potential‐field model that utilizes several potential functions to explain the varied styles and physical limitations of the surrounding vehicles. Finally, the trajectory of the ego vehicle is obtained through model predictive control that is based on the outputs of the decision‐making and constructed potential‐field models. The results of simulation experiments that used designed scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method effectively manages various social interactions and generates safe and appropriate trajectories for autonomous vehicles. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that considering multistate trajectories caused the decision‐making and path‐planning modules to be appropriate for unpredictable environmental conditions.",

Each cell is rolled during flow, and its off‐axis holograms from multiple viewpoints are acquired. Using the reconstructed quantitative phase profiles of the cell projections, highly discriminating features, enabling cell detection, classification, and differentiation, are extracted via a modified ResNet‐18 deep convolutional neural network architecture. The model is first validated by classifying metastatic breast carcinoma cells (MCF‐7) and normal human mammary epithelial cells (MCF‐10A). An increase in classification accuracy by 1% is achieved when processing five interferometric projections versus processing a single interferometric projection. This model is further tested on four types of white blood cells and exhibits an accuracy increase of 5% when processing 12 interferometric projections versus processing a single interferometric projection. This approach is shown to be superior to that of using conventional 2D‐rotation augmentation, and can be used to decrease substantially the number of cell examples needed for training the classification model without impairing the results. This novel concept has great potential to be incorporated into label‐free imaging flow cytometry and improve cell classification, and be used to detect various types of medical conditions and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump adequate blood to the body, which afflicts over 60 million people worldwide. Its treatment options include physiotherapy, medication, mechanical heart support, heart surgery, or heart transplantation. Ventricular assist devices have direct blood contact while passive ventricular constraint devices have only modest therapeutic efficacy. Current direct cardiac compression devices are either bulky, require noisy driving pneumatic sources, or are unable to mimic the natural heart motion. This study introduces a robotic cardiac compression device made of soft artificial muscle filaments that can simultaneously produce radial, axial, and torsional movements, potentially augmenting the pumping function of a failing heart. An empirical model is developed to describe the device motion and an artificial pericardium is employed to enable uniform force distribution to the heart and real‐time pressure sensing. The proposed device could deliver a stroke volume of 70 mL at 15 beats per minute, or a cardiac output of 1.05 L min −1 , and achieve a peak instantaneous flow rate of 2.8 L min −1 and an output pressure of 50 mmHg. The new devices are highly customizable and experimentally validated with fresh porcine heart. They are expected to inspire future development of nonblood‐contacting cardiac assist devices.",

    "abstract": "Insects flap their wings through a highly specialized musculoskeletal system that allows the wings to rotate about three degrees of freedom. Consequently, the wingtip trajectory is adjustable in 3D, and accompanied with appropriate wing feathering (wing pitch). Remarkably, the complex flapping motion is achieved by thoracic muscles acting on the wing hinge. The wings themselves do not possess muscles but adjust their shape and orientation by elastically deforming due to the loads applied on them during flapping. Previous attempts to develop insect‐inspired flapping drones have mostly focused on simplified linear flapping mechanisms, which do not utilize the interaction between the wing flexibility and flapping kinematics to its full potential. Here, the aim is to improve flapping drones’ performance by introducing mechanisms that mimic insects’ flight. The first is an elastic beam mechanism, allowing the wing root to swing during flapping, and the second is a passive wing pitch mechanism that allows the wing to rotate at stroke reversals. The two mechanisms are tested using high‐fidelity insect‐inspired 3D‐printed wings and show a sixfold improvement of aerodynamic performance compared to linear flapping kinetics of the same flexible wings. This underscores the necessity of bioinspired flapping mechanisms in future flapping drones.",

Herein, event–visual–inertial state estimation and 3D dense mapping (EVI‐SAM) are introduced to tackle the problem of pose tracking and 3D dense reconstruction using the monocular event camera. A novel event‐based hybrid tracking framework is designed to estimate the pose, leveraging the robustness of feature matching and the precision of direct alignment. Specifically, an event‐based 2D–2D alignment is developed to construct the photometric constraint and tightly integrated with the event‐based reprojection constraint. The mapping module recovers the dense and colorful depth of the scene through the image‐guided event‐based mapping method. Subsequently, the appearance, texture, and surface mesh of the 3D scene can be reconstructed by fusing the dense depth map from multiple viewpoints using truncated signed distance function fusion. To the best of knowledge, this is the first nonlearning work to realize event‐based dense mapping. Numerical evaluations are performed on both publicly available datasets, which qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superior performance of our method. EVI‐SAM effectively balances accuracy and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency, showcasing superior pose tracking and dense mapping performance in challenging scenarios.",

Herein, liquid metal gallium micromachines that significantly increase their velocity in confining channels with adaptive deformation under exposure to an electric field are presented. The liquid metal gallium micromachines move toward the negative electrode under the propulsion of hydrogen bubbles, which is obviously different from the previous report that liquid metal gallium alloy (i.e., Galinstan) micromachines move to the positive electrode, owing to the surface tension gradient. More importantly, the liquid metal gallium micromachine can adaptively deform and accelerate in confined channels. The velocity of liquid metal gallium micromachines increases with the decrease in the width of channels. It is found that the speed‐up motion of liquid metal gallium micromachines is caused by the enhanced electro‐osmosis effect in confining channels. The findings not only help understand the role of the confinement effect on the motion of liquid metal micromachines but also provide a novel strategy to manipulate the motion velocity of liquid metal micromachines for specific applications.",

Herein, the dynamic tuning of optical transmission is reported by controlling the orientation of 1D colloidal assemblies of magnetic nanostructures. Colloidal magnetic nanostructures of Fe 3 O 4 , including nanospheres, nanorods, and nanodiscs, are assembled into 1D chains under external magnetic fields. Magnetic tuning of the orientation of the nanochains results in a pronounced contrast in optical transmittance, which is strongly dependent on the size and shape of the primary nanostructures. Contrary to the intuitive expectation, the 1D chains of the nanospheres and nanorods exhibit lower transmittance when they are oriented parallel rather than perpendicular to the incident light, whereas the nanodisc counterpart responds oppositely due to the unique “edge‐to‐edge” assembly mode of the nanodiscs. The dynamic tuning of the optical transmittance through magnetic means is believed to have broad applications in the design of novel switchable optical devices. As an example, the incorporation of orientation‐dependent optical properties of 1D chains into the construction of intelligent polymer films with their transparency sensitive to rotation and bending is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous nanomotors have become the new paradigm for current research as they are expected to shift the momentum in the development of next‐generation technologies. However, there is a grand challenge in gaining control over the nanomotors’ motion, speed, directionality, and using biocompatible fuels to power them. Currently, light is recognized for powering micromotors with advancement in using visible light for driving motion at the nanoscale regime. In this context, micron‐scaled motors are fabricated but they contain metal surfaces and fabrication is quite laborious. Herein, encapsulation of plant organelles into supramolecular assemblies for active motion is conducted to fabricate bio‐nanomotors, utilizing the natural photosynthesis process for powering motion at the nanoscale. The oxygen produced by the water‐splitting reaction by plant organelles in visible light and the photophoresis effect due to the transparent nature of the supramolecular assembly are the main driving forces for bio‐nanomotors. The bio‐nanomotors are observed to have propelled motion with speed reaching up to 120.42 ± 12 μm s −1 , together with on‐demand reversible on/off motion and real‐time control over change in directionality at the nanoscale. The observed results shift the momentum toward harnessing energy from natural processes to power nanosystems for varied applications.",

Morpho butterflies are among the well‐known species possessing iridescent bright blue coloration due to multiple optical effects generated by the complex structuration of the wing scales. Such surprising solution can be replicated to fabricate efficient devices. Maybe even more interesting, novel approaches can be developed to combine wings with synthetic smart materials to achieve complex structures responsive to external stimuli. This study demonstrates the proof of concept of an innovative biotic–abiotic hybrid smart structure made by the integration of a butterfly wing with thermoresponsive liquid crystalline elastomers, and their capability to actuate the mechanical action of the wing, thus controlling its spectral response. Exploiting two fabrication strategies, it is demonstrated how different mechanisms of color tuning can be achieved by temperature control. In addition, due to the thermally induced mechanical deformation of the elastomer and superhydrophobic properties of the wing, a potential self‐cleaning behavior of the bilayer material is demonstrated.",

Herein, a feasible near‐memory error correction method for a typical bipolar‐type memristor stateful logic system is proposed. An error correction principles using a HfO 2 ‐based crossbar array device is explained, and two types of error correction methods checking if the number of FALSE data is zero and if the number of TRUE data is odd are proposed.

A soft robot as a hybrid system described by both discrete and continuous states is considered and a method of analysis for enhanced manipulation is proposed. The method is tested with a soft gripper composed of a pneumatic bending actuator and an embedded soft sensor for a task of object gripping. The optimum sensor location on the actuator based on the calibration map obtained from the actuator characterization is first determined. Using the sensor information, the interaction with the environment (i.e., object) classified into four discrete states is understood. In addition, a control strategy to find the best position to grip the object based on the estimated states is developed. The gripper is able to successfully complete the task using the proposed method for three test scenarios with different initial conditions and control parameters.

The deep WS‐CNN pattern classifier identifies EEG spikes with remarkable accuracy of 99.81 = 0.15% (area under curve, AUC = 1.000), cross‐validated across 5010 EEG waveforms, during the first 6 h post‐HI (42 h total), an important clinical period for diagnosis of HI brain injury.

The results show that the proposed WS‐CNN approach is less sensitive to the potential morphological variations of spikes across all subjects compared to other deep CNNs and spectral‐fuzzy classifiers, allowing the user to flexibly choose an approach depending on their computational requirements.

The sucker attachment mechanism grants the octopus the ability to perform many of these tasks. The goal of this study is to analyze sucker function and control through the assessment of pull‐off forces under different conditions. Sucker pull‐off forces are measured in Octopus bimaculoides (three females, seven males), when the arm is intact, amputated, and amputated with the suckers punctured. Greater sucker pull‐off forces are observed for amputated arms, plausibly indicating that the brain and/or the interbrachial commissure are responsible for triggering early sucker detachment in the intact animal. In addition, after piercing and compromising the sucker cavity, pull‐off force significantly decreases, indicating that the primary mechanism for sucker attachment is suction, and is less dependent on adhesion. These results provide new insights into the control and function of octopus suckers that can be integrated into the design and development of soft robot arms for aquatic applications.",

Despite hitting the headlines regularly and many publications of proofs-of-concept, certified products are failing to breakthrough to the clinic. AI in healthcare is a multi-party process with deep knowledge required in multiple individual domains. The lack of understanding of the specific challenges in the domain is, therefore, the major contributor to the failure to deliver on the big promises. Thus, we present a decision perspective framework, for the development of AI-driven biomedical products, from conception to market launch. Our framework highlights the risks, objectives and key results which are typically required to proceed through a three-phase process to the market launch of a validated medical AI product. We focus on issues related to Clinical validation, Regulatory affairs, Data strategy and Algorithmic development. The development process we propose for AI in healthcare software strongly diverges from modern consumer software development processes. We highlight the key time points to guide founders, investors and key stakeholders throughout their relevant part of the process. Our framework should be seen as a template for innovation frameworks, which can be used to coordinate team communications and responsibilities towards a reasonable product development roadmap, thus unlocking the potential of AI in medicine.",

Pneumatic actuators (PAs) are a type of soft robotic actuator that utilizes pneumatic pressure for actuation and are commonly used; however, the relationship between their design and actuation performance is not well understood. Herein, a cubic kernelized support vector regression (SVR) model based on finite element analysis is used to explore the design space of bending PAs with respect to their bending angles through the investigation of the dependencies between different design parameters. The model obtained from the SVR is then tested by experimentally comparing the bending angle of different 3D‐printed PAs from within the design space. The bending torque, an indicator of the actuation force of the PA, is also measured and compared for different design configurations. This study provides a computational and experimental framework and paves the way for future work on PAs, which has the potential to greatly propel the advancement of soft robotics.",

Several basic operations with liquid bridges using an EHD‐pin matrix based on the pyroelectric effect engineered in ferroelectric crystals are demonstrated. By activating pyro‐EHD effect in predetermined positions (pins of the array), the locomotion and handling of single or multiple LUVs simultaneously are controlled. In particular, multiple operations such as lift, displacement, mixing, stretching, and carrying vector for microparticles, are shown.

However, fabrication of pneumatic soft robotic systems with complex 3D structures and material distribution still remains elusive. Herein, a mode‐free fabrication approach, called planar laser cutting and stacking fabrication (PLCSF), is proposed to create pneumatic soft robotic systems with multi‐material and complex structure, which involves the following steps: 1) slicing the 3D model of desired pneumatic soft robotic systems into 2D layers; 2) fabricating each layer via laser cutting corresponding 2D membrane; 3) stacking all layers together to finish the fabrication. With the PLCSF approach, various prevalent pneumatic soft actuators are fabricated with complex structures (including fiber‐reinforced and pneu‐net) and different actuation modes (such as bending, elongation, twisting, abduction, contraction, and grabbing). The scalability of the PLCSF approach to fabricate multiple degrees‐of‐freedom (DOFs) pneumatic soft actuators with integrated structures, such as twisting‐bending pneumatic soft actuators for delivering and bending‐elongation‐bending pneumatic soft actuators for crawling, is also demonstrated. It is further demonstrated that the PLCSF approach also enables creating a bio‐inspired soft hand with nine DOFs, capable of various dexterous motions and manipulations.",

As of today, however, this technology is yet to find widespread commercial applications. One of the challenges is obtaining scalable and highly efficient designs that can withstand the fabrication errors associated with nanoscale manufacturing techniques. This problem becomes more severe in flexible structures, in which deformations appear naturally when flat‐optics structures are conformally applied to, for example, biocompatible substrates. Herein, an inverse design platform that enables the fast design of flexible flat‐optics that maintain high performance under deformations of their original geometry is presented. The platform leverages on suitably designed evolutionary large‐scale optimizers, equipped with fast‐trained neural network predictors based on encoder decoder architectures. This approach supports the implementation of flexible flat‐optics robust to both fabrication errors or user‐defined perturbation stress. This method is validated by a series of experiments in which broadband flexible light polarizers, which maintain an average polarization efficiency of 80% over 200 nm bandwidths when measured under large mechanical deformations, are realized. These results could be helpful for the realization of a robust class of flexible flat‐optics for biosensing, imaging, and biomedical devices.",

On the basis of recent experimental findings that memristive networks can be rapidly printed and lifted off as electronic microparticles, an alternative design paradigm is introduced based on arrays of two‐terminal memristive elements, which enables real‐time use of memory, sensing, and actuation in microrobots. Several memristor‐based designs are validated, each representing a key building block toward robotic autonomy: tracking elapsed time, timestamping a rare event, continuously cataloguing time‐indexed data, and accessing the collected information for a feedback‐controlled response as in a robotic glucose‐responsive insulin. The computational results establish an actionable framework for microrobotic design—tasks normally requiring complex circuits can now be achieved with self‐assembled and printed memristor arrays within microparticles.",

Current designs for biocomputing leveraging the information processing units of the cells, such as DNA, gene, or protein circuitries, are inherently slow (hours to days speed) and, therefore, are primarily being considered for archival storage of information. On the contrary, electrically active cells that can synchronize in milliseconds and can be connected as networks to perform massively parallel tasks can transform biocomputing and lead to novel ways of high throughput information processing. Herein, coupled oscillator networks made of living cardiac muscle cells, or bio‐oscillators, is explored as collective computing components for solving computationally hard problems. An empirically validated circuit compatible macromodel is developed for the bio‐oscillators and the fibroblast cells acting as coupling elements, to faithfully reproduce the synchronization dynamics of the network and it is shown that such bio‐oscillator network can be scaled up to hundreds of nodes and be used to solve computationally hard problems faster than traditional heuristics‐based Boolean algorithms.",

Herein, a programmable haptic sleeve composed of textile‐based electroadhesive clutches for skill acquisition and retention is described. Its functionality in a motor learning study where users control a drone's movement using elbow joint rotation is shown. Haptic feedback is used to restrain elbow motion and make users aware of their errors. This helps users consciously learn to avoid errors from occurring. While all subjects exhibited similar performance during the baseline phase of motor learning, those subjects who received haptic feedback from the haptic sleeve committed 23.5% fewer errors than subjects in the control group during the evaluation phase. The results show that the sleeve helps users retain and transfer motor skills better than visual feedback alone. This work shows the potential for fabric‐based haptic interfaces as a training aid for motor tasks in the fields of rehabilitation and teleoperation.",

However, the construction of hardware competitive learning neural network still faces great challenges due to the lack of an accurate distance computation method and a self‐adaptive in situ training scheme. Herein, a fully memristive Euclidean distance (ED) engine based on analog multiply‐accumulate operation in a 32 × 32 TiN/TaO x /HfO x /TiN 1T1R array is demonstrated. The dual‐layer devices perform multilevel modulation under the target‐aware programming method with excellent read linearity in a dynamic range of 10–100 μS. The ED calculation is verified experimentally on a test board with an O (1) temporal complexity. Furthermore, in situ training and offline inference schemes for competitive learning, based on the ED engine, are developed and the simulated results show comparable success rates with those obtained by the CPU‐based software. Compared with a state‐of‐the‐art RTX6000 GPU (0.5 TOPS W −1 ), the energy efficiency of competitive learning models on ED engines can yield 100× improvements by utilizing optimized memristive devices.",

The soft actuation components are based on liquid crystal elastomers formed into functionally graded structures by extrusion printing, which enables a high free strain of 45.5%. The robot design includes a self‐sustained oscillation mechanism incorporating a novel, highly elastic spring for energy storage and impulse release. The arthropod‐inspired exoskeleton structures are printed from polycarbonate with high strength to increase the load‐carrying capacity, or to increase moving speed by a lever mechanism that amplifies the stepping distance up to eight times. The robot achieves self‐sustained locomotion, harvesting constant infrared radiation for continual power. Leveraging the strength of the exoskeleton and the high stress of the actuator, the robot transports a load 22 times its body weight. It is capable of climbing up a slope of 40° and moving up to a quarter of its body length per minute with peripheral lever legs. The robot operation does not require external signaling controls or complex electronics, demonstrating the potential of this battery‐free, scalable, environment‐powered design with an unlimited range free from tethering constraints.",

Sleep diagnosis by polysomnography is a golden standard but expensive procedure involving huge effort from patients. There remain challenges for smart devices to precisely identify sleep stage and minimize intrusive effect on sleep progression. Herein, a novel noncontact sleep structure prediction system (NSSPS) using a single radar sensor is presented to analyze sleep structure without any tethered unit. The NSSPS is realized through training a convolutional recurrent neural network and neural conditional random fields using reflected radio frequency (RF) waves acquired by radar antennas. By capturing implicit temporal information in RF signals and transitions of sleep progression, high accuracy of sleep‐stage prediction is achieved and characteristics of sleep structure are extracted. The performance of the NSSPS is validated by transfer learning between radar signals with different frequency bands and crossvalidation among different subjects. Moreover, the NSSPS is demonstrated to estimate overnight parameters that are critical for sleep diagnosis. Benefiting from its low cost, convenient setup, and accurate prediction capability of sleep‐stage identification, the NSSPS can be widely deployed in “smart” homes and exploited to conduct daily sleep structure analysis.",

When it enters the water, it entraps an air bubble in a superhydrophobic hairy structure covering its abdomen. While this bubble is mainly used for respiration, it also functions as an external inflatable gas reservoir for buoyancy regulation. Namely, hemoglobin is used to store and release oxygen to the entrapped bubble, reversibly. This way, it can reach neutral buoyancy without further energy consumption. Herein, a small, centimeter‐scale, backswimmer‐inspired untethered robot (BackBot) with autobuoyancy regulation through controlled nucleation and release of microbubbles is developed. The bubbles nucleate and grow directly on onboard electrodes through electrolysis, regulated by low voltage. A bubble‐entrapping 3D‐printed canopy is introduced to create a stable external gas reservoir. To reduce buoyancy forces, the bubbles are released through linear mechanical vibrations of the canopy, decoupled from the robot's body. Through pressure sensing and a proportional integral derivative control loop mechanism, the robot autoregulates its buoyancy to reach neutral floatation underwater within seconds. This mechanism can promote the replacement of traditional, and physically larger, buoyancy regulation systems such as pistons and pressurized tanks, and enables the miniaturization of autonomous underwater vehicles.",

Three kinds of functions are explored to interpret the mechanism. First, encryption and decryption of wireless secure communications are realized through DPM; second, range profile imaging is accomplished by using DPM‐based biphase‐coded signals; and third, wireless communication and radar detection are simultaneously presented using DPM.

However, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a highly constrained and complex luminal construct that fundamentally limits the size of an ingestible system. Recent advancements in mesoscale magnetic crawlers have demonstrated the ability to effectively traverse complex and confined systems by leveraging magnetic fields to induce contraction and bending‐based locomotion. However, the integration of functional components (e.g., electronics) in the proposed ingestible system remains fundamentally challenging. Herein, the creation of a centralized compartment in a magnetic robot by imparting localized flexibility (MR‐LF) is demonstrated. The centralized compartment enables MR‐LF to be readily integrated with modular functional components and payloads, such as commercial off‐the‐shelf electronics and medication, while preserving its bidirectionality in an ingestible form factor. The ability of MR‐LF to incorporate electronics, perform drug delivery, guide continuum devices such as catheters, and navigate air–water environments in confined lumens is demonstrated. The MR‐LF enables functional integration to create a highly integrated ingestible system that can ultimately address a broad range of unmet clinical needs.

The essence of catapulting behavior is that plants and animals use their structural characteristics to control elastic strain energy locking, triggering, and releasing under external stimulation. At present, bistable or multistable structures are attractive for optimizing the system energy and improving the performance of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) soft actuators. However, the overelaborate designation of such structures makes it a great challenge to achieve fast morphing LCE soft actuators. Here, a light‐driven azobenzene liquid crystal elastomer (azo‐LCE) soft actuator mimicking the catapulting behavior of fern sporangia is reported. 2D azo‐LCE monoliths are simply folded to construct V‐shaped structures as 3D catapults, which exhibit higher morphing velocity upon UV light, and the morphing velocity is related to the aspect ratio of films. Furthermore, asymmetric morphing behavior occurs by constructing localized UV irradiation conditions, which greatly improves the morphing velocity. It is envisioned that the origami‐inspired azo‐LCE catapults can be further designed as the throwing component in fast‐morphing soft robots for the remote delivery of microcargoes.",

Inspired by the movement of jellyfish in nature (Physophora hydrostatica), herein, a microscale aerial vehicle FlyJelly is introduced, powered by onboard energy to achieve untethered flight. FlyJelly uses a balloon filled with helium to overcome self‐gravity and an actuator powered by electrostatic power to generate thrust. The balloon, heat sealed with two gold‐covered Mylar films, weighs 95.56 mg, provides 257.9 mg of buoyancy when filled with helium, and stores 19.457 × 10 −3 J of energy when powered by 2400 V of direct current. The electrostatic actuator is composed of multiflapping units arranged radially and symmetrically, consuming only 0.3370 mW of power but generating a thrust of 0.2271 mN to drive the vehicle for flight. Benefiting from a design of distributed propulsion, FlyJelly is highly reliable and continues to work well even after the actuator is damaged. The milligram‐level weight, untethered flight with onboard energy, and high reliability make the prototype suitable for development as a long‐term remote exploration and search‐and‐rescue mission.",

Assessing the risk of recurrence or functional impairment in IS and TIA patients is essential to both acute phase treatment and secondary prevention. Current risk prediction systems that rely on clinical parameters alone without leveraging imaging data have only modest performance. Herein, a deep learning‐based risk prediction system (RPS) is developed to predict the probability of stroke recurrence or disability (i.e., deep‐learning stroke recurrence risk score, SRR score). Then, Kaplan–Meier analysis to evaluate the ability of SRR score to stratify patients at stroke recurrence risk is discussed. Using 15 166 Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR‐III) cases, the RPS's receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.850 for 14 day TIA recurrence prediction and 0.837 for 3 month IS disability prediction are used. Among patients deemed high risk by SRR score, 22.9% and 24.4% of individuals with TIA and IS respectively have stroke recurrence within 1 year, which are significantly higher than the rates in low‐risk individuals. Deep learning‐based RPS can outperform conventional risk scores and has the potential to assist accurate prognostication in stroke patients to optimize management.",

However, the harsh conditions present in outer space, including radiation, vacuum, temperature fluctuations, and complex, unpredictable terrain, pose significant obstacles to the development and operation of robotic systems. Although a variety of robotic platforms have been created for exploration, construction, and maintenance in space, their capacity to address fundamental questions remains largely untapped. In particular, the design, construction, and control of robots that can withstand the rigors of extreme space environments remain a significant challenge. In this special section, which is building on a workshop co-organized by the guest editor at the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, we focus on the recent advancements of space robots, as well as opportunities and critical challenges of this field. In particular, we cover topics of significant interest to the field including mobility on granular terrain and bio-inspired and soft robots for extraterrestrial applications. Because research pertaining to space robotics is generally interdisciplinary in nature, we include articles not only from roboticists but also from physicists and planetary scientists. This special section includes two research articles (2100040, 2100125), two review articles (2100063, 2200071), and two perspectives (2100106, 2100195).

The other research article by Green et al., presents CASPER, a novel screw-propelled excavation system for planetary exploration and excavation. This platform employs screw propellers for both mobility and excavation and demonstrates significant excavation capability with low mass and power requirements (2100125). The two review papers in this special section discuss robotic attachment mechanisms (2100063) and soft robots (2200071) for space applications. In particular, the article by Spenko, reviews robotic attachment mechanisms for extraterrestrial applications. Specifically, bio-inspired fibrillar dry adhesives for smooth surfaces, electrostatic adhesives for smooth and rougher surfaces, and microspines for rocky and rough surfaces are discussed (2100063). The article by Zhang et al., reviews soft robotics technologies for space applications. Particularly, advantages of soft robots for such applications and potential design, modeling, fabrication, sensing, and control improvements for adapting to space environments are described (2200071). Finally, there are two perspective articles included in this special section that provide insight on soft robots (2100106), and bio-inspired multi-legged and limbless robots (2100195) for mobility on extra-terrestrial terrain. Ng and Lum elaborate on key advantages and potential changes to actuation, fabrication, and locomotion of soft robots for future planetary explorations (2100106). Li and Lewis discuss using terradynamics insights for developing bio-inspired ground robots that are effective in maneuvering on granular and rocky planetary terrain (2100195). The guest editor extends heartfelt gratitude to the authors, reviewers, and the editorial team for their great contributions to this special section.

    "abstract": "The theoretical capability of modular robots to organize the overall robot into different structures with different functions has broad prospects in space exploration. Therefore, a novel modular space robot named Space Module is developed, and a self‐assembly strategy inspired by biological cooperative and mutual assistance behaviors is proposed. First, the meta‐module method is utilized to endow nonmobile modules with the mobility. Second, the mutual assistance is presented to achieve position and posture reachability of the assembly unit while minimizing the effect of meta‐modules on granularity. Then, according to the unique motion characteristics of the meta‐module and mutual assistance, an assembly planner is designed to obtain the assembly sequences to realize the self‐manufacturing of desired configurations. Finally, the validity and feasibility of the proposed assembly strategy are further confirmed by demonstrations.

    "abstract": "Soft pneumatic gripping strategies are often based on pressurized actuation of structures made of soft elastomeric materials, which limits designs in terms of size, weight, achievable forces, and ease of fabrication. In contrast, fabric‐based inflatable structures offer high stiffness‐to‐weight ratio solutions for soft robotics, but their actuation has been little explored. Herein, a new class of pneumatic soft grippers is presented that exploits the in‐plane overcurvature effect of inextensible fabric flat balloons upon inflation. A star‐shaped gripper contracts radially under pressure producing a gripping force on the object whose intensity can be modulated by the pressure input. First, the kinematics and mechanics of a single V‐shaped actuator are studied through experiments, finite element simulations, and analytical models. Then, these results are leveraged to predict the mechanical response of the entire star, optimize its geometry, and maximize contraction and stiffness. It is shown that the gripping performance can be improved by stacking several stars with silicon‐coated corners. It is expected that the flexibility, robustness, scalability, and ease of fabrication of this methodology will lead to a new generation of lighter and larger actuators capable of developing higher forces and moving delicate and irregularly shaped objects while maintaining reasonable complexity.",

This iron oxide/functionalized carbon nanotube/polyvinylidene fluoride film optimizes both piezoelectric and magnetic properties through dual‐alignment fabrication, utilizing strong element bonds for simultaneous alignment. Magnetic nanoparticles are advantageous over nanorods due to latter's randomized shape anisotropy decreasing magnetization. The dual magnetic and mechanical processing increases polar β ‐crystal content to 88%, where magnetic alignment alone increases degree of crystallinity to 66%. As a vibration damper, HPMSA operates within 40–600 Hz frequency, with a sensing sensitivity of 2.5 mV g −1 and 0.72 m s −2 weighted acceleration damping, lowering passenger health risks. Piezoelectric and magnetic relationship shows 0.19 V increase with 125 mT applied. The flexible HPMSA can integrate onto a curved surface and sense/dampen vibrations of an air motor, propeller drone, and simulated tremors. The HPMSA provides tremendous potential and understanding into multi‐stimuli‐responsive/functional materials, simultaneous alignment, and vibration control in the next generation of transportation vehicles for human safety.",

When evaluated in the illustrative problem of a model octopus foraging for food, this hierarchical decomposition results in significant improvements relative to end‐to‐end methods. Performance is achieved through a mixed‐modes approach, whereby qualitatively different tasks are addressed via complementary control schemes. Herein, model‐free reinforcement learning is employed for high‐level decision‐making, while model‐based energy shaping takes care of arm‐level motor execution. To render the pairing computationally tenable, a novel neural network energy shaping (NN‐ES) controller is developed, achieving accurate motions with time‐to‐solutions 200 times faster than previous attempts. The hierarchical framework is then successfully deployed in increasingly challenging foraging scenarios, including an arena littered with obstacles in 3D space, demonstrating the viability of the approach.",

Hard-magnetic soft materials are shown to provide new opportunities for metachronal wave-modulated robotic locomotion by multi-agent active morphing in response to external magnetic fields. However, the design and optimization of such magnetic soft robots can be complex, and the fabrication and magnetization processes are often delicate and time-consuming. Herein, a computational model is developed that integrates granular models into a magnetic-lattice model, both of which are implemented in the highly efficient parallel computing platform large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS). The simulations accurately reproduce the deformation of single cilium, the metachronal wave motion of multiple cilia, and the crawling and rolling locomotion of magnetic cilia soft robots. Furthermore, the simulations provide insight into the spatial and temporal variation of friction forces and trajectories of cilia tips. The results contribute to the understanding of metachronal wave-modulated locomotion and potential applications in the field of soft robotics and biomimetic engineering. The developed model also provides a versatile computational framework for simulating the movement of magnetic soft robots in realistic environments and has the potential to guide the design, optimization, and customization of these systems.",

The issue arises because aerial robots with agile mobility lack sufficient rotors for manipulation tasks, while those with manipulation ability are too large for agile mobility. To tackle this problem, a novel aerial robot unit named TRADY, tilted‐rotor‐equipped aerial robot with autonomous in‐flight assembly and disassembly capability, is introduced. The TRADY unit can self‐assemble/disassemble with another unit in mid‐air, adjusting the aircraft's control freedom by switching between under‐actuated and fully‐actuated control models. The system implementation involves a docking mechanism design, optimized rotor configuration, as well as a control system with the ability to switch between under‐actuated and fully‐actuated controllers. A proposed state transition method compensates for discrete changes during the controller switchover process. Also, a motion strategy for assembly/disassembly with hazardous condition recovery behavior is presented. Finally, through experiments, TRADY demonstrated a 90 % success rate in executing assembly/disassembly motions, and in the assembly state, it can utilize full‐pose tracking and generate over nine times the torque of a single unit. This is the first aerial robot developed to perform both assembly and disassembly while seamlessly transitioning between fully‐actuated and under‐actuated models.",

The filaments are developed with two filler materials, namely, silver and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). The influences of filler aspect ratio (AR), concentration, functionalization, and morphology on the composites' mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties are studied. Printed tracks of the 10 wt% high‐AR MWCNT/TPU filament exhibit a maximum electrical conductivity of 0.92 S cm −1 and withstand powers &gt;1 W and currents &gt;100 mA. The filament shows negligible change in impedance over the frequency range 1 kHz–1 MHz and a change in the resistance of &lt;5% with 90° bending. Conversely, printed tracks using filaments with 3 wt% low‐AR MWCNT exhibit a change in resistance of ≈30% with 90° bending, allowing a clear distinction between various bending angles, and thus could be used for embedded strain/bend sensors. These results suggest that, with the correct optimization, multimaterial additive manufacturing can be utilized with tunable conductive filaments to fabricate complex 3D electronic systems by constructing reliable circuit tracks, bendable interconnects, and sensors.",

However, the fabrication of deformable grasping robots at small scales requires advanced materials and fabrication technologies. Alternatively, multiple microrobots can be used to surround and grasp objects. By collaborating, microrobots can perform complex tasks that they would not be capable of executing individually. The complexity of controlling multiple untethered microrobots has limited the applications of collaborative microrobots to two‐dimensional operations. To fill this gap, this work proposes a collaborative microrobotic system for three‐dimensional grasping operations. The system is based on the control of two magnetic agents and the exploitation of the magnetic interactions between them to grasp, manipulate, and assemble passive components. A custom‐made closed‐loop controller is developed to automatically stabilize the system, achieving pose control of a grasped passive component (of 2 mm in size) with a precision of 300 μm in position and 10° in orientation. The main advantage of the proposed system is its capability to reconfigure the magnetic agents for other operations, as demonstrated by the assembly of a microgear and subsequent reconfiguration to power the assembled mechanism.",

However, traditional approaches built on handcrafted features, predefined rules, or thresholds are often susceptible to the variation of the acquired images’ quality and give unstable performances. To solve this problem, a deep learning‐based soldering defect detection method is developed in this article. Like many real‐life deep learning applications, the number of available training samples is often limited. This creates a challenging low‐data scenario, as deep learning typically requires massive data to perform well. To address this issue, a multitask learning model is proposed, namely, PCBMTL, that can simultaneously learn the classification and segmentation tasks under low‐data regimes. By acquiring the segmentation knowledge, classification performance is substantially improved with few samples. To facilitate the study, a soldering defect image dataset, namely, PCBSPDefect, is built. It focuses on the dual in‐line packages (DIP) at the PCB back side, DIP at the PCB front side, and flat flexible cables. Experimental results show that the proposed PCBMTL outperforms the best existing approaches by over 5–17% of average accuracy for different datasets.",

In this, gravity is required to pull μbots near the surface; however, this is not necessarily practical in complex geometries. Here, the authors show that rotating magnetic fields, in tandem with directional magnetic gradient forces, can be used to roll μbots on surfaces regardless of orientation. Simplifying implementation, a spinning permanent magnet is used to generate differing ratios of rotating and gradient fields, optimizing control for different environments.

As a result, active‐control capsule endoscopy, which can be controlled via external stimulation, has emerged as a prominent diagnosis tool, unlike traditional passive capsule endoscopy. However, owing to its rigid cover, the high rotating radii limit its observation range at anchor points, such as polyps. There are also persistent challenges with pass‐through in narrow spaces in the intestines. This study proposes a soft‐shell capsule endoscope (SSCE) to improve this limitation. Experiments ranging from virtual phantoms to ex vivo investigations in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine were conducted to ensure comprehensive coverage of the entire digestive system by the SSCE. Additionally, in the stomach and intestine experiments, we compared the performances of the SSCE and hard‐shell capsule endoscope (HSCE) to highlight the advantages of the SSCE. The results demonstrate that the SSCE achieves a 37.3% increase in the observable angles through bending motions at the anchor point compared to the HSCE, in addition to increased efficiency of pass‐through in the intestines. This revolutionary innovation is expected to significantly impact and promote high efficiency via pass‐through and the observation area in the clinical application of capsule endoscopy.",

Inspired by the flexibility and adaptability of organisms like snakes and octopuses, the continuum robot concept aims to address the inherent challenges in traditional arthroscopy, including lower precision, manual tremors, and long surgeon learning curves. The implementation of these principles in the human body, however, faces significant obstacles, particularly achieving high‐performance motion control amid strong nonlinearity and coupling between modules. This research focuses on intelligent integration and enhanced safety in human‐machine interaction, aiming for improved control precision and flexibility in arthroscopic procedures. A thorough literature review of endoscopic continuum robots is conducted, highlighting current advancements in actuation, structure, sensing, and control technologies. The study concludes with an assessment of these technologies, their limitations, and future potential, in light of the unique demands of arthroscopic continuum robots. This comprehensive review bridges bionics and robotics, presenting the opportunities and challenges in applying continuum robotics to arthroscopic surgery.

The magnetic field strength at 100 mm for the array with the same mass as the cylindrical magnet is about 1.8 times higher than that of the cylindrical magnet. Using the magnet array actuation, the flexible robot exhibits the capability of agile steering to navigate along a predefined trajectory. In addition, a 1 mm × 1 mm lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch is embedded into the tip of the flexible robot as a beacon for b‐TFM ultrasonic imaging to detect the position of the robot.

Specifically, some models are not parameterized, while others compromise accuracy and speed, which limits their usefulness in multi‐device applications and reduces the quality of circuit simulations. To address these drawbacks, a neural compact modeling framework with a flexible selection of technology‐based model parameters using a two‐stage neural network (NN) architecture is proposed. The proposed neural compact model comprises two NN components: one utilizes model parameters to program the other, which can then describe the current–voltage ( I–V ) characteristics of the device. Unlike previous neural compact models, this two‐stage network structure enables high accuracy and fast simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) simulation without any trade‐off. The I–V characteristics of 1000 amorphous indium–gallium–zinc‐oxide thin‐film transistor devices with different properties obtained through fully calibrated technology computer‐aided design simulations are utilized to train and test the model and a highly precise neural compact model with an average I DS error of 0.27% and R 2 DC characteristic values above 0.995 is acquired. Moreover, the proposed framework outperforms the previous neural compact modeling methods in terms of SPICE simulation speed, training speed, and accuracy.",

SNNSim is a reconfigurable simulator that accurately and very quickly models the behavior of the user‐defined device characteristics and returns key metrics such as area, accuracy, latency, and power consumption as output.

Using SNNSim, the conversion of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs is simulated and the performance of the large‐scale analog SNNs is optimized.

Previous approaches to nonreciprocity involve ferrite‐based devices with bulky systems. Herein, the controlled synthesis of a space–time modulation (STM) metamaterial for enhanced nonreciprocity using machine learning (ML) is investigated. The design of STM metamaterial poses great challenges due to the nonlinear nature of time‐periodic Floquet harmonics, which are inefficiently handled in traditional methods such as numerical optimization. To deal with the challenge, an ML approach is proposed that learns from the accumulated training data using the guided objective function and generates high‐quality designs by leveraging the learned features. This approach first trains a residual neural network (ResNet) to learn the nonlinear relationships between the STM parameters and nonreciprocal responses. The trained ResNet achieves a high testing accuracy, with 96.7% of the 9000 instances having a mean square error less than 0.6 × 10 −4 . For the synthesis of STM metamaterial, a customized Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) is proposed, which leverages the discovered nonlinearity and synthesizes large‐scale datasets using small computational costs. The histogram obtained using 90 000 data samples shows that WGAN generates designs with an average normalized nonreciprocity of 0.83, four times higher than the measured data.",

However, it is still concentrated in certain industries (i.e., electronics and automotive) where standardization of product physical form is high. Current state‐of‐the‐art gripping solutions fall short when they need to accommodate items with high variability in physical form. This challenging scenario for automation can be found in a few industries (i.e., e‐commerce). Automation of pick‐and‐place processes in this area requires a more versatile gripping solution. To resolve this challenge, this article proposes a novel way to improve grip‐versatility by synergizing the mechanical and machine intelligence of a hybrid robotic gripper (HRG). Comparative analysis with commercial grippers shows that HRG can pick a more diverse range of items with success rate 94.78%. Visual perception‐based picking strategy is developed to automate the reconfiguration of HRG into a stable grasp pose for different objects. Using the proposed reconfigurable picking strategy, the efficacy of HRG in pick‐and‐place tasks is evaluated using three parameters—mean pick per hour (MPPH), successful execution over total attempts (SETA), and average cycle time (AVGCT). HRG can effectively pick items in cluttered workspace with MPPH of 98.54 ± 15.49, SETA of 0.93 ± 0.11, and AVGCT of 34.76 ± 3.31 s.",

    "abstract": "Extensive efforts in providing upper limb amputees with sensory feedback have primarily focused on the restoration of tactile capabilities, while challenges in evoking proprioceptive sensations have been poorly addressed. Previously, an human–machine interface (HMI) was proposed based on permanent magnets implanted in residual muscles of an amputee, namely the myokinetic interface, to control robotic limb prostheses. Besides control, implanted magnets offer an unprecedent opportunity to trigger musculotendon proprioceptors via untethered selective vibrations. Herein, the challenge of tracking multiple moving magnets is addressed (e.g., following muscle contractions) while being vibrated by controlled magnetic fields produced by external coils. Results demonstrate the viability of a real‐time (RT) system capable of simultaneously tracking and vibrating multiple moving magnets within a three‐dimensional workspace. Highly selective torsional vibrations in the frequency span eliciting movement illusions (70, 80, and 90 Hz) are achieved on two moving magnets, with efficiencies above 0.82 (over 80% of spectral power at the desired frequency). Tracking accuracy and precision remain robust to the coil magnetic field, with position median errors below 1.2 mm and median displacement errors below 0.95 mm. This study represents a crucial step towards the development of a bench system to study proprioception in humans.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of tortoise‐inspired locomotion on enhancing energy efficiency in legged robots. Tortoises, known for their high locomotion efficiency, provide a unique model for robot and gait design, where their specific gait and posture significantly contribute to energy efficiency. This study hypothesizes that the gait and belly‐dragging posture of tortoises can improve the energy efficiency of robots. To test this hypothesis, a quadruped robot mimicking these tortoise characteristics is developed, utilizing the cost of transport (CoT) as a measure of energy efficiency. Dynamic simulations and real‐world experiments are conducted, varying parameters like robot size, mass, friction coefficient, and Froude number, to validate the generality of the findings. The results indicate that both belly dragging, a postural characteristic of tortoises, and their diagonal gait significantly lower the robot's CoT. This suggests that the energy‐efficient locomotion of tortoises, specifically the diagonal gait with belly dragging, is transferable to robotic platforms to enhance energy efficiency. The tortoise‐inspired robot design offers significant potential in applications such as search and rescue operations, space exploration, and payload transportation. Furthermore, the tortoise‐inspired locomotion strategy can be effectively integrated with other research focusing on energy efficiency improvements through mechanical structures or control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Respiration is one of the most important physiological processes of the human body. Continuous monitoring of respiration with wearable sensors can provide abundant information related to the health status of the respiratory system. However, the vast majority of the developed respiration sensors are constructed on nontextile substrates, resulting in dissatisfactory convenience, comfortness, and aesthetics. Additionally, special micro‐/nanomaterials are inevitably involved to construct the respiration sensors, which pose potential hazards to the human body due to the exfoliation and inhalation of these micro‐/nanomaterials. Here, humidity‐ and temperature‐sensitive electronic textiles (e‐Textiles) are presented, which are fabricated based on easily accessible and biofriendly materials (e.g., sodium chloride, glycerin, aluminum fiber, carbon fiber, and polyvinyl alcohol). Moreover, the proposed e‐Textiles use a potentiometric sensing mechanism, featuring self‐powered signal outputs and ultralow power consumption. The humidity and temperature‐sensing functionalities can also be in situ integrated into commercial masks for constructing full‐textile and all‐in‐one e‐Masks for comprehensive respiration monitoring. As demonstrations, both single‐point respiration monitoring (e.g., intensity, frequency, etc.) and 2D respiratory analysis (i.e., airflow distribution) can be realized with the e‐Masks.

Patients with positive cytology require neoadjuvant chemotherapy instead of instant resection, and conversion to negative cytology results in improved survival. However, pathologists’ or artificial intelligence's accuracy of cytological diagnosis is disturbed by manually produced, unstandardized slides. In addition, the elaborate infrastructure makes cytology accessible to a limited number of medical institutes. This work develops CellGAN, a deep learning method that enables label‐free virtual peritoneal lavage cytology by producing virtual hematoxylin–eosin‐stained images with single‐color stimulated Raman scattering microscopy. A structural similarity loss is introduced to overcome the challenge of unsupervised virtual pathology techniques that cannot accurately present cellular structures. This method achieves a structural similarity of 0.820 ± 0.041 and a nucleus area consistency of 0.698 ± 0.102, indicating the staining fidelity outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art method. Diagnosis using virtually stained cells reaches 93.8% accuracy and substantial consistency with conventional staining. Single‐cell detection and classification on virtual slides achieve a mean average precision of 0.924 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.906, respectively.

    "abstract": "Previous studies have emphasized the potential of threshold image segmentation for early breast cancer detection. However, traditional methods encounter challenges regarding low segmentation efficiency and accuracy. Addressing this, the ant colony optimization algorithm for continuous optimization (ACOR) shows promise. Yet, existing ACOR variants still grapple with poor initial population quality, affecting convergence speed and avoiding local optimization. These issues impact segmentation efficiency and accuracy. To tackle them, this study introduces RESACO, an enhanced ACOR version integrating three novel optimization strategies: resampling initialization (RIS), elite exploration (EES), and strengthened convergence mechanism (SCM). RIS enhances initial population quality by resampling regions with individuals demonstrating superior fitness and segmentation efficiency. EES promotes exploration across the search space, preventing local optima entrapment and enhancing model stability. SCM expediting convergence, segmentation efficiency, and precision. RESACO's performance is assessed through extensive experiments using IEEE CEC 2014 and IEEE CEC 2022 benchmark functions, including ablation experiments and comparisons with basic and improved algorithms and ACOR variants. Subsequently, the threshold image segmentation model based on RESACO is compared with other models using metaheuristic algorithms for segmenting realistic breast cancer medical images. Results demonstrate the proposed model's faster convergence and higher segmentation accuracy, preserving more lesion tissue details.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of soft fluidic analogs to electrical components aims to reduce the demand for rigid and bulky electromechanical valves and hard electronic controllers within soft robots. This ongoing effort is advanced in this work by creating sheet‐based fluidic diodes constructed from readily available flexible sheets of polymers and textiles using a layered fabrication approach amenable to manufacturing at scale. These sheet‐based fluidic diodes restrict reverse flow over a wide range of differential pressures—exhibiting a diodicity (the ratio of resistance to reverse vs forward flow) of approximately 100×—to address functional limitations exhibited by prior soft fluidic diodes. By harnessing the diode's highly unidirectional flow, soft devices capable of 1) facilitating the capture and storage of pressurized fluid, 2) performing Boolean operations using diode logic, 3) enabling binary encoding of circuits by preventing interactions between different pressurized input lines, and 4) converting oscillating input pressures to a direct current‐like, positively phased output are realized. This work exemplifies the use of fluidic diodes to achieve complex patterns of actuation and unique capabilities through embedded fluidic circuitry, enabling future development of sheet‐based systems—including wearable and assistive robots made from textiles—as well as other soft robotic devices.",

    "abstract": "Wearable haptic devices transmit information via touch receptors in the skin, yet devices located on parts of the body with high densities of receptors, such as fingertips and hands, impede interactions. Other locations that are well‐suited for wearables, such as the wrists and arms, suffer from lower perceptual sensitivity. The emergence of textile‐based wearable devices introduces new techniques of fabrication that can be leveraged to address these constraints and enable new modes of haptic interactions. This article formalizes the concept of “multiscale” interaction, an untapped paradigm for haptic wearables, enabling enhanced delivery of information via textile‐based haptic modules. In this approach, users choose the depth and detail of their haptic experiences by varying their interaction mode. Flexible prototyping methods enable multiscale haptic bands that provide both body‐scale interactions (on the forearm) and hand‐scale interactions (on the fingers and palm). A series of experiments assess participants’ ability to identify pressure states and spatial locations delivered by these bands across these interaction scales. A final experiment demonstrates the encoding of three‐bit information into prototypical multiscale interactions, showcasing the paradigm's efficacy. This research lays the groundwork for versatile haptic communication and wearable design, offering users the ability to select interaction modes for receiving information.",

    "abstract": "Currently, cables are manually installed in aircraft manufacturing scenarios. The utilization of robots in cable assemblies can enhance efficiency and ensure quality, presenting great promise for the future. However, the assembly process must control the shape of the cables, which is a significant challenge for robots. On the one hand, cables have high degrees of freedom in space, making accurate modeling of cable dynamics for robotic arm manipulation difficult; on the other hand, cable deformation has uncertainty, and the applied forces cause simultaneous deformation and motion, which is difficult to control. To address these problems, this study proposes a cable‐shape control method based on graph neural networks and online visual shape‐servoing. The method first approximates cable dynamics with a graph neural network. Then, in practice, the learnt model is used alongside visual‐based shape‐servoing to generate optimal robotic arm movements, controlling the cable to attain the desired shape. In the experiments, precise control of three different cable types is realized, and an example of a completed cable assembly is shown.",

First, the function and structure of the robot are described, including an analysis of the Hawken mechanism's endpoint trajectories and a regional examination of the robot leg's fundamental components, establishing a relationship between the trajectory characteristics and linkage length. Second, the robot posture transformation strategy is analysed, obtaining the geometric dimensional constraints and feasibility regions of the posture transformation. The posture transformation process is quantified, and the robot transformation gait and drive functions are designed. The robot gait and velocity regulation are implemented based on a neural control architecture. Finally, the robot's locomotion and posture transformation are tested using four high‐speed cameras. The results show that the robot can crawl on an inclined surface and continue crawling in a dorsal downward posture post‐fall.

The configuration variation behaviors are realized by recombinant kirigami segments, and thus, with only head segment actuation, the gripper slickly deforms among different configurations. Revolutionizing the conventional deployable systems, the proposed design methodology can realize configuration variation‐locking integration, and reusing of multi‐stability property. To realize rapid configuration switching with the lowest energy input, a nested origami actuation, called trigger structure, is given. Furthermore, advanced design for the trigger structure is carried out, broadening the bistable state to four‐stable geometric configurations for enhanced reachable space of the flexible gripper. By combining the design of the advanced trigger structure, the flexible gripper enables an energy‐free switching behavior between deployed and curled configurations in symmetrical and asymmetrical planes. The asymmetrical configurations, induced by the multi‐stability property of the advanced trigger structure, make the flexible gripper appropriate for various moving velocities capture. The proposed kirigami multi‐stable flexible gripper has significant capture capability for moving targets with different types and motion attitudes. Summarily, the proposed kirigami multi‐stable flexible gripper opens a new avenue for flexible robots, with potential applications in space exploration, grippers, and beyond.",

The jumping process is thoroughly analyzed, and the kinematics and dynamics models are derived in meticulous detail. In addition, the performance of the robot is comprehensively assessed from aspects of wheel action versus vertical jump capability, power consumption, and endurance across various motion modes.

However, the current 1D hinge deformation‐driven transformation of foldable origami with rigid or slightly deformable panels cannot achieve a 3D complex and large curvilinear morphing. Moreover, most active origami structures use thin hinges with soft materials on their creases, thus resulting in a lower load capability. This study proposes a novel origami morphing method demonstrating large free‐form surface morphing, such as Euclidean to non‐Euclidean surface morphing with shape‐locking. Tensorial anisotropic stress in origami panels is embedded during the extrusion‐based 3D printing of shape memory polymers. The extrusion‐based 3D printing of isotropic SMPs can produce tensorial anisotropic stress in origami panels during fabrication, which can realize significant non‐Euclidean surface morphing with multiple deformation modes. The connecting topology of the origami unit cells influences the global morphing behavior owing to the interaction of the deformation of adjacent panels. Non‐Euclidean morphing integrated with 4D printing can provide multimodal shape locking at material and structural levels.",

The approach, combining 3D printing, robotic actuation, and innovative antenna design, enables various origami folding patterns, enhancing both portability and EM performance. This antenna's functionality has been successfully demonstrated, displaying its communication capabilities with another antenna and its ability to navigate narrow spaces on a remote‐controlled wheel robot.

The antenna operates in two modes at 2.08 and 2.4 GHz, ideal for fixed mobile use and radiolocation. Through extensive simulations and experiments, the antenna is evaluated in both flat and folded states, focusing on resonant frequency, gain patterns, and hinge connectivity.

Traditional pneumatic suction cups rely on bulky and noisy vacuum sources and need for preloading while electrostatic adhesion‐detachment devices generally cannot provide enough adhesion force. To address these shortcomings, a liquid‐amplified electrostatically driven suction cup is proposed inspired by octopus's sucker, including a negative pressure chamber with a wrinkle‐like membrane and a sealing ring. The negative pressure chamber generates the active adhesion force enhanced by the wrinkle‐like membrane, increasing the adhesion strength tenfold compared to pure electrostatic adhesion.

    "abstract": "Nanomaterial properties and functionalities are influenced by their shape, size, and chemical composition. The importance of these parameters highlights the need for a statistically robust analysis of a large particle population, necessitating automation. This study introduces a neural network‐empowered smart scan technique that achieves a relative increase in speed compared to traditional energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping. The main advantage is that it reduces the required dose, decreasing potential damage to the sample by avoiding unnecessary exposure. It holds potential use in other multimodal scanning transmission electron microscopy or scanning‐based imaging approaches. In the first example, identifying particles in a matrix with a trained neural network reduces the acquisition time by two orders of magnitude. This acceleration enables a statistical compositional analysis of thousands of particles in less than 1 h. Similar improvements are observed for atomic resolution. The discrete positions of atoms identified by the trained network allow for selective EDX sampling at these centers, thereby identifying the atomic species of the column with much‐reduced sampling. Consequently, a lower sampling dose is required, enabling mapping of more delicate materials with high lateral resolution and at a high statistical confidence interval. Even though manual training is still required, this approach greatly benefits repetitive quality control tasks.",

While convolutional neural networks‐based approaches have been introduced, the quest for higher performance continues, especially for precise robotics manipulation, including in the Agri‐robotics domain. This article proposes an improved transformer‐based pipeline for full pose estimation, incorporating a Depth Refinement Module. Operating solely on monocular images, the architecture features an innovative Lighter Depth Estimation Network using a Feature Pyramid with an up‐sampling method for depth prediction. A Transformer‐based Detection Network with additional prediction heads is employed to directly regress object centers and predict the full poses of the target objects. A novel Depth Refinement Module is then utilized alongside the predicted centers, full poses, and depth patches to refine the accuracy of the estimated poses. The performance of this pipeline is extensively compared with other state‐of‐the‐art methods, and the results are analyzed for fruit picking applications. The results demonstrate that the pipeline improves the accuracy of pose estimation to up to 90.79% compared to other methods available in the literature.",

This study introduces a straightforward and efficient method for creating PEDOT‐based, biomimetic, fiber‐shaped, linearly contracting ionic electroactive polymer actuators. To achieve this, a wet‐spinning technique is presented, which enables a continuous production of PEDOT:polystyrene sulfate (PSS) fibers at high production rates of 34 m h −1 , an additional fiber washing step and a sulfuric acid posttreatment step to increase the fibers conductivity. The fibers provide a high conductivity of 1028 S cm −1 , maximum tensile strength reaching 182 MPa, and a maximum elongation of 24%. When utilized as CP actuators in an aqueous sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate electrolyte medium, the fibers demonstrate a repeatable maximum isometric contractile force of 1.64 mN and repeatable linear contractile strain up to 0.56%. Furthermore, a high level of cyclic long‐term actuation stability can be demonstrated. Notably, these contractile strains are, to the best of knowledge, the highest reported values for pristine PEDOT:PSS fibers.",

However, integrating tactile sensing into these grippers presents challenges due to the specific properties of the particle jamming mechanism. This study introduces a parallel particle jamming soft gripper equipped with tactile sensing capabilities. The gripper consists of two tactile sensing particle jamming pads (TSPJPs) that are integrated with flexible optoelectronic skins. These skins are made of silicone rubber membranes and are embedded with a 3 × 3 array of stretchable optical waveguide arrays (SOWAs). Testing indicates that incorporating these sensors enhances the gripper's tactile sensing capabilities, with minimal impact on its particle jamming‐based grasping function. A single TSPJP can accurately detect various contact points and estimate the contract forces. The proposed soft gripper can reliably grasp a wide range of objects, varying in shape, hardness, and weight, and it provides detailed tactile feedback on contact locations and the intensity of the grasping through the SOWA sensor. It can precisely distinguish between different grasping postures using a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) learning model. Furthermore, it can effectively detect the slippage of grasped objects, facilitating accurate closed‐loop control for secure manipulation.",

Biomaterial screens are typically fabricated as microarrays or “chips,” seeded with the cell type of interest, then phenotyped using immunocytochemistry and high‐content imaging, generating vast quantities of image data. Typically, analysis is only performed on fluorescent cell images as it is relatively simple to automate through intensity thresholding of cellular features. Automated analysis of bright‐field images is rarely performed as it presents an automation challenge as segmentation thresholds that work in all images cannot be defined. This limits the biological insight as cell response cannot be correlated to specifics of the biomaterial feature (e.g., shape, size) as these features are not visible on fluorescence images. Computer Vision aims to digitize tasks humans do by sight, such as identify objects by their shape. Herein, two case studies demonstrate how open‐source approaches, (region‐based convolutional neural network and algorithmic [OpenCV]), can be integrated into cell‐biomaterial HTS analysis to automate bright‐field segmentation across thousands of images, allowing rapid, spatial definition of biomaterial features during cell analysis for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Untethered soft robots (USRs) based on single‐actuation methods face inherent limitations due to restricted energy resources, which adversely affect their performance. Pneumatic‐tendon‐coupled actuators (PTCAs) offer an effective approach for USRs by combining the compliance and variable stiffness of pneumatic actuation with the precision and rapid motion control of tendon‐driven actuation. However, current PTCA‐based USRs are limited in versatility and efficiency when executing complex tasks. This research introduces discrete pneumatic‐tendon‐coupled actuators with interconnected air circuit (DPTCAs‐IAC) to address these limitations through two major design approaches: 1) multiple discrete DPTCAs with integrated micro pump, providing additional degrees of freedom and independent motion control while regulating internal pressure without significantly adding weight; and 2) interconnecting multiple DPTCAs through air circuits to facilitate gas flow and enhance efficiency. Theoretical modeling and experimental tests conducted on single DPTCA and DPTCAs‐IAC show that the IAC effectively reduces actuation torque and that opposite‐direction movements consume less energy compared to same‐direction movements. An untethered soft robotic gripper and an untethered quadruped robot with soft legs based on DPTCAs‐IAC are developed. Both demonstrate excellent controllability, compact system integration, and multifunctionality, highlighting the potential of DPTCAs‐IAC in advancing the development of complex untethered soft robots.",

Despite these advances, the standard photovoltaic materials development workflow still involves manually performing multiple characterization techniques on every new device, requiring significant time and expenditures. One barrier to ML implementation is that most models reported to date are trained on computer simulated data, due to the difficulty in experimentally collecting the massive data sets needed for model training, limiting the ability to assess the limitations and validity of these methods, as well as to access new potential physical mechanisms absent in simulations. Herein, several neural networks trained on experimental data from PbS colloidal quantum dot thin‐film solar cells are introduced. These models predict multiple, complex materials properties, including carrier mobility, relative photoluminescence intensity, and electronic trap‐state density, from a single, simple measurement: illuminated current–voltage curves. The measurement system considers the spatial distribution of the materials parameters to gather and predict large amounts of data by treating an inhomogeneous device as a series of thousands of micro‐devices, a novel feature compared to existing solutions. This model can be extended to other materials and devices, accelerating development times for new optoelectronic technologies.",

Natural and complex physical human–robot interactions utilizing intelligent EMG‐based interfaces require a computational estimation model for 3D voluntary forces. Existing computational models infrequently directly encode the interconnections among the spatial‐dimensional components of 3D arm forces and experience performance degradation caused by confounding variables like muscle fatigue in EMG‐based control. Motivated by this challenge, a computational model is proposed using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which only requires a user‐friendly calibration by an incremental GMM approach to reduce the effect of muscle fatigue. GMM aims to encode the multivariable connection between EMG and voluntary force by joint probability density distribution. The EMG‐based control system retrieves the estimated voluntary forces given EMG from GMM by utilizing the Gaussian mixture regression. Herein, the performance of the proposed EMG‐based admittance control is tested using GMM by trajectory‐tracking experiments before and after the fatigue‐inducing experiment. The experiments include eight healthy participants. The experimental outcomes prove that the EMG‐based control using calibrated GMM shows an increase of 23.66% and 8.17% in tracking precision and motion compliance, showing potential application across diverse domains involving physical human–robot interactions.",

Application of the model to an independent validation cohort of 113 PDAC patients confirms its robustness and utility as a diagnosis tool.

However, recently developed wearable strain sensors exhibit several limitations. For example, when a sensor is designed with high sensitivity to detect strain, it struggles to accurately measuring the deformation of low‐stiffness materials like skin. Additionally, finding the optimal balance between sensitivity, durability, hysteresis, and strain range in sensor design is challenging. To address these challenges, a Buckled, Ultrasoft, Crack‐based, Large strain, EpiDermal (BUCKLED) sensor is developed. This sensor integrates the benefits of soft structure engineering with high sensitivity of crack‐based sensing mechanisms to ensure optimal skin deformation measurements. The BUCKLED sensor exhibits significant improvements in compliance (18 500 mm N −1 ), stretchability (100%), hysteresis (2%), durability (10 000 cycles with 100% strain), and force sensitivity () owing to its buckled shape, confirming its ability to detect subtle movements with enhanced accuracy. The sensor's high compliance allows it to accurately measure low‐stiffness objects, ensuring reliable performance. Furthermore, the sensor's tunability is demonstrating its effectiveness in applications such as respiratory monitoring, facial expression recognition, and silent speech interfaces. Consequently, the proposed sensor is versatile and holds great potential for a wide range of sensing applications.",

However, prolonged exposure to high humidity inside masks can cause discomfort and increase the risk of respiratory diseases. To address the issue, in this work, a porous polymer humidity sensor suitable for monitoring respiratory changes in high humidity environment is prepared and integrated into the power air‐purifying mask. Combined with the transfer learning algorithm, the problem with respiratory resistance caused by delayed air supply due to signal processing in the traditional power air‐purifying mask is overcome, and the respiratory signal is effectively predicted in advance, so as to achieve real‐time on‐demand air supply. The brief process is as follows: A porous polymer humidity sensor with fast response/recovery times (2.94/4.86 s) at 95% relative humidity (RH) is developed for monitoring respiratory rate changes in high humidity environments. By integrating this sensor with a powered air‐purifying system and employing a transfer learning algorithm, the system predicts respiratory signals and adjusts the air supply in real‐time. This reduces mask humidity from 95% RH to 40–50% RH in 1.8 s, ensuring comfortable, low‐resistance breathing for workers.This work will be conductive to the development of comfortable poweredair‐purifying respirators with low resistance and humidity.",

This work addresses rapid inverse design of such metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors, a challenge due to its intractability and nonunique solutions. Unlike data‐intensive and noninterpretable deep‐learning‐based methods, this work proposes the random‐forest‐based interpretable generative inverse design (RIGID), a single‐shot inverse design method for fast generation of metamaterials with on‐demand functional behaviors. RIGID leverages the interpretability of a random forest‐based “design → response” forward model, eliminating the need for a more complex “response → design” inverse model. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained random forest, one can sample a desired number of design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. RIGID is validated on acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems, each with fewer than 250 training samples. Compared to the genetic algorithm‐based design generation approach, RIGID generates satisfactory solutions that cover a broader range of the design space, allowing for better consideration of additional figures of merit beyond target satisfaction. This work offers a new perspective on solving on‐demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design under small data constraints.",

Modern computer vision algorithms often rely on artificial neural network approaches, which require image‐like representations of the data and cannot fully exploit the characteristics of event data. Herein, approaches to action recognition based on the Fourier transform are proposed. The approaches are intended to recognize oscillating motion patterns commonly present in nature. In particular, the approaches are applied to a recent dataset of breeding penguins annotated for “ecstatic display,” a behavior where the observed penguins flap their wings at a certain frequency. It is found that the approaches are both simple and effective, producing slightly lower results than a deep neural network (DNN) while relying just on a tiny fraction of the parameters compared to the DNN (five orders of magnitude fewer parameters). They work well despite the uncontrolled, diverse data present in the dataset. It is hoped that this work opens a new perspective on event‐based processing and action recognition.",

The recorded signals are processed using a long short‐term memory (LSTM) neural network, achieving over 91% classification accuracy in distinguishing different emotions through a data fusion approach, showing &gt;9% enhancement in accuracy as compared to feature fusion. As a proof of concept, Q‐learning is implemented with the data to simulate emotional responses in a robotic model. The study's approach provides a pathway to understanding complex human emotions and enhances the capabilities of effective human–machine interaction.",

    "abstract": "Printed electronics have traditionally used substrates and materials derived from fuel‐based or less abundant and toxic resources, raising environmental concerns. Wood as a substrate reduces processing steps and enables the integration of intelligent functionalities in wooden furniture, offering biodegradability, nontoxicity, and derivation from renewable sources. In this work, sustainably printed transistors using zinc oxide nanoparticles as the active layer and honey electrolyte on wood substrates are demonstrated as a promising approach to reduce the environmental footprint of electronics. Despite the substrate's high roughness, the transistor exhibits excellent performance for screen‐printed devices, with low on‐voltage of 0.32 ± 0.12 V and high I on /I off of (2.4 ± 0.9) × 10 4 . Further analysis of hysteresis in transfer curves under varying scan rates and sweep ranges reveals the device's ability to adjust memory windows and on‐current. Notably, these devices successfully emulate synapses, exhibiting neural facilitation and plasticity, indicating a shift toward sustainable computing. The device's dynamic response to single and successive presynaptic pulses demonstrates its ability to adjust synaptic weight, transition from transient to persistent memory, and pulse width‐, frequency‐, voltage‐, and number‐dependent excitatory postsynaptic currents. The successful emulation of the learning–forgetting–relearning–forgetting process underscores the device's potential for use in sustainable high‐performance neuromorphic systems.",

Incorporating wearable technology with sweat rate sensors allows individuals to conveniently monitor their health, optimize workouts, and enhance occupational safety. However, challenges persist in such integration techniques, including intricate manufacturing, non-linear responses to changes in sweat rates, and errors from the intermediate measurement of the distance sweat travels in the sensor. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive wearable platform that includes a fully printed, flexible sensor patch, readout electronics, and a mobile app for continuous, real-time monitoring of sweat rate. Utilizing direct 3D printing and scalable microfluidic fabrication, we produced a sensor patch measuring 700 mm 2 and weighing 380 mg. The microfluidic channels are 850 μm wide, and 164 μm thick with serpentine electrodes measure sweat rate using capacitance. Our custom readout electronics capture these changes in capacitance to accurately measure sweat rate, achieving a sensitivity of 0.01 μLmin -1. We validated the sensor's performance against analytical models, simulations, and on-body trials with commercial sensors.

Design automation of analogue neuromemristive chips is made difficult by the need to design chips at low cost, ease of scaling, high‐energy efficiency, and small on‐chip area. The rapid progress in edge AI computing applications generates high demand for developing smart sensors. The integration of high‐density analogue computing AI chips as coprocessing units to sensors is gaining popularity. This article proposes a hardware–software codesign framework to speed up and automate the design of analogue neuromemristive chips. This work uses genetic algorithms with objective functions that take into account hardware nonidealities such as limited precision of devices, the device‐to‐device variability, and device failures. The optimized neural architectures and hyperparameters successfully map with the library of relevant neuromemristive analogue hardware blocks. The results demonstrate the advantage of proposed automation to speed up the analogue circuit design of large‐scale neuromemristive networks and reduce overall design costs for AI chips.",

Herein strain engineering and geometric frustration as an on‐demand strategy for fabricating spontaneous rolling “origami” structures with programmable multistability across multiple length scales are exploited. Through experiments, theory, and finite element simulations, it is demonstrated that a strain‐engineered bilayer structure can make a transition from a monostable, doubly curved shape to a neutrally stable, developable configuration, depending on a dimensionless parameter that is determined through the plate's geometry and misfit strain. In addition, the doubly curved region near the edge can play a significant role in deciding the final bending direction of the strained bilayer due to edge effects. A strain‐engineering approach is further proposed to generate various 3D structures by programming the geometry, misfit strain, and mechanical properties of the bilayer units, for instance, a self‐folding buckyball structure. These design principles have promising broad applications in constructing self‐deploying, stimuli‐responsible, and multifunctional devices across multiple length scales.",

The idea of microrobotics is primarily based on teleoperated mobile micromachines equipped with manipulation capabilities such as actuated grippers and drug‐loaded reservoirs. Due to miniaturization challenges, the majority of these micromachines are wirelessly actuated using magnetic fields or acoustic waves. A step toward complete autonomy is the development of on‐board control systems that directly transduce environmental stimuli such as heat and pressure into actuation, without going through the perception and computation cycles. Following the analogy of the central nervous system for the architecture of conventional autonomous robots, the next‐generation microrobots are expected to possess reflexes that would allow them to autonomously navigate inside structured microenvironments and perform targeted and triggered operations. Herein, the construction of on‐board control systems using stimuli–responsive materials, nonlinear mechanical mechanisms, and fluid–structure interactions is described. Recent advances in macroscale soft robotics and mechanical metamaterials are highlighted with the hope that they inspire solutions for microrobotics.",

The high recording channel counts, however, pose significant challenges for data analysis because the required time and computational resources grow superlinearly with the data volume. Herein, the feasibility of real‐time reconstruction of neural functional connectivity using a second‐order memristor network is analyzed. Spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity, natively implemented by the internal dynamics of the memristor device, leads to the successful discovery of temporal correlations between pre‐ and postsynaptic spikes of the simulated neural circuits in an unsupervised fashion. The proposed system demonstrates high classification accuracy under a wide range of parameter settings considering indirect connections, synaptic weights, transmission delays, connection density, and so on, and enables the capturing of dynamic connectivity evolutions. The influence of device nonideal factors on detection accuracy is systematically evaluated, and the system shows robustness to initial weight randomness, and cycle‐to‐cycle and device‐to‐device variations. The proposed method allows direct mapping of neural connectivity onto the artificial memristor network and can lead to efficient front‐end data analysis of high‐density neural recording systems and potentially directly coupled bioartificial networks.",

    "abstract": "Intra‐abdominal hypertension (IAH) has gained increasing attention worldwide because of its prevalence and high mortality rate among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Most current approaches of measuring intra‐abdominal pressure (IAP) involve the use of sensors inside or attached to the body, which may, however, make daily monitoring inconvenient. This paper proposes a noninvasive and contactless system to learn the relationship between the passive mechanical behavior of the abdominal wall with millimeter‐wave (mm‐wave) frequency‐modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar and an IAP sensor via a deep learning approach. We correlated the IAP variance with the mobility measures of the abdominal wall and proposed Pearson‐coefficient‐guided domain adversarial neural network (PCG‐DANN) to learn the mapping relationship. To validate the efficacy of our proposed method, a stable intra‐abdominal hypertension/abdominal compartment syndrome (IAH/ACS) model using swine was established to evaluate the mobility of the abdominal wall under different intra‐abdominal pressures with multichannel mm‐wave FMCW radar. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing with other neural network structures and mostly adopted sensor‐based methods. These preliminary results confirm that the new methodology for evaluating IAP nonlinearity is promising and that it can serve as an important diagnostic and treatment reference for patients with IAH.",

Herein, a self‐folded corrugated structure (SCS) is developed based on the reinforcing properties of the origami technique. The corrugated structures are used as the core materials for a high‐strength, open‐channel sandwich structure. Research on self‐folded core materials is scarce; thus, a design concept is proposed, and the mechanical properties of the SCS are evaluated. First, the structural parameters of the SCS fabricated by changing the printing parameters (e.g., linewidth and number of lines/creases), to derive the structural model, are determined. The model facilitates the design of an SCS with the desired structure. Thereafter, the mechanical properties of the SCSs are evaluated by conducting three‐point bending tests to determine the essential design parameters corresponding to high stiffness. Moreover, SCSs can be stacked without occupying space, thus leading to improved strength. These SCSs fabricated using self‐folding paper by inkjet printing are low cost and ecofriendly. Moreover, they are specialized for rapid design and fabrication, depending on the application. Herein, the use of SCS as a novel smart core because it exhibits high transportation efficiency and stiffness without additional components is proposed.

    "abstract": "As the use of artificial intelligence (AI) soars, the development of novel neuromorphic computing is demanding because of the disadvantages of the von Neumann architecture. Furthermore, extensive research on electrochemical metallization (ECM) memristors as synaptic cells have been carried out toward a linear conductance update for online learning applications. In most cases, however, a conductance distribution change over time has not been studied as a major issue, giving less consideration to inference‐only computing accelerators based on offline learning. Herein, organic–inorganic bilayer stacking for synaptic unit cells using poly(1,3,5‐trivinyl‐1,3,5‐trimethyl cyclotrisiloxane) (pV3D3) and Al 2 O 3 thin films is suggested, showing highly enhanced reliability for offline learning. The bilayer structure achieves better reliability and control of the analog resistive switching and synaptic functions, respectively, through the guided formation of conductive filaments via tip‐enhanced electric fields. In addition, 5‐bit multilevel states achieve long‐term stability (&gt;10 4 s) following an in‐depth study on conductance‐level stability. Finally, a device‐to‐system‐level simulation is performed by building a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the hybrid devices. This highlighted the significance of multilevel states in fully connected layers. It is believed that the study provides a practical approach to using ECM‐based memristors for inference‐only neural network accelerators.",

    "abstract": "The locust's steering behavior has long been thought to be achieved under the control of fore‐ and mesothoracic legs before takeoff. This turning strategy is not necessarily present in all steering jumps. It is found that the locust could achieve a large‐angle steering jump without significant yaw rotation beforehand. Herein, how the hindlegs contribute to the steering jump, including kinematic analyses and reaction forces measurement, is studied. It is found that the contralateral hindleg of the turn direction presses down tens of milliseconds earlier than the ipsilateral side. The time lag between both hindlegs is primarily responsible for the steering jumps. The leg kickings with a time lag is induced exogenously by designing sequential electrical stimulation signals for the muscles of both legs. Under 0‐ms, 20‐ms, and 40‐ms time lags, the induced steering angles are 2.1°, 22.1°, and 24.2°, respectively, in the loosely tethered jumps. A locust is transformed into a bio‐robot via a custom e‐backpack and demonstrate a remote‐controlled 20° jump of the bio‐robot. The asynchronous actions of bilateral actuators for steering jumps are extremely beneficial for micro‐robots, as both the jumping and the steering functions can be compacted together.",

One of the key challenges in soft actuator research is to simultaneously produce complex morphing (e.g., surface morphing) and high force. Therefore, a soft robotic pad (SRP) was developed as a new soft actuator that can potentially tackle this challenge. This article demonstrates the highly flexible customization process of the SRP regarding fabrication, morphing design, and force scaling for a challenging application: a giant manta ray robot with the Mobuliform swimming mode. Soft robotic pectoral fins (SRPFs) are customized using the SRP technology for the robot. Detailed characterization results show that the SRPFs can generate almost 100 N force or 25 Nm torque with a dual curving motion to mimic the manta ray fin kinematics. The SRPFs are able to propel the manta ray robot to a decent swimming speed with biomimetic fin motions. As a new member of the soft actuator family, SRPs exhibit strong capabilities through this manta ray robot, and they can potentially become unique tools for many engineers and researchers to tackle challenging applications requiring high force and surface morphing.",

    "abstract": "Highly selective and sensitive detection of chemical mixtures by a single sensor consistently suffers from overlapping response signals. Previous researchers have to make a detour to avoid overlapping through preparing selective sensor materials, tedious preseparation, and time‐consuming operation. Nowadays, machine learning (ML), as one remarkable branch of artificial intelligence (AI), possesses advantages to modernize pathways to approach chemical challenges and provides a novel short cut for chemical mixture detection. Herein, a challenging example of a single nonselective cataluminescence (CTL) sensor with nonequilibrium and especially nonlinear responses is taken for chemical mixture detection. Intelligent recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with gated recurrent units are applied to directly predict mixture component contents from overlapping signals and achieve 100% and 92.22% of prediction accuracy for known and unknown samples, respectively. Furthermore, the physical law of response overlapping is revealed to support the mechanism of the proposed approach. The introduction of RNN into selective sensing not only initiates a distinctive and simple pathway for selective quantitative detection of mixtures via a single nonselective sensor but also can inspire future intelligent detection approaches in analytical chemistry, biological analysis, environmental monitoring, healthcare, clinical therapy, etc.",

In this approach, iPRISM incorporates gene expression, biological functional network, tumor microenvironment characteristics, immune‐related pathways, and clinical data to provide a comprehensive view of factors influencing immunotherapy efficacy. Using stepwise logistic regression, we identified key predictive features and validated iPRISM across multiple cohorts including melanoma, bladder cancer, non‐small cell lung cancer, and stomach adenocarcinoma.

By identifying key genetic and immunological factors, this model provides a new insight for more personalized treatment strategies and combination therapies to overcome resistance mechanisms. iPRISM can be accessed at CRAN: https://CRAN.R‐project.org/package=iPRISM .",

As workspaces shrink, the need for precise autonomous manipulation in confined and isolated environments increases, particularly in areas such as electronics and biological assemblies. Herein, an autonomous, untethered, holonomic, mobile micromanipulator driven by piezoelectric actuators with nanometer resolution is developed. The micromanipulator comprises a driving circuit, single‐board computer, battery, manipulator, and small camera; it is lightweight (515 g), compact (90 × 116 × 104 mm), and untethered, capable of independently operating in confined and dangerous spaces for humans. The micromanipulator can autonomously position a single object with a positioning error of 0.18 ± 0.51 mm and an angular deviation of −0.4° ± 1.2°, utilizing image recognition, machine learning, and visual feedback. Moreover, the micromanipulator is verified to function in extreme conditions that simulate draft chambers and clean benches, where it successfully performs circuit mounting in confined space. The device can arrange droplets under microscopy for applications in chemical and biomedical fields, demonstrating its versatility and precise positioning capabilities. Additionally, its multi‐scale applications are explored from centimeters to sub‐micrometers and adjusted to the magnification capabilities of various microscopes.",

However, its low open‐loop locomotion control precision makes it difficult to perform tasks requiring precise control, while the number of sensors that can be carried is limited due to their low load capacity, which significantly limits its application scenarios. To this end, an exoskeleton is proposed herein, which significantly improves the locomotion control accuracy and load capacity of cyborg insects. The exoskeleton, with a peripheral size of 7.2 cm × 14 cm, employs three wheels to carry the load and control the direction of motion of the cyborg insect. The exoskeleton‐integrated cyborg insect excels in locomotion control precision. Without feedback control, it completes continuous circular and linear motions with minor offset errors. Compared to other cyborg insects, its load capacity is increased from less than 20–400 g or more, allowing it to be equipped with large, energy‐intensive sensors. In addition, the exoskeleton supports switching between high‐precision controlled motion and insect‐driven active exploration modes. This design broadens the application scenarios of the cyborg insect and opens the possibility of performing more complex tasks.",

    "abstract": "Vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) remains a diagnostic challenge due to its scarce prevalence, and delayed diagnosis usually results in blindness and even fatal outcomes. Herein, an artificial intelligence (AI) system is developed to identify VRL among 16 retinal diseases and conditions on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images with the cross‐subject meta‐transfer learning (CS‐MTL) algorithm. Extensive experiments of few‐shot VRL recognition tasks prove the robustness of our model on 1‐, 3‐, and 5‐shot scenarios, achieving an F1 score of 0.8697 to 0.9367. The superiority of the model is shown with a higher F1 score (0.9310) compared with other state‐of‐the‐art algorithms (0.5487–0.9018) and three doctors whose clinical experiences range between 3 to 10 years without the help of the CS‐MTL (0.7773–0.8949). AI assistance significantly improves the F1 scores of doctors by 6.16–14.46% ( p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the F1 scores of AI‐assisted senior doctor and retinal specialist (0.9414 and 0.9500), but not the junior doctor (0.8897), exceed that of the CS‐MTL (0.9310). This study presents a promising approach for aiding in the diagnosis of VRL on retinal OCT images and may provide a novel insight into the collaboration of doctors with AI techniques, resulting in reducing the risk of diagnostic delays of rare diseases.",

Humans display a range of remarkable haptic skills, enabled by the synergistic interactions of the somatosensory system with higher‐level cognitive processes. In contrast, robotics’ haptic sensing solutions have historically lacked the ability to achieve human‐level perceptive capabilities, lacking in both the sensory system and its cognitive digital counterpart. Herein, part of this challenge is addressed by leveraging the success of the fields of soft robotics and deep learning to show how a soft robotic hand, equipped with low‐resolution tactile sensing, can be used to accurately identify a diverse set of objects. In particular, ROSE‐Net, a neural network that leverages multiple grasps to enable accurate pose‐invariant object recognition, is developed. The multi‐grasp haptic discrimination solution can lead to a significant increase in performance. The versatility and adaptability of this approach are also tested in two scenarios: a learning transfer scenario and a fault tolerance scenario. Finally, the framework is tested in an online discrimination task, where this approach is shown to naturally require additional grasps for objects that are more challenging to identify using a single grasp and low spatial resolution tactile sensing.",

Over years of development, many microrobot fabrication methods have been developed; however, they typically require costly specialized physical vapor deposition (PVD) vacuum instrumentation and present homogeneity and conformality coating problems (especially in complex 3D structures). Herein, a solution‐based polydopamine (PDA)‐assisted electroless deposition method is developed to deposit a superparamagnetic nickel thin film on microrobots. The multilayered functional film design comprises PDA as an adhesive primer and reducing agent, silver nanoclusters as catalysts, and a nickel magnetic top film, all deposited in a batch solution‐based process on glass and 3D‐printed polymer substrates. This multilayer magnetic coating is implemented and demonstrated in three magnetic microrobot archetypes, including arbitrarily‐shaped active particles, microrollers, and helical swimming microrobots, each using distinct actuation working mechanisms. Due to the material‐independent interfacial adhesive properties of PDA, this multilayer functionalization strategy can open up new magnetic microrobot fabrication schemes with a broad compatibility with materials and structures (including complex 3D‐printed polymer microstructures) and without the need for and limitations of PVD coating approaches.",

Artificial central pattern generators (CPGs) can be either implemented in software or constructed in a physical domain. The former lacks embodiment, inhibiting direct interactions with the physical world. The latter is restricted by a complex translation of abstract functions to the physical domain, e.g., negative feedback, if‐then behavior, etc. Here, self‐oscillators, a rudimentary type of central pattern generators, that find ground in both the pneumatic and electrical domains are demonstrated. First, the hysteretic behavior of previously developed conical membranes is analyzed in deformation space. This state‐space behavior is then transformed to the electrical domain by means of a stretchable strain sensor. Next, an analog comparator distinguishes between the two states and instructs a pneumatic solenoid valve to counteract the current state. As a result, a stable oscillation emerges, with a frequency that is dominated by the physical characteristic of the pneumatic circuit. As such, the proposed electropneumatic oscillator provides a promising platform for building complex CPGs that control interactive neuromorphic robots.",

    "abstract": "Shared control combines human intelligence with autonomous algorithms, demonstrating potential for enhancing the intricate and dynamic operational capabilities of robots. In robotic surgery, shared control can integrate autonomous functions into master–slave control, which enables surgeons to receive certain control assistance while maintaining control of the operation. Such a shared control system must handle multiple types of dynamically changing motion tasks, for instance, trajectory tracking, obstacle avoidance, spatial constraint, and safety guarantee. This article proposes an innovative shared control method based on multiobjective motion fusion (MoMF) by integrating multiple objective controllers into master–slave control mode. In addition, a state feedback mechanism with prediction and evaluation model is developed to balance the control inputs of different control objectives. Further, an objective priority partition function is designed to overcome the conflicts between control objectives. In the proposed method, objective controllers can be added or removed as needed. The theoretical stability of the proposed MoMF method is proved. As an example, a fusion controller that considers four control objectives of a surgical cutting operation is designed to demonstrate the practicability of this method. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed MoMF method are validated by simulations and prosthesis experiments.",

    "abstract": "Previous compute‐in‐memory (CIM) technologies use current summation for executing matrix–vector multiplication (MVM) operations and are gaining attention as next‐generation artificial intelligence (AI) computing systems. Despite their advantages, these technologies encounter significant difficulties, such as managing wide current ranges in large arrays, overcoming substantial “IR (current‐resistance)‐drop” issues, and integrating with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor operating circuits. Herein, an innovative voltage‐summation‐based CIM (V‐CIM) technology is introduced; this technology represents a paradigm shift that employs capacitive coupling at a floating voltage summation node for MVM operations. By using a differential pair of input voltages (|Δ V |) with opposite signs relative to the reference voltage, the accumulated MVM results at the floating summation node cancel out, eliminating IR‐drop. Representing the MVM result as an analog voltage simplifies the neuron circuit design and significantly reduces energy consumption. V‐CIM technology is reported with two types of capacitive synaptic devices: read‐only and programmable. A prototype V‐CIM chip using read‐only capacitors is developed, demonstrating the superiority of V‐CIM in image classification applications. For programmable capacitive synaptic devices, a memcapacitor device based on logic‐compatible embedded flash memory is introduced. The work sheds light on ultralow‐power, highly integrated, and highly reliable AI computing systems based on CIM technology.",

    "abstract": "Continuum wall‐climbing robots with a compact structure and omnidirectional movement capabilities can be used for the internal space inspection of complex equipment. Reliable adhesive capacity and sensitive distance feedback guarantee the stable operation of the robot. Consequently, an actively deformable claw equipped with multiple adhering and sensing units is developed, which can realize enveloping adhesion and distance feedback on a large curved surface. The flexible claw realizes an integrated design of the physical structure and coupling design of the excitation circuit. Both the adhering and sensing units use high‐permeability permalloy as their magnetic core and have the same closed magnetic circuit. Under the excitation of DC parallel with double winding, the electromagnetic adhesion effect is activated. Under the excitation of the AC series with unilateral winding, a self‐inductive microdisplacement sensor is realized. A fuzzy controller is established with the distance information of the sensing unit as the input and the joint angle and claw deformation as two outputs. A robot based on the fuzzy controller realizes automatic adhesion to surfaces with different curvatures and reliable applications in nuclear reaction equipment.",

As a result, users must frequently visit prosthetic centers for socket adjustments or replacements, which is time‐consuming and limiting. This study introduces a new transfemoral socket that incorporates a motorized cable‐driven mechanism and a sensorized liner, allowing it to adapt to changes in residual limb volume based on interface pressures. Users can control the socket in both open‐ and closed‐loop modes using a customized mobile application. The socket is able to withstand compressive mechanical loads of up to 900 N and demonstrates effective biomechanical coupling capabilities. A mathematical model guide the design of the system and is experimentally verified. To validate the system, an in vitro residual limb simulator with a hydraulic chamber is utilized, enabling volume adjustments of ±7.5%. In closed‐loop mode, the smart socket effectively adjusts its volume to maintain interface pressure within the target range of 70–80 kPa. This innovative smart socket has the potential to enhance user satisfaction by allowing individuals with lower limb amputations to self‐adjust their sockets as needed, ensuring a proper fit and safe interface pressures on tissues.",

Current research mainly aims to enhance prediction accuracy in typical traffic conditions. However, less attention has been paid to low‐probability, high‐risk safety‐critical events. It is undeniable that multiagent interaction behaviors in safety‐critical events are more complex and difficult to predict. To address this, an interaction mechanism based on generative adversarial networks training, named GACNet, aimed at effectively predicting multiagent interaction behaviors under potential collision risks is proposed. GACNet is a deep learning framework capable of learning and capturing complex interaction patterns between multiple agents from real vehicle trajectory data. In addition, A conflict analysis module, which analyzes the predicted future trajectories and assesses potential collisions to provide a more detailed characterization of the interaction behaviors in safety‐critical events is designed and incorporated. This design enables the model to predict vehicle trajectory behaviors in safety‐critical events more accurately, aligning them more closely with real‐world trajectory distributions. This mechanism is validated in various highly interactive roundabout and urban road scenarios. The results demonstrate that GACNet accurately learns vehicle behavior characteristics from real traffic data and makes precise predictions of multiagent interaction behaviors in safety‐critical events.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel dual‐body negative‐pressure ground‐wall transition robot (DNPTR) aimed at expanding the application scenarios of climbing robots to meet the functional requirements of obstacle traversal and wall transition in high‐altitude operations. As a typical representative of highly nonlinear and multivariable strongly coupled systems, the wall transition actions of the DNPTR are analyzed and planned based on the mechanical structure characteristics. Subsequently, unified kinematic and dynamic models of the bipedal negative‐pressure climbing robot are established. To improve the automation and ensure safe, efficient operation of climbing robots, effective trajectory tracking control for the DNPTR is crucial. Addressing challenges such as model parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, this study proposes an adaptive trajectory tracking control method based on a radial basis function neural network. The method integrates a boundary layer with an improved exponential reaching law, forming a non‐singular terminal sliding mode control strategy. Using Lyapunov theory, the global asymptotic stability of the system is verified. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves faster convergence and effectively suppresses oscillations during trajectory tracking. This research is of practical importance, offering valuable guidance for the design of high‐accuracy, robust trajectory‐tracking controllers for dual‐body climbing robots.",

The occupation of the tumor alters the relative positions of structures in the orbit. Hence, for the first time, the relative spatial positional features are extracted between different orbital structures and the tumor, complemented by the texture characteristics of the tumor area, to perform hybrid modeling. To validate this idea, 114 orbital lymphoma patients were are included. Statistical analysis reveals significant differences between the two groups in terms of four spatial features (lymphoma lesion, eyeball, inferior rectus, and optic nerve) and two texture features (angular second moment and contrast). The accuracy of the classifier based on spatial, texture, and hybrid features is 84.7, 83.1, and 88.3%, respectively.

Herein, an optimal optical sensing sleeve using a multilayer perceptron is introduced to achieve an accurate inter‐day motion intent recognition. This sleeve, demonstrating a high correlation ( R 2 = 0.93) with grasping force, incorporates six novel optical waveguides. Each waveguide is specifically designed to respond to pressing with high linearity, achieved by minimizing bending with a 3D‐printed base and limiting elongation through carbon fiber reinforcement. This novel configuration enhances the generalization of the optical waveguides across multiple donning and doffing sessions. Furthermore, the multilayer perceptron model, which maps sensing signals to grasping forces, shows optimal performance compared to linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomial models. Remarkably, the correlation in mapping does not decrease in inter‐day experiments; instead, it increases by 4.54%, indicating improved model generalization. Additionally, 12 commonly used items are grasped and held by a prosthetic hand, controlled by the optical sensing sleeve, which suggests the robustness in daily life, for an amputee.

Combining high‐content screening (HCS) with artificial intelligence efficiently detects drug‐induced cellular phenotypes from a large pool of compounds.

Additionally, the existing morphology‐based studies use only few features, which cannot accurately characterize cell phenotypic perturbations. Herein, π‐PhenoDrug, a deep learning‐based pipeline, is developed for cell phenotype‐driven drug screening. It integrates cell segmentation, morphological profile construction, and phenotype analysis modules of HCS processes. π‐PhenoDrug is applied to evaluate drug response in various human melanoma cell lines.

Furthermore, π‐PhenoDrug identifies drugs with potential killing effects on melanoma cells from a library of diverse compounds. Compared with traditional single‐readout assays, this method is more sensitive to compounds that induce weaker phenotypes, reducing the risk of overlooking effective drugs.

In this work, a 4 × 4 flexible humidity sensing array and a designed flexible sampling circuit are directly integrated to form a noncontact handwriting recognition system. The humidity sensing array is fabricated by screen printing the interdigital electrode array on PET substrate with MXene acting as the humidity‐sensitive film.

The flexible sampling circuit allows simultaneous acquisition of 16 port signals and transmission to the computer. Combined with a convolutional neural network, the average accuracy of the noncontact handwriting recognition system for recognizing handwriting digits 1–9 is achieved to be highly 98.67%. The noncontact handwriting recognition system is further applied to control a mechanical hand to visualize handwriting digits in real time.

However, the physiological phenomenon of eye movements makes it difficult to align the convergence point of image lights with the human pupil, especially when the viewer needs to wear a pair of vision‐corrected frame glasses, resulting in blurred images. To accommodate the movements of human eye, herein, a waveguide‐based RPD system with bidirectional extended eyebox is proposed, in which two‐layer holographic optical elements (HOEs) are designed as the image combiner to generate different eye reliefs along the visual axis of the human eye. Each layer of HOEs generates two horizontally arranged viewpoints, thus, achieving bidirectional eyebox expansion. Experimental results show that the proposed RPD system provides two sets of viewpoints with the eye reliefs of 11 and 12 mm, respectively, and obtains a 2 × 2 viewpoint array distributed horizontally and axially. Additionally, two sets of viewpoints can be switched to accommodate the different eyewear habits of viewers. The proposed RPD system enhances the adaptability of near‐eye display device to the human eye through the bidirectional eyebox expansion.",

Therefore, this research proposes a novel hot‐plugging logic‐enabled pinch valve to facilitate seamless valve integration without disrupting the existing pneumatic system. The valve design incorporates a frame equipped with slots for two pneumatic actuators (PAs). A third slot positioned between these two actuators enables hot‐plugging capabilities for the operational elastic tubing pinched between the actuators. This configuration allows the control of higher operational pressures while operating at lower control pressures, achieving an impressive gain of up to eight and a maximum operational frequency of 1 Hz. Furthermore, by utilizing two PAs and adjusting the control pressure, the valve can execute a range of logical functions, including NOT, NAND, and NOR, without modifying its pneumatic connections.

    "abstract": "Matrix‐vector multiplications are a fundamental building block of artificial intelligence; this essential role has motivated their implementation in a variety of physical substrates, from memristor crossbar arrays to photonic‐integrated circuits. Yet their realization in soft‐matter intelligent systems remains elusive. Herein, A reprogrammable elastic metamaterial that computes matrix‐vector multiplications using floppy modes—deformations with near‐zero stored elastic energy is experimentally demonstrated. Floppy modes allow to program complex deformations without being hindered by the natural stiffness of the material; but their practical application is challenging, as their existence depends on global topological properties of the system. To overcome this challenge, a continuously parameterized unit cell design with well‐defined compatibility characteristics is introduced. This unit cell is then combined to form arbitrary matrix‐vector multiplications that can even be reprogrammed after fabrication. The results demonstrate that floppy modes can act as key enablers for embodied intelligence, smart micro electro mechanical systems(MEMS) devices, and in‐sensor edge computing.",

    "abstract": "Soft robotics is an attractive and rapidly emerging field, in which actuation is coupled with the elastic response of the robot's structure to achieve complex deformation patterns. A crucial challenge is the need for multiple control inputs, which adds significant complication to the system. A novel concept of single‐input control of an actuator is proposed, which composes of interconnected bistable elements. Dynamic response of the actuator and predesigned differences between the elements are exploited to facilitate any desired multistate transition using a single dynamic input. Formulation and analysis of the control system's dynamics and pre‐design of its multiple equilibrium states, as well as their stability, are shown. Then, fabrication and demonstration are done experimentally on single‐input control of two‐ and four‐element actuators, where the latter can achieve transitions between up to 48 desired states. This work paves the way for next‐generation soft robotic actuators with minimal actuation and maximal dexterity.",

    "abstract": "Soft fluidic actuators (SFAs) are widely adopted for soft robotic applications, for example, for the manipulation of delicate objects of various geometries. However, the innate compliance of SFAs prevents them from sustaining large forces when needed. Existing methods to achieve variable stiffness in SFAs necessitate complex mechanisms that require additional control inputs and often limit the flexibility of the actuators. This work explores the use of supercooled sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) solution as a multifunctional working fluid for SFAs to allow independent control of position and stiffness; the solution is used to both inflate the elastomer chambers while in liquid state and to achieve a dramatic increase in stiffness with rapid solidification. The mechanical properties of crystallized SAT samples in flexible membranes and with embedded materials for reinforcement are first investigated. SFAs that use the SAT solution to greatly increase their stiffness (up to 13 times) are then tested. Furthermore, the use of supercooled SAT is demonstrated to achieve both manipulation and stiffness change with a single control input. The proposed approach is a new way to combine the high manipulability of SFAs with stiffness tunability and opens up new applications for soft robots and manipulators.",

The main idea of this article is to introduce a feedback connection to combine several algorithms with respect to the forecasting and the detecting in a single algorithm. More precisely, Xgboost and long short‐term memory are used for forecastor and one‐class support vector machine and robust random cut forest are used for detector. Combining those 2 × 2 schemes leads to the overall four algorithms, and future anomalies can be detected before they occur. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified through some comparative simulations of an IEEE 3‐bus system with various faults. More interestingly, the detecting accuracies obtained through the two schemes of taking robust random cut forest are shown to be improved by 10% than those of employing the one‐class support vector machine. For the forecasting part, Xgboost is regarded as involving the fastest prediction speed for online implementations, and thus the combination of Xgboost and robust random cut forest can be the most suitable choice for anomaly forecasting for power system fault events.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative on‐ramp merging control for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can significantly enhance traffic flow and fuel efficiency at highway merging points. However, in mixed traffic scenarios where CAVs coexist with human‐driven vehicles (HDVs), the unpredictable behavior of HDVs poses challenges to safety and coordination. While many cooperative merging strategies focus on individual CAV control, fewer have addressed the coordination of multiple CAVs in such settings. This study introduces an optimization‐based cooperative merging strategy for all CAVs within a control zone, considering interactions with HDVs of uncertain intentions. A key innovation is the strategic influence of CAVs on HDV behavior by slowing down the CAV preceding HDVs, thereby allowing other CAVs on the adjacent road to merge in front of the HDVs with reduced uncertainty. The optimal slowdown pattern is identified by evaluating CAV throughput across various candidate patterns, with dynamic optimization applied at each time a new vehicle enters the control zone to effectively manage HDV uncertainties. Experimental results from various mixed‐traffic scenarios show that the proposed strategy reduces the average travel time delay by up to 31% compared to an existing optimization‐based approach.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in locomoting robotics have demonstrated how shape morphing can enhance efficiency, mobility, and speed during transitions between domains, such as from land to water. However, prior approaches often optimize a robot's propulsor shape, stiffness, and gait to minimize the cost of transport in distinct domains while neglecting the energy required to achieve these shape and stiffness changes at domain interfaces. Additionally, many shape‐morphing robots rely on thermally driven materials that couple shape and stiffness changes to environmental temperatures, limiting their applicability in real‐world multidomain scenarios. This work introduces the Jamming Amphibious Robotic Turtle (JART), which employs pressure‐responsive, topologically altered kirigami laminar jamming to transform its limbs between hydrodynamic flippers and load‐bearing legs. Energetic analyses reveal that JART achieves a 98.5% reduction in the energetic cost of morphing compared to thermally driven predecessors. Its pressure‐responsive morphing mechanism also enables temperature‐independent energy expenditures when morphing, rapid stiffness switching, decoupled control of stiffness and shape, and robust postloading shape recovery. System‐level evaluations highlight JART's ability to efficiently transition between domains, demonstrated through a continuous terrestrial–aquatic–terrestrial transition at an ocean inlet. This study provides valuable insights into the design of deployable, multidomain robots, advancing their potential for real‐world applications.",

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection aims to identify objects’ 3D positions and poses with low hardware and computation power costs, which is crucial for scenarios like autonomous driving and deep space exploration. While the corresponding research has developed rapidly with the integration of transformer structures, features in 3D are still simply transformed from visual features, resulting in a mismatch between the detection results and the reality. Moreover, most existing methods suffer from the slow convergence speed. To address these issues in monocular 3D object detection, a framework, named geometry‐guided monocular detection with transformer (GG‐Mono), is proposed. It consists of three main components: 1) the mix‐feature encoder module that incorporates pretrained depth estimation models to enhance convergence speed and accuracy; 2) the geometry encoding module that supplements hybrid encoding with global geometry data; 3) the GG decoder module that utilizes geometry queries to guide the decoding process. Extensive experiments show that the model outperforms all existing methods in terms of detection accuracy, and achieves 26.88% and 30.65% in average precision of 3D detection box (AP 3D ) on the validation dataset and test dataset, respectively, which is 1.88% and 1.81% higher than the baseline, and significantly improved the convergence speed (from 184 to 90 epochs).

This article introduces a soft pneumatic pressure regulation system with self‐rhythmic characteristics and simple structure. In this system, the hose generates self‐excited oscillations due to jet force, which realizes the transformation of constant pressure to periodically varying pressure. This mechanism allows soft robots to perform rhythmic movements. A mathematical model is developed to describe the self‐excited oscillations of the jet hose. Numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the impact of various parameters on system oscillations. The system operates under pressures from 90 to 150 kPa. By adjusting the pressure, hose length, and jet hole diameter, the oscillation frequency of the pressure can be tuned between 5.9 and 11.1 Hz. The comparison between simulation results and experimental data verifies the correctness of the mathematical model. Finally, a soft robot capable of crawling based on anisotropic friction is designed and fabricated. Powered solely by the soft pneumatic pressure regulation system, the robot achieves self‐rhythmic crawling. By adjusting the air source pressure, hose length, and jet hole diameter, the robot's crawling speed can be effectively controlled, ranging from 2.5 to 6.8 mm s −1 .",

Unlike traditional impedance control methods, AFH‐IC, which is enhanced with fractional‐order control and an adaptive fuzzy algorithm, is designed to eliminate torque errors in time‐varying stiffness environments. The fractional parameters of the AFH‐IC are optimized using particle swarm optimization for each terrain under different constraints.

    "abstract": "Self‐healing is a promising approach for damage management in high‐load robot applications, such as legged robots. It is becoming a major function in soft robotics; however, its application to support heavyweight is relatively niche. Although previous studies has developed several self‐healing tensile modules for tendon‐driven robots, these modules suffered from deficient healing strength because of the formation of surface oxides. This study proposes a biomimetic approach to enhance self‐healing performance. This approach exploits the motion of the robot to trigger the sloshing of liquid metal, which decomposes surface oxide. The method is validated using a benchtop module test, resulting in a healed strength of over tens of kilograms. Moreover, the module enables the tendon‐driven monopod testbed to perform a squat motion 13 times after a landing impact fracture and self‐healing sequence. The self‐healing module does not break during or after the squatting motion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of active self‐healing behavior using a life‐sized legged robot. Thus, this study provides a novel approach in the field of self‐healing robotics for improving self‐healing, thus contributing to medical robot and mechatronic designs, including rehabilitation, surgical, and diagnostic robots.",

However, they are often deployed and evaluated standalone due to the lack of compatibility with existing simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) software. To investigate the benefits of the NN‐based compact models, the proposed framework is integrated into commercial SPICE tool, and NN models’ speed is compared with the existing in‐built and Verilog‐A industry standard implementations. Additionally, the speed‐up of NN‐based compact models provided by GPU acceleration is demonstrated for variability analysis, and design technology co‐optimization with genetic algorithm is explored. For the best trade‐off between NN simulation speed and accuracy, the proposed dual‐NN structure employs a parameter generator network, representing devices with different transistor geometry, to generate weights for a current/charge prediction network (CPN). In addition to drain voltage and gate voltage , CPN also incorporates environment temperature and achieves 0.797% error with higher than 0.995 scores for DC characteristics. Moreover, it maintains the speed within SPICE, outperforming Verilog‐A Berkeley short‐channel insulated gate field‐effect transistor model (BSIM), and can simulate up to 18.8 million DC points per second with GPU acceleration.",

    "abstract": "Biological organisms excel in dynamically reshaping their bodies to navigate and manipulate ever‐changing environments, and some can even tune their mechanical properties for enhanced adaptability. Many existing shape‐morphing robots rely on the inherent softness of materials or structures, which sacrifices load‐bearing capacity. Despite efforts to achieve both morphing and stiffness tuning in one system, these strategies often rely on separate mechanisms, such as heating liquid metal components to reduce rigidity before employing other mechanisms to change the shape, leading to bulky and complex systems that limit practicality and scalability. Here, a tunable‐stiffness architected morphing structure (TSAMS) is introduced, which unifies shape morphing and tunable stiffness in a single, compact platform. By combining 3D‐printed tessellated particles with shape memory alloy springs, TSAMS transitions smoothly from soft to rigid states, exhibiting a ≈308 times increase in bending stiffness while concurrently executing intricate shape transformations through electrothermal actuation. This design is demonstrated with the following robotic applications, including rolling robots that can explore diverse terrains by climbing slopes, avoiding obstacles, and carrying loads; compact manipulators that lift objects nearly 50 times heavier than themselves; and snake‐inspired robots performing undulation and sidewinding gaits. These results highlight TSAMS's potential to advance next‐generation soft robots and bioinspired systems that demand both dynamic shape reconfiguration and robust structural performance in diverse operating conditions.",

    "abstract": "Collecting detailed information from trees via hovering with an aerial robot is both energetically inefficient and often infeasible in dense forest canopies. Perching on trees offers a promising solution by enabling prolonged observations with reduced energy consumption. To overcome perching location limitations, in this article, a bird‐inspired passive perching mechanism specifically optimized for vertical tree trunks is proposed. Similar to the tail action of treecreepers ( Certhiidae family) when perching on vertical tree trunks, the proposed aerial robotic platform perches on tree surfaces using a main clawed gripping mechanism combined with a supporting “tail” mechanism featuring arrays of embedded microspines. To cope with the complex curvature of tree trunks, adaptive elastic joints that allow the mechanism to passively contact the tree's surface are introduced. By incorporating the region of attraction for the mechanism, the aerial platform is designed to be more reliable during perching maneuvers by adjusting angular movement, thereby defining suitable initial velocities and accelerations for achieving stable equilibrium. The proposed system is validated in a motion capture environment using vertical trunks with diameters ranging from 40 to 220 mm, and further demonstrates in outdoor perching tests. Results confirm the feasibility of dynamic perching on vertical tree trunks under realistic forest conditions.",

However, locomotion at small scales presents numerous counterintuitive behaviors, primarily governed by the interactions between the microrobot's body and its surrounding boundaries. In this study, the locomotion of surface‐rolling microrobots is investigated in 3D, particularly focusing on their ability to climb walls. Through a combination of experiments and computational fluid dynamics analyzes, it is demonstrated that the influence of gravity plays a secondary role in enabling surface‐rolling microrobots to climb walls. Instead, locomotion capability in 3D settings is primarily determined by interactions with surrounding boundaries. The fundamental principles of surface‐rolling locomotion in 3D spaces is elucidated and a design strategy aimed at optimizing fluid flow for efficient propulsion in future applications is proposed.",

To address these challenges, this article proposes a self‐organized multitarget pursuit approach based on hierarchical probabilistic graphical models (PGM) for multi‐UAV systems. Specifically, a scalable hierarchical PGM structure is designed to facilitate a direct mapping from environmental perception to action decision‐making for individual UAVs. To estimate the probability distribution parameters of the designed PGM's nodes, a density‐driven probability parameter estimation method that relies on local perceptual information is proposed, which employs smoothed particle hydrodynamics for local density estimation. A series of simulations and real‐world experiments validates the scalability, adaptability, and robustness of the proposed approach in dynamic, obstacle‐cluttered environments.",

This method models the physical process as a constraint in the training work, starting with theoretical calculations of the radiation field matrix to predict scattering coefficients, which reduces data requirements and enhances robustness. The simulation results demonstrate its superior image quality and noise resistance compared to traditional algorithms, especially under low sampling rates, which provides a strong foundation for practical implementations of TCAI.",

Physical reservoir computing (PRC) offers an alternative by leveraging the intrinsic dynamics of physical systems while restricting training to the readout layer. However, two significant shortcomings hinder the PRC's efficacy: the memory‐nonlinearity trade‐off, where increasing nonlinearity reduces memory capacity, and limited timescale adaptability, constraining it to contrived task‐device matching. This work presents a biomolecular PRC system that integrates heterogeneous nodes with complementary memimpedance properties using droplet interface bilayers. The system combines ion channel‐based memristive (nonlinear, fast‐switching) and biomembrane‐based memcapacitive (linear, slow‐switching) nodes within a single device, addressing the trade‐off and enabling multiscale temporal processing. Predicting a second‐order nonlinear system is demonstrated to address the trade‐off, achieving a normalized mean square error of 0.176 with the hybrid system outperforming memristive and memcapacitive reservoirs. Additionally, two real‐time classification tasks validate the system's ability to process signals across temporal scales, achieving 100% accuracy in both tasks. This approach expands PRC's applicability across diverse tasks without preoptimization, underscoring the potential of PRC and soft biomolecular materials for adaptive energy‐efficient computing.",

However, the use of a thick electrolyte layer (&gt;40 nm) in conventional ECRAMs leads to an unavoidable tradeoff between synaptic weight updates and operating speed. To address this problem, a Cu‐based ultrathin ECRAM (UT‐ECRAM) that uses a single 5 nm HfO x active layer and a ≈1.2 nm AlO x liner is designed. The highly efficient gate‐tunable fast Cu‐ion transport in the AlO x /HfO x UT‐ECRAM enables 1) near‐ideal linearity in weight updates (0.45) even achieved with a pulse width ( t w ) of 50 μs, 2) dynamic multilevel retention of 10 4 s, and 3) reliable cycling endurance of 10 4 cycles. A numerical analysis based on device scaling quantitatively reveals that a relatively high concentration of field‐driven Cu ions (≈10 20 cm −3 ) contributes to each synaptic weight update per gate voltage ( V G ) pulse in the UT‐ECRAM without becoming deactivated by traversing thicker layers. This improved gate sensitivity can ultimately overcome the linearity and the ratio/speed tradeoff relationships, paving the way for robust neuromorphic synaptic units.",

Although emerging nonvolatile memories exhibit promising potential as synaptic devices, their widespread application in training accelerators is limited due to their low endurance and immature fabrication technology.

Moreover, a piece of cloth is utilized for four automatic calibration trials, resulting in a mean absolute error (MAE) of calibration accuracy at 3.79 ± 0.64 mm. The dynamic registration accuracy is also assessed by varying the deformation of the target, yielding an MAE of 6.03 ± 0.96 mm.

    "abstract": "Personalized ultra‐fractionated stereotactic adaptive is an innovative radiation treatment paradigm. To fully harness its benefits, transitioning decision‐making and plan adaptation from empirical judgment to a data‐driven approach is essential. This study presents a novel compressed sensing (CS)‐based feature selection method, offering distinct advantages over conventional approaches such as the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso). Two feature selection models are developed—binary and Gaussian random projections—and applied them to a brain metastasis dataset. Using the top five features identified, support vector machine models are trained to classify whether lesions achieved ≥20% volume reduction at a 3‐month follow‐up. Integrating residual error with frequency‐based selection further enhances performance over weight coefficient‐based criteria. For 5‐feature sets, the CS‐Binary model outperforms Lasso across multiple metrics: AUC (0.937 vs 0.890), balanced accuracy (87.3% vs 83.0%), F1 score (79.4% vs 75.9%), Kappa coefficient (75.8% vs 69.0%), and Matthews correlation coefficient (78.0% vs 72.1%). The CS‐based framework shows great potential in streamlining feature selection and improving predictive accuracy, particularly beneficial in two scenarios: 1) early phase clinical trials with small datasets where traditional radiomics methods are prone to overfitting; and 2) emphasizing the selection of the most prognostically relevant features to help improve interpretability.",

However, predicting BG trends under long‐term prediction horizons is challenging due to the dynamic complexity of glucose changes.

This model incorporates a trustworthy uncertainty‐estimation approach to reduce output variance, further improving predictive accuracy. Additionally, an open‐source benchmark is established using four public datasets and five evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess model performance. This model shows significant improvements in both short‐term (15–30 min) and long‐term (45–60 min) BG predictions. In the 60 min task, it achieves root mean square error values of 10.86, 15.33, 20.46, and 13.74 mg dL −1 across four datasets, representing a 20%–39.4% improvement over previous methods.

    "abstract": "Multiagent technology is a popular research direction and has been widely applied in many fields. When applied to antimissile systems, it primarily involves issues such as multiagent cooperation and competition, and resource allocation. These existing studies typically focus on the collaboration and confrontation strategies of multiagents when dealing with adversarial targets that have strong countermeasure capabilities or a higher level of intelligence. However, if the attackers use low‐performance, low‐cost, but numerous nonintelligent agents to launch area coverage attacks, traditional multiagent strategies may not provide the best defensive effects. Therefore, this article proposes a multiagent cooperative defense strategy based on the balance of resource allocation and defense efficiency. The strategy design is approached by considering three key dimensions: time, resources, and paths. This approach is structured within a hierarchical framework. The high‐level decision‐making layer focuses on formulating the overall strategy and managing macro resource allocation. The middle‐level coordination layer leverages the PPO algorithm to optimize the deployment of defenders and the allocation of resources. Meanwhile, the low‐level execution layer is tasked with carrying out interception missions and planning the necessary paths. By ensuring close collaboration between these layers, the framework guarantees an efficient defense mechanism.",

Incorporating low‐melting‐point alloy Field's metal (FM) particles into the LCE matrix both enhances actuation stress and introduces tunable stiffness. At low FM concentrations (≤10 vol%), actuation stress increases fivefold due to mechanically enhanced network entropy. At higher concentrations (≈30 vol%), the composite exhibits variable stiffness, behaving metal‐like when below the FM's melting point and softening once the FM melts. These formulations not only enhance actuator performance in terms of stress and strain but also mimic muscle‐like rheological behavior, advancing LCEs toward practical artificial muscle applications.",

A deep bidirectional fusion network is developed, DBF‐Net, achieving efficient yet accurate 6D object pose estimation. Specifically, a sparse linear Transformer (SLT) with linear computation complexity is introduced to effectively leverage cross‐modal semantic resemblance during the feature extraction stage, such that it fully models semantic associations between various modalities and efficiently aggregates the globally enhanced features of each modality. Once acquiring two feature representations from two modalities, a feature balancer (FB) based on SLT is proposed to adaptively reconcile the importance of these feature representations. Leveraging the global receptive field of SLT, FB effectively eliminates the ambiguity induced by visual similarity in appearance representation or depth missing of reflective surfaces in geometry representations, thereby enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the network.

Current compound–protein interaction prediction models rely on complex features to enhance capabilities, but this often incurs substantial computational burdens. Indeed, this challenge arises from the limited understanding of data imbalance between proteins and compounds, leading to insufficient optimization of protein encoders. To address this issue, a sequence‐based predictor named FilmCPI is introduced, which leverages data imbalance by learning proteins with their numerous corresponding compounds. This approach enables the characteristics of each protein to be effectively represented through itself and its relationship with corresponding compounds. Without increasing parameters, FilmCPI consistently outperforms baseline models across diverse datasets and split strategies, and its generalization to unseen proteins becomes more pronounced as the datasets expand. Notably, FilmCPI can be effectively transferred to unseen membrane protein families with sequence‐based data from other families. The optimization dynamics is further analyzed and it is discovered that the effectiveness of FilmCPI is attributed to different optimization speeds for diverse encoders.

    "abstract": "As automation expands across industries, robotics is becoming increasingly essential. However, the sector's growth raises concerns about sustainability, making crucial the integration of sustainable materials into robots. Many robotic systems rely on moving components, such as arms, touch sensors, and grippers, that frequently interact with humans or objects, making them highly susceptible to wear and tear. A promising strategy to address this challenge is designing easily replaceable parts made from green, recyclable materials using low‐energy fabrication methods. This approach not only reduces waste generation but also enhances the functionality and durability of these critical components. In this work, electrically conductive biocomposite coatings that functionalize a commercial foam are presented, enabling its use as a robotic gripper or as a touch sensor based on piezoresistive or piezocapacitive feedback mechanism, respectively. The conductive coatings are composed of polybutylene adipate terephthalate biodegradable polymer binder and carbon fillers, achieving sheet resistance in the order of kΩ sq −1 , and are chemically recyclable. The coated foams have stable performance, exhibiting low hysteresis piezoresistive and piezocapacitive responses over 100 deformation cycles, making them a viable solution as robotic grippers and touch sensors. Using sustainable and recyclable materials, the approach supports environmentally friendly practices in robotics and sensing applications.",

The proliferation of AI technologies frequently presents ophthalmologists with the dilemma of selecting the most suitable approach tailored to their research aims and data types, while computer experts may struggle to understand how these methodologies can be effectively applied to achieve objectives in improving eye health. This review offers valuable insights and guidance to both ophthalmologists and computer experts to bridge this gap and promote collaborative synergy between these two distinct domains. The analysis entails the structural characteristics, specific use cases, clinical objectives, and evaluation metrics of these methods. Additionally, emerging paradigms such as semi‐supervised learning, attention mechanisms, federated learning, reinforcement learning, and large language models are introduced. These paradigms enhance model performance, ensure patient data security, and facilitate personalized treatment strategies and resource optimization in complex ophthalmic tasks.",

The feasibility of the suggested IGZO DRAM TCAM for accelerating Hamming distance calculation is further examined through simulations of two distance‐based algorithms, which are few‐shot learning and k‐nearest neighbor search. The accuracy of the algorithm exhibits limited tolerance to device variations, with deterioration for standard deviation surpassing 10%.

Furthermore, an enhanced actor‐critic algorithm called offline sample correction actor‐critic (OSCAC) to learn the formation control policy is proposed.

Specifically, OSCAC adjusts the importance weights of the samples based on the discrepancies between the current policy and previous policies during each update step, making better use of past experience and improving the learning performance.

    "abstract": "Cholesterol plays a critical role in physiological functions, but elevated levels increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Regular cholesterol monitoring is essential for elderly or obese individuals. Current methods, such as blood tests, are invasive, inconvenient, and require a professional operator. In contrast, tears, as an accessible body fluid, offer a promising alternative for noninvasive monitoring due to their correlation with blood cholesterol levels. Herein, a noninvasive approach for monitoring cholesterol levels in tears using a biosensor integrated into a smart contact lens is reported. The biosensor employs cholesterol oxidases as the biocatalyst, coupled with an osmium‐based mediator, to detect cholesterol concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 1.2 mM in artificial tears. A key challenge is the extremely low cholesterol concentration in tears, which is addressed using a parity‐time (P‐T) symmetry‐based magnetic resonance coupling system. This system enables wireless signal reading and achieves high sensitivity due to its high‐quality (Q) factor, which can achieve a detection limit of 0.061 mM. This portable, high‐sensitivity smart contact lens demonstrates significant potential as a wearable device for continuous, noninvasive cholesterol monitoring. The findings contribute to advancing tear‐based diagnostic systems and highlight the scientific importance of utilizing tear biomarkers for health monitoring.",

However, rapid uncontrolled division and off‐target distribution of bacteria hinder their therapeutic use. To enhance the bacteria's targeting ability, bacteria are modified with magnetic materials that respond to external control signals. Nonetheless, this approach still tackles the rapid division of bacteria, their slow locomotion speed, and the control of their localization. Therefore, it is proposed to confine bacteria within a more extensive hydrogel‐based platform that can be controlled with external stimuli. Specifically, a millimeter‐scale magnetic soft robot incorporating probiotic bacteria is reported, which allows for the rapid, concentrated, and targeted delivery of living therapeutics with external alternating magnetic fields. In addition to remaining viable and multiplying within the hydrogel network, the bacteria escape from the robot after one hour and successfully disrupt colorectal tumor spheroids in vitro. Moreover, this robot demonstrates mobility across rough terrain made up of multiple materials and can target a polyp inside a phantom of the colon. Overall, this magnetic soft robotic platform provides a new strategy for a potential targeted cancer treatment based on the concentrated delivery of tens of millions of bacteria.",

Traditional deep learning models often extract redundant features that hinder segmentation accuracy. To address this limitation, a novel machine‐learning framework is proposed that combines an Extended Exploration Particle Swarm Optimization (EE‐PSO) algorithm with a modified DeepLabV3+ architecture to enhance feature selection and improve segmentation performance in medical imaging tasks. The two main contributions are 1) a structurally optimized DeepLabV3+ model that uses dynamic EE‐PSO‐driven channels instead of standard convolutional layers to adaptively prioritize important features during training, and 2) an improved PSO algorithm that incorporates particle reinitialization and adaptive inertia weight adjustment to reduce premature convergence and enhance global search capabilities. The atrous spatial pyramid pooling module has the EE‐PSO component strategically incorporated inside it, allowing for the synergistic integration of multi‐scale contextual information with optimal feature maps. The system demonstrates improvements in mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 2.7% and 2.8% when tested on Alzheimer's and brain tumor datasets.

Current particle robots rely entirely on electronic communication systems, requiring a sensor to receive signals, a transducer to send signals, a processor to process them, and a battery to power the system. In this work, an alternative, electronics‐free communication strategy for particle robots is introduced via physical contact between their architected tentacles. Instead of relying on a central controller, the communication protocols are embodied in the geometrical outlines of these tentacles and can be further tuned with external vibrations. Separated particles can interlock under external pressure to form stable clusters resembling “solids,” or vaporize into “gas” by spontaneously repelling one another. Surrogate simulation tools have been developed to guide the design of these robots, enabling the inverse design of particle geometries for programmable interlocking and repulsion. Based on these basic communication schemes, particle robots can achieve a range of functionalities through collective behavior, including fast, sequential, and hierarchical deployment, locomotion, and coordinated group navigation. Finally, this contact‐based communication concept is extended to particles with different shapes, hybrid particle interactions, 3D particles, and microscale particle robots.",

Inspired by the substantial progress of neural networks in 2D natural images, current methods often adapt 2D networks to 3D for these tasks, resulting in massive network parameters. However, the limited training data available for lung nodule CT scans (≈2 k) compared to natural images (&gt;10 b) lead to overfitting and reduced performance. This study proposes a lightweight architecture for lung nodule detection and segmentation, alleviating the overfitting caused by the data scarcity. To reduce the parameters of the backbone network, the deformable Transformer is introduced to retain large receptive fields for desired performance with a small model size. To eliminate extensive anchor‐related parameters, this study employs the anchor‐free structure for the detection task, which also aligns the common features with the segmentation task. Benefiting from this, a higher level of parameter sharing becomes possible between two tasks, further reducing the entire model size and imposing a strong regularizer to alleviate the overfitting. The proposed method is validated on the LUNA16 and LIDC‐IDRI datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art methods with a small model size.

The control framework uses quadratic programming to integrate rich tactile and proximity feedback from the skin network. To maintain real‐time performance with this dense sensory data, the method clusters sensor activations into active regions. This enables the robot to generate whole‐body compliance, regulate interaction forces across various body parts, and transform proximity feedback into distance constraints to dynamically avoid collisions in unmodeled environments. This approach's effectiveness and real‐time feasibility through experiments on a humanoid robot performing tasks such as transporting bulky objects, directly controlling interaction forces, and avoiding dynamic obstacles are demonstrated.",

The proposed MRI to Desktop 3D printing approach contrasts with the state of the art, where high biomimicry is achieved through a multistage assembly process and expensive 3D printing setups. The resulting hand shows several unique behaviors of natural hands, including an opposable thumb moving across the palm, improved resistance at bone–joint interfaces, high life cycle, constrained bending, absorption of perpendicular loads, high range of coordinated, bioinspired motion, and grasping capabilities. The proposed approach can be potentially used to 3D print prosthetic hands tailored to individual needs, leveraging patient‐specific digitally created MRI data.",

This article focuses on guidewire tip tracking tasks during image‐guided therapy for cardiovascular diseases, aiding physicians in improving diagnostic and therapeutic quality. A novel tracking framework based on a Siamese network with dual attention mechanisms combines self‐ and cross‐attention strategies for robust guidewire tip tracking. This design handles visual ambiguities, tissue deformations, and imaging artifacts through enhanced spatial‐temporal feature learning. Validation occurs on three randomly selected clinical digital subtraction angiography sequences from a dataset of 15 sequences, covering multiple interventional scenarios. The results indicate a mean localization error of 0.421 ± 0.138 mm, with a maximum error of 1.736 mm, and a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.782. The framework maintains an average processing speed of 57.2 frames per second, meeting the temporal demands of endovascular imaging. Further validations with robotic platforms for automating diagnostics and therapies in clinical routines yield tracking errors of 0.708 ± 0.695 and 0.148 ± 0.057 mm in two distinct experimental scenarios.",

Despite being highly impaired in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), it is rarely assisted by wearable robots, likely due to the challenging anchoring to the body and the risk of hindering hand capabilities. Here, a lightweight (30 g) soft wearable robot is introduced to assist pronosupination, employing a pneumatic fabric‐based actuator that twists around the forearm, without impeding hand movements. It is mechanically transparent when unpowered but generates up to 122 N of force when inflated at low pressure (70 kPa). The device is tested on 10 SCI individuals, showing significant improvements in range of motion and reduced muscular effort. Additionally, participants engage in a target‐hitting exergame, achieving higher scores and enhanced performance when assisted.

Soft machines designed with origami or kirigami, the ancient paper art of folding or cutting, have been shown to perform remarkably in severe geometric conditions or situations through shape morphing. However, conventional origami‐ or kirigami‐inspired machines rely on a single, monotonous morphing pathway, thereby limiting their achievable functions. Recent designs integrate both origami and kirigami to enable multimorphing; however, they frequently require numerous actuators or inputs, increasing system complexity. Here, a highly deformable “ori‐kirigami” robotic structure is presented by operating both folds and cuts on a 2D tessellated sheet, possessing multiple morphing pathways and tunable mechanical properties. The geometry and mechanics of the ori‐kirigami structure are analyzed using theoretical modeling and experiments with paper prototypes. Exploiting these merits, a multimodal soft robot capable of steering into confined gaps and manipulating obstacles encountered in its path is designed and demonstrated. This work can be used to design morphing machines that need to adapt to intricate environments, such as the human body and a disaster area.",

However, in more practical scenarios like partially observable household scenes, the clutter and uncertainty of object placements, coupled with the often nonspecific goal states provided by human users, pose significant challenges. Conventional TAMP planners struggle to efficiently navigate these spaces based on nonspecific goals and also find it difficult to manage environments cluttered with irrelevant objects. To address these difficulties, this article introduces a TAMP framework based on a broadly used TAMP planner PDDLStream, requiring only nonspecific goal states to complete tasks. This framework employs Task‐level Backward Search to identify relevant objects for task completion, thus balancing autonomous exploration with the use of known information. Additionally, it uses an Object Manipulation Constraint Graph to generate a safe, collision‐free sequence for handling cluttered objects.

However, significant mental burdens and unfamiliarity with instruments can lead to various human errors. Consequently, the research community has explored robotic prototypes. Unfortunately, these prototypes often focus on specific instrument‐handling tasks or offer non‐intuitive interaction methods, hindering social acceptance. This article proposes a surgeon‐friendly robotic scrub nurse platform that addresses multiple instrument‐related tasks, including grasping and transferring, automatic sorting, and counting. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first prototype to incorporate audiovisual input modalities and a large language model (LLM) for smooth and intuitive interaction between the surgeon and the robot. Specifically, vision artificial intelligence (AI) provides accurate instrument detection results using oriented bounding boxes with an average precision of 97.6%, guiding robot motion planning. The speech AI recognizes the surgeon's voice commands. The LLM further interprets multimodal information to trigger different robot actions via the “tool use” capability, achieving a standalone success rate of 94% with an average action latency of less than 1 s on a real robotic scrub nurse hardware platform. Physical validation demonstrated that the proposed prototype successfully completed all assigned tasks, proving its feasibility and effectiveness.",

With theoretical analysis and tests on two large battery datasets, the superiority of 2D image representation compared with traditional 1D representation in principal component analysis method and different models is illustrated. Moreover, a 2D ResNet model is also trained to explore the full potential of deep learning in battery cycle modeling, allowing it to learn directly from raw cycling images.

Consequently, bio‐inspired algorithms have led to several impactful applications in heart‐related ailments, demonstrating significant effectiveness in this domain. The Harris’ Hawks Optimization (HHO) is a recent metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the cooperative behavior of the hawks. This article presents, for the first time, the Multi‐Objective hybrid Harris Hawks Optimization (MO‐hHHO) algorithm, a novel enhancement of the HHO. Designed to address complex multiobjective problems (MOPs), MO‐hHHO focuses on feature selection minimization and classifier hyperparameter optimization, achieving improved predictive accuracy. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, four different machine learning classifiers are used: random forest (RF), K‐nearest neighbors, logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM). Extensive experiments are carried out using heart disease dataset obtained from the Kaggle repository. The experimental results on both single‐objective problems and MOPs reveal that the MO‐hHHO effectively reduces the number of features while optimizing classifier hyperparameters, achieving superior classification accuracy, particularly for RF, LR, and SVM. Additionally, hybrid HHOs adaptive exploration and exploitation mechanisms ensure efficient convergence toward optimal solutions, making it well‐suited for high‐dimensional and complex optimization tasks.",

Traditionally, studies have focused on single‐domain datasets. These approaches overlook the potential insights gained from integrating data across different domains. This research addresses this gap using a cross‐domain dataset that includes building characteristics, energy usage, and environmental factors. Feature selection techniques, including filter methods (correlation, mutual information), wrapper methods (RFE), embedded methods (Lasso, Random Forest, and gradient boosting), and dimensionality reduction are used to identify the most significant features contributing to the energy efficiency of residential properties. These techniques identify the most significant features influencing energy consumption. The findings show that cross‐domain features like energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, and heating cost play a key role in predicting energy performance. By integrating data from multiple domains, the feature selection process reveals areas for energy optimization that are previously overlooked in single‐domain studies. The results provide valuable insights for energy consultants, building managers, and policymakers aiming to enhance energy efficiency in residential buildings. This research highlights the importance of cross‐domain data integration and offers a robust framework for feature selection.

Regulating the actuation frequency between 30 and 40 Hz established reversible transitions between particle trapping and release states. At 40 Hz, stable trapping zones are created due to amplified shear gradients and vortex structures, while at 30 Hz, reduced circulation allowed controlled particle release. A trapping efficiency exceeding 83.3% is observed, along with a mixing efficiency of 79.8% achieved under 40 Hz actuation, demonstrating effective particle confinement and substantial flow manipulation performance.

Reservoir computing (RC), an energy‐efficient computing paradigm that leverages fixed weights and trains only the output layer, has emerged as a promising solution. Physical reservoir computing (PRC), which implements RC in hardware, enables real‐time and large‐scale data processing but faces challenges, such as process variability, material degradation, and limited complementary metal‐oxide‐semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility. This study introduces a novel PRC device based on an electrochemical field‐effect transistor (EcFET) with an indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) channel. The EcFET controls oxygen vacancies, which act as n‐type dopants, by injecting and extracting oxygen ions through electrochemical redox reactions in the channel. By applying an electric field to the gate electrode, the threshold voltage of the channel is controlled, enabling conductance modulation. With its low ion diffusivity, the IGZO channel provides short‐term memory characteristics and excellent performance. The proposed device exhibits a time constant of ≈300 ms, durability over ≈10 4 cycles, cell variability below 10%, and test accuracy of 94.29%. These findings demonstrate the potential of IGZO‐based EcFETs for next‐generation energy‐efficient PRC.",

Minimizing distortion restores the intended flexion moment arms at the finger joints, ensuring target functionality. User‐preferred stretchability minimizes constraints on the user's finger flexion, improving wearability. To satisfy these conflicting goals, the finger body as a longitudinally periodic structure and develop a corresponding unit cell‐level optimization is developed. Specifically, finger body‐level evaluations are converted into equivalent unit cell‐level analyses. A novel metric, distortional compliance—defined as a weighted sum of unit cell‐level compliances—is introduced as the optimization objective. To account for large deformation effects, a two‐step optimization approach is employed: topology optimization under a linear elastic assumption, followed by size optimization considering material and geometric nonlinearities. Experimental validation considers three users with different hand sizes. Results show that the optimized designs reduce distortion by 54.9% on average compared to the previous version, while achieving target stretchability within a 4.43% error. The optimized EGP II exhibits minimal distortion, increased grasping force (15.3% on average), and user‐preferred wearability, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

A method to adjust the aperture based on the electrowetting effect is proposed, which dispenses with any mechanical moving components, enabling fast adjustment, compact structure, and low power consumption. The liquid aperture can be flexibly adjusted to a roughly circular shape with a variable diameter between 0 and 5.07 mm or a horizontal or vertical elongated shape with a maximum aspect ratio of 9.5. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of achieving both large FOV and adaptive imaging, including light intensity adaptability and transmittable information frequency adaptability. Therefore, the proposed ACE imaging device can operate under different lighting conditions and can be used to distinguish between target and background images. Its distributed control capability also ensures that it can adapt to locally changing imaging scenes. The proposed ACE imaging device is expected to be applied in many fields such as machine vision, detection, and measurement.",

Robots can collect this data, by placing sensors with uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), perching UAVs, or climbing robots. All require adhesion to substrates with varying roughnesses, from tree bark to concrete and glass. Unfortunately, common adhesion methods are specialized for specific substrates, don't generalize to different surfaces, or leave behind harmful residue. This work presents the novel use of gelatin‐based hydrogels as biodegradable and water‐soluble adhesives for reversible adhesion to different surfaces for robotic environmental monitoring. The hydrogel adheres through heating, attaching, and cooling. The hydrogel is released by heating again, and any residue can be washed away with water. To correctly dimension the adhesive, factors affecting the maximum pull‐off force are experimentally characterized. The versatility of the adhesive is shown through adhesion to different surfaces. Only 0.1 g is shown to support at least 20 N. Finally, the adhesion method is validated on three robotic monitoring applications: sensor placement, UAV perching, and a climbing robot. These tests demonstrate the utility of biodegradable gelatin hydrogels as adhesives for robotic monitoring applications in natural and industrial settings.",

Herein, the memristor‐based compact chaotic circuit incorporated in a computing architecture is presented, able to process information through time. A memristive hardware version of the formally simplest chaotic circuit has been realized, which, thanks to the nonlinearity of the nonvolatile memristor device, exhibits complex dynamics in response to a driving signal.

    "abstract": "Existing transformer‐based image captioning methods face two primary limitations: first, they struggle to adequately represent visual features from multiple regions during the encoding phase, and second, the decoder fails to effectively utilize future semantic information during the inference phase. To address these challenges, an attention‐enhanced image captioning model is proposed. During the encoding phase, multigranular visual features are integrated by combining cross‐attention and self‐attention mechanisms, fully utilizing both grid and regional features. Additionally, a novel dense global self‐attention module is introduced to enhance model performance with minimal computational cost by fully leveraging the contextual information and fine‐grained details of the image. This model is particularly well‐suited for biomimetic wearable devices, where real‐time visual assistance plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience. In the decoding phase, a bidirectional decoding structure with an adaptive masking module is designed to dynamically adjust the focus on past and future semantic information, enabling the model to combine historical and future context effectively for generating more accurate and relevant descriptions. Experimental results on the MSCOCO dataset show that the model outperforms the baseline, achieving a 2.1 percentage point improvement in the CIDEr metric. Comprehensive hardware evaluations on the wearable platform demonstrate real‐time efficiency with minimal memory footprint, significantly outperforming state‐of‐the‐art models in edge deployment scenarios.",

    "abstract": "One main challenge faced in modern automotive safety design is the glare caused by strong external light. When glare directly hits the driver's eyes, the extreme brightness distribution in the driver's field of view reduces environmental visibility, causing a decrease in driver judgment and reaction speed, which increases the probability of accidents occurring. To reduce traffic accidents caused by glare in a changing environment, an intelligent holographic antiglare windshield system (IHAWS) based on a holographic optical element (HOE) is proposed. The antiglare HOE (aHOE) in IHAWS attenuates the external strong light directly in the driver's field of view to an acceptable level through diffraction and absorption of incident light, thereby alleviating abnormal brightness distribution caused by glare. The HOE in head‐up display (hHOE) projects driving information such as speed and navigation to the front of the vehicle, thus reducing safety hazards by minimizing driver distraction. The compatibility between these two types of HOEs requires an intelligent scheduling scheme based on binocular camera detection. The IHAWS proposed in this article attenuates the intensity of light directly shining on the driver's eyes, which inspires new solutions to reduce the incidence of accidents caused by glare.",

Autonomous sorting is achieved through the integration of motion control, trajectory planning, and action scheduling. Experimental validation is conducted using a nine‐coil electromagnetic actuation system and a microrobot of 3 mm in size. The system demonstrates an average trajectory‐following precision of 0.1 mm. The proposed magnetic weighing enables the detection and classification of carried silica beads of 0.75–1.00 mm diameter by measuring the increase in effective weight with a resolution of ≈1 μN. During the sorting process, all particles with a diameter larger than 0.9 mm are classified as heavy, and all those with a diameter smaller than 0.85 mm are classified as light, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. Overall, the proposed system holds significant promise for applications in biomedicine and micromanufacturing, driving innovation in autonomous microrobotics.",

High‐resolution global images of the workspace are obtained using an image stitching method that combines phase correlation and template matching. Global path planning is accomplished with the A* algorithm, followed by local path planning utilizes the optimized informed rapidly‐exploring random tree star (OI‐RRT*) algorithm in each FOV to ensure swarm adaptation. The strategy also incorporates an FOV planning algorithm to optimize FOV positioning, along with a displacement platform to ensure smooth transitions between FOVs. A real‐time visual feedback control system monitors both channel width and swarm position. This strategy improves swarm navigation efficiency and stability, as demonstrated through experimental validation, and holds significant potential for targeted drug delivery and other biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "To advance the application of continuum robots in the medical field, this study proposes the integration of compliant bi‐stability in continuum robots to enable the ability to form custom shapes. The process includes designing a compliant bistable mechanism (CBM), deconstructing a ball‐joint‐based continuum robot segment, and then integrating the two. This allows the resultant continuum segment to become bistable. Two versions of this CBM‐integrated continuum segment arose from the design process: an “Extending” version that improves the effective length and reachability of the segments, and a “Locking” version that locks certain regions and enhances stiffness. When used together, these two segment types enable the CBM‐based continuum robot to demonstrate mechanical intelligence by achieving custom shapes in different configurations through passive mechanical design. The paper also presents an analytical model to characterize the CBM. Simulation and experimental results for the segments establish a 50% increase in workspace by using the extending segment. Using the locking segment results in an 80% to 100% increase in stiffness. A shape formation test for a liver biopsy procedure shows a decrease of 61% in the tip‐to‐target deviation, demonstrating a potential application for minimally invasive surgeries.",

This study develops an enhanced Hill's muscle model (EHMM) for tissue‐ engineered skeletal muscle (TESM) to account for mechanical property changes between the static and contracted states. First, the conventional Hill's muscle model (CHMM), a widely used model for native muscle, is applied to TESM. However, parameters determined from the elongation test fail to reproduce the rapid rise and fall of tension observed in isometric contraction tests. To address this, next, a seven‐element EHMM is introduced, incorporating an active viscoelastic branch in parallel with the static branch to represent actin–myosin interactions. In the former branch, both contractile and viscoelastic elements scale with muscle activity, fatigue decay, and length dependence, modeling viscoelastic changes during contraction. Since the viscous element in the active branch has a negligible effect, it is removed to yield a six‐element EHMM. For the reverse‐action tweezer structure driven by TESM, the displacement predicted by the CHMM is greatly overestimated, whereas the six‐element EHMM results closely match the experimental data. The developed model thus provides a physiological description of TESM contraction and a basis for future research on feedback control and advanced biohybrid actuator development.",

A polar robot that utilizes assisted sail and multimode motion to achieve energy‐saving is proposed. The assisted sail is foldable, providing assistance force for the robot in unfolded state and coping with extreme wind speed conditions in folded state. The multimode includes the traction mode with high energy consumption and the sliding mode with low energy consumption, which can be switched through variable‐form tracks. To improve the motion ability in sliding mode, the carve slip steering and plow braking for sleds are borrowed from human skiing.

On this basis, energy‐saving control frameworks and strategies for each mode are proposed, and the effectiveness of energy‐saving is verified through simulation.

Preterm infants often require continuous monitoring and artificial respiratory support due to underdeveloped lungs. Effective respiratory support requires precise synchronization of oxygen delivery with an infant's natural breathing to minimize lung injury, air leaks, or impaired cerebral blood flow. This requires noninvasive systems with intelligent sensors capable of capturing high‐fidelity respiratory signals in real‐time to accurately detect breathing cycles. However, such systems typically involve complex and costly sensor fabrication processes, energy‐intensive designs, and extensive computational demands. This study presents a low‐cost, portable, and real‐time neonatal respiration monitoring system with synchronized oxygen delivery. The skin‐like sensor patch, fabricated through screen‐printing, demonstrated high sensitivity (≈75/με) within 0–20 000 με, rapid response time (≈140 ms), minimal drift (2%) over 7,000 cyclic tests, and negligible thermal variation (&lt;0.5 °C over 8 h). A multistage signal processing algorithm, combined with machine learning‐based classification facilitates accurate real‐time differentiation among normal breathing, tachypnea, and apnea episodes.

Results show that the proposed method significantly outperformed the state‐of‐the‐art methods in terms of root‐mean‐square error (Ninapro DB2: 6.37 ± 0.16 vs. 7.26 ± 0.18, p &lt; 0.01; collected data: 5.64 ± 0.21 vs. 5.08 ± 0.15, p &lt; 0.01) and correlation coefficient (Ninapro DB2: 0.87 ± 0.01 vs. 0.85 ± 0.01, p &lt; 0.01; collected data: 0.92 ± 0.01 vs. 0.88 ± 0.01, p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the proposed model is based on an explainable prediction mechanism wherein the importance of information from the different muscles is quantified by the MHSA.",

However, existing platforms struggle to balance miniaturization, multidegree‐of‐freedom flexibility, and rapid in situ reconfiguration for different tasks. To address these challenges, Grassmann Line‐Guided Magneto‐Operative Robotics is proposed, a systematic design framework that synergizes Grassmann line geometry with modular magnetic spherical joint connections to enable rapid in situ topology changes. A synthesis‐based method is employed to guide the assembly strategy design flow for a specific magneto‐connected parallel robot. The magneto‐coupled modules enable in situ minute‐level (average 48 s) reconfiguration across multiple types of centimeter‐scale magneto‐reconfigurable parallel robots, all sharing a common driving system and featuring a base diameter of 3.2 cm. As a case study, a widely used 3‐P(4S) robot system is fully analyzed. The regular workspace, considering the influence of magnetic connections and the global transmission index, is evaluated to assess the performance of different design parameters. Then, the payload experiment is conducted. Bench‐top positioning, bench‐top manipulation, and laparoscopic manipulation potentials are demonstrated. Overall, the proposed library and design methodology, utilizing magneto‐connected parts, enable the rapid prototyping of reconfigurable, modular parallel robots.",

This study proposes a selective weight update method that accelerates training by reducing pulse generation opportunities for update to a square‐root level by defining gradient importance based on kernel mapping and implementing gradient synchronization in crossbar‐based distributed systems. The approach demonstrates robustness against memory state variations, as well as cycle‐to‐cycle and device‐to‐device variability, while minimizing write disturbance effects.

Commercial multisensory devices (e.g., smell diffusion and haptic technologies) are available, and virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) headsets are increasingly integrated with brain–computer interfaces (BCI). These integrations enable adaptive, personalized virtual immersive experiences that are more engaging, interactive, and effective. As these applications become mainstream, concerns arise regarding the security and privacy of personal information. Recent studies demonstrate that users can be identified with high accuracy using the data monitored from sensors available in VR/AR headsets. This literature survey investigates the types of personal user information that can be inferred from BCI‐instrumented headsets. In particular, it focuses on predicting age, gender, and ethnic/racial background from neurophysiological signals currently monitored by commercial devices. The survey highlights the predictive strength of electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram signal modalities, followed by eye tracking and iris scanning. It also considers future privacy risks posed by biometric and gesture‐based monitoring using non‐contact technologies such as computer vision and WiFi signal analysis. The survey concludes with recommendations for future research aimed at contributing to the development of robust frameworks that safeguard user privacy in the evolving Metaverse landscape.",

Therefore, the ability to autonomously estimate velocity and position based on onboard sensors becomes critical. While vision or radar‐based approaches face limitations for MAVs due to payload constraints, poor lighting, or featureless environments, bio‐inspired airflow sensing offers a promising alternative. Airflow interaction with MAVs provides continuous motion cues during flight, enabling airflow odometry—a feasible yet accuracy‐limited solution. This article presents a novel skin‐like airflow odometry system using distributed flexible thermal anemometers embedded in wingtips, allowing real‐time motion estimation where conventional methods fail. Computational fluid dynamics is first employed to analyze the feasibility and sensitivity without changing their aerodynamic profile. A transformer‐enhanced gated recurrent unit network then extracts high‐precision airflow velocity, while model‐based multisensor fusion reduces dead‐reckoning drift and is validated through experiments. To the authors’ knowledge, this demonstrates the first airflow odometry system with positional accuracy surpassing previous research for MAV applications.",

In‐memory computing (IMC) offers a promising solution by addressing the von Neumann bottleneck inherent in traditional deep learning accelerators, significantly reducing energy consumption. However, the analog nature of IMC introduces hardware nonidealities that degrade model performance and reliability. This article presents a novel approach to directly train physical models of IMC, formulated as ordinary differential equation (ODE)‐based physical neural networks (PNNs). To enable the training of large‐scale networks, a technique called differentiable spike‐time discretization is proposed, which reduces the computational cost of ODE‐based PNNs by up to 20 times in speed and 100 times in memory. Such large‐scale networks enhance learning performance by exploiting hardware nonidealities on the CIFAR‐10 dataset. The proposed bottom‐up methodology is validated through post‐layout SPICE simulations on the IMC circuit with nonideal characteristics using the sky130 process. The proposed PNN approach reduces the discrepancy between model behavior and circuit dynamics by at least an order of magnitude. This work paves the way for leveraging nonideal physical devices, such as nonvolatile resistive memories, for energy‐efficient deep learning applications.",

A proof‐of‐concept demonstration is provided of a bioinspired tonotopic sensor for speech recognition that mimics the human cochlea, using a spiral‐shaped elastic metamaterial.

Here, this study shows a new type of high‐stiffness, low‐density material made entirely from robots of submillimeter dimensions. To bear load, these hundred‐micrometer robots directly grow metal onto their bodies and bond together under the control of on‐device microelectronics. The resulting aggregates achieve some of the lowest densities of any material and toughness/elastic moduli approaching the fundamental limits for metallic foams. Going beyond static properties, this study shows that robots can be used to actively repair the material microstructure, restoring stiffness and toughness following compressive fatigue. Broadly, these results clear the way for a new breed of programmable materials with bulk properties that can be rationally tuned over several orders of magnitude through the actions of robots too small to see with the naked eye.",

However, most current walking assist robots only support flexion–extension of the hip joint and may restrict the unassisted passive movements of other motions. This would cause major problems when used in daily life for such actions as changing direction, recovering from a stumble, and toileting. To solve these issues, the sliding guide system is conceptualized, a very simple and configurable joint mechanism that allows for 3D movement of the hip joint in walking assist robots. As the human femoral head is almost a perfect sphere, the sliding guide system employs two guide plates that contour spherical surfaces projected from the center of the femoral head. The motor unit assisting flexion–extension is configured with these guide plates to passively slide according to the movements of the assist device wearer and enable unobstructed abduction–adduction and external rotation–internal rotation of the hip joint. While systems of various complexities allowing 3D movement are proposed, the sliding guide system concept represents the simplest and most practical approach for implementation in both conventional and future walking assist robot hip joints.",

This work introduces Kolmogorov–Arnold network (KAN) for the transistor—a groundbreaking NN architecture that seamlessly integrates interpretability with high precision in physics‐based function modeling. The performance of KAN and Fourier KAN (FKAN) is systematically evaluated for fin field‐effect transistor (FinFET) compact modeling, benchmarking them against the golden industry‐standard compact model and the widely used multi‐layer perceptron architecture. The results reveal that KAN and FKAN consistently achieve superior prediction accuracy for critical figures of merit, including gate current ( I D ), drain charge ( Q D ), and source charge ( Q S ). Furthermore, the unique ability of KAN to derive symbolic formulas from learned data patterns is demonstrated and improved—a capability that not only enhances interpretability but also facilitates in‐depth transistor analysis and optimization. Additionally, we identify challenges inherent to KAN and FKAN architectures, which limit their ability to achieve a general‐purpose SPICE simulation suitability.",

These mechanical transmission systems and insulin reservoirs occupy more than one‐third of pumps’ volume, significantly limiting miniaturization and making pumps cumbersome for daily use. Herein, a compact, magnetically actuated insulin pump is developed that is less than one‐quarter the size of piston‐based pumps. Instead of bulky mechanical components, the pump uses a magnetic soft actuator to directly compress the insulin chamber, controlled by a precisely tuned electromagnetic field. This innovative design eliminates the need for large transmission systems, enabling a notably smaller form factor. In addition, the fine‐tunable magnetic actuation enables a 0.01 μL delivery resolution, significantly surpassing the 0.25 μL resolution of piston‐based pumps. This high‐resolution mechanism facilitates further miniaturization by allowing the use of high‐concentration insulins, thereby reducing the reservoir size. By varying the magnetic field's waveform, amplitude, and duration, the pump's performance can be further enhanced. The reported magnetic insulin pump exhibits superior repeatability and accuracy across single‐pulse, basal, and bolus modes compared to commercial insulin pumps. This miniaturized, high‐resolution magnetic insulin pump is anticipated to substantially benefit people with diabetes by improving portability, precision, and cost efficiency.",

First, etch depth is initially obtained through ellipsometry mapping and used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) based on process parameters (e.g., plasma power, pressure, and gas flow), achieving significantly lower mean squared error (MSE) than a linear baseline. This is extended with a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to capture uncertainty in the predictions. Second, it is demonstrated that red, green, and blue data from DIC alone can effectively predict etch depth without relying on process parameters. Together, these findings establish ML‐DIC integration as a real‐time, low‐cost, and noninvasive alternative for plasma process monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Soft and continuum robots commonly rely on fluid, tendon, or rod‐based power transmissions, to control robotic form and actuation. Architected geometry has enhanced robot control through tailored physical and mechanical properties based on topology. For example, twist‐actuated metamaterials, such as handed shearing auxetics (HSAs), have expanded the soft robot design space, offering varied shape changes and direct integration with simple motors. Despite these advancements, current options for torque transmission limit the successful integration of HSAs in tubular robots, especially for constructions requiring maximized interior space for passing devices or additional concentric tubes. An architected structure based on patterned straight‐line mechanisms is proposed that enables simultaneous bending, extending, and torsionally rigid (BETR) transmission. Pairing these new torque‐transmitting materials with twist‐driven materials HSAs creates new modalities for the varied actuation of tubular robots. Parameter trade offs in BETRs are analyzed, and a user operated robot is built that demonstrates feasibility for navigation, positioning, and anchoring in scaled 3D‐printed anatomies.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a minimally invasive robotic probe inspired by plant root growth, designed for subsoil exploration and future ecosystem monitoring and intervention. The bio‐inspired probe advances in soil by mimicking plant root apical growth, creating and consolidating a borehole through the injection of a bio‐based, biodegradable binder at its tip. This innovative process confines penetration resistance to the tip while generating a hollow tubular structure by harnessing in situ local soil. The probe's penetration is facilitated by a linear actuator, which can be retracted upon reaching a desired depth, thereby minimizing the environmental dispersion of mechatronic components. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of subsoil exploration (whether on‐Earth or in outer space) by reducing penetration force requirements and reliance on exogenous material but also ensures environmental sustainability by employing biodegradable materials and lowering mechanical footprints. The robotic probe's design and functionality highlight the potential of bio‐inspired technologies to address complex environmental challenges, paving the way for future innovations in ecological research and conservation efforts. This study underscores the importance of integrating biological principles into engineering solutions to develop tools that are both effective and environmentally responsible.",

Shape‐memory alloy (SMA) is a common actuation material but needs to be designed into specific shapes to disperse local strains. In this article, a dedicated configuration of SMA strips is introduced for soft robotic body joint manipulation and morphing. Inspired by the Möbius strip, the proposed SMA torsion strip (STS) can meet the requirements of both large deformation and large force output desirable for robotic applications. Compared to conventional morphing methods, the STSs can supply considerable torque output over a wide range of bending angles to freely chosen body joints. Therefore, both pattern‐to‐pattern extreme shape morphing, such as tendrils curling, and programmable shape morphing can be achieved. A mathematical model is established to describe how geometry and temperature affect the STS properties to optimize performance. Due to the extensibility of the STS, it can be used for a large variety of robotic applications that are partially illustrated in this research as artificial muscles, grippers, jumping robots, and soft proportional valves.",

Although retrograde intrarenal surgery with laser lithotripsy is effective, current retrieval methods are inefficient, typically capturing only 1–3 fragments per ureteroscope pass and requiring many passes for full clearance. A novel spinner device that enables ultra‐efficient fragment removal through spinning‐induced localized suction is introduced. It generates spiral and circulating flows to capture fragments from over 20 mm away, eliminating the need to chase them. Optimized via computational fluid dynamics and validated in vitro and ex vivo, the spinner retrieves ≈60 small (0.5–2 mm) or ≈15 larger (2–3 mm) fragments per pass. It demonstrates nearly 100% capture of 60 fragments in bench tests and removes 45 fragments in 4 s in a porcine kidney model.

    "abstract": "This article presents a computational method for generating virtual 3D morphologies of functional materials using low‐parametric stochastic geometry models, that is, digital twins, calibrated with 2D microscopy images. These digital twins allow systematic parameter variations to simulate various morphologies, which can be deployed for virtual materials testing by means of spatially resolved numerical simulations of macroscopic properties. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained popularity for calibrating models to generate realistic 3D morphologies. However, GANs often comprise numerous uninterpretable parameters, making systematic variation of morphologies for virtual materials testing challenging. In contrast, low‐parametric stochastic geometry models (e.g., based on Gaussian random fields) enable targeted variation but may struggle to mimic complex morphologies. Combining GANs with advanced stochastic geometry models (e.g., excursion sets of more general random fields) addresses these limitations, allowing model calibration solely from 2D image data. This approach is demonstrated by generating digital twins for the morphology of microstructures in all‐solid‐state battery (ASSB) cathodes. Since the digital twins are parametric, they support systematic exploration of structural scenarios and their macroscopic properties. The proposed method facilitates simulation studies for optimizing 3D morphologies, benefiting not only ASSB cathodes but also other materials with similar structures.",

Understanding the computational mechanisms of MSI is key to advancing AI and brain‐inspired systems. While earlier models relied on probabilistic frameworks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) offer advantages in capturing temporal dynamics and neural computations. This review presents a critical examination of computational models of MSI, focusing on the evolution from probabilistic integration to modern RNN‐based methods. Biological evidence for temporal coordination in multisensory areas is analyzed and explored how different RNN architectures (e.g., vanilla, long short‐term memory, and gated recurrent unit) simulate these dynamics. Comparative analyses show RNNs’ superiority in robustness and learning efficiency, with up to 46.9% improvement in classification tasks involving sensory fusion. We introduce a taxonomy of MSI tasks and a novel evaluation framework for model benchmarking. Real‐world case studies—from speech recognition to prosthetic control—highlight practical applications. Challenges in interpretability, data efficiency, and generalization are also discussed. The review provides actionable insights for future research in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. By bridging neurobiological principles and machine learning, RNN‐based models pave the way for intelligent systems capable of flexible, context‐aware multisensory processing.",

Current ivEEG methods using electrode‐attached stents are limited to recording from large vessels, such as the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), restricting access to cortical regions essential for precise BCI control, such as those for hand and mouth movements. Here, ivEEG signals from small and soft cortical veins (CV‐ivEEGs) in eight pigs using microintravascular electrodes are recorded, achieving higher resting‐state signal power and greater spatial resolution of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) compared to SSS‐based ivEEG. Additionally, ivEEG recorded from deep veins clearly captures visual evoked potentials. Furthermore, comparisons between CV‐ivEEG and electrocorticography (ECoG) using epidural and subdural electrodes in two pigs demonstrate that CV‐ivEEG captures cortical SEPs comparable to ECoG. Targeted electrical stimulation via cortical vein electrodes induces specific contralateral muscle contractions in five anesthetized pigs, confirming selective motor‐region stimulation with minimal invasiveness. The findings suggest that ivEEG with microintravascular electrodes is capable of accessing diverse cortical areas and capturing localized neural activity with high signal fidelity for minimally invasive cortical mapping and BCI.",

Recent work has proposed an end‐to‐end convolutional neural network that converts 2D images into 3D holograms, enabling real‐time 3D holographic displays from widespread available images. However, the high computational cost of deep learning‐based methods limits their practical application. Deploying such algorithms on resource‐constrained mobile platforms requires more efficient models with reduced computational memory and power demands, which plays a crucial role in promoting human‐centric virtual reality/augmented reality displays.

Specifically, a 2D‐to‐3D CGH model is quantized from 32‐bit floating‐point to 8‐bit integer precision. The results show that the INT8 model reduces size by 60%, improves processing speed by a factor of three, and achieves comparable hologram quality to the FP32 model.

Adding actuated degrees of freedom to manipulate the environment can substantially expand the range of tasks that the insect‐scale robot can perform, which is, however, prohibitive due to the added volume and weight. Herein, a miniature rotary electrostatic clutch is presented such that it enables reconfigurable motion by selectively distributing the power of a single motor while embedded at multiple joints. In order to facilitate a compact clutch with a large locking torque, cutting patterns in the electrostatic clutch layer are incorporated. The segmented layer allows large out‐of‐plane displacement, thereby increasing the contact area between layers during engagement. Therefore, compact (20 mm), lightweight (0.4 g) clutches achieve a locking torque of 83.4 mNm, 4 times larger than a clutch without the pattern. Adding a single motor, seven clutches, and four clutch‐layer pairs enables independent drive of six additional joints without significantly increasing size or mass. This approach allows insect‐scale robots to perform variety tasks such as object manipulation, obstacle negotiation, and shape transformation. This method offers an efficient way to embed multiple actuated degrees of freedom in miniature robots, therefore enhancing their mobility and functionality.",

In prior investigations, image classification has been applied to identify morphologic abnormalities associated with infertility issues. However, the limited data availability has impeded high performance. In the field of image augmentation techniques, particularly concerning generative adversarial networks (GANs), an alternative approach can encounter a significant issue known as mode collapse. This phenomenon arises when the generator consistently produces a restricted set of identical or highly similar images, which may negatively affect the overall performance and accuracy of the model. Consequently, the aim of this study is to mitigate mode collapse by employing loss‐based ensemble GAN framework, formulated based on the integration of two distinct GAN models. In addition, a comprehensive analysis is carried out using an expanded approach involving three GAN models in conjunction with a spatial augmentation technique. The Shifted Window Transformer model achieves 95.37% accuracy on the HuSHeM dataset, outperforming other classification models.

The compiled 1,200+ hydrothermal reaction records and trained three machine‐learning models—K‐nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)—to predict product elements and phases from precursors, additives, reaction conditions, and engineered features.

Performance is strongest when similar training examples exist, while accuracy declines for underrepresented reactions, notably REE carbonates and heavy‐REE systems.

This method seamlessly integrates concepts from Elastic Maps , a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) method based on a mesh of springs, and Fast Marching Learning (FML) , an LfD method relying on light‐based velocity fields. The combination of these methods allows a robot to generate reproductions with multiple properties, such as the ability to be trained with single or multiple demonstrations, adapt to any number of initial, final, or via‐point constraints, and generate smooth reproductions. This algorithm not only improves the efficiency of the two previous methods but also enhances capabilities beyond prior works, as the new method operates in both orientation space and task space, which neither of the original methods were able to previously. EFML exhibits advantages in terms of precision, smoothness, and speed. This approach has been validated with various comparisons in simulated environments, evaluating its performance against Elastic Maps , FML , and other contemporary LfD methods using benchmarks such as the LASA and RAIL datasets. In addition, real‐world experiments involving tasks like pouring, where both position and orientation are crucial, have been conducted to validate the approach.",

    "abstract": "Metaverse has been widely studied in recent years, which aims to build a richer, more interactive, and more integrated digital layer on top of reality. As a fundamental and important 3D representation of metaverse, point clouds have gained significant attention recently and have been applied to many applications. However, assessing the quality of point clouds remains a significant challenge, particularly in scenes involving complex geometries or textures. To this end, this study presents a b ioinspired m etaverse p oint c loud q uality a ssessment (BMPCQA) metric, which simulates the human visual evaluation process to perform the point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) task. Specifically, inspired by local–global perception characteristics of biological visual systems, this study first extracts rendering projection video features, normal image features, and point cloud patch features. Then, these extracted high‐level semantic features and low‐level geometric features are fed into a large multimodal model to achieve biological‐like knowledge feature integration. Extensive experiments on standard PCQA datasets demonstrate that this study's method significantly outperforms existing traditional and learning‐based metrics, correlating more closely with human subjective evaluations. This work paves the way for perceptually aligned and scalable point cloud quality assessment in next‐generation virtual environments.

    "abstract": "Non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises the largest subtype of lung cancer with the most cases. Lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma are two NSCLC subtypes that pose challenges for accurate diagnosis using conventional methods, including histological examination and imaging, which can be slow and inconclusive. To address these concerns, RPSLearner is proposed, which combines random projection (RP) for dimensionality reduction and stacking ensemble learning to accurately predict lung cancer subtypes. Specifically, multiple independent RP matrices are first generated to project the high‐dimensional RNA‐seq data into a lower‐dimensional space, whose features are subsequently concatenated. After that, the concatenated RP features are fed into a stack of diverse base classifiers, and integrated the predictions from base models via a deep linear layer network. Benchmarking tests on 1 333 NSCLC patients demonstrated that RPSLearner outperformed state‐of‐the‐art approaches for lung cancer subtype classification. Specifically, RPSLearner efficiently preserved sample‐to‐sample distances even after significant dimension reduction, and the meta ‐model in RPSLearner yielded consistently higher scores than individual base models. In addition, the feature fusion method outperformed conventional score ensemble methods. We believe RPSLearner is a promising model for downstream lung cancer clinical diagnosis, and it holds the potential to be extended to subtyping of other types of cancer.",

Bimodal networked DEs have emerged as a class of high‐performance DEs owing to their tunable mechanical properties and electromechanical instability (EMI) suppression capability. However, their development is limited by complex synthesis and empirical trial‐and‐error methods. Here, an AI‐assisted design framework is presented that integrates experimental data with machine learning models and demonstrates it on the design of a typical bimodal networked DE material, processible high‐performance dielectric elastomer (PHDE). The neural network in the framework enabled accurate prediction of mechanical properties, while the support vector machine reliably classified EMI behavior. The framework also achieved reverse design of DEs from user‐defined targets in which experimentally validated formulations matched predictions and demonstrated EMI suppression. A soft gripper fabricated from the optimized PHDE materials lifted 25 times its own weight, demonstrating the practical utility of the framework.

    "abstract": "Bats species navigating dense vegetation based on biosonar must obtain sensory information about their environments from “clutter echoes”, i.e., echoes that are superpositions from many unresolved reflecting facets (e.g., leaves) with unpredictable individual waveforms. Prior results suggested that pinna deformations can aid performance in sensing tasks based on deterministic echo patterns, raising the question of whether varying pinna shapes can also have functional significance for biosonar tasks performed on clutter echoes. To test this hypothesis, this work investigates whether different pinna shapes have a consistent effect on clutter echoes despite the random nature of these signals. This is accomplished using a dedicated laboratory setup that produces large amounts of uncorrelated clutter echo data by agitating artificial foliage with fans between echo recordings. Deep learning then identifies the pinna shape that receives a given clutter echo using a data‐driven classification approach that learns features directly from echoes without explicit physical modeling. A ResNet‐50 achieves 97.8% overall classification accuracy for the pinna shape conformations (true‐positive identifications 91.67–100%), whereas a two‐dimensional convolutional neural network operating on echo spectrograms still achieves 90% accuracy. These findings demonstrate that even small pinna deformations can impart consistent effects on the clutter echoes.",

These sensors often rely on electronic components for signal interpretation and processing, which increases system complexity, reduces robustness under hazardous conditions, and limits the adaptability of the robots. Reducing complexity and improving adaptability in soft robots requires the development of electronics‐free control systems. A 3D‐printed, electronics‐free sensory system is integrated into a six‐legged soft robot, increasing its adaptability by enabling obstacle detection and directional change of locomotion using pneumatic logic gates. Pneumatic systems enable smooth, nature‐like movements and can operate safely in environments where electronics might fail. The results show rapid sensor response times (1.41–1.52 s), low required input forces (1.07–4.62 N) of the sensor, and walking speeds up to 0.17 body lengths per second. Operating at 225 kPa with 13.64 l n min −1 of compressed air in tethered mode, the robot also functions autonomously with a CO 2 cartridge. Integrated pneumatic grippers enhance their utility for object retrieval.

While Riemannian geometry has been successfully applied in noninvasive settings, its utility for invasive datasets, which are typically smaller and scarcer, remains less explored. Herein, a minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier is proposed using a Riemannian geometry approach based on covariance matrices extracted from intracortical local field potential (LFP) recordings across various regions during different brain state dynamics. For benchmarking, the performance of the approach is evaluated against convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Euclidean MDM classifiers. The results indicate that the Riemannian geometry‐based classification not only achieves a superior mean F1 macro‐averaged score across different channel configurations but also requires up to two orders of magnitude less computational training time. Additionally, the geometric framework reveals distinct spatial contributions of brain regions across varying brain states, suggesting a state‐dependent organization that traditional time series‐based methods often fail to capture. The findings align with previous studies supporting the efficacy of geometry‐based methods and extend their application to invasive brain recordings, highlighting their potential for broader clinical use, such as brain‐computer interface applications.",

When functionalized with ionic liquids (ILs) and coated with conductive polymers, BC forms soft, sustainable, and electroactive composites, making it suitable for sensors in soft robotics, wearable, biomedical, and environmental monitoring applications. However, modeling frameworks for BC–IL sensors are still lacking, hindering their integration into real‐world applications. To bridge this gap and support smart material design, we propose a novel first‐principle white‐box modeling framework is proposed that couples a 2D finite element method (FEM) for mechanical deformation with 1D FEM sub‐models for ion transport and voltage generation. Specifically, this work introduces the first dual‐carrier multiphysics model for mechanoelectric transduction in BC–IL sensors. The model, experimentally calibrated and validated, resolves the spatio‐temporal dynamics of mechanical deformation and dual‐ion transport, including diffusion, electromigration, and advection. By explicitly incorporating the transport and interaction of both cations and anions, previously neglected in smart‐sensors modeling, the proposed strategy provides a foundational simulation framework for the scalable, rapid, and intelligent design of next‐generation biodegradable and multifunctional smart sensors, advancing the integration of green materials into intelligent systems.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a new method for measuring the effective stiffness of curved actuators. Actuators are loaded into tension, and analytical mechanical equilibrium formulations are used to determine the stress along the actuator. A new mechanical metric, Shape Actuation Modulus (SAM), defines the effective stiffness of the actuator during loading as the ratio of stress change to radius of curvature change. Conductive polylactic‐acid shape‐memory actuators are produced to benchmark this novel methodology. These actuators display a linear behavior between 25 and 50 mm radius of curvature with SAM of 3.8±0.9 MPa at 50 mm. The interval on which the radius of curvature to stress relationship is linear can be controlled by choosing the radius of curvature of the hinge. For instance, SAM calculation with R 2 &gt; 0.97 was achieved in ranges of [22.7;79.6] mm and [16.4;51.5]mm for starting radius of curvature of 23.5±0.7 mm and 17.2±0.6 mm, respectively. Hence, the new technique proposed provides guidelines to design actuators. Finally, a comparison of bio‐composite actuators made of the same material was conducted. The hygromnemic actuators tested displayed a stiffness more than one order of magnitude larger than the hygromorphic ones for the range of radius of curvature [20;100]mm.",

However, the existing soft grippers cannot provide high response speed and firm grasping. Inspired by the natural, active entanglement behaviors of animals and plants, a rapid, cilia‐like soft gripper design is proposed for grasping various objects via envelopes formed by the self‐entanglement of multiple hollowed silicone tubes. The basic entanglement unit comprises a hollow, soft silicone tube with an actuation wire inside, which leads to compression and entanglement by fixing the front of the tube and drawing the actuation wire. Using multiple entanglement units enables sufficient mechanical interlocking between deformed tubes and grasped objects, avoiding the reliance on contact force control. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed soft gripper, with a cost lower than one dollar, can complete adaptive grasping within 1 s. The grasping success rate can reach 100% in grasping common irregular‐shaped daily objects within the effective grasping range of the entanglement units.

First, the proposed framework leverages advanced generative models to augment minority action classes, thus enhancing data representation and ensuring accurate recognition of catheterization actions. The six generative models utilized in this study undergo rigorous evaluation, achieving high fidelity with average precision and F1‐scores exceeding 94% across all models except CTGAN. Second, a convolutional neural network (IAR‐Net) tailored to recognize seven distinct catheterization actions is developed. Evaluated using the augmented dataset, IAR‐Net achieves an accuracy of 98.9%, surpassing current benchmarks. Comparative analysis with state‐of‐the‐art machine learning and transformer‐based models designed for tabular data confirms IAR‐Net's performance and robustness in recognizing catheterization actions. Lastly, interpretability methods are incorporated to elucidate the model's decision‐making process, improving understanding and increasing the trustworthiness of predictions.

An apparatus able to imitate the operation of biologic eyes and function as a standalone platform would therefore present the next evolutional step in machine visual perception. Neuromorphic computing is an alternative approach to the Von Neumann architecture that carries the potential for implementing such intelligent cameras. In this regard, artificial synaptic devices have been widely used in recent years to construct hardware‐based neural networks mainly due to their adjustable electric parameters. Herein, a bioinspired, hybrid electrophotonic responsive neuronic device that mimics the combined functionality of retinal cones and bipolar cells is demonstrated. Under illumination, it features a hyperpolarization‐like current response in an OFF state and a complementary depolarized reaction when toggled to an ON state. Furthermore, electrical pulsing done in conjunction with light stimulation can emulate the horizontal cell neurotransmitter release in center‐surround biologic configurations. These devices may thus serve as building blocks for advanced visual systems, integrating self‐healing sensory and neuromorphic computing into an artificial cognitive retina.",

Intrinsic properties of the soft actuators are estimated via computer vision for varying input fluid pressures. The dynamic motion of individual arms and the full robot are modeled using the planar discrete elastic rod (PDER) theory. Locomotion gaits (periodic shape changes) that result in translation in the plane, separately considering fixed or rotating anchors at the end of each arm, are derived. Gait efficiency is defined as the displacement magnitude divided by a measure of the input control effort over each gait cycle, including a cost for anchor attachment.

Many potential applications of these systems involve their flowing, extrusion, and deposition through channels and nozzles, such as targeted drug delivery and out‐of‐equilibrium self‐assembly. However, understanding their fundamental interactions with flow and boundaries remain incomplete. Herein, experimental and theoretical studies of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) powered self‐propelled gold–platinum nanorods in parallel channels and nozzles are conducted. The behaviors of active (self‐propelled) and passive rods are systematically compared. It is found that most active rods self‐align with the flow streamlines in areas with high shear and exhibit rheotaxis (swimming against the flow). In contrast, passive rods continue moving unaffected until the flow rate is very high, at which point they also start showing some alignment. The experimental results are rationalized by computational modeling delineating activity and rod‐flow interactions. The obtained results provide insight into the manipulation and control of active particle flow and extrusion in complex geometries.",

The conductive acrylic elastomer is first characterized in terms of its mechanical and electrical characteristics and then applied to various devices, such as soft electrostatic actuators, strain sensors, and stretchable pumps. These devices, which can be fabricated within 15–30 min, exhibit areal actuated strains of up to 163.0 ± 1.0% at 4 kV in the actuators, a highly linear response ( R 2 = 0.995) for strains of up to 100% with a gauge factor of 0.98 in the sensors, and an output pressure of 0.11 ± 0.08 kPa and flow rate of 20 ± 4 μL s −1 at 7 kV in the pumps. These performance characteristics are comparable to those reported in the literature. To demonstrate the potential for soft robotic applications, a wearable device is developed (fabrication time of ≈15 min), which exhibits multiple functionalities, such as detection of deformations of a human finger, haptic presentation through vibration, and electroadhesion.

The interaction between actin filaments and the negatively charged block‐copolymer Krytox is identified as the driving force for Marangoni flows at the droplet interface. Tuning the actin–Krytox interplay, sustained autonomous unidirectional droplet rotation with 1.7 rot h −1 is achieved. Ultimately, this rotational motion is transformed into a translational rolling motion by introducing interactions between the droplets and the surface of the observation chamber. Accordingly, translational motility of actin‐containing droplets at velocities of 0.061 ± 0.014 μm s − 1 is reported herein and an overall displacement of several hundreds of micrometers within 30 min is observed.

The leaf‐motion actuator combines built‐in dynamic sensing and room‐temperature self‐healing capabilities to restore macroscale cutting damage with an intrinsically high bandwidth of up to 10 kHz. The feasibility and potential of the new actuator for use in complex soft autonomous systems are demonstrated.

To overcome these issues, herein a sensorized foam actuator (SFA) with a foam core that acts as both an actuator and a proprioception‐sensing element is developed. The integrated modules can sense direct actuation and passive deformation due to extrinsic stresses through a specific pore shape evolution, which leads to a distinct variation in the resistivity pattern. In addition, a fiber‐reinforced skin encapsulating the SFA facilitates a fast and efficient response. The SFA is able to lift more than 500 times its own weight with a load‐withstanding capacity of 235 N, linear contraction up to 70% strain, and a recovery speed of 13.3 mm s −1 . In addition, the SFA is lightweight (34 g), has low hysteresis (&lt;4%), and can self‐sense its current deformation state. As proof of concept, various soft robotic applications are presented such as compression piston‐like motion, modular inchworm‐like crawling locomotion, and a robotic trunk‐like manipulation.",

Electro‐fluidic actuators are especially promising, they combine the advantages of electroactive polymers (low‐power consumption, fast response, and electrical powering) with the versatility of fluidic systems (force/stroke amplification). EHD (electrohydrodynamic) actuators are electro‐fluidic actuators whose motion results from charges being induced and accelerated in a liquid. They are extremely compact, silent, and low power (≤10 mW). They have been recently demonstrated in stretchable pumps and for the wireless propulsion of simple floating robots. This study demonstrates simultaneous wireless propulsion (2.5 mm s −1 ) and control of a 1 cm sized robot using a single DC signal. Voltage is applied between an electrode on the floating robot and a fixed one, both exposed to a dielectric liquid. Results support the underlying physical mechanism as EHD and characterize robot motion with different fluorocarbon liquids and voltages between 400 and 1800 V. Path following is demonstrated with a 3 × 3 array of electrodes.

The underlying sensory nerves that make this possible are highly dense and use sophisticated communication pathways to propagate signals from nerves in muscle, skin, and joints to the central nervous system wherein the organism can process and react to stimuli. In a step forward to realize robots with such perceptive capability, a flexible sensor framework that incorporates a novel modeling strategy, taking advantage of computational mechanics and machine learning, is proposed. The sensor framework on a large flexible sensor that transforms sparsely distributed strains into continuous surface is implemented. Finite element (FE) analysis is utilized to determine design parameters, while an FE model is built to enrich the morphological data used in the supervised training to achieve continuous surface reconstruction. A mapping between the local strain data and the enriched surface data is subsequently trained using ensemble learning. This hybrid approach enables real time, robust, and high‐order surface reconstruction. The sensing performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, repeatability, and feasibility with numerous scenarios, which has not been demonstrated on such a large‐scale sensor before.",

This novel real‐time knee soft tissue balance measurement system provides a way for surgeons or knee joint replacement surgery robots to accurately evaluate soft tissue balance and paves the way for improving the success rate of TKA and the patient's postoperative rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Chemically driven micromotors display unpredictable trajectories due to the rotational Brownian motion interacting with the surrounding fluid molecules. This hampers the practical applications of these tiny robots, particularly where precise control is a requisite. To overcome the rotational Brownian motion and increase motion directionality, robots are often decorated with a magnetic composition and guided by an external magnetic field. However, despite the straightforward method, explicit analysis and modeling of their motion have been limited. Here, catalytic Janus micromotors are fabricated with distinct magnetizations and a controlled self‐propelled motion with magnetic steering is shown. To analyze their dynamic behavior, a dynamic model that can successfully predict the trajectory of micromotors in uniform viscous flows in real time by incorporating a form of state‐dependent‐coefficient with a robust two‐stage Kalman filter is theoretically developed. A good agreement is observed between the theoretically predicted dynamics and experimental observations over a wide range of model parameter variations. The developed model can be universally adopted to various designs of catalytic micro‐/nanomotors with different sizes, geometries, and materials, even in diverse fuel solutions. Finally, the proposed model can be used as a platform for biosensing, detecting fuel concentration, or determining small‐scale motors’ propulsion mechanisms in an unknown environment.",

    "abstract": "It is shown that naturally occurring under‐extrusion results in mechanically weak prints while over‐extrusion causes excess use of material with little strength gain. Herein, a deep‐learning‐based computer vision system to correct under‐ and over‐extrusion issues commonly found in 3D printing technology such as the fused deposition modeling (FDM) is developed. The adaptive correction system is created to acquire recurring images of print‐in‐progress, allowing pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models to classify the printing condition. Then the classification data allow the adaptive system to make subsequent changes of printing parameters in a simple feedback loop to correct printing extrusion in an average of four to eight printed layers. The result shows that the system can improve the strength consistency of the prints by reducing yield strength variance by a factor of six through in situ correction. This system strengthens weaker prints by up to 200% and can save up to 40% material amount in extreme over‐extruded cases. In the future, the deep‐learning approach demonstrated in this design can be expanded to correct different parameters and its corresponding defects in the other 3D printing technologies with the same methods.",

    "abstract": "External‐memory‐based few‐shot learning has emerged as a promising solution to deal with the shortage of labeled samples in traditional deep neural networks (DNNs). The external memories here are used to perform explicit similarity calculations. Despite several encouraging schemes were proposed to merge data storage and similarity calculation using non‐volatile memories, two major challenges, including the long encoding bits and the degraded accuracy of hardware implementations, remain to be tackled. Herein, a cosine‐similarity‐based few‐shot learning method with analog memristors is designed. A regulation block in the embedding net is used as a hardware–software co‐optimization unit to reduce the encoding lengths of the embedding vectors. Then, a lifelong memory adaptation method, termed the online prototype augmentation, is proposed for the first time to promote the accuracy of extremely low‐shot learning problems. Results show that the encoding bits are 4–32 times smaller than popular schemes. Using the Omniglot dataset, record accuracy (98.3% and 97.3% for the 5‐way 5‐shot and 5‐way 1‐shot problems, respectively) can be obtained for the few‐shot learning with memristive cosine similarities. In addition, the online prototype augmentation method leads to at least ≈ 2% improvement in accuracy for 1‐shot learning, which is outstanding compared to prior studies.",

    "abstract": "In the last several years, laboratory automation and high‐throughput synthesis and characterization have come to the forefront of the research community. The large datasets require suitable machine learning techniques to analyze the data effectively and extract the properties of the system. Herein, the binary library of metal halide perovskite (MHP) microcrystals, MA x FA 1− x PbI 3− x Br x , is explored via low‐dimensional latent representations of composition‐ and time‐dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The variational autoencoder (VAE) approach is used to discover the latent factors of variability in the system. The variability of the PL is predominantly controlled by compositional dependence of the bandgap. At the same time, secondary factor of variability includes the phase separation associated with the formation of the double peaks. To overcome the interpretability limitations of standard VAEs, the workflow based on the translationally invariant variational (tVAEs) and conditional autoencoders (cVAEs) is introduced. tVAE discovers known factors of variation within the data, for example, the (unknown) shift of the peak due to the bandgap variation. Conversely, cVAEs impose known factor of variation, in this case anticipated bandgap. Jointly, the tVAE and cVAE allow to disentangle the underlying mechanisms present within the data that bring a deeper meaning and understanding within MHP systems.",

    "abstract": "Small ground‐based robots show promise for locomotion on complex surfaces. A critical application area for such robots is movement over complex terrain and within constricted space such as narrow gaps in rubble. To contend with this terrain complexity, robots typically require high degree‐of‐freedom (DOF) limbs. However, for small robot platforms, this approach of high DOF legs is impractical due to actuator limitations. This presents an opportunity to design robots whose morphology enables the outsourcing of computational tasks to the robot body through the use of compliant elements (morphological computation). Herein, a novel robot appendage is developed that can passively compress in a programmed direction in response to environmental constrictions. A robot equipped with these appendages can enter narrow spaces down to 72% of the robot's sprawled body width as well as low ceilings down to 68% its freestanding height. The robot is able to step onto and over small terrain features ( hip height) and navigate various natural terrain types with ease. The results show that these compressible appendages enable versatile robot locomotion for robot exploration in previously unmapped environments.",

    "abstract": "Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common endocrine carcinoma and has frequent recurrence instances. Although PTC recurrence has been predicted using predictors established using various features and techniques, its early detection is still challenging. To address this issue, it is aimed to develop a deep‐learning model that utilizes not only the initial medical records but also the thyroid function tests (TFTs) performed periodically post‐surgery. Herein, a novel multimodal prediction model, called the hybrid architecture for multimodal analysis (HAMA), that can analyze numeric and time‐series data simultaneously, is proposed. For quantitative evaluation, fourfold cross validation is conducted on data of 1613 PTC patients including 63 locoregional recurrence patients, and the HAMA is achieved the following performance: sensitivity (0.9688); specificity (0.9781); F1‐score (0.7943); and area under the receiver‐operating characteristic curve, AUROC (0.9863). Furthermore, a real‐time prediction simulation is conducted at 6‐month intervals by reconstructing the data of each patient into real‐time data. It is demonstrated in the real‐time simulation results that the HAMA predicts PTC recurrence at least 1.5 years in advance by recalculating the recurrence probability using the additional follow‐up data. To the best of the knowledge, the HAMA is the first deep‐learning model to reflect continuous change in the physical condition of a patient post‐surgery.",

    "abstract": "Advanced technologies for muscle tracking provide easy access to identify and track muscle activity, often for the purposes of therapeutic interventions. The necessity of muscle trackers arises from the acute and chronic sources that disrupt neuromuscular control, resulting in an impaired ability to perform daily activities without assistance. In the context of human–machine interfaces, muscle trackers can serve as the “sensory” component, providing real‐time information to machines, such as exoskeletons and prosthetics, that can act upon such information for therapeutic and functional aid. Recently developed devices for muscle tracking rely on combinations of sensor modalities and algorithms to extract information from biosignals track muscle activity, or even extrapolate kinematic information, including gestures. However, a number of obstacles remain to be overcome to further facilitate the practical implementation of muscle‐tracking technologies, the most notable being real‐time analysis of biosignal data and extracting kinematic information from complex movements. This review attempts to cover the mechanisms behind various sensor modalities and algorithms commonly used for muscle tracking, as well as establish the current state of applications within the field. Given its multidisciplinary nature and ability to free users from rehabilitation constraints, the field of muscle tracking holds significant promise for future study.",

Biological neurons with fault tolerance and logic functions exhibit powerful computing capacity when facing complex real‐world problems, which strikes the inspiration for the development of highly energy‐efficient brain‐like computing. Herein, a novel device architecture, an electrolyte‐manipulated ferroelectric organic neuristor, which emulates biological neurons to perform both neuromorphic and reconfigurable logic‐in‐memory operations in a single cell, is proposed. The interfacial coupling of ions and dipoles in the neuristor contributes to the tunable synaptic behaviors of short‐ to long‐term plasticity. Notably, by virtue of lateral capacitive coupling, the neuristor is effectively controlled by multiple in‐plane gates to achieve heterosynaptic plasticity. An artificial neural network exhibits robust recognition ability with high accuracy of 93.7% in speech recognition, further demonstrating the feasibility of the neuristor for neuromorphic computing. Additionally, reconfigurable logic‐in‐memory operations (OR and AND) are successfully demonstrated in a single device. Therefore, the devices shed new light on the development of more brain‐inspired computing systems in the era of big data.",

    "abstract": "Optoelectronic devices based on optically responsive materials have gained significant attention due to their low cross talk and reduced power consumption. These devices rely on light‐induced changes in conductance states, which are used to create synaptic weights for image recognition tasks in neural networks. However, a major drawback of such devices is the rapid decay of conductance states after light stimulus removal, which hinders their long‐term memory and performance without a continuous external stimulus in place. To address this issue, a platform neural network scheme is proposed to counter the natural decay of conductance in optoelectronic devices. The approach restores the memory effect of the devices and significantly enhances their performance by several orders of magnitude without using additional energy‐intensive techniques like training pulses or gate fields. Herein, the model is validated experimentally using optoelectronic devices fabricated with two different materials, BP and doped In 2 O 3 , and demonstrates the restoration of memory/image retention ability to any material system being studied for optoelectronic synapses and vision. This approach has important implications for the practical application of neuromorphic visual processing technologies, bringing them closer to real‐world applications.",

Furthermore, the sheets bend into 3D structures, where the bending direction can be programmed. The resulting structures actuate anisotropically when exposed to heat or laser illumination and can be designed for various modes of operation, such as manipulation or untethered locomotion.

Tensegrity, of which the structural integrity is constrained by tension, does not involve static/sliding friction among the rigid components. However, this mechanical stability is very susceptible to actuation errors. It requires complex kinematics modeling and sophisticated control model with sensing feedback. Herein, a low‐inertia tensegrity joint that is covered/protected by a fiber Bragg grating (FBG)‐embedded silicone sheath is proposed, with the aim to reinforce the joint motion stability and enable self‐contained sensing feedback. A learning‐based closed‐loop controller is also designed and trained with the proper joint configurations selected by a two‐step sampling method. Both the kinematics and static equilibriums of such configurations can be well satisfied. The experiments demonstrate that the joint can follow paths accurately in 2D by compensating manipulation error shortly under the closed‐loop control. The joint stiffness can also be varied against the external/impulsive disturbances. It can be foreseen that this primitive robot joint component with 2 degrees of freedom (DoFs) can provide safe, compliant interaction with human, for which a simple test of maneuvering a portable ultrasound probe (≈210 g) for abdominal imaging is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Safe and human‐like trajectory planning is crucial for self‐driving cars. While model‐based planning has demonstrated reliability, it is beneficial to incorporate human demonstrations and align the results with human behaviors. This work aims at bridging the gap between model‐based planning and driver imitation by proposing a constraint imitative trajectory planning method (CITP). CITP integrates artificial potential field and dynamic movement primitives, which have achieved both the ability to imitate human demonstrations as well as ensure safety constraints. During the planning process, CITP first encodes human demonstrations, local driving target, and traffic obstacles as attractive or repulsive effects, and then the trajectory planning problem is solved through model predictive optimization. To address the dynamics of traffic scenarios, a hierarchical planning strategy is proposed based on the division of planning process. CITP is designed with five modules, including LSTM‐based target generation, encoding attractive and repulsive effects with target, demonstrations and obstacles, and trajectory planning with model predictive optimization. Data collection and experiments are carried out based on CARLA driving simulator, and the effectiveness in terms of both safety and consistency with human behavior are reported.",

However, most available tactile sensors require complicated technological processes, redundant layouts, and data acquisition circuits, which limits their ability to provide a real‐time static perception and feedback for potential applications such as robotic manipulation. Drawing inspiration from the sliding tactile (ST) perception mode of the human fingertip, a robust and flexible ST sensor with a low array density of 2.7 cells cm −2 is reported. This innovative sensor has a soft and cambered configuration that allows it to rapidly and accurately recognize the 3D surface features of objects, including grooves as small as 500 μm. Benefiting from the strong correlation between collected electronic responding and local deformation of sensing cell, the ST sensor can adaptively reconstruct surface patterns with the assistance of deep learning, even on unstructured objects. The pattern recognition system based on the robot is demonstrated by accurately classifying a set of mahjong tiles with nearly 100% accuracy, surpassing human tactile perception capabilities in the same task.",

For steady and free‐flowing particle management, it is essential to produce acoustic OAM beams of high order and high quality. However, this task is difficult due to the phased array's fundamental restriction of insufficient resolution or aperture. Herein, a generic approach is presented to inverse design that may be used to improve the OAM beam quality and produce twisted ultrasonic motors in free space. In comparison to the previous direct‐design method, up to a 14% improvement in amplitude uniformity and a 12 dB improvement in signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) of OAM modes are achieved. These notable benefits enable the ultrasonic motor to operate with a straightforward and compact system while enabling steady particle rotation in free space with an undersampled phased array, which is not possible with the conventional technique. This study paves the way for effective particle control, high‐fidelity communication, and other OAM‐based technologies by providing an inverse‐design framework for optimizing OAM.",

    "abstract": "Floor‐cleaning robots play a crucial role in both industrial and domestic spaces. However, these robots often face challenges due to hazardous components in their environment, which can cause them to fail and prevent them from performing at their best. This situation necessitates continuous research in the field of floor‐cleaning robots. However, most of these efforts focus on improving the robots’ perception capabilities by incorporating additional sensors. Nevertheless, incorporating more sensors is an expensive solution for most cleaning robots. Alternatively, in this research, the feasibility of introducing a safe path on a predefined hazard map is explored. The proposed method aims to trade‐off between area coverage and the safety of the cleaning robot. Herein, the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method is introduced as a tool to classify the hazards and implement a safety‐ensured coverage path‐planning process. In this approach, the risk factor defined for a point in the environment serves as the key parameter to assess the safety of the algorithm's suggested path. To validate and evaluate the proposed method, this article utilizes the hTetro mobile robot. In the experimental results, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can reduce high‐risk movements of the robot compared to existing methods.",

Herein, bimodal tactile sensors capable of simultaneously recognizing the size and stiffness of grasped objects, even deformable ones, are produced. The bimodal tactile sensors are fabricated using the identical process of controlling the air gap between a flexible substrate and the sensing layer, allowing the sensorized gripper to measure pressure and bending characteristics with high accuracy and durability. The pressure sensor yields an excellent durability performance with a negligible change of Δ I / I o &lt; 4.01% even after more than 10 4 pressing–releasing cycles and broad detection range (5–360 kPa) characteristics. The bending strain sensor also exhibits high sensitivity in a broad bending strain range (0–2.3%) and high durability with a change of Δ I / I o &lt; 4.48% for 10 4 bending cycles. Using these devices, the sensorized gripper demonstrates that seven tomatoes with different sizes and ripeness states can be classified with high accuracy of 98.78% using an artificial neural network.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma tumor recurrences often occur in brain tissue areas harboring infiltrating tumor cells, resembling healthy tissue in brain imaging. Demarcating infiltrative regions for aggressive resections is critical for improving prognostic outcomes but is challenging in neurosurgery. Herein, a multilayer sigmoid‐activated convolutional neural network (MLS‐CNN) is developed for rapidly distinguishing glioma tumor infiltration in brain tissue histology. Unlike conventional multiclass classifiers, the MLS‐CNN employs sigmoidal activation to accommodate coexisting classes within patch images. 59 811 image patches (25 807 infiltrating edge, 15 178 normal brain, 18 826 cellular tumor) from 73 brain tissue samples are extracted to train the classifier. The model achieves an accuracy of 91.70% (sensitivity: 91.62%; specificity: 91.78%) and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.964 in distinguishing infiltrating edges, outperforming the current state‐of‐the‐art Vision Transformer (ViT) (accuracy: 89.45; AUC: 0.947). The MLS‐CNN is computationally efficient, generating predictions within 11.5 s in comparison to 81.4 s for ViT. The predictions strongly correlate with In Situ Hybridization expression intensities, validating the utility of the MLS‐CNN model in spatial genomics investigations in gliomas. The robust model can therefore serve as an automatic and accurate classifier to help pathologists identify infiltrative glioma for better diagnosis and patient outcomes in brain oncology.",

To meet the high‐throughput manufacturing speed (90 mm s −1 ) of the R2R gravure system, six different electronic inks are formulated to print the WeHLs to harvest ±10 V from the smartphone's NFC carrier. To attain a practical device yield under the given printing speed, the web tension, nip force, doctor blade angle, and overlay printing registration accuracy are well controlled and optimized to print six different layers within a high overlay printing accuracy, while printing patterns to connect two electrodes with a height difference greater than 3 μm.

    "abstract": "Soft robot deformations are typically estimated using strain sensors to infer change from a nominal shape while taking a robot‐specific mechanical model into account. This approach performs poorly during buckling and when material properties change with time, and is untenable for shape‐changing robots that don't have a well‐defined resting (unactuated) shape. Herein, these limitations are overcome using stretchable shape sensing (S3) sheets that fuse orientation measurements to estimate 3D surface contours without making assumptions about the underlying robot geometry or material properties. The S3 sheets can estimate the shape of target objects to an accuracy of ≈3 mm for an 80 mm long sheet. The authors show the S3 sheets estimating their shape while being deformed in 3D space and also attached to the surface of a silicone three‐chamber pneumatic bladder, highlighting the potential for shape‐sensing sheets to be applied, removed, and reapplied to soft robots for shape estimation. Finally, the S3 sheets detecting their own stretch up to 30% strain is demonstrated. The approach introduced herein provides a generalized method for measuring the shape of objects without making strong assumptions about the objects, thus achieving a modular, mechanics model‐free approach to proprioception for wearable electronics and soft robotics.",

To address this, a multiobjective collaborative deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the actor‐critic framework is presented. Initially, two deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) networks are established for training the jumping motion, each focusing on different objectives and collaboratively learning the optimal jumping policy. Following this, a recovery experience replay mechanism, predicated on dynamic time warping, is integrated into the DDPG to enhance sample utilization efficiency. Concurrently, a timely adjustment unit is incorporated, which works in tandem with the training frequency to improve the convergence accuracy of the algorithm. Additionally, a Markov decision process is designed to manage the complexity and parameter uncertainty in the dynamic model of the bipedal robot. Finally, the proposed method is validated on a PyBullet platform. The results show that the method outperforms baseline methods by improving learning speed and enabling robust jumps with greater height and distance.",

Simultaneous real‐time visualization and manipulation of microcarriers at any depth in the human body is far to be achieved even though one of each task has been successfully proven. Herein, a novel targeting strategy is proposed that employs field‐free region (FFR) scanning to guide microcarriers through multiple bifurcations within a predefined vessel network. The main challenge of this method lies on how, where, and when to activate FFR to steer a particle to a desired direction, regardless of its spatial feedback. To achieve it, first, a mathematical model of particle motion in a vessel network is developed to predict particle behaviors and positions. Subsequently, an optimization algorithm is formulated to place FFR well‐coordinated around each bifurcation at a designated moment. The established solution for targeting a magnetic microcarrier is preemptively evaluated through finite element simulations and then successfully implemented in in vitro multibranched vessels.",

    "abstract": "Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for real‐world applications is challenging due to the requirement of high‐quality labeled imagery. This study employs pseudo‐labeling and transfer learning, built upon a 6D pose estimation framework. A CNN trained on synthetic images predicts bounding boxes (bbox) for an object's components in a real image. With as few as four bbox predictions, the framework solves for the object's pose relative to the camera and reprojects bboxes for all components onto that image. The pose and reprojections allow filtering of bad predictions, a common issue in pseudo‐labeling. Thereby, enabling automated labeling of large datasets with minimal human intervention. Tested on color and long‐wave infrared imagery captured during December 2023 flight tests, this process demonstrates increased predictions, enhanced performance across situations, reduced reprojection error, and stabilized pose predictions. This technique is significant as it enables labeling of real‐world imagery without expensive truth systems, requiring only a camera. It supports learning and labeling of previously captured imagery without known camera calibrations, facilitating labeled data creation for impractical‐to‐simulate sensors. Ultimately, this transfer learning approach provides a low‐cost and precise method for creating CNNs trained on operationally relevant data, previously unattainable by the everyday user.",

    "abstract": "As a crucial component of modern energy systems, wind energy plays a significant role in energy transition. In traditional wind power systems, mutual interference between wind turbines leads to wake effect, adversely impacts the power generation efficiency of wind farms. Herein, a multicluster distributed optimization strategy based on wake‐DBSCAN, specifically designed for environments affected by wake interference is proposed. First, clustering analysis on the wind turbine layout and wind conditions to establish a foundation for efficient distributed computation is performed. Based on the clustering results, wake analysis is conducted to plan and optimize the operational strategy for each wind turbine cluster, resulting in a distributed optimization strategy for their operation. Additionally, simulation experiments are conducted on micrositing and time‐varying wind conditions using real‐world data from a wind farm in the Arua region. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the computational efficiency of wake optimization, while ensuring the effect of the wake optimization algorithm in actual wind farms as much as possible, which is more in line with the wake optimization needs of actual wind farms. The algorithm proposed in this article provides valuable insights into wind turbine operation and maintenance under time‐varying conditions.",

In this research, a new method called class‐separable extreme learning machine auto‐encoding (CS‐ELM‐AE) is proposed, to improve ELM‐AE's efficacy in addressing the overlapping data problem and thereby increasing classification efficiency. CS‐ELM‐AE encodes points in the same class of the dataset to be closer together. Oversampling is also applied to the encoded dataset to solve the imbalanced data problem.

Herein, the development of an electronic skin (e‐skin) that integrates multifunctional tactile sensing capabilities, including dynamic pressure sensing and continuous sliding touch detection, along with human–robot interface is reported. To address the limitations of early works on multifunctionality in strain sensors based on resistive values, the innovative scheme harnesses the synergy of facile e‐skin fabrication and advanced decoding algorithms, creating a robust stimuli‐responsive platform. At the core of the system lies a straightforward integration of e‐skin, achieved by generating laser‐induced graphene on a liquid‐crystal polymer film, followed by embedding the transfer‐printed conductive graphene layer into an elastomeric substrate. This streamlined methodology optimizes existing sensor arrays without the need for intricate material combinations or interconnections, avoiding susceptibility to damage. The advanced decoding algorithms bypass geometric engineering and complex numerical calculations within the deep learning hyper‐redundant system. In the experimental results, it is demonstrated that the e‐skin system successfully achieves a Braille‐readable e‐skin and a surgery‐enabled human–robot interface, highlighting the scalability and adaptability of the e‐skin in coordination with decoding algorithm systems.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing has the potential to revolutionize future technologies and our understanding of intelligence, yet it remains challenging to realize in practice. The learning‐from‐mistakes algorithm, inspired by the brain's simple learning rules of inhibition and pruning, is one of the few brain‐like training methods. This algorithm is implemented in neuromorphic memristive hardware through a codesign process that evaluates essential hardware trade‐offs. While the algorithm effectively trains small networks as binary classifiers and perceptrons, performance declines significantly with increasing network size unless the hardware is tailored to the algorithm. This work investigates the trade‐offs between depth, controllability, and capacity—the number of learnable patterns—in neuromorphic hardware. This highlights the importance of topology and governing equations, providing theoretical tools to evaluate a device's computational capacity based on its measurements and circuit structure. The findings show that breaking neural network symmetry enhances both controllability and capacity. Additionally, by pruning the circuit, neuromorphic algorithms in all‐memristive circuits can utilize stochastic resources to create local contrasts in network weights. Through combined experimental and simulation efforts, the parameters are identified that enable networks to exhibit emergent intelligence from simple rules, advancing the potential of neuromorphic computing.",

It uses the flexible multi‐segment appendages to generate asymmetric force during the power stroke and recovery stroke for swimming. Meanwhile, the middle appendages are considered to help regulate stability. Inspired by this, a comprehensive study on a diving‐beetle‐like swimming robot is presented. The design of the robot is first demonstrated. Soft rubber is used as a passive flexible joint for the multi‐flexible appendage, and the swimming gaits are mimicked. Next, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed appendage design, its dynamic model is established and the effects of overly high and overly low stiffness on net thrust generation are compared. Finally, extensive thrust and swimming tests are conducted. The experimental results show that by mimicking the diving beetle's appendage structure and swimming gaits, the proposed robot can effectively perform forward swimming and turning maneuvers. Furthermore, comparing only the hind appendage, the experimental results reveal that coordinating the hind appendage and the middle appendage gives the robot a faster turning speed. Additionally, utilizing the enhanced maneuverability, a proportional‐derivative controller is employed to control the robot's yaw stability, and the experimental results demonstrate that the robot has good robustness and disturbance resistance.",

This survey thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data, client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and limitations inherited within the array of the state‐of‐the‐art techniques utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training process. A comprehensive overview of the several notions, theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and their adoption in FL‐based multidisciplinary environments are delineated. Furthermore, the salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness quantitatively are examined. Finally, exciting open research directions that have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this pivotal area are envisaged.",

However, it is limited to strict environmental requirements and inadequate recognition accuracy. Herein, a flexible strain sensor is developed based on microfluidics using a back propagation (BP) neural network for highly accurate gesture recognition. The microfibers are achieved with stretchable polyurethane shells and conductive liquid metal cores in a convenient, safe, and effective way. Further, by combining 3D printing with microfluidics, the flexible strain sensor based on microfiber units is constructed. Because of the great advantages in mechanical and electrical performance of microfiber units, the achieved sensor shows impressive stretching and conductivity. When applied to the finger, the sensor converts the bending deformation into electrical signals directly. Thus, a set of sensors is attached to five fingers to record corresponding signals of different gestures, which can be further analyzed for gesture recognition. To improve the accuracy, flexible strain sensors are combined with a BP neural network. With electrical signals introduced into the input layer as the characteristic values of training set, high‐precision gesture recognition is achieved by updating the weights through training.

However, its capability to reveal the underlying tissue properties remains underexplored. A physics‐constrained learning framework is studied to reversely approximate tissue property representations from multiple B‐mode images acquired with varying dynamic ranges. First, an extractor network is used to generate property maps, that is, attenuation coefficient α , reflection coefficient β , border probability ρ b , scattering density ρ s , scattering amplitude ϕ , and one perturbation p map characterizing the variations caused by varying dynamic range. The α − ϕ maps are loosely regularized by rendering them forward to realistic US images using ray‐tracing simulator. To further enforce the physics constraints, a ranking loss is introduced to align the disparity between two estimated p maps with the discrepancy between two distinct inputs. Due to the missing ground truth α − ϕ maps, alternatively, the method is validated by evaluating the consistency between the feature maps inferred from distinct images. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can robustly extract consistent intermediate maps from images. Furthermore, one potential downstream application is showcased to perform realistic US augmentation by introducing specific noise into the physics‐inspired α − ϕ maps.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning faces challenges like limited data, vanishing gradients, high parameter counts, and long training times. This article addresses two key issues: 1) data scarcity in ophthalmology and 2) vanishing gradients in deep networks. To overcome data limitations, an image processing‐based data generation method is proposed, expanding the dataset size by 12x. This approach enhances model training and prevents overfitting. For vanishing gradients, a deep neural network is introduced with optimized weight updates in initial layers, enabling the use of more and deeper layers. The proposed methods are validated using the retinal fundus multi‐disease image database dataset, a limited and imbalanced ophthalmology dataset available on the Grand Challenge website. Results show a 10% improvement in model accuracy compared to the original dataset and a 5% improvement over the benchmark reported on the website.",

    "abstract": "Hot‐rolled coils (HRCs) are essential in various industries, including automotive, construction, and machinery. However, the cooling process of HRCs in the yard tends to be nonuniform because of complex thermal interactions between adjacent coils and varying environmental conditions, which affect the mechanical properties and steel quality. In this study, we used simplified heat transfer models based on the finite element method (FEM) to generate realistic simulation data. We developed a novel management system that integrates two trained artificial neural networks with deep and wide networks using hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction speed, a known limitation of FEM. The system predicts temperature variations at multiple points on the coil, enabling strategic placement that minimizes temperature deviations and enhances cooling uniformity. This real‐time computational approach eliminates the necessity for additional cooling equipment and ensures high product quality. The system's efficacy was validated through case studies, revealing dynamic adjustments and optimized placements. The proposed system achieved a mean absolute error of 3.44 and a mean absolute percentage error of 0.24%, outperforming conventional regression techniques. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the system in simulating real‐world cooling scenarios and its feasibility for real‐time cooling optimization in steel manufacturing.",

While previous studies show task‐specific improvements with XRAs, it remains uncertain whether skills acquired in one task generalize to others with differing cognitive and motor demands. This study investigates whether multitasking training enhances performance on untrained tasks involving XRA. The training combined biological functions (button pressing, slider movement, and speech) with XRA control via voluntary diaphragmatic modulation. Untrained tasks include trimanual block manipulation and concurrent block manipulation with keyboard typing. We compared performance in the untrained tasks between a group that only perform those tasks and one that completes the training beforehand. Training significantly improves performance in the trimanual block manipulation task ( t = 3.45, p = 0.001). Additionally, users’ performance in this task is significantly higher than when they used only their biological limbs, demonstrating true functional augmentation ( t = 2.70, p = 0.021). However, no differences are observed between groups in the concurrent block manipulation and typing task ( t = 163.50, p = 0.880). These findings highlight the need to explore adaptive training protocols enhancing XRA‐biological limb coordination for improved skill transfer across diverse multitasking environments.",

Owing to their inherent nonlinearity, nanomechanical systems constitute an interesting technology to serve as reservoir. While RC platforms are built using microelectromechanical systems, the energy efficiency, response time, and footprint of these systems can be significantly improved by using nanoscale devices. Herein, the use of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) is investigated, which can be used in RC, utilizing inherent nonlinearities and the fading memory effect from the transient response of NEMS. The smaller size and higher operating frequencies of NEMS enable faster processing rates compared to micromechanical systems, while their compact footprint, low power consumption, and ability to operate under ambient conditions simplify integration into practical applications. In modified national institute of standards and technology (MNIST) handwritten digit–recognition test, this system achieves 90% accuracy with a 3.3 μs processing time per pixel. Also the effect of driving frequency and amplitude on NEMS classification accuracy is investigated using experiments and simulations and it is shown that no significant dependency in any of the parameters is observed. Herein, an estimate for energy consumption of core NEMS RC system on MNIST data is provided.

We propose an approach based on multimodal GCNNs that integrates patients’ lung computed tomography images with clinical information to differentiate between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. Leveraging large‐scale and multisource data from multiple hospitals (i.e., 6033/290/524 patients for three hospitals respectively) enhances the diversity of features. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) are used to evaluate the performance. We achieved the average accuracy/sensitivity/specificity/AUROC of 0.8612/0.9425/0.6786/0.9025 for the main dataset via the novel GCNN proposed, respectively, maintaining the robustness of the deep learning procedures. Especially for the external testing dataset (hospital 2/hospital 3), the specificity is much higher than comparison methods (0.6250–0.6731 vs. 0.2569–0.2788).

Although they adapt readily to their environment and are inherently safe, they still require a large amount of tethers which limit their applicability. To overcome this limitation, researchers have exploited richness in the energy landscape, expressed in a nonlinear pressure–volume (PV) inflation characteristic, to sequence the motion of multiple actuators with only a few supply lines. However, designing actuators for a certain PV curve is an uphill task. Here, metamaterials, that consist of cylindrically tessellated unit cells, are explored to create a sleeve with nonlinear force–displacement characteristics. When combined with an inflatable core, these metamaterial sleeves imbue nonlinear characteristics to the actuator as a whole, making the PV characteristic tunable via the unit cell's geometry. Where previously, similar architectures were used for shape programming and shape retention, here, the symmetry‐breaking properties are analyzed and exploited to create metamaterial sleeve actuators that display a nonreciprocal bending motion; bending to the right during inflation, and to the left during deflation. Finally, the motion nonreciprocity of such actuators is used to make a quadruped robot walk.",

It calculates pharmacodynamic action scores to account for drug effect transmission across hierarchical levels, considering decay rates and node degree values. Validated against extensive datasets, HSPM differentiates between known effective and unknown/ineffective drug–disease pairs, highlighting its predictive modeling potential. Applied to traditional Chinese medicine, HSPM reveals synergistic effects and identifies new drug combinations with therapeutic potential, such as against hepatocellular carcinoma. Cellular experiments confirm the model's predictions, enhancing the efficacy of specific drug combinations.

It allows the number of convolution reading cycles to be adjusted based on design demands, such as area or time constraints. This adaptability can be achieved by modifying the area of kernel weights on the array, enabling a balance between time and area efficiency. A detailed algorithm for the configurable convolution scheme is presented, taking into account factors such as array size, feature map size, and cycle limits. Also, the experimental validation using a binary 12 × 12 MNIST dataset demonstrates the practical applicability of our scheme. By varying the number of cycles per inference ( N cycle ), this study analyzes how different array sizes can affect performance, confirming the relationship between the total number of cells ( N cell ) and cycles. Larger N cycle values can result in the increased usage of faulty devices, leading to more distorted feature map pixels. Additionally, it analyzes the robustness of the scheme to weight errors, finding that longer cycles are less robust due to more frequent reads on critical fault devices within the crossbar, causing accuracy degradation.",

The model achieves an accuracy of ≈86%, classified into three thermal regimes: 1) single‐phase stable behavior below 500 °C, 2) partial decomposition between 500 °C and 800 °C with formation of β‐tricalcium phosphate (β‐TCP) and oxyapatite, and 3) complete transformation above 800 °C into α‐TCP and Sr/Ca‐apatite phases. Cerium and samarium ion doping improve stability up to 600 °C by reducing vacancy formation, whereas co‐doping with holmium ion triggers earlier decomposition (≈500 °C) due to increased lattice strain. ML‐based framework reduces need for large‐scale experimental screening, enhances research efficiency and offers predictive in silico tool to design thermally stable apatite‐based materials for biomedical and catalytic applications.",

    "abstract": "The human sense of touch converts skin deformations into electrical impulses, enabling functional tasks such as object recognition and manipulation. Providing haptic information is crucial for improving usability in applications like prosthetics. Soft actuators have the potential to deliver modality‐matched feedback and high compression forces in a compact form. However, their full potential has been partially demonstrated. This study presents a soft inflatable actuator utilizing thermoplastic polyurethane to provide rich multimodal sensory feedback, including pressure and vibration. The actuator weighs less than 2 g and is 0.4 mm thick, significantly improving upon previous designs. Mechanical characterization reveals that the actuator can produce high‐bandwidth vibrations (200 Hz) and high forces (28 Newtons at 60 kPa). Psychometric tests, conducted with 14 able‐bodied individuals and three transradial amputees, show performance comparable to state‐of‐the‐art invasive and noninvasive solutions (Weber constants within 0.19–0.22). Additionally, the actuator successfully provides different artificial roughness sensations in able‐bodied individuals. Finally, amputees achieve an overall accuracy of 73.3% in a classification task, with dominant sensations of touch and pressure (45% of the stimuli). These results demonstrate that the proposed soft feedback actuator is effective, versatile, and lightweight, with potential for integration into robotic systems for feedback restoration and augmentation.",

Cardiac assist devices are crucial treatment modalities for end‐stage HF, but they still face limitations, such as direct blood contact and high power consumption. We present a lightweight (&lt;60 g), compact, electroactive polymer (EAP)‐based cardiac assist device (E‐CAD) as a nonblood‐contacting, low‐power alternative to address these limitations. E‐CAD consists of EAP units paired with negative bias springs (NBSs), mounted on a flexible sleeve that wraps around the heart to assist in cardiac compression. The device is designed to be biomimetic to match the regionally varying mechanical stiffness of the heart. Benchtop silicone phantom and ex vivo porcine tests demonstrated E‐CAD's ability to increase volume displacement by 1.21‐fold in benchtop tests with a silicone phantom and 1.17‐fold in ex vivo settings, along with an associated increase in ejection fraction, compared to cases without the device. Furthermore, it operates on low power (&lt;0.3 W), enabling a compact design with a thin driveline (outer diameter = 0.3 mm), which reduces infection risk. In summary, we showed that EAP‐based direct cardiac compression was feasible with low power demand. The improvement in cardiac output may translate into clinical benefits for advanced HF patients.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable microrobots promise advancements in microsurgical tools, self‐healing materials, and environmental remediation by enabling precise, adaptive functionalities at small scales. However, predicting their behaviors a priori remains a significant challenge, limiting the pace of design and discovery. To address this, a Monte Carlo simulation framework is presented for predicting the folding behavior of self‐assembled, sequence‐encoded microrobot chains composed of magnetic particles, enabling efficient exploration of their large design space. This computational framework employs metrics of radius of gyration, tortuosity, and symmetry score to map the design space, identify functional sequences, and predict likely folding behaviors before fabrication. The framework through experiments to demonstrate accuracy in capturing folding behaviors is validated. Statistical analysis reveals adherence to self‐avoiding walk principles from polymer theory, providing a foundation for understanding how input sequences drive folding capabilities. Moreover, the simulation surpasses current experimental capabilities, enabling exploration of novel microrobot designs, such as sequences incorporating mixtures of cubes and triangular prism subunits, which exhibit distinct compressive behaviors. Beyond the sequence‐encoded microrobots investigated in this study, this framework offers broad utility for the design of reconfigurable microscale systems by reducing reliance on experimental prototyping and accelerating discovery of new functional microrobots for use in biomedicine, materials engineering, and sustainability.",

However, it is often computationally hard, in that complexity grows exponentially with problem size. The big‐data era urgently demands low‐latency and low‐energy optimization at the edge, which cannot be handled by digital processors due to their non‐(parallel von Neumann architecture. Recent efforts using massively parallel hardware (e.g., memristor crossbars and quantum processors) employing annealing algorithms, while promising, have handled relatively easy and stable problems with sparse or binary representations, such as the max‐cut or traveling salesman problems. However, most real‐world applications embody three features, which are encoded in the knapsack problem, and cannot be handled by annealing algorithms—dense and nonbinary representations, with destabilizing self‐feedback. Herein, a post‐digital‐hardware‐friendly randomized competitive Ising‐inspired (RaCI) algorithm performing knapsack optimization, experimentally implemented on a foundry‐manufactured complementary metal‐oxide‐semiconductor‐integrated probabilistic analog memristor crossbar, is demonstrated.

However, OCT images inevitably exhibit speckle noise, which results from coherent interference of light backscattered caused by single or multiple scatterers. This challenge would substantially degrade image quality and obscure morphological structures, complicating the interpretation process and deteriorating diagnosis accuracy. Herein, a novel self‐supervised end‐to‐end framework is proposed for OCT image despeckling, without access to unpaired noisy–clean images or paired noisy–noisy images for training. A frame interpolation module is integrated in order to enhance the denoising performance, thus fully leveraging the highly correlated structural information from the adjacent A ‐scans. Experiments are performed on 150 subjects from five retina datasets (121 subjects) and one middle ear dataset (29 subjects). Results from the datasets demonstrate the framework's superior speckle reduction performance as compared with the state‐of‐the‐art algorithms, in terms of visual evaluation and quantitative metrics. Validation on both retina and middle ear scenarios convincingly shows the feasibility in speckle noise removal, while preserving tissue structural details.

However, existing convolutional neural network‐based or vision transformer‐based segmentation models often struggle to produce accurate masks when dealing with complex images.

Therefore, RefineCatDiff, a refinement framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion models to achieve high‐quality medical image segmentation, is proposed. In this framework, an initial‐stage model predicts a coarse mask, which is subsequently refined by a diffusion model to generate a more accurate and detailed mask. Specifically, a categorical distribution‐based discrete diffusion model is developed for refinement, which better aligns with the characteristics of segmentation tasks, thereby enhancing its effectiveness. Moreover, the coarse mask is incorporated as prior knowledge into the diffusion process to further improve efficiency. Additionally, the Prior Fusion Guidance Module, the Encoder Coupled Feature Fusion Module, and the Semantic Attention Conditional Module are integrated into the denoising network to enhance guidance of the diffusion process. Extensive experiments on the BTCV, BraTS‐2020, and ISIC‐2018 datasets demonstrate that RefineCatDiff outperforms several state‐of‐the‐art models in segmentation performance and is highly compatible with various initial‐stage models.",

However, traditional memristive neural networks (MNNs) are incapable of independently determining high‐precision target weight and bias updates without relying on off‐chip intelligent machines, rendering the completion of the training process entirely on‐chip unattainable. Consequently, the critical challenge of achieving fully on‐chip learning remains to be addressed urgently. To address this bottleneck, this study introduces a novel MNN paradigm that facilitates fully on‐chip learning. Critically, this neuromorphic system adopts an operational mechanism derived from biological principles—contrastive Hebbian learning. This allows fully on‐chip learning using only voltage differences between pre and postsynaptic neurons and basic multiplications. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that the MNN achieves an accuracy (ACC) exceeding 98% in a pattern recognition task, and generalization error rates remain below 10% across all categories. This memristive neural system also exhibits ultralow power consumption, averaging 0.321 nJ per input image on a device, while maintaining over 80% accuracy within the conductance perturbations of ±1 μS, which reflects the adaptive restoring capability of these memristive neurons.

However, conventional AI‐based perception systems face challenges in irregular conditions such as poor visibility, occlusions, or adverse weather conditions, which can lead to incomplete or degraded information from sensors reaching the central computing/navigation system. This severely impacts perception accuracy, potentially compromising vehicle, and pedestrian safety.

The proposed circuit dynamically reinforces patterns, allowing the system to retain decision‐making capabilities even when certain sensors fail or provide incomplete data. The fault tolerance of the circuit is validated through error analysis, proving that accurate outputs are generated even with missing sensor inputs. The system demonstrates an average error of 6.98% across 10 critical driving scenarios, with a power consumption of ≈152 mW per scenario, confirming its robustness, energy efficiency and adaptability in case of sensor failures and under‐performance.

    "abstract": "Sperm motility, a critical factor in diagnosing male infertility, requires computer‐based solutions due to the limitations of manual evaluation methods. This study introduces the Hi‐LabSpermTracking dataset, comprising 66 videos (60 s each, 10 fps) collected from 14 patients and meticulously annotated by experts. Unlike similar datasets, these uninterrupted, long‐duration videos enable continuous tracking of individual sperm cells, each assigned a unique ID throughout the video, supporting both sperm detection and tracking tasks. Experimental evaluations employ you only look once v8 (YOLOv8), real‐time detection transformer, and simple online and realtime tracking with a deep association metric across three scenarios. In Scenario I (sperm detection), the YOLOv8n model achieves 98.9% mAP50 and 97.9% F1‐score. In Scenario II (sperm tracking), performance metrics include 83.88% mAP50, 87.63% F1‐score, 72.27% higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA), and 77.88% multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). Scenario III simulates real‐world challenges by separating training and testing videos. Ensemble methods are applied, with the proposed mean ensemble achieving superior results: 86.55% mAP50, 87.87% F1‐score, 66.66% HOTA, and 76.42% MOTA. The Hi‐LabSpermTracking dataset enables robust sperm tracking research, while the mean ensemble method amplifies accuracy by uniting model strengths.",

    "abstract": "The high reliance on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) knowledge and practical skills has led to prolonged training cycles for therapists and a significant talent shortage, posing a severe challenge to the standardization of TCM physiotherapy in rehabilitation. Meanwhile, most physiotherapy robots based on rigid robotics technology suffer from insufficient safety and adaptability, resulting in unsatisfactory treatment effects. This paper presents a novel wearable pneumatic soft physiotherapy device, designed to achieve high‐safety and personalized physiotherapy for shoulder and neck acupoint massage. The device integrates four soft massage actuators, four embedded thin‐film stress sensors, two miniature airflow sources, and a power supply system, enhancing its portability. Additionally, a hybrid control strategy combining feedforward inverse compensation and PID feedback is proposed to regulate and customize the therapy intensity on human acupoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed device can apply therapeutic intensities ranging from 0 to 3.45 N to human acupoints, effectively adapting to the human shoulder and neck region to achieve good wearing comfort, and performing safe acupoint massage with customized physiotherapy intensities. This study explores and realizes the integration of emerging soft robotics technology with TCM, providing a paradigm for the development of more soft physiotherapy devices.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation can lead to secretion retention in airways, which increases the risk of airway obstruction and lung infections. Clearing secretions in time is essential to guarantee ventilation effectiveness and patients’ safety. However, manual and scheduled auscultations, widely adopted in clinical practices, can hardly continuously recognize the extent of secretion retentions to determine an optimal timing of secretion suction, which also place a burden on clinicians. Herein, an autonomous recognition model of secretion retention is proposed based on a ResNet‐34 convolutional neural network to perform triple classifications, which represent three levels of secretion retention, namely no secretions, secretions appear, and secretions retained. Respiratory sounds in central airways are continuously recorded and fed into the model in the form of Mel spectrograms. Experimental results demonstrate that the model can continuously monitor the breathing sounds and autonomously recognize different extent of secretion retentions in real time with overall accuracy of 89.08%. An edge computing module to integrate the recognition model into ventilators with limited computing power is also developed and approved, which indicates its potential clinical applications. The proposed autonomous recognition model facilitates clinicians to optimize secretion‐suction schedules to guarantee the ventilation effectiveness and patients’ safety.",

Our extensive experiments with six evaluation metrics reveal that medical LVLMs, despite promising performance on standard medical tasks, are particularly susceptible to hallucinations-often more so than general models. This raises significant concerns about domain-specific model reliability. For real-world applications, medical LVLMs must accurately integrate medical knowledge while maintaining robust reasoning to prevent hallucination. We explore mitigation methods without model-specific fine-tuning, including prompt engineering and collaboration between general and domain-specific models.

Based on the principle of virtual work, the relationship between the output torque and the bending angle is established and experimentally verified. Test results indicate that the MFPMU can attain a maximum output torque of 240 mN m. The bending angle of the bending segment can achieve 62° under 10 kPa.

Additionally, their nonembedded solid structures limit application potential. In this study, inspired by origami structures, a cable‐driven continuum robot featuring dual bending‐contraction DOF is developed. Then, kinematic analysis to predict deformation at different cable contraction and joint parameters is conducted. Based on the kinematic characteristics of the robot, a continuum robot with five joint modules is fabricated to demonstrate its contraction and bending capabilities under no‐load and loaded states. This continuum robot can reach a maximum contraction of 33.87% and a bending angle of 95.71°. By increasing the number of joints in the continuum robot, grippers with different numbers of fingers can be made for grasping objects of various shapes. Additionally, based on the embedded characteristics of the robot's cable‐supported structure, a wrist rehabilitation orthosis with two joint modules is designed. This orthosis supports personalized customization, and has two rehabilitation movement modes, that is, flexion‐extension (76.45° curvature) and radial‐ulnar deviation (53.66° curvature). The performance and application experiments demonstrate the robot's structural conformality and potential for application in different interaction scenarios, and provide the practical guidance for cable‐driven continuum robotic applications.",

In particular, injection molding enables rapid and cost‐effective production, making it well‐suited for mass production. Thus, rapid and precise measurement is essential for inspecting the quality of all injection‐molded products. However, complex 3D geometry and easily deformable property of axial fan hinder rapid and accurate measurement, thereby reducing quality control efficiency. This study introduces a convolutional neural network‐based vision inspection system that can enhance the productivity and quality of injection‐molded products by overcoming the limitations of traditional physical measurement methods. Consequently, the proposed model shows high performance (R‐squared = ≈0.9987) for predicting both edge heights. Compared to a conventional manual measurement method, the proposed model reduces the measurement time per blade by ≈99%, and the total inspection time by ≈93.61%. Moreover, by utilizing explainable artificial intelligence, key features for prediction are identified, providing insight into why the model is capable of robust and precise measurements even in the presence of noise. The developed vision‐based deflection measurement system is expected to contribute significantly to the automation of quality control of axial fans to realize the future smart injection‐molding plants.",

As connectionist AI has caused a paradigm shift in diverse fields and its applications are being extended to high‐stakes domains, its opacity has become a growing concern, giving rise to a rethinking of the need for integrating symbolic logical reasoning with neural networks, i.e., neuro‐symbolic computing. However, the very different mathematical nature of logical reasoning and neural networks, i.e., localist and distributed representations, respectively, has impeded their fusion, which has been exacerbated by the lack of suitable hardware. Here, reservoir computing (RC), a typical connectionist model, is experimentally demonstrated to be implemented symbolically within memristor crossbar arrays (MXAs) as a discrete‐time 1D rule‐based cellular automata (CA). CA‐based RC (CARC) within the MXAs achieves up to 86.5% and 100% accuracy in the image recognition task and 20‐bit memory task, respectively. Because of hyperdimensionality, CARC requires fewer training samples and is more robust against errors in the emerging MXA hardware. This work expands the functionality of MXAs for AI applications.",

This study addresses this limitation by developing a novel class of soft EM actuators composed of a silicone matrix with fully embedded copper coils and small magnets, eliminating the need for external magnets. This fully integrated architecture, enabled by additive manufacturing, ensures operation in unstructured environments, as functional elements are monolithically integrated within the actuator.

    "abstract": "Wave‐based mechanisms inspired by traveling wave locomotion in animals have shown great potential use in robots to navigate unstructured environments. Herein, the dual actuator wave‐like navigator (DAWN), a multisurface robot employing two actuated helical wave generators to produce continuous traveling waves on flexible link tracks enclosed in elastomer skins, is presented. These skins provide mechanical resilience, enhanced friction, and adaptability on uneven terrain. The robot demonstrates steering and controlled locomotion on flat surfaces, inclines, and declines. To characterize the robot, locomotion tests are performed on plywood, PMMA, and sand, achieving average linear speeds of 16.00, 15.76, and 1.63 mm s −1 , respectively. A key innovation is cyclic pneumatic actuation of the skins with actuation frequencies of 0.5 and 0.9 Hz, improving locomotion performance on sand to 2.22 and 2.70 mm s −1 . DAWN's capability to move on sand, grass, gravel, and wet soil is also demonstrated. Its modular design enables plug‐and‐play assembly of components including helical wave generators, flexible link tracks, and elastomer skins, allowing for easy maintenance, modification, and replacements. Potential applications include navigation in complex terrains for search and rescue, inspection, and environmental monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical resilience is crucial for both animals and machines. Repairing or replacing damaged components of machines is often costly and time‐consuming. Many walking insects, especially species that autotomize legs as a predator‐avoidance strategy, exhibit remarkable adaptive control of their leg movement dynamics to compensate for leg loss. The embodied adaptation of leg control in insects can be informative for robotics to develop control strategies for damage compensation. From this point, the study utilizes the stick insect Medauroidea extradentata as a model organism to investigate the effects of leg amputation on the compensatory control of walking behavior. A decentralized adaptive resilient neural control system is proposed, leveraging self‐embodied resilience strategies, for legged robots. Unlike model‐based or machine learning‐based approaches, relying on accurate mathematical models or extensive training data, the neural control system achieves self‐organized gait patterns and adaptive leg movements through minimal sensory feedback, coupled with neural dynamics, synaptic plasticity, and robot‐environment interactions. This embodied neural control approach is validated and demonstrated on simulated and real insect robots, resulting in robust locomotion and rapid adaptation (within seconds) to various leg loss cases. The combined findings reveal the potential for insect‐inspired embodied emergent resilience in complex robotic systems toward resilient robotics.",

    "abstract": "The treatment plan for brain tumors varies depending on the type and stage of the tumor. Early diagnosis plays a vital role in determining appropriate treatment. In addition to clinical routines, artificial intelligence‐based systems that produce automated, quantitative, and objective results can assist clinicians and scientists in making early diagnoses. For this motivation, this study proposes a deep learning‐based system that classifies brain tumors obtained by magnetic resonance imaging. In the proposed approach, several wavelet transform approaches are applied to the raw dataset images. Thus, in addition to automated feature extraction in deep learning, it aimed to detect more detailed features. Therefore, four types of datasets have been obtained. Then, using the transfer learning approach, some popular convolutional neural network and vision transformer models are trained separately with the four‐type datasets, and the test results are compared. The networks that produced the highest results are used to make the final decision with the ensemble technique. In the first analysis, the best performance was obtained using original data with an 83.50% accuracy value, and the second highest performance is obtained 81.72% accuracy value using the Daubhecies wavelet before deep learning. The third and fourth high performances are 81.47% and 81.22% accuracy, respectively, using original data. In the ensemble analysis, the highest result is achieved at 85.03% accuracy value using the bagging‐ensemble approach of the networks, namely MobileNet‐v3, vision transformer, ResNeXt, and DenseNet‐201. This study demonstrates that using a hybrid wavelet transform and deep learning approach improves classification performance. This may inspire the use of the same method to solve different classification problems.",

Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, the feasibility of projecting quantitative metrics from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy is investigated. Generative models are also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin‐film MoS 2 .

However, the modeling of inverse kinematics remains challenging because of its inherent nonlinearities and various external conditions. This work proposes an online learning control framework with a data cache pool utilizing a constant‐curvature model inspired neural network (CCMINN) model to obtain the inverse kinematics model of tendon‐actuated continuum manipulators. The CCMINN model is a kind of geometric relationships‐inspired neural network, which is inspired by the geometric relationships within the constant‐curvature model. This model improves the ability of traditional fully connected neural network models on high convergence speed and precision through its constant‐curvature inspiration layers. These layers embed geometry insights into the neural network structure rather than loss functions like physics‐informed neural networks. The online learning framework enables CCMINN to maintain high control accuracy in a variety of external load scenarios. Experiments show average tracking errors of 1.4 mm, 1.38 mm, and 1.48 mm (0.7%, 0.64%, and 0.74% of the continuum manipulator length) in the free space, under constant and variable loading conditions, respectively. The results show that combining the fast‐converging CCMINN with an online learning control framework enables high‐precision and robust positioning control of continuum manipulators under various external payloads.",

Recently, there has been much progress in realistically modeling crowds in complex environments, based on social force models, cellular automata, and machine learning. However, current models assume specific social interactions and do not allow to systematically explore how to optimize crowd cooperation and evacuation. In contrast, the present work focuses on the question, how an ideal crowd of superintelligent agents, comprising humans, robots, or smart active particles, would cooperate to optimize evacuation. A method is developed that uses multiagent reinforcement learning combined with self‐play to learn optimal crowd behavior from scratch. Crucially, the agents in this approach are pressure‐aware and autonomously learn collision and crushing avoidance. After training, they adopt interpretable evacuation strategies like queuing and zipper merging and outperform traditional evacuation models in terms of fatality avoidance and evacuation rate. Our method can be used to enhance guidelines for mass evacuation, potentially saving lives.",

To enhance accuracy and address dataset imbalance during training, data augmentation techniques are employed, including random trajectory rotation and Gaussian noise into the radar cross‐section, as well as introducing a custom loss function and dynamic learning rate (LR) to enhance early‐stage prediction and accelerate learning. Employing these strategies, the proposed MTI AI model achieves a 94.4% accuracy at 3.2 s in identifying Non class, while average accuracy for five classes is 94.4% at 12.8 s. The model exhibits ≈43.6% greater accuracy at 3.2 s than that of the conventional model, and the estimated false‐negative rate can be kept less than 2.5%.

Prior studies have evaluated the relationship between process parameters and as‐built surface roughness, but they rely on forward models using trial‐and‐error, regression, and data‐driven methods based only on areal surface roughness parameters that neglect spatial surface characteristics. In contrast, this study introduces, for the first time, an inverse data‐centric framework that leverages machine learning algorithms and an experimental dataset of Inconel 718 as‐built surfaces to predict the PBF‐LB process parameters required to achieve a desired as‐built roughness. This inverse model shows a prediction accuracy of ≈80%, compared to 90% for the corresponding forward model. Additionally, it incorporates deterministic surface roughness parameters, which capture both height and spatial information, and significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to only using areal parameters. The inverse model provides a digital tool to process engineers that enables control of surface roughness by tailoring process parameters. Hence, it establishes a foundation for integrating surface roughness control into the digital thread of AM, thereby reducing the need for post‐processing and improving process efficiency.",

However, most sensors can capture only 1D MD features, and are suitable only for on‐land scenarios, leading to the under evaluation and under exploitation of MD sensing. This article develops a 4 × 4 soft magnetic sensor array (SMSA) to capture 3D MD distribution. Compared to solid structures, the used porous elastomer mitigates hydraulic pressure disturbances by half within 0–100‐m water depth, while sensitivity increases by 10 times. The SMSA has consistent amphibious measurements and about 200 ms faster response than inertial measurement units (IMUs). Mapping between 3D magnetic flux densities and deformations of elastomers is justified by calibration errors within 1% of full ranges. Experiments justify the proposed method in multiple environments, muscles, motions, and subjects. Average gait classification accuracy is 98.73%, and phase estimation error is 2.85% when using only one SMSA, which is better than existing commercial sensors (with 82.40% and 10.39% for one IMU, and 89.06% and 6.33% for one flexible resistive sensor array).

Mimicking remora fish, the design incorporates liquid metal microchannel sensors arranged at 90° intervals to monitor lip deformation, enabling real‐time assessment of adhesion state and force distribution. The optimized suction cup morphology improves deformation sensitivity, while the integrated sensor system operates effectively in both aquatic and aerial environments.

    "abstract": "Active composite (AC) plates, composed of active and passive materials, can undergo complex shape transformations when stimulated. Leveraging 4D printing—which combines additive manufacturing with stimuli‐responsive materials—digitally encoded design patterns offer flexibility in shape morphing. However, performing inverse design, i.e., determining the pattern to achieve a desired shape, remains challenging due to the vast design space. Recently, machine learning (ML) has been applied to inverse design tasks with promising results. Nevertheless, these approaches require large datasets, and even then, inverse design remains difficult, often demanding multiple strategies and trials to obtain optimal results. To address these challenges, this work introduces an iterative data curation strategy combined with transfer learning. This method ensures that newly curated data is nonredundant and distinct from existing datasets, reducing the required training data by a factor of eight while maintaining performance. Additionally, ML models are integrated with a genetic algorithm (ML‐GA) to further fine‐tune the generated design patterns. The results show that ML‐GA enhances accuracy in achieving the desired shape while reducing computational effort. This framework offers an efficient and scalable approach for inverse design, reducing data needs and improving performance, making it a valuable tool for AC plate design and 4D printing.",

The proposed 3‐T embedded NOR flash demonstrates highly reliable operations: only 1.36% memory window degradation and 4.7% subthreshold swing degradation after 10 7 program/erase (P/E) cycles. Moreover, its near‐zero linearity LTP/LTD operations deliver a high classification accuracy of 92% on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) datasets.

    "abstract": "Plastic pollution in water bodies threatens and disrupts aquatic life, requiring effective cleanup solutions. This paper proposes a strategy for plastic cleanup using a fleet of autonomous surface vehicles in a multitask scenario, with a focus on both exploration and cleaning tasks. The mission is decoupled into two phases: an exploration phase for locating trash and a cleaning phase for collection. A Multitask Deep Q‐Network with two heads estimates Q ‐values for each task, and all ASVs share the same policy through an egocentric state formulation to enhance scalability. A multiobjective learning approach is applied, resulting in distinct policies that balance the duration of the exploration and cleaning phases, leading to the construction of a Pareto front, which provides a visual representation of trade‐offs between task priorities. The framework adapts to various environmental conditions, demonstrated in both the larger Malaga Port and the smaller Alamillo Lake. The study also highlights the importance of a dedicated exploration phase for larger areas, while minimal exploration is sufficient for smaller spaces. Compared to the decomposition weighting sum strategy, the approach consistently produces superior Pareto‐optimal policies, ensuring broader and more effective exploration of the objective space.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores trajectory planning for robotic arms in 3D operational spaces. To improve the adaptation to dynamic via‐points in complex, confined environments, an enhanced dynamic movement primitives (DMP) approach is proposed and designed for dynamic planning under composite steering force field constraints. By incorporating steering attraction forces, this method enhances the generalization capability of DMP, allowing the robotic arm to navigate through dynamic via‐points flexibly without altering the start and end positions. The trajectory shape is adjusted via regression attraction forces, which helps preserve the demonstrated trajectory, reduce free‐space loss, and improve the system's adaptability to complex, dynamic environments. The convergence of the target state is rigorously proven using Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted with the Franka robotic arm validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that in dynamic environments with multiple via‐points, this method produces reliable trajectories for robotic arm movements, significantly enhancing the adaptation of DMP to dynamic contexts. The planning process requires no additional learning, and the generated trajectory closely resembles the original demonstrated path. This method enables effective via‐point operations in confined spaces without requiring additional learning, while maintaining existing skills.",

    "abstract": "Microfluidics has enabled numerous applications in, for example, analytical chemistry, medical diagnostics, microelectronics, and soft robotics. In most of these applications, the geometries of the microchannels are of fixed dimensions that (ideally) remain invariant during operation. In soft robotics, however, the geometries of the microchannels contained in soft actuation systems are inherently dynamic, and the specific dimensions are expected to change during operation, and, by extension, the fluid transport properties of the system are variable. If this characteristic is not properly considered, or if methods are not developed to control it, the progress of soft robotic devices with distributed fluid transport systems can be hampered. Herein, the deformation of soft microchannel networks is investigated using a finite‐element method and experimental observations, and the understandings are applied to imbibe sensing capabilities in soft robots that have integrated microfluidic networks with dynamic channel geometries of predictable dimensions. This approach enables the fabrication of soft fluid transport systems with deterministic deformation characteristics—a capability that is specifically applied to touch and actuation sensing in soft actuators. This work provides insight into the channel deformation processes expected in soft robotic systems with embedded networks of microchannels, enabling devices with reliable/predictable transport properties.",

Researchers have proposed numerous swimming methods utilizing various actuation principles. Herein, the different propulsion methods of MRs are evaluated by analyzing their scalability. Comparing various actuators, how their performance changes with size reduction is evaluated. The swimming of natural flagellar swimmers such as spermatozoa and nematodes is analyzed. It is found that although the fluidic regime and the geometry of these organisms change considerably, there are nondimensional features that remain almost constant; most importantly, the variation of the swimming velocity is much smaller than the variation of the Reynolds number in natural swimmers. Then, several methods of propulsion and actuation principles are compared, and it is found that among the swimming methods examined, the downscaling of a piezoelectrically driven vibrating elastic beam is the most favorable. Similar to natural swimmers, the swimming velocity of a piezoelectric active swimming tail does not depend on the geometry given that its power requirements can be met. This comparative approach tool aids in the development of future actuation methods for MRs and other active microsystems.",

Researchers have devoted considerable efforts to exploring the utility of DNA nanotechnology in a variety of fields, with the majority related to harvesting their assembling power, since they are highly capable of guiding the assembly of other entities—molecules, materials, living cells, and so on—to fabricate artificial assemblies with emergent properties and functions. Herein, a brief introduction is given to self‐assembly methods in DNA nanotechnology, including DNA tiles, modular DNA bricks, and DNA origami. Four sections are then dedicated to covering the utilization of DNA nanotechnology for guided assembly of organic materials, inorganic materials, biological materials, and living cells. Lastly, DNA‐enabled molecular intelligent systems that are able to compute and execute algorithms are discussed.",

By exploiting the in‐memory boolean exclusive OR (XOR) operation of single CRS devices, the Hamming Distance (HD) can be calculated if the center electrodes of multiple CRS cells are connected. This HD is linearly encoded in the voltage drop of the common electrode, and from it the result of a binary multiply‐accumulate operation can be calculated. A small‐scale demonstration is experimentally realized and the feasibility of the in‐memory computation concept is confirmed. A simulation study identifies the low resistance state (LRS) variability as the main reason for the variations in the output voltage. The application as a potential hardware accelerator for the inference step of binary neural networks is investigated. Therefore, a 1‐layer fully connected neural network is trained on a binarized version of the MNIST data set and the inference step of the test data set is simulated.

A considerable amount of research is conducted to develop materials in which layered neural networks are easily implemented. Herein, the use of high‐quality semiconducting single‐walled carbon nanotube (s‐SWCNT) inks to fabricate artificial synapses using simple bottom‐gate field‐effect transistors (FETs) is reported. The synapse utilizes the otherwise often dreaded hysteresis, the characteristic of the device structure, and the materials used therein. This hysteresis spans several orders of magnitude. The SWCNT synaptic transistor exhibits a clear spike‐time‐dependent plasticity (STDP), indicating the ability to achieve learning, following a mechanism similar to biological systems: asymmetric anti‐Hebbian learning. The very well‐defined STDP shape, together with the use of a simple pulse shape to obtain it, has not been reported previously for synaptic transistors. This represents a crucial step for further development of actual hardware implementation of artificial synapses in a more extensive, layered network. Interestingly, the time response of the device is very similar to the one of biological synapse, opening opportunities unavailable to CMOS emulations.",

The electrohydraulic actuator powered by induced interfacial charge (EPIC) uses the amplified electrostatic force when the surface charge‐inducing phenomenon of the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel and the geometrical gradient of the actuator are combined to reinforce the zipping motion of the liquid layer. This actuator produces a more than 50‐fold higher blocking force than conventional dielectric liquid‐coupled electrostatic actuators at 2 kV. This implies the possibility of expanding the applicability of soft actuators to high‐power transducers. This actuator is modeled as parallel capacitors by considering the interfacial‐induced charge; the ratio of the dielectric constant of the polymer film to that of the dielectric liquid is analyzed as the principal design criterion for optimizing the performance characteristics. The actuator prototype exerts a force as high as 16 times its body weight (25.5 g) and exhibits a large normal displacement of more than 20% of its height (8.5 mm). Furthermore, four actuators can lift a weight of 1.25 kg and one actuator can be used as a large‐aperture (diameter: 30 mm) varifocal lens (374% focal length variation).",

However, it remains significantly difficult to mimic all the functionalities of human skin.

At the same time, their usage poses new challenges, related to the adoption of classical sensing techniques originally developed for rigid end defectors, which provide fundamental information, such as to detect object slippage. Under this regard, model‐based approaches for the processing of the gathered information are hard to use, due to the difficulties in modeling hand–object interaction when softness is involved. To overcome these limitations, in this article, we proposed to combine distributed tactile sensing and machine learning (recurrent neural network) to detect sliding conditions for a soft robotic hand mounted on a robotic manipulator, targeting the prediction of the grasp failure event and the direction of sliding. The outcomes of these predictions allow for an online triggering of a compensatory action performed with a second robotic arm–hand system, to prevent the failure.

    "abstract": "Similarity measures play an important role in many data analysis fields. However, the current cell similarity measures are poor used in data characteristics. Herein, a novel similarity measure named segment weighting similarity (SWS) is developed for the analysis of single‐cell Raman spectra. SWS segments the spectra by the cell biological characteristics and quantifies the significant factors per region, which can increase the contribution of intrinsic biological features and reduce noise. The similarity heat maps of SWS and three other kinds of traditional similarities, including cosine similarity, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Euclidean distance, show that SWS has high accuracy and low bias in distinguishing cell spectra. K‐nearest‐neighbor classifiers have the identification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.852, 0.853, and 0.965, respectively. The purity of the clustering model could increase by 0.31 in some tasks of the K‐means and spectral clustering. The classification and clustering results demonstrate that SWS is more effective than common ones. SWS, based on the basic data and intrinsic biological characteristics, provides a new thought and formula in the similarity measure for most of the Raman and infrared technologies, and has great potential for enhancing the performance of machine learning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Capsule networks promise significant benefits over convolutional neural networks (CNN) by storing stronger internal representations and routing information based on the agreement between intermediate representations’ projections. Despite this, their success has been limited to small‐scale classification datasets due to their computationally expensive nature. Though memory‐efficient, convolutional capsules impose geometric constraints that fundamentally limit the ability of capsules to model the pose/deformation of objects. Further, they do not address the bigger memory concern of class capsules scaling up to bigger tasks such as detection or large‐scale classification. Herein, a new family of capsule networks, deformable capsules ( DeformCaps ), is introduced to address object detection problem in computer vision. Two new algorithms associated with our DeformCaps , a novel capsule structure ( SplitCaps ), and a novel dynamic routing algorithm ( SE‐Routing ), which balance computational efficiency with the need for modeling a large number of objects and classes, are proposed. This has never been achieved with capsule networks before. The proposed methods efficiently scale up to create the first‐ever capsule network for object detection in the literature. The proposed architecture is a one‐stage detection framework and it obtains results on microsoft common objects in context which are on par with state‐of‐the‐art one‐stage CNN‐based methods, while producing fewer false‐positive detection, generalizing to unusual poses/viewpoints of objects.",

An eight‐neighborhood‐based method for increasing the localization accuracy of guidewire endpoint to improve the safety of interventional procedures is proposed herein. The proposed method includes two stages: 1) An improved U‐Net network is employed for segmenting the data of the guidewire to extract regions of interest containing guidewire endpoints with higher precision and to reduce interference from other anatomical structures and imaging artifacts. 2) The proposed method detects guidewire endpoints using the adjacent relationship between pixels in the eight‐neighborhood regions. This stage covers skeletonization extraction, removal of bifurcation points, and repair of fracture points. This study achieves mean pixel errors of 2.02 and 2.13 pixels in an in vivo rabbit and porcine X‐ray fluoroscopy images, outperforming ten classic heatmap and regression methods, achieving state‐of‐the‐art detection results. The proposed method can also be applied to detect other tiny surgical instruments such as stents and balloons, while preserving the flexibility of the guidewire bending angle.",

Initially, the scribing is performed by varying different laser parameters and further evaluate them via an optical microscope and two probe resistivity measurements. The corresponding scribing width and sheet resistance data are used as input databases for ML analysis. The classification and regression tree (CART)‐based ML analysis revealed that median pulse energy &lt;5.7 μJ insufficient to separate the adjacent scribing regions. While pulse energy &gt;5.7 μJ, APL &gt; 35%, LSO &gt; 46%, and processing speed ≥1250 mm s −1 gives ≥16 μm of scribing width. Further, the decision tree (DT) analysis showed that pulse energy of ≥8.1 μJ, and LSO ≥ 37% are required for electrically isolated lines. The feature importance score suggests that laser fluence and pulse energy determined the scribing width, whereas electrical isolation strongly depends on LSO and processing speed. Finally, the ML achieved conditions experimentally validated and reassessed via scanning electron microscope, and atomic force microscopy aligns well with optical microscope measurements.",

These mechanisms range from adapting their movements to move through the environment to the ability to chase prey, all thanks to senses such as sight, hearing, and touch. Neuromorphic engineering is inspired by brain problem‐solving techniques with the goal of implementing models that take advantage of the characteristics of biological neural systems. While this is a well‐defined and explored area in this field, there is no previous work that fuses analog and neuromorphic sensors to control and modify robotic behavior in real time. Herein, a system is presented based on spiking neural networks implemented on the SpiNNaker hardware platform that receives information from both analog (force‐sensing resistor) and digital (neuromorphic retina) sensors and is able to adapt the speed and orientation of a hexapod robot depending on the stability of the terrain where it is located and the position of the target. These sensors are used to modify the behavior of different spiking central pattern generators, which in turn will adapt the speed and orientation of the robotic platform, all in real time. In particular, experiments show that the network is capable of correctly adapting to the stimuli received from the sensors, modifying the speed and heading of the robotic platform.",

Inspired by this concept, active whisker sensors measure various physical and geometric properties through contact with objects. However, previous research has focused on measuring the object geometry, often overlooking the potential for broader applications of the sensors. Herein, an active whisker sensor that enables simple measurement of the surface properties such as surface hardness and adhesiveness is reported. Composed of motor‐, wire‐, and crack‐based mechanosensor, the active whisker sensor implements a tapping process inspired by the movement of a rat's whiskers to quickly evaluate the object surface. One area of potential application is the food industry. The active whisker sensors offer a new approach to measuring surface properties of viscoelastic and inelastic food that are difficult to measure with traditional bulky systems. Herein, it is validated that the tapping process can be used to measure the surface properties of a various foods. With the aid of machine learning algorithms, sensor can also recognize differences in the surface properties of bananas at different ripeness stages and classify them with 99% accuracy. In this report, the possibilities for applications of active whisker sensors, including food industry, robotics, and medical devices, are opened up.",

Due to the intrinsic compliance of soft robotics for biomimicking purposes and the volume‐regulation capability of the 3D origami patterns, the soft robots with origami patterns show promising potential in such research. However, the folding deformation of the origami facets cannot be straightforwardly implemented as the actuation or the body movement, and the predetermined movements of the pattern limit the appropriate functions for specific applications. In this work, an origami‐patterned rigidification (OPR) method is proposed for applying rigid origami mechanisms (herein, the cuboctahedron origami ball) to the chamber‐like structure of soft robots. The motion of the soft robot is programmed by purposefully rigidified the soft chamber following the pattern. The resultant OPR structures are granted with functions corresponding to the predetermined motion of the pattern, and the expanded movements through the bifurcation brought by the soft–rigid characteristics. The concept, design, and fabrication of the OPR robot are presented. By analyzing the deformation of the soft creases, the kinematic models of the predetermined and expanded degrees of freedom are presented and verified by experiments. The extended functions of two OPR robots are demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence for graph‐structured data has achieved remarkable success in applications such as recommendation systems, social networks, drug discovery, and circuit annotation. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are an effective way to learn representations of various graphs. The increasing size and complexity of graphs call for in‐memory computing (IMC) accelerators for GCN to alleviate massive data transmission between off‐chip memory and processing units. However, GCN implementation with IMC is challenging because of the large memory consumption, irregular memory access, and device nonidealities. Herein, a fully binarized GCN (BGCN) accelerator based on computational resistive random‐access memory (RRAM) through software–hardware codesign is presented. The essential operations including aggregation and combination in GCN are implemented on the RRAM crossbar arrays with cooperation between multiply‐and‐accumulation and content‐addressable memory operations. By leveraging the model quantization and IMC on the RRAM, the BGCN accelerator demonstrates less RRAM usage, high robustness to the device variations, high energy efficiency, and comparable classification accuracy compared to the current state‐of‐the‐art GCN accelerators on both graph classification task using the MUTAG and PTC datasets and node classification task using the Cora and CiteSeer datasets. These results provide a promising approach for edge intelligent systems to efficiently process graph‐structured data.",

So far, the exploration of thick‐panel origami has been relatively limited, but it is worth noting that the incorporation of rigid thick panels can introduce unique mechanical properties, showcasing great potential in addressing manipulation challenges. Our previous work has developed a gripper from thick‐panel waterbomb origami, which can pick up a variety of daily objects. Based on the same prototype, this article extends the gripper's function from grasping to in‐hand manipulation, which is attributed to the kinematic bifurcations and compliance of thick‐panel origami. A kinematic study is carried out to investigate the gripper's bifurcated motion modes. The hinge compliance is also taken into account to enhance the gripper's motion dexterity. Theoretical analysis and experiments are conducted to demonstrate both features, thereby paving the foundation for achieving dexterous motions with a simplified control strategy. Aided by a differential mechanism, the gripper can effectively interact with objects with the actuation inputs from only two motors. Objects including balls, cuboids, and cones are explored for in‐hand manipulation under different motion modes, showing varied trajectories. With the integration of tactile sensors at the fingertips, we have also revealed the gripper's potential for classification tasks.",

A novel framework is proposed to address breaking down the complicated decision issues, which combines the strengths of graph convolutional networks in relation extraction with the ability of hierarchical reinforcement learning. To solve the problem of decision validity under high‐dimensional inputs, the joint framework is applied to the Maneuver Intent's decision, and a maneuver library‐based state space design method is suggested. The joint framework executes adaptable strategies and flight maneuvers to address the issue of training non‐convergence or task failure due to difficult‐to‐obtain reward signals across various scenarios. Then, the recurrent curriculum training and cross‐entropy rewards are designed to train decisions on different sub‐strategies. The experimental evaluation demonstrated more flexibility and adaptability in decision‐making problems under complex tasks compared to rule‐based and reinforcement learning baseline methods.

The core algorithm of this framework is improved from the classical MRL algorithm multi‐agent proximal policy optimization based on the idea of the virtual group instead of designing control rules. The trajectories planned by the framework show outstanding performance in improving throughputs and reducing emissions at the global system level, comparing natural driving, classic adaptive cruise control model and cooperative adaptive cruise control model.

However, existing methods remain a challenge for automatically loading multiple single oocytes into different locations. Herein, a novel microfluidic chip on a robotic manipulator (chip‐on‐robot) with feedback control for flexible manipulation of multiple oocytes within a large spatial range is proposed. The manipulator automatically controls the microfluidic chip to reach different locations based on imaging feedback. The microfluidic chip then utilizes the hydrodynamic focusing effect of the main channel to separate oocytes for individual loading or reloading under capacitive sensor feedback. The separation distance reaches approximately 16 times the oocyte diameter. Moreover, capacitive signal feedback on the number of oocytes for flow direction control ensures the separation of all oocytes. For close‐loop control of the loading/reloading process, image‐based oocyte detection is combined using deep learning to calculate the target position of the oocyte. Finally, an automatic sequence is achieved to load multiple single oocytes into a well chip by using the chip‐on‐robot. As a demonstration, the oocytes are reloaded into a specified location based on the conditions. The proposed chip‐on‐robot with feedback control has significant advantages in the micromanipulation of oocytes.",

At present, the variable‐stiffness design of robotic fish still suffers from structural complexity, severe deformation, and small variation range, which limits the application of variable‐stiffness theory in robotic fish. In this article, a variable‐stiffness tail is designed based on layer‐jamming for robotic fish, which can conveniently achieve online stiffness adjustment while maintaining the optimal stiffness distribution and the shape is unaffected. A modeling method for the tail is proposed by combining the mechanical characteristics of the layer‐jamming structure with the pseudo‐rigid body model. To validate the performance of the tail, a series of experiments are conducted, which show that the stiffness variation range of the tail is around 10 times, and the accuracy of the model in predicting the kinematics of the tail is also verified. Moreover, the thrust tests demonstrate that stiffness adjustment is beneficial for fish swimming at different frequencies. The proposed variable‐stiffness tail will promote the development of efficient underwater biomimetic robots.",

This article presents a novel design of a new soft tactile sensor for a robotic gripper, incorporating a sandwich‐like multilayered structure, together with a deep learning (DL) model, which overcomes the limitations of traditional sensors. The structure consists of three distinct layers: a 15 wt% iron magnetorheological elastomer, a flexible printable circuit board layer equipped with three‐dimensional Hall sensors (TLE493D; Infineon), and permanent magnets. Additionally, a multilayer perceptron network that can classify the loading state is adopted for the DL model.

Implementing multidegree of freedom (MDOF) control is the key to developing motion strategies for advanced MW‐driven robots. However, the use of MWs for MDOF control of robots has so far remained a challenge. This article first presents examples of wireless driving and controlling millimeter‐scale peristaltic pipeline robots (diameter, 4 mm; length, 30 mm; weight, 0.39 g) utilizing multifrequency MWs in complex nonmetal channel environments. Herein, shape memory alloy springs combined with passive wires, whose length depends on the frequencies of MWs, are adopted to form selectively controlled robot components, and silicon rubber replica technology is utilized to achieve miniaturization of the robot. The monopole antenna model is developed for the actuator, and its structure is refined using antenna theory. This allows the successfully achievement of MDOF control of the robot at several MW frequencies (2.4, 4, and 5.9 GHz).

To partially reconstruct the shape, proprioceptive techniques use built‐in sensors, resulting in inaccurate results and increased fabrication complexity. Exteroceptive methods so far rely on expensive tracking systems with reflective markers placed on all components, which are infeasible for deformable robots interacting with the environment due to marker occlusion and damage. Here, a regression approach is presented for three‐dimensional key point estimation using a convolutional neural network. The proposed approach uses data‐driven supervised learning and is capable of online markerless estimation during inference. Two images of a robotic system are captured simultaneously at 25 Hz from different perspectives and fed to the network, which returns for each pair the parameterized key point or piecewise constant curvature shape representations. The proposed approach outperforms markerless state‐of‐the‐art methods by a maximum of 4.5% in estimation accuracy while being more robust and requiring no prior knowledge of the shape. Online evaluations on two types of soft robotic arms and a soft robotic fish demonstrate the method's accuracy and versatility on highly deformable systems.",

    "abstract": "In nature, gliding birds frequently execute intricate flight maneuvers such as aerial somersaults, perched landings, and swift descents, enabling them to navigate obstacles or hunt prey. It is evident that birds rely on different wing–tail configurations to accomplish a wide range of aerial maneuvers. For traditional fixed‐wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), pitch control primarily comes from the tail's elevators, while adjusting flight lift and drag involves deploying wing flaps. Although these designs ensure reliable flight, they compromise the drones’ maneuverability to maintain longitudinal stability. Therefore, the study introduces a biomimetic morphing wing UAV, and presents a pitch control strategy that simultaneously engages morphing wings, ailerons, and tail elevators. The pull‐up maneuver tests indicate that the proposed control method results in a pitch rate that is approximately 2.5 times greater than when using only the elevator control. A closed‐loop control system for the drone is also established. The closed‐loop flight experiment, which tracks a 45° pitch angle, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed coupled control method in adjusting the flight attitude. In addition, during cruising, the UAV employs three configurations, straight wing, forward‐swept wing, and back‐swept wing, to cater to different mission objectives and augment its flight capabilities.",

    "abstract": "As robotics and intelligence increasingly integrate into surgery, the pivotal role of human–robot interaction (HRI) in surgical procedures and outcomes becomes evident. However, debate rages over whether increasing robot autonomy will result in less human involvement. Some scholars assert that autonomy will reduce human participation, whereas others contend it will result in more complex interactions. To reveal the role of HRI in the evolution of autonomous surgery, this review systematically explores the HRI of robotic surgery with various levels of autonomy. The HRI is examined from both robotic science and clinical practice perspectives, incorporating relevant case studies. Two key components, intention detection and situation awareness, are especially concerned with a brief description of the interfaces and control strategies they rely on. Additional insights are drawn from analogous technologies in aviation, industrial robotics, and autonomous vehicles. The analysis suggests that HRI complexity tends to increase as the robot transitions from no autonomy to conditional autonomy and is predicted to subsequently decrease with a substantial shift in the interaction form when moving toward full autonomy. It is concluded by highlighting challenges from technical and clinical perspectives and delineating research trends in this rapidly evolving field.",

    "abstract": "Memristors play a pivotal role in advanced computing, with memristor‐based crossbar arrays showing promise for various artificial neural networks. Among these, HfO 2 ‐based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) stand out as ideal synaptic devices for neuromorphic computing. Their compatibility with the complementary metal oxide semiconductor process and intrinsic energy efficiency make them particularly appealing. While an increasing number of studies adopt identical pulse programming (IPP) with short width to update the conductance of HfO 2 ‐based FTJs synaptic devices, conventional ferroelectric switching models fall short in describing updates the conductance with the IPP scheme. Consequently, studies achieving conductance updates via IPP lack an underlying mechanism explanation, potentially limiting the application of HfO 2 ‐based FTJs as synaptic devices. This study explores the potential of ferroelectric Zr‐doped HfO 2 (HZO) FTJs to undergo learning through the IPP scheme. Synaptic characteristics, including the number of conductance states, symmetry, linearity, write energy, and latency by modulating IPP scheme conditions are optimized. Finally, the applicability of HZO FTJ as a synaptic device by assessing learning accuracy in pattern recognition through artificial neural network simulation based on the optimized synaptic characteristics is evaluated.",

In this study, a vision‐based approach is introduced to learning proprioceptive interactions by simultaneously reconstructing the shape and touch of a soft robotic metamaterial (SRM) during physical engagements. The SRM design is optimized to the size of a finger with enhanced adaptability in 3D interactions while incorporating a see‐through viewing field inside, which can be visually captured by a miniature camera underneath to provide a rich set of image features for touch digitization. Employing constrained geometric optimization, the proprioceptive process with aggregated multi‐handles is modeled. This approach facilitates real‐time, precise, and realistic estimations of the finger's mesh deformation within a virtual environment. Herein, a data‐driven learning model is also proposed to estimate touch positions, achieving reliable results with impressive R 2 scores of 0.9681, 0.9415, and 0.9541 along the x , y , and z axes. Furthermore, the robust performance of the proposed methods in touch‐based human–cybernetic interfaces and human–robot collaborative grasping is demonstrated.

Conventional cluster analyses typically use basic features derived from the chemical composition and crystal structure without considering target material properties such as the bandgap and dielectric constant. However, such approaches do not meet demands for grading materials according to properties of interest simultaneously with chemical and structural similarities. Herein, a clustering method grouping similar materials in terms of both the target properties and basic features is proposed. The clustering is compared considering the cohesive energy with that considering the bandgap of metal oxides, showing that their categorizations are clearly different. Further, several clusters classified by the bandgap are analyzed, and coordination environments related to each range of the bandgap are revealed. The clustering for the electronic static dielectric constant identifies a cluster involving several perovskite‐type oxides and balancing with the bandgap near the Pareto front. The method enables analyses with different viewpoints from those of the conventional clustering and feature importance analyses by taking the relationship between the target property and the basic features into account.",

NetDRm, an online dimensionality reduction method based on neural ensemble learning that integrates different dimension reduction methods in a synergistic way, is introduced. NetDRm is designed for datasets of multidimensional points that can be either structured (e.g., images) or unstructured (e.g., point clouds, tabular data). It starts by training a collection of deep residual encoders that learn the embeddings induced by multiple dimension reduction methods applied to the input dataset. Subsequently, a dense neural network integrates the generated encoders by emphasizing topological preservation or cluster induction. Experiments conducted on widely used multidimensional datasets (point‐cloud manifolds, image datasets, tabular record datasets) show that the proposed method yields better results in terms of topological preservation ( curves), cluster induction ( V measure), and classification accuracy than the most relevant dimension reduction methods.",

This work presents a methodology for the design and optimization of selection field generators operating with soft magnetic materials outside the linear regime in the context of MPI. Key elements are a mathematical model of magnetic field generators, a formalism for defining field sequences, and a relationship between power consumption and field sequence. These are used to define the design space of a field generator given its system requirements and constraints. The design process is then formulated as an optimization problem. Subsequently, this methodology is then utilized to design a new magnetic field generator specifically for cerebral imaging studies. The optimization result outperforms our existing MPI field generator in terms of power consumption and field of view size, providing a proof‐of‐concept for the entire methodology. As the approach is very general, it can be extended beyond the MPI context to other areas such as magnetic manipulation of medical devices and micro‐robotics.",

To investigate if artificial muscles can mimic the complete mechanical state spectrum of biological muscles, this study uses a novel method to characterize twisted coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) mechanically. Thus, comprehensive and reproducible test procedures are established to verify artificial muscle biomimetics regarding stress, strain, and strain rate combinations intrinsic to biological muscle. A rheometer performs novel high-precision mechanical characterization methods that comprehensively verify biomimetic performance. Sample twist level, torque, length, force, and temperature were controlled and measured during twist-induced coiling, heatsetting/annealing, and mechanical testing. TCPAs were formed from linear low-density polyethylene monofilament. LLDPE TCPAs generate larger stresses than biological muscle through the entire spectrum of strains - contracting more than 40%, exerting more than 0.3 MPa at rest length, and withstanding tension of 8 MPa without damage. Thus, the LLDPE TCPAs attained biological muscle performance statically, but additional tests are required to assess this dynamically. The mechanical performance of LLDPE TCPAs enables biomimetic actuation with an intelligent control and measurement system. Their high-throughput textile manufacturability positions them for advanced biomechatronic applications - including prosthetics and exoskeletons.",

However, most of the existing methods are single‐modal movement recognition, which has inherent limitations, such as limited feature representation and instability to noise, which will affect its practical performance. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel fusion approach that can integrate two biological signals, including electromyography (EMG) and bioelectrical impedance (BI). The fusion method combines EMG for capturing dynamic movement features and BI for discerning key postures representing discrete points within dynamic movements. In this method, the identification of key postures and their temporal sequences provide a guiding framework for the selection and weighted correction of probability prediction matrices in EMG‐based dynamic recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the method, six dynamic upper limb movements and nine key postures are defined, and a Universal Robot that can follow movements is employed for experimental validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of the dynamic movement reaches 96.2%, representing an improvement of nearly 10% compared with single‐modal signal. This study illustrates the potential of multimodal fusion of EMG and BI in movement recognition, with broad prospects for application in HMI fields.",

However, a notable challenge lies in the contrasting requirements of locking each morphology for flight controllability and efficiency while permitting low‐energy reconfiguration. A novel design approach is proposed for reconfigurable multirotors utilizing soft multistable composite laminate airframes. These airframes show kinematically determinate morphologies corresponding to multiple minima in their elastic potential energy landscape. By varying design parameters, the methodology allows for tuning the energy landscape characteristics governing each morphology's structural stability and reconfiguration energetics. The airframe, composed of multistable composite laminate grids, is optimized to maximize rigidity under flight loads and minimize reconfiguration work. The 130‐g reconfigurable multirotor design demonstrates self‐locking properties in an open and a folded configuration, enabling a 48% reduction in width‐span without compromising stability during flight. Soft pneumatic actuators, actuated using a tethered compressed air supply, enable reversible reconfiguration on the ground between open and folded configurations. The design resolves the conflicting requirements of high‐stiffness to lock each flight configuration and low‐actuation work for reconfigurability. By exploiting soft yet multistable structures, the approach combines the stability observed in rigid‐linked reconfigurable multirotors with the low‐effort reconfigurability of soft multirotors, offering new methods for designing adaptive‐morphology multirotors.",

Planar printing tool paths, utilized in layer‐by‐layer printing such as fused deposition modeling (FDM) and prevalently used in most slicing algorithms, severely limit the realization of complex topologies required in metamaterials.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in extended reality (XR) showcase their potential ability to enhance the user experience of traditional displays such as liquid crystal displays and organic light‐emitting diode screens. To achieve this goal, the upcoming generation of head‐mounted displays (HMDs) necessitates a seamless transition between different XR modes, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) modes. Herein, an innovative cholesteric liquid crystal‐ (CLC‐) based optical combiner for HMDs is introduced. This approach enables the display device to switch between AR, VR, and transparent modes via temperature modulation. Since CLC materials demonstrate varying optical properties at different temperatures, a real‐time temperature monitoring system that is paired with an external controller is integrated. This allows for dynamic temperature adjustments of the optical combiner and enables smooth transitions between display modes. Furthermore, the Berreman 4 × 4 matrix method is used to simulate the optical properties of the optical combiner, finding strong agreement with the experimental results. The performance of the tunable optical combiners using 450, 532, and 635 nm laser sources is explored. The findings demonstrate that CLC‐based optical combiners can effectively switch between the three distinct modes at corresponding temperatures, paving the way for versatile applications in future HMDs.",

    "abstract": "Conventional continuum robots have outstanding flexibility and dexterity. However, when the robot needs to interact with the environment, the softness may affect the performance of the robot. Especially in transport tasks, the softness of continuum robots can lead to handling failures and drastic drops in precision. The variable stiffness continuum robot combines the advantages of flexibility and rigidity, which is conducive to expanding the application scenarios of flexible continuum robots. This article proposes a flexible continuum robot that simultaneously realizes variable stiffness, shape‐aware, and self‐heating functions using liquid metal. The low‐temperature phase transition property of liquid metal is utilized to realize the variable stiffness function; the overall stiffness of the robot can reach the range of 18.5–183 N m −1 , which can realize a tenfold stiffness gain. The conductivity of liquid metal is utilized to develop the shape‐aware function, and the monitoring accuracy is within 5%. At the same time, this article utilizes the liquid metal's resistive thermal effect to realize heating function, so that the robot no longer needs heating systems such as heating wires and can realize the phase transition by energizing itself. Based on this design, the robot arm can realize the transition between maximum and minimum stiffness within 240 s.",

    "abstract": "Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) videos offer valuable histopathologic information about the prostate. Accurate prostate zonal segmentation in TRUS videos is vital for diagnosing prostate cancer and guiding surgery. However, TRUS videos are manually recorded by urologists, resulting in no standardized coordinate system, which limits direct prostate zonal segmentation in these videos. To overcome the limitation, a novel Prostate Zonal Segmentation Network (PZS‐Net), based on U‐Net, which learns critical cross‐frame information and multi‐scale features from sequential frames, is proposed. First, a sequential frame cross‐attention (SFCA) module is designed to capture remote information from sequential frames to enhance the feature representation of the current frame. The SFCA module is embedded at each skip connection layer to extract crucial cross‐frame information. Then, a multi‐scale fusion (MSF) module that utilizes three parallel branches with different atrous convolutions is designed. The MSF module is placed at the bottleneck layer to dynamically fuse multi‐scale context information from high‐level features. Extensive experiments on TRUS image datasets show that the PZS‐Net achieves higher accuracy in both the transitional zone (dice coefficient [Dice]: 68.90% ± 1.73%, mean intersection over union [mIoU]: 59.19% ± 2.09%, 95% Hausdorff distance [HD95]: 5.02 ± 0.83 mm) and the peripheral zone (Dice: 63.99% ± 3.16%, mIoU: 54.60% ± 3.35%, HD95: 5.28 ± 1.12 mm) and demonstrates the effectiveness and competitiveness of its key components via comprehensive ablation studies.",

However, several challenges arise when printing on nonplanar surfaces, especially using the drop‐on‐demand (DoD) approach. These challenges include ink flow due to gravity, precise ink deposition, and reproducibility. This study introduces an innovative method for highly accurate DoD material jetting on nonplanar 3D conductive surfaces, enabling precise production and trajectory control of charged droplets. The technique involves using a grounded 3D substrate as the target, where in‐flight droplets are subjected to an external electric field generated by gate electrode installed on a piezo activated droplet dispenser. Individual droplets are generated and controlled using a complex trigger system that relays variable‐voltage signals to the gate electrode. Moreover, a predictive model for droplet deposition, exhibiting an accuracy of 87%, is developed utilizing supervised machine learning (ML). This approach significantly improves the accuracy and repeatability of droplet deposition. Overall, this study presents an effective method of integrating piezoelectric and electrohydrodynamic printing technologies, complemented by ML. It addresses the challenges associated with printing on nonplanar surfaces using the DoD material jetting technique and shows considerable promise for enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability in the manufacturing of printed electronics.",

In this research, 24 soft–rigid grippers are first identified through a scoping review using the Web of Science database, capturing their technical features and performance. Providing a variable stiffness grasp ( n = 9, 37.5%) and a limited grasp capability ( n = 8, 33.3%) is the most common advantage and challenge, respectively, of soft–rigid grippers. Pneumatic actuators ( n = 12, 50.0%), followed by tendon‐driven electric rotary actuators ( n = 9, 37.5%), are the predominant actuators used for soft–rigid grippers. Soft–rigid grippers are found to have a lower output force‐to‐weight ratio ( n = 9, median , standard deviation ( σ ) = 15.17) in comparison to industrial parallel rigid grippers ( n = 63, , ), but can provide a larger range of motion ( n = 20, , ). This is the first quantitative comparative analysis between industrial parallel rigid and soft–rigid grippers, enhancing the understanding of their status and prospects in industrial applications. Herein, a common approach is proposed to standardize reporting to facilitate benchmarking between research‐based and industrial grippers and highlight controlling soft–rigid grippers is an underexplored area that can enhance the technology's performance.",

The functions and information processing capabilities of these strain receptors, however, are largely unknown. Herein, the potential ability of wing strain sensors to detect wind direction in flapping flight is experimentally explored. Seven strain gauges are attached to the biomimetic wing shafts of flexible wings. The wings flap through an electric mechanism emulating hovering flight in a wind tunnel with gentle wind, and a convolutional neural network model for wind direction classification is developed. The results show that with only one strain gauge, accurate wind classification is achieved using segmented data of ≈1 flapping cycle. Even with segmented data of only 0.2 flapping cycles, wind classification can be achieved with all seven strain gauges. Moreover, the use of wing shafts improves the classification accuracy, especially with shorter segmented data. Additional flapping phase information does not substantially improve classification performance. These results suggest that hovering animals determine the wind direction via strain sensing, which is useful for flight control. The implementation of wing strain sensors in flapping‐wing aerial robots may improve flight control ability.",

Artifacts in the lesion images, such as various dirt, hairs, low contrast, and unclear boundaries, are challenges that affect segmentation accuracy. Convolutional neural networks have brought success in skin lesion segmentation. U‐shaped and V‐shaped deep learning‐based segmentation architectures learn boundary information in the first layers. However, this information becomes weaker in the following layers. Herein, the Edge‐aTtention module is added to the V‐Net architecture to move edge information to the last layer, and the spatial and channel squeeze‐excitation module is added to emphasize high‐level features by recalibrating the channel information to learn lesion boundaries better. The scSEETV‐Net is supported by fusing the binary cross‐entropy, which calculates the loss on a pixel‐based, and the focal Twersky loss function, which has significant success in class imbalances.

The use of interventional data in the causal analysis is crucial for real‐world applications, such as robotics, where the scenario is highly complex and observational data alone are often insufficient to uncover the correct causal structure. Validation of the method is performed initially on randomly generated synthetic models and subsequently on a well‐known benchmark for causal structure learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The experiments demonstrate that the approach can effectively handle data from interventions and exploit them to enhance the accuracy of the causal analysis.

Inspired by the hygroscopic deformation observed in multilayered pine cone scales, wherein hydration of the outer active layer induces cone closure, a one‐step fabrication method of a personalized 4D‐printed water‐actuated four‐arm polypill is demonstrated in this study. The bilayer‐arm polypill self‐deploys upon ingestion to prolong gastric retention and sustain drug release. By inversing the orientation of the swellable active layer at the polypill arms compared to pine cone scales, a differential swelling strain develops generating bending force that enables polypill deployment to constrain passage through the pylorus. Finite‐element analysis is used to model spatial changes in polymer phase swelling to ensure adequate deployment within the timeframe of gastric emptying. In a stomach model, the polypill expanded to 30 mm over 2 h, exceeding the diameter of the stomach model's distal end. In an in vitro release screening, biocompatible polymer composites capable of providing up to 6 days of release for a three‐drug combination for tuberculosis–HIV coinfected patients are identified.

This approach is applied to a multiloop origami spherical joint, which features a minimalistic design comprising two parallel waterbomb structures. This design allows for the integration of four actuators, thereby enabling full control over the structure's three DoF and its inherent compliance.

Using composite of thermoplastic polyurethane and micron‐sized Nd 2 Fe 14 B magnetic powder, 12 unique butterfly designs—varying in size, vein patterns, and stiffness—are fabricated via powder bed fusion (PBF) 3D printing, resulting in 84 specimens.

    "abstract": "Wearable healthcare devices monitor the condition of patients outside the hospital and hence increase treatment capacity and resources. At the same time, patients benefit from wireless data transmission and conformable device designs, speeding up the rehabilitation process and integration into normal daily activities. Yet, the successful implementation of personalized treatment creates an extensive engineering challenge as devices need to adapt to a vast number of different patients and treatment protocols. Herein, soft building blocks of mobile health (mHealth) devices that reversibly assemble through a magnetic click‐on mechanism are introduced. Fabrication of reliable magnetic connectors with an inherent safeguard mechanism allows the realization of personalized wearable mHealth devices, independent of the (desired) measurement technique. Stretchable elastomer‐based units combined with imperceptible electrodes are protected from overstretching by controlling the opening force of the magnetic connections. The stretchable devices retain both electrical and mechanical functionality for more than 10 000 opening cycles, on par with the standard for universal serial bus type C (USB C) connectors used in consumer electronics. A fully functional and autonomous pulse sensor wristband, assembled from the reliably connecting circuits, demonstrates the feasible implementation for mHealth devices. The plug‐and‐play modularity ensures the applicability independent of a patient's needs, without sacrificing functionality and durability.",

    "abstract": "Oblique‐incidence‐induced energy‐density loss (OEL) is a universal problem which affects nearly all processes involving electromagnetic waves, especially sunlight harvesting. Technologies (solar concentrating plants, large scale systems, etc.) are developed to address this issue, albeit with limitations such as complex design, large size, and high cost. Inspired by nature, artificial phototropism is developed to accurately follow the light direction without complex motors system and electronical control. However, the existing systems are limited by small tracking operation windows, low robustness, or the requirement of high‐power input. Herein, a system is reported that is versatile, low cost, mechanically strong, and can achieve large‐angle reorientation driven by unconcentrated sunlight. This system is demonstrated to be able to recover the OEL for photovoltaics as well as solar vapor generation (SVG) processes. Compared with the nonphototropic system, it can achieve 447% output in lab and 155% in real‐life applications. The principle behind our artificial phototropic system is universal and can be extended to many optical applications, especially sunlight harvesting.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted much attention in recent years due to their outstanding performance in image classification. However, changes in lighting conditions can corrupt image segmentation conducted by CNN, leading to false object detection. Even though this problem can be mitigated using a more extensive CNN training set, the immense computational and energy resources required to continuously run CNNs during always‐on applications, such as surveillance or self‐navigation, pose a serious challenge for battery‐reliant mobile systems. To tackle this longstanding problem, a vision sensor capable of autonomously correcting for sudden variations in light exposure, without invoking any complex object detection software, is proposed. Such video preprocessing is efficiently achieved using photovoltaic pixels tailored to be insensitive to specific ranges of light intensity alterations. In this way, the pixels behave similarly to neurons, wherein the execution of object detection software is only triggered when light intensities shift above a certain threshold value. This proof‐of‐concept device allows for efficient fault‐tolerant object detection to be implemented with reduced training data as well as minimal energy and computational costs and demonstrates how hardware engineering can complement software algorithms to improve the overall energy efficiency of computer vision.",

This enables the replacement of the conventional tactile sensor comprising a patterned array structure with a super‐simple, single‐layer, large‐area tactile sensor pad. A crude carbon nanotube‐dispersed polydimethylsiloxane pad—with a bias applied to the center and the resultant piezoresistive current detected at several electrodes located on the pad edge—plays a smart sensory role without the need for complicated fabrication of microengineered structures. The piezoresistive current while recording the indented location and the pressure thereon is measured, and then various DL models (a multimodel arrangement is necessary due to the viscoelasticity of the pad) using the collected data are trained. The proposed concept is realized using a tandem model comprising a combination of algorithms selected from deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, long short‐term memory networks, and 16 state‐of‐the‐art machine learning algorithms. The hold‐out dataset test accuracy for the indented location identification reaches 98.89%, and the goodness of fit for pressure prediction is evaluated with mean squared error of 2.5 × 10 −3 and coefficient of determination of 98.05%.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria‐mediated drug delivery systems comprising nanotherapeutics conjugated onto bacteria synergistically augment the efficacy of both therapeutic modalities in cancer therapy. Nanocarriers preserve therapeutics’ bioavailability and reduce systemic toxicity, while bacteria selectively colonize the cancerous tissue, impart intrinsic and immune‐mediated antitumor effects, and propel nanotherapeutics interstitially. The optimal bacteria–nanoparticle (NP) conjugates will carry the maximal NP load with minimal motility speed hindrance for effective interstitial distribution. Furthermore, a well‐defined and repeatable NP attachment density distribution is crucial to determining these biohybrid systems’ efficacious dosage and robust performance. Herein, our nanoscale bacteria‐enabled autonomous delivery system (NanoBEADS) platform is utilized to investigate the effects of assembly process parameters of mixing method, volume, and duration on NP attachment density and repeatability. The effect of linkage chemistry and NP size on NP attachment density, viability, growth rate, and motility of NanoBEADS is also evaluated. It is shown that the linkage chemistry impacts NP attachment density while the self‐assembly process parameters affect the repeatability and, to a lesser extent, attachment density. Lastly, the attachment density affects NanoBEADS’ growth rate and motility in an NP size‐dependent manner. These findings will contribute to the development of scalable and repeatable bacteria–NP biohybrids for applications in drug delivery and beyond.

Herein, a method to combine resistance–resistance ( R–R ) and voltage–resistance ( V–R ) logic gates to implement exclusive logic gates composed of APMR‐two‐2(XOR, IMP, RIMP) and APMR‐three‐4XOR, where APMR means antiparallel memristors with a series resistor, is suggested. The proposed gates can accelerate XOR logic operation in a single cycle and expand for the n ‐bit input. The performance of the proposed logic gate is then demonstrated with a 1‐bit full adder–subtractor along with the comparison of an n ‐bit ripple carry adder. It shows that the implementation for the n ‐bit adder takes 4 n +1 memristors within 2 n +1 steps, which significantly improves the optimization in terms of space‐ and time‐related costs compared with other memristive logic gates. Subsequently, the improved adder circuit can be further utilized to implement an n ‐bit multiplier. In addition, the evaluation of the device stress on the various logic gates confirms that the proposed logic gates are reliable.",

Herein, by knitting bare SMA wires on scattered holes, it is shown that the substrate‐free knitted SMA wires can periodically ride robots forward, where a deterministic spatial curvilinear actuation can be achieved in which its in‐between heated configuration and the final stable pattern is sensitive to the prescribed hole constraints. By arranging “knitting‐constraints,” the 3D‐printed and origami robots with a pair of SMA wires, respectively, are ridden. The SMA wires have an angle parameter with a variation range of 30° for the 3D‐printed robot and that of 8° for the origami robot, where the angle parameter is defined to indicate the performance of the knitted SMAs. Both the robots can displace up to 5 mm in one motion cycle with an average speed of 20 and 15 mm min −1 , respectively.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises an exponentially higher computational power than classical computers; although all the building blocks have become available, certain constraints still prevent quantum advantage. The fundamental challenge in building a practical quantum computer is integrating thousands of highly coherent qubits with the control and readout electronics. The need for a high‐coherence qubit drives the effort for quantum error correction algorithms to create fault‐tolerant quantum systems. Error correction becomes tangible in a quantum processor only in large numbers of qubits. Thus, the other challenge is reducing the number of physical interconnects (coaxial lines) between the quantum–classical interface and bulky room‐temperature electronics. To interface thousands of qubits, interconnects can be reduced by bringing the control and readout electronics near the quantum processor. Cryogenic complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology has been an ideal candidate for this purpose. Integrated control and readout at cryogenic temperatures require low power dissipation circuit designs and techniques such as frequency‐division multiplexing (FDM) due to the finite cooling power of a dilution refrigerator. Herein, an overview of each building block in a superconducting quantum computer is provided, focusing on scalability. Furthermore, this article is concluded with an outlook discussing current challenges and future directions for the scalable superconducting control and readout.",

Asian flat‐tailed geckos ( Hemidactylus platyurus ) are observed to glide and perch on vertical surfaces by relying on their tail and body morphology, potentially reducing the control effort to perch. This novel perching mechanism using a bioinspired physical model is discussed and its tail and body parameters to determine their influence on perching success and the kinematics of the gecko's dynamic landing maneuver are adjusted. Perching performance is evaluated by changing the model's torso and tail stiffness. Combining a compliant torso and stiff tail enables the model to passively perch on a vertical substrate with a success rate &gt;90%, compared with ≈10% without a tail attached. A compliant torso is necessary to absorb the in‐flight kinetic energy and accommodate the uncertainties in approach conditions. Similar to the gecko's perching strategy, the stiff tail pushes against the substrate, preventing the model from falling backward head over heels.

    "abstract": "Microdispersion technology is an important part of the flow chemistry method in creating tiny bubbles or droplets for enhancing mass/heat transfer performance, in which the dispersed flow condition plays a central role. Currently, most microdispersion flow characterization works are conducted by manual analysis on microscopic images, suffering from long analysis time and limited accessible information. Herein, taking the advantage of convolutional neural networks, TrackFit is proposed as an efficient video deep learning method for a precise, fast, and comprehensive investigation of microdispersion states. TrackFit is capable of recognizing bubble instances, tracking them in the microscope sight, and unprecedentedly inferring bubble diameter, location, velocity, as well as sphericity in an intelligent way. TrackFit achieves small measurement errors of diameter (8 μm) and velocity (0.08 mm s −1 ) on the test dataset after deepening the neural network backbone and adopting the data augmentation technique. When applied to inexperienced data, the TrackFit output relationship of bubble diameter to flow rate is consistent with previous manual results, but with a beyond‐human efficiency (≈500 times higher). TrackFit not only works as a core method of an intelligent microdispersed fluid characterization system, but also suggests a promising potential for real‐time microdispersion process analysis in the future.",

However, conventional repair methods require additional equipment and manual intervention to sequentially finish complicated processes such as global scanning and reverse modeling, which results in efficiency reduction and usage restriction. To address the existing shortcomings, an automatic repair system with artificial intelligence (AI) assistance is developed, which includes a semantic segmentation module, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) module, and composite printing device. The damaged part features are extracted by semantic segmentation from the captured real‐time images to establish DRL maps, where the print motion is simulated and transmitted to the printer. The results indicate that the applied bilateral segmentation network (BiSeNetV2) is 59.03% and 29.90% faster than pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) and DeepLabV3+ architecture with satisfying accuracy. The established DRL model based on actual printing achieves the optimization of agent learning speed and print quality. The automatic system improves the repair efficiency by 294% compared to the conventional methods, and enables both structural and electrical repair through high‐temperature polymer–metal printing. This intelligent system enables industrial robots to independently handle unexpected tasks in complex and changeable environments through interdisciplinary knowledge integration of advanced manufacturing and AI.",

    "abstract": "Computing‐in‐memory (CIM) is considered a feasible solution to the acceleration of multiply‐accumulate (MAC) operations at low power. The key to CIM is parallel MAC operations in the memory domain, and thus reductions in power consumption and memory‐access latency. Resistive random access memory (RRAM) can be a good candidate for the memory for CIM given its data nonvolatility, high data density, low‐latency read‐out, multilevel representation, and inherent current accumulation capability. Particularly, the last two attributes offer analog MAC operations in parallel in the memory domain. However, the fully analog MAC operation scheme causes significant power and area overheads for its peripheral circuits, particularly, analog‐to‐digital converters. To compensate for these downsides using digital processing, a method for sub‐array‐wise partial MAC operations over weight‐resistors that are optimally split to minimize power and area overheads for the peripheral circuits is proposed. The simulations performed highlight the optimal sub‐array of in size. That is, weight‐splitting such that a single w ‐bit weight is represented by RRAM cells, i.e., 2‐bit for each cell. For 8‐bit weights, the figure of merit (FOM) for this optimal case reaches ≈28.3 FOM for the case of no weight‐splitting.",

Various free space deployment operations are demonstrated, such as 3D helical precurved tube deployment, conical–spiral deployment, and constrained 3D deployment through needle orifices. The forward kinematic model (FKM), inverse kinematic model (IKM), and stability analysis are experimentally validated.

Herein, all four material (M) states of a phase‐change material (PCM) in data storage and register operations are utilized and a combined M state‐based model framework for developing in‐memory operation is demonstrated, along with nonvolatile, reprogrammable single‐cell shift register operations. A previously unachieved multiple‐level‐per‐volt different‐initial‐state multilevel set process with further computing in the M state‐based platform is realized. The simplest case of a programmable shift register configuration is demonstrated with a serial‐in–serial‐out processing strategy, as well as more complex reprogrammable processing schemes using the M state‐type platform, showing previously unreported nonvolatile shift register types with multiple processing approaches.

The strategy exploits deep neural networks to learn the mapping between the latent space of a 2D acoustic object and the far‐field scattering amplitudes. A neural network is designed as an adversarial autoencoder and trained via unsupervised learning to determine the latent space of the acoustic object. Important structural features of the object are embedded in lower‐dimensional latent space which supports the modeling of a shape generator and accelerates the learning in the inverse design process. The proposed inverse design uses the variational inference approach with encoder‐ and decoder‐like architecture where the decoder is composed of two pretrained neural networks: the generator and the forward model. The data‐driven framework finds an accurate solution to the ill‐posed inverse scattering problem, where nonunique solution space is overcome by the multifrequency phaseless far‐field patterns. This inverse method is a powerful design tool that doesn't require complex analytical calculation and opens up new avenues for practical realization, automatic recognition of arbitrary‐shaped submarines or large fish, and other underwater applications.",

One of the most commonly used pose estimation methods first detects the 2D pose keypoints in the input image and then calculates the 6D pose using a pose solver. Recently, deep learning is widely used in pose keypoint detection and performs excellent accuracy and adaptability. However, its over‐reliance on sufficient and high‐quality samples and supervision is prominent, particularly in the industrial field, leading to high data cost. Based on domain adaptation and computer‐aided‐design (CAD) models, herein, a virtual‐to‐real knowledge transfer method for pose keypoint detection to reduce the data cost of deep learning is proposed. To address the disorder of knowledge flow, a viewpoint‐driven feature alignment strategy is proposed to simultaneously eliminate interdomain differences and preserve intradomain differences. The shape invariance of rigid objects is then introduced as constraints to address the large assumption space problem in the regressive domain adaptation. The multidimensional experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the method. Without real annotations, the normalized pixel error of keypoint detection is reported as 0.033, and the proportion of pixel errors lower than 0.05 is up to 92.77%.",

Herein, the principles of evolution into the metamaterial design and discovery process to directly evolve thousands of metastructures with hitherto‐unknown structures and new modalities of operation are embedded. In this so‐called evolving metamaterial (EM) concept, evolution takes place by randomly creating an initial population of parent metamaterial entities that pass on their genetic material to their offspring through variation, reproduction, and selection. The metamaterial configurations with desired response emerge during this evolutionary process. The EM concept presents a different approach for direct morphological evolution of metamaterial microstructures using merely a piece of matter. For the biologically inspired evolution of mechanical metamaterials, this piece is chosen to be a representative unit cell to launch the design process. This paradigm shift by creating an evolutionary computational framework for the exploration of a series of proof‐of‐concept 2D mechanical metamaterial structures with maximum bulk modulus, maximum shear modulus, and minimum Poisson's ratio is studied.

    "abstract": "Cell counting and segmentation are critical tasks in biology and medicine. The traditional methods for cell counting are labor‐intensive, time‐consuming, and prone to human errors. Recently, deep learning‐based cell counting methods have become a trend, including point‐based counting methods, such as cell detection and cell density prediction, and non‐point‐based counting, such as cell number regression prediction. However, the point‐based counting method heavily relies on well‐annotated datasets, which are scarce and difficult to obtain. On the other hand, nonpoint‐based counting is less interpretable. The task of cell counting by dividing it into two subtasks is approached: cell number prediction and cell distribution prediction. To accomplish this, a deep learning network for spatial‐based super‐resolution reconstruction (SSRNet) is proposed that predicts the cell count and segments the cell distribution contour. To effectively train the model, an optimized multitask loss function (OM loss) is proposed that coordinates the training of multiple tasks. In SSRNet, a spatial‐based super‐resolution fast upsampling module (SSR‐upsampling) is proposed for feature map enhancement and one‐step upsampling, which can enlarge the deep feature map by 32 times without blurring and achieves fine‐grained detail and fast processing. SSRNet uses an optimized encoder network. Compared with the classic U‐Net, SSRNet's running memory read and write consumption is only 1/10 of that of U‐Net, and the total number of multiply and add calculations is 1/20 of that of U‐Net. Compared with the traditional sampling method, SSR‐upsampling can complete the upsampling of the entire decoder stage at one time, reducing the complexity of the network and achieving better performance. Experiments demonstrate that the method achieves state‐of‐the‐art performance in cell counting and segmentation tasks. The method achieves nonpoint‐based counting, eliminating the need for exact position annotation of each cell in the image during training. As a result, it has demonstrated excellent performance on cell counting and segmentation tasks. The code is public on GitHub (https://github.com/Roin626/SSRnet).",

Ferroelectric field‐effect transistors (FeFETs) with excellent controllability and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility are favorable to achieving synaptic functions with low power consumption and high scalability. However, because of the only nonvolatile ferroelectric (Fe) characteristics in the FeFET, it is difficult to develop bioplausible short‐term synaptic elements for spatiotemporal information processing. By judiciously combining defects (DE) and Fe domains in gate stacks, a compact artificial synapse featuring spatiotemporal information processing on a single Fe–DE fin FET (FinFET) is proposed. The devices are designed to work in a separate DE mode to induce short‐term plasticity by spontaneous charge detrapping, and a hybrid Fe–DE mode to trigger long‐term plasticity through the coupling of defects and Fe domains. The capability of the compact synapse is demonstrated by differentiating 16 temporal inputs. Moreover, the highly controllable static electricity of advanced FinFETs leads to an ultralow power of 2 fJ spike −1 . An all Fe–DE FinFET reservoir computing (RC) system is then constructed that achieves a recognition accuracy of 97.53% in digit classification. This work enables constructing RC systems with fully advanced CMOS‐compatible devices featuring highly energy‐efficient and low‐hardware systems.",

However, the former method lacks detailed measurements of the expected motion, whereas the latter is prone to errors in diverse movement situations. Based on this problem, a multi‐intent prediction scheme is proposed that analyzes both rhythmic locomotion and volitional movement intent for AI‐based intrinsic and extrinsic hybrid control (AIEC). A 1D residual shrinkage convolutional network is designed to extract EMG features. The motion state is continuously predicted with an accuracy of 91.66% and the angle completion is also estimated with of 0.9540 and 0.9456 for left and right knee angles, respectively. Additionally, the comparison test further indicates that the motion state classification is significantly improved in the multitask analysis compared with the single‐task approach. This work demonstrates and verifies a novel method in EMG studies that multi‐intent recognition not only compensates for the lack of information in the analysis of single rhythmic or volitional movement, but also enhances the comprehensive performance and makes AIEC feasible, which optimizes the current EMG‐driven control for ampler intent collection and more practical robotic control.",

Herein, a braided flat‐tube artificial muscle (BFAM) is presented. BFAMs are fabricated by braiding cotton threads together with an inexpensive lay‐flat tube (LFT) in a specific conform‐to‐LFT weaving method. They generate uniaxial contractions when powered by compressed fluids. The basic structure and working mechanism of the proposed BFAM are explained, and a quasistatic model is also developed. A comparison with other fluidic driven soft actuators is made and tabulated. Based on experimental studies, the proposed BFAM can contract close to 30% and yield force outputs more than 150 times their weight at an air pressure of 0.12 MPa. BFAM can be braided with multiple layers of flat tube without large increase of size. Experimental studies have shown that more layers of flat tube give a larger strain and output force up to four layers, beyond which layer increase does not yield visible improvement in strain and output force. Finally, potential applications of BFAM to arm joint actuations are illustrated to show its easy fitting to wearable robotics.",

To extract signal features, a novel technique is introduced that estimates movement‐related cortical potentials and incorporates them into the processing pipeline. Moreover, a time‐frequency domain representation of the dataset is used as input for the classifier.

We propose a simple and high‐precision hand–eye calibration method for 3D robot measurement systems.

Finally, a novel simultaneous solution for and the corresponding closed‐form initial solution are introduced. Simulations and experiments confirm that the proposed method exhibits high noise resistance and achieves high‐precision calibration, even with a limited calibration data quantity.

Moreover, the inspected area is very small. Herein, a simple, inexpensive, and ultrasensitive NDT method for identifying and classifying the geometries of subsurface defects using commercial cameras, digital image correlation software, and object detection (OD) algorithms is developed. Three OD algorithms—Faster region‐based convolutional neural network (Faster R‐CNN), Mask R‐CNN, and you‐only‐look‐once (YOLO)v3—are evaluated for their ability to locate defects and identify defect geometries. Specifically, bounding boxes of two sizes (large and small) are applied to the regions of defect‐induced perturbations in strain tensors, which serve as virtual representatives of invisible subsurface defects. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on test datasets of known and unknown defect types. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can effectively utilize the surface deformation field information to accurately and reliably locate and identify subsurface defects. The method is nondestructive and low cost, enables real‐time detection, is robust against noise‐dominated deformation fields, and can be applied to various structural deformations. The method is therefore suitable for multiscale structural health monitoring and characterization of internal defects in materials.",

However, commonly used tumor markers lack sensitivity and specificity for screening purposes. Herein, 10 diagnostic models for 10 common types of cancer are developed by extreme gradient boosting, incorporating 66 laboratory parameters. The datasets consist of a retrospective cohort of 737 503 training and 184 012 validation cases, and a prospective cohort of 174 894 cases for model testing. The areas under the curve of the 10 diagnostic models range from 0.763 to 0.993. Notably, the different models have varying numbers of identical parameters among the 66 test features. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanation analysis reveals that 54 nontumor markers contributed significantly to the models. Cosine similarity analysis and clustering analysis demonstrate that some of the 10 cancers share common pathophysiological characteristics. Feature‐based inference graph models are thus performed and infer relationships between nontumor index parameters and cancers with strong correlations. In conclusion, a machine learning‐based pan‐cancer early warning system has been established in this study, which can guide doctors in selecting more accurate testing indicators and assessing the risk of 10 types of cancer with greater precision.",

Furthermore, a multilevel characteristic is achieved through low‐power program/erase operations based on Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling, which exhibit 0.09 and 0.99 fJ per spike, respectively. These characteristics provide the HNN stability, along with high performance and power efficiency.

However, performing LS requires advanced training and skills, as it demands high precision and dexterity due to visual feedback depending on the collaboration between the surgeon and endoscope assistant, restricted field of view, and limited dexterity inside the body. Thus, a flexible endoscope holder system with an automatic control scheme is proposed to assist LS performance, allowing the surgeon to perform solo LS.

Both simulation and physical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control scheme.

The NaNbO 3 films deposited on one Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 monolayer exhibit a bipolar switching curve due to the construction and destruction of oxygen vacancy filaments. Because the Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 monolayer does not act as an insulating layer, the film does not exhibit self‐rectifying properties. Self‐rectifying properties are observed in the NaNbO 3 memristor, which forms on two Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 monolayers that act as tunnel barriers in the memristor. The memristor exhibits extensive rectification and on/off ratios of 48 and 15.7, respectively. Tunneling is the current conduction mechanism of the device in the low‐resistance state, and Schottky emission and tunneling are responsible for the conduction mechanism in the high‐resistance state at low and high voltages, respectively. The piezoelectric nanogenerator produced using the [001]‐oriented NaNbO 3 film generates high voltage (1.8 V) and power (3.2 μW). Furthermore, endurance of the resistive random‐access memory and nonlinear transmission characteristics of the biological synapse are accomplished in the NaNbO 3 memristor powered by the NaNbO 3 nanogenerator. Therefore, the [001]‐oriented crystalline NaNbO 3 film formed at 300 °C may be utilized for self‐rectifying and self‐powered artificial synapses.",

These systems can perform complex tasks that are impossible for humans to accomplish or at scales that humans cannot reach. In recent years, the rapid advancement of small‐scale robotics has benefited from the progress in synthesis and nanotechnology, providing access to nanomembranes with stimuli‐responsive materials, such as phase transition materials, shape memory alloys, and palladium. These materials are 2D sheets with a thickness ranging from 5 to 500 nm, and they have the ability to change their shape reversibly under extremal stimuli. Together with strain engineering for deterministic assembly, various stimuli‐responsive actuators and robots have been fabricated for medicine, manufacturing, and exploration by endowing them with the combined features of a continuously deformable structure, remote operation, and several degrees of freedom. Herein, the recent achievements in small‐scale actuators and robots based on inorganic stimuli‐responsive nanomembranes are reviewed and their advantages and properties highlighted.",

However, LiDAR utilizes radiation in the near‐infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is prone to complete absorption by typical dark (such as painted by carbon black) colored objects, leading to loss of timely data points. Till date a very limited number of solutions have been put forward to address this. Herein, nanocrystallites of copper (II) oxide with specific prevalence of crystal facets that create nearly perfect black material at visible wavelengths are proposed. The sharp transition of absorbance near 700 nm wavelength light is attributed to the near‐unity ratio of (−111)/(111) the crystal facets and a crystal size of around 100 Å for the (−111) plane. Although indistinguishable from carbon black and with the same degree of measured blackness ( M y value 135.5), the nanocrystalline CuO shows 1500% better detectability by LiDAR. The study paves the way for the unconstrained use of dark objects in future society and infrastructure, moving a step closer toward fully autonomous operation of vehicles and robots.",

One thousand sixty‐six laboratory variables are reduced to 18 measures using standard filtering and feature importance methods. Then, five machine learning classifiers are evaluated for the study. Hyperparameter optimization for each classifier is carried out, and the optimal algorithm is established using a tenfold cross validation on the training data. Finally, gradient boosting decision tree‐based ternary classifier composed of 18 routine laboratory variables (GBDT‐TC 18 ) is established.

    "abstract": "Electrical neurostimulation has been used successfully as a technique in both research and clinical contexts for over a century. Despite significant progress, inherent problems remain, hence there has been a drive for novel neurostimulation modalities including ultrasonic, magnetic, and optical, which have the potential to be less invasive, have enhanced biointegration, deeper stimulus penetration from the probe, and higher spatiotemporal resolution. Optogenetics—the optical stimulation of genetically photosensitized neurons, enables highly precise genetic targeting of the stimulus. Specifically, it allows for selective optical excitation and inhibition via different wavelengths. As such, optogenetics has become a prominent tool for neuroscience. Herein, the complementarity between different forms of neurostimulation is explored with a focus on cranial magnetic and optogenetic stimulation. Magnetic stimulation is complementary to optogenetics in that it does not require an electrochemical tissue interface like in the case of electrical stimulation. Furthermore, if incorporated onto the same probe as one with light emitters, its stimulation field can be orthogonal to the light emission field—allowing for complementary stimulus fields. Herein, dual optogenetic and magnetic modalities are proposed that can unite to yield a powerful and versatile tool for neural engineering.",

So far, there have been some studies of 2D patterns and structural designs based on ML techniques. However, a particular challenge remains in allowing complex 3D mechanical designs using ML techniques. Herein, a novel and experience‐free method to equip ML models with 3D design capabilities by combining a convolutional neuron network (CNN) with a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) is developed. The model directly receives 2D image‐based training data that define the complex 3D structures of a specific machine part. After the training process, an infinite number of new 3D designs can be generated by the proposed model, with their geometric and mechanical properties being accurately predicted at the same time.

Here, effects of flicker noise and drift on large DL systems are explored using a new flicker‐noise model with memory, which preserves temporal correlations, including a flicker noise figure of merit (FOM) to quantify impacts on system performance. Flicker noise is characterized for (GST) based phase‐change memory (PCM) cells with a discovery of read‐noise asymmetry tied to shape asymmetry of mushroom cells. This experimental read polarity dependence is consistent with Pirovano's trap activation and defect annihilation model in an asymmetric GST cell. The impact of flicker noise and resistance drift of analog PCM synaptic devices on deep‐learning hardware is assessed for six large‐scale deep neural networks (DNNs) used for image classification, finding that the inference top‐1 accuracy degraded with the accumulated device flicker noise and drift as , and , respectively, where ν is the drift coefficient. These negative impacts could be mitigated with a new hardware‐aware (HWA) (pre)‐training of the DNNs, which is applied before programming to the analog arrays.",

To elaborate, designed a bidirectional, asynchronous, and parallel pulse‐signaling scheme over an analog‐weighted phase‐change memory (PCM) synapse array to enable spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP) as a local weight update rule based on eCD is designed. Building upon the initial version of this work, significantly more experimental details are added, such as the on‐chip characterization results of LIF and backward‐LIF (BLIF) and stochasticity of our random walk circuitry. The experimental characterization of these on‐chip stochastic neuron circuits shows a reasonable symmetricity between LIF and BLIF as well as the necessary stochasticity for spiking RBM operation. Fully hardware‐based image classification recorded 93% on‐chip training accuracy from 100 handwritten MNIST digit images. In addition, we experimentally demonstrated the generative characteristics of the RBM by reconstructing partial patterns on hardware. As each synapse and neuron execute its computations in an asynchronous and fully parallel fashion, the chip can perform data‐intensive machine learning (ML) tasks in a power‐efficient manner and take advantage of the sparseness of spiking.",

Loosely consolidated sandy slopes flow unpredictably when perturbed, often leading to locomotion failure. Systematic experiments with various robot morphologies on flowable terrains feature open‐loop quasistatic gait strategies that remodel the terrain to aid locomotor kinematics. On a sloped terrain of granular media near the critical angle, a laboratory‐scale rover robot induces a flow via a localized fluidization gait to remodel local terrain and succeed in locomotion. A Bayesian optimization machine learning approach that modulates this gait strategy then finds a pattern of selectively fluidizing and solidifying terrain to climb slopes rapidly. In a biped walker robot, a cleated foot design dynamically manipulates the stress fields of flowable slopes. The deeply submerged cleats remodel the shear response of the material by creating jammed regions behind them which then improve forward progression by reducing slip when compared to a flat foot. The “robophysics” approach of systematic experiments exploring terrain reconfiguration combined with future machine learning models of flowable terrain evolution can augment gait discovery for future robots.",

    "abstract": "Herein, the development of a multimodal, nature‐inspired unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that operates in three different flight regimes (rotor wing, tailsitter, cruise), unlike typical UAVs which only consist of two, is discussed. The platform uses a nature‐inspired method to achieve efficient hover, yet possesses the flexibility to enter a more agile state via additional tailsitter and cruise modes. Both the mechanical configuration and software/control architecture used to achieve three‐mode capability are documented in detail. A sigmoid blending control is implemented as the transition control strategy, consisting of transition coordinators that adjust the weight of each individual controller on the actuator outputs. To improve the transition sequence based on performance goals such as reduced altitude variation and throttle usage, an optimization routine is performed to obtain the optimized blending parameters. The optimized parameters are then experimentally verified on a physical prototype in lab conditions and shown to exhibit at least a 20% improvement for altitude variation and at least 5% less throttle usage across 4 consecutive transitions compared with baseline. Three‐mode capability outdoors in real‐world conditions are also demonstrated in multiple flights. Power draw in rotor‐wing mode is found to be 30% less than in tailsitter mode.",

    "abstract": "The application of Soft Crawling Robots (SCRs) to real‐world scenarios remains a grand challenge due to their limited deployment time to reach the target and accessibility to difficult‐to‐reach environments by any obstacles. To overcome these limitations, a novel multimodal Tasering Twin Soft Robot (TTSR), carrying two SCRs, capable of 1) passive flight and 2) wall climbing to a desired location by deploying SCRs once reached the target is proposed. For satisfying both tasks, reconfigurable design of SCRs using a novel bistable mechanism and detaching mechanism based on a shape‐memory alloy for deploying SCRs is proposed. Each SCR is driven by two dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA) and three electroadhesive (EA) feet. To demonstrate multimodality, the TTSR with two SCRs is launched by pneumatic pressure and flown over an obstacle. While flying, the SCRs are folded compactly to reduce the air drag and perch on a wall 3 m away (50 times of body length) within 0.64 s. After perching, the SCRs reconfigure themselves for crawling and separated from each other. After that, the SCRs crawl, performing planar motion, and reach predefined locations on the wall. Moreover, the SCR can move across 15°‐slope dihedral surfaces and inverted surface.",

    "abstract": "Recently, shape‐morphing films (SMFs) have been actively researched due to their diverse applications such as soft robotics, soft grippers, and healthcare/wearable devices. Their complex movements are typically made by assembling multiple actuation elements in a single system. However, the unreliability during the assembly process is a critical issue, which has restricted their practical usage. In order to resolve this problem, herein, a biomimetic, programmable, and part‐by‐part maneuverable single‐body SMF is proposed. Programming of the SMF adopts a similar mechanism to Bauhinia variegates, whereby nonequivalent volume changes due to external stimuli cause the bending of the overall film. The patterned elastic modulus of the SU‐8 microwall prescribes the preferred bending direction. Part‐by‐part maneuvering is accomplished by controlling the voltage distribution of the underlying electrothermal heater. The fabricated single‐body SMF demonstrates the complex movements of the inchworm (pose stabilization: front‐to‐back flip and back‐to‐front flip; basic movements: crawl, left turn, and right turn) and Drosera Capensis (insect gripping via hierarchical morphology). The proposed method for the fabrication of a biomimetic, programmable, and part‐by‐part maneuverable single‐body SMF can successfully replace the conventional assembly process and achieve advanced SMF technology by enabling various complex movements toward practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Light exerts force or torque on objects through the momentum or angular momentum exchange between photons and the objects. For absorbing structures, light also induces a thermal gradient that can be used to power the object movement. The light‐driven mechanism, with the advantages of wireless, versatile modulation, and excellent spatial and temporal resolution, is very attractive and triggers various studies on micro‐ and nanomotors controlled by light. However, when the size of the motor becomes smaller and reaches the nanoscale, their interaction with light decreases and therefore it is very challenging to overcome the random Brownian motions. Optically resonant nanomotors can break such limitations. Alternatively, one can use optically resonant structures that significantly confine the light energy to control the movements of nanoobjects. Herein, the recent research on state‐of‐the‐art light resonant nanomotors, which includes both optically resonant nanomotors and nanomotors controlled by optically resonant nanostructures, is discussed. Their driving mechanisms, movement control, limitations, and possible improvements are introduced in detail. The exploration of the light resonant nanomotors in various applications is also introduced. Finally, an outlook on the future development of light resonant nanomotors is provided.",

    "abstract": "Smart textiles integrated with the function of recording tactile stimulation attract much attention due to its great potential for health monitoring and wearable electronics. However, the highly uneven surface and poor thermal stability of textiles become main challenges for precision measurement and device fabrications. To solve these issues, an ion‐assisted pressure‐sensitive textile using a novel photo‐curing process is demonstrated in this work. Using a photo‐cured fluorinated polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride‐ co ‐hexafluoropropene) (PVDF‐HFP) and a transparent polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold, a highly sensitive pyramid array of PVDF‐HFP is successfully fabricated on a textile. Furthermore, after doping the ionic additive, tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP), the sensors show improved sensitivity due to the enhanced dielectric constant. The dielectric constant has a significant increase in the value over 37 after doping a small amount of TBAP (2 wt%). Due to the ion doping, the sensitivity of the textile pressure sensors show significant improvement (0.73 kPa −1 ) higher than that of the PDMS‐based one (0.19 kPa −1 ). This work not only opens an efficient approach for the fabrication processes of a high‐k elastomer pyramid array on a textile but also provide a design strategy to improve performance of capacitive pressure sensor for smart textiles.",

To simplify the PEDOT coating process and at the same time make this process more suitable for application in industry, a new coating method is developed and the properties of the PEDOT‐PSS conducting layer is optimized, paying attention on its effect on the actuation performance. The effect of the concentration of an additive such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) on actuation, and of PEDOT:PSS layers, is investigated. Results show that on improving this conducting layer, better performance than previously developed yarn‐actuators is obtained, with strains up to 0.6%.

    "abstract": "Beyond the great success in machine learning (ML), the engineering community has been actively exploring neuromorphic computing systems based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). In the preliminary SNN, the neuronal information is simply encoded by the firing rate, which limits the volume of information in a certain spike pattern. Studies of the biological nervous system have discovered neuronal cooperativity, where flow of neural information is collaboratively encoded and carried by the spatiotemporal stamp and the correlated neuronal activity. In this study, by encoding the control pattern on the dual gates, a MoS 2 ‐based neuristor is exploited to program spatiotemporal information and neuronal correlations via the device's internal dynamics as well as the network topology, and a spiking correlated neural network (SCNN) is demonstrated. This correlated neural network not only succeeds in identifying the patterns with translational and rotational symmetry but also correctly reveals the rotated angles. Compared with conventional SNNs, the dimension of information flow in SCNNs can be greatly enlarged by taking advantage of the synergy between the rate coding and the neuronal correlations. This proof‐of‐concept work provides the potential to achieve high‐volume information processing with the simplified circuitry of neuromorphic computing systems.",

In addition to procedural training, the same technology may potentially help formulate treatment strategies in preprocedural planning especially in complex anatomy. Herein, a hybrid simulator for structural heart disease interventions is demonstrated by using the combination of a mixed reality (MR) display and 3D printing. The system consists of a 3D printed phantom heart model, a catheter with real‐time tracking using electromagnetic sensors, and the stand‐alone MR display for rendering 3D positions of the catheter within the heart model, along with quantitative feedback. The phantom heart model is generated by 3D printing technology using a segmented geometry from a human cardiac computed tomography (CT) scan. The catheter is coupled with electromagnetic sensors that allow real‐time tracking of their 3D positions and orientations. Custom software and algorithms to coregister and display the catheter's position relative to the phantom heart model are developed to interface with commercial software provided with the tracking sensors and MR display such that updates occur seamlessly in real time. Prespecified target crossings in the fossa ovalis during a transcatheter septal puncture procedure are demonstrated in the training scene. This hybrid training system will be used for training and educating transcatheter septal puncture procedure and other structural heart interventions.",

In the past two decades, significant progress has been made toward mimicking the underlying designs and resulting functions in artificial materials and systems. Polymer‐based bilayer bending actuators, in which the dissimilar thermal expansion of two materials is exploited, represent widely investigated actuation elements, but one limitation of this design approach is that the thermal expansion coefficient of polymers is generally small. Herein, it is shown that this problem is mitigated using a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer with a crystallizable soft segment. The domains formed by the latter reversibly melt and crystallize in a convenient temperature range (30–60 °C), whereas the hydrogen‐bonded urethane hard segments serve as physical crosslinks that provide mechanical integrity and elastic behavior beyond this temperature. Melting the polyester results in a large nonlinear thermal expansion and thus actuation, in a narrow temperature range. The electrically controlled bilayer actuators are created by combining this material with cellulose acetate and integrating resistive heating electrodes. Optionally these devices are equipped with a thermally controlled supramolecular polymer adhesive “gripper.”",

For in vivo/in vitro therapeutic applications, high movement velocity is necessary for efficient operation on targets with high throughput. Herein, a fast underwater microstructured spherical surface walker (i.e., microsphere) driven by a rotating magnetic field is reported, and the effect of the surface microstructures on the mobility of microspheres is explored. Compared with the motion of smooth sphere walking nearby a smooth plane, a twofold and a fourfold increases in the velocity are found for the microstructured sphere (MS) walking nearby a smooth plane and a patterned plane, respectively. A hydrodynamic model of MS moving nearby a plane is used to reveal the underlying mechanism of the enhanced motion, which demonstrates that the slippage of fluid on the microstructured surface and the interaction between fluid and microstructures are crucial to the motion enhancement. The result of motion enhancement induced by microstructures can be used for the design of fast biomimetic microrobots, anti‐adhesion, cell manipulation, and targeted drug delivery in complex aqueous environments.",

    "abstract": "Unlike artificial intelligent systems based on computers which have to be programmed for specific tasks, the human brain “self‐programs” in real time to create new tactics and adapt to arbitrary environments. Computers embedded in artificial intelligent systems execute arbitrary signal‐processing algorithms to outperform humans at specific tasks, but without the real‐time self‐programming functionality, they are preprogrammed by humans, fail in unpredictable environments beyond their preprogrammed domains, and lack general intelligence in arbitrary environments. Herein, a synaptic resistor circuit that self‐programs in arbitrary and unpredictable environments in real time is demonstrated. By integrating the synaptic signal processing, memory, and correlative learning functions in each synaptic resistor, the synaptic resistor circuit processes signals and self‐programs the circuit concurrently in real time with an energy efficiency about six orders higher than those of computers. In comparison with humans and a preprogrammed computer, the self‐programming synaptic resistor circuit dynamically modifies its algorithm to control a morphing wing in an unpredictable aerodynamic environment to improve its performance function with superior self‐programming speeds and accuracy. The synaptic resistor circuits potentially circumvent the fundamental limitations of computers, leading to a new intelligent platform with real‐time self‐programming functionality for artificial general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The dissemination of edge devices drives new requirements for security primitives for privacy protection and chip authentication. Memristors are promising entropy sources for realizing hardware‐based security primitives due to their intrinsic randomness and stochastic properties. With the adoption of memristors among several technologies that meet essential requirements, the neural network physically unclonable function (NNPUF) is proposed, a novel PUF design that takes advantage of deep learning algorithms. The proposed design integrated with the memristor array can be constructed easily because the system does not depend on write operation accuracy. To contemplate a nondifferentiable module during training, an original concept of loss called PUF loss is devised. Iterations of weight update with the loss function bring about optimal NNPUF performance. It is shown that the design achieves a near‐ideal 50% average value for security metrics, including uniformity, diffuseness, and uniqueness. This means that the NNPUF satisfies practical quality standards for security primitives by training with PUF loss. It is also demonstrated that the NNPUF response has an unassailable resistance against deep learning‐based modeling attacks, which is verified by the near‐50% prediction model accuracy.",

However, time‐to‐digital converters (TDCs) in conventional ToF sensors are usually bulky, complex, and exhibit large delay and power loss. To overcome these issues, a resistive time‐of‐flight (R‐ToF) sensor that can measure the depth information in an analog domain by mimicking the biological process of spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP) is proposed herein. The R‐ToF sensors based on integrated avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with memristive intelligent matters achieve a scan depth of up to 55 cm (≈89% accuracy and 2.93 cm standard deviation) and low power consumption (0.5 nJ/step) without TDCs. The in‐depth computing is realized via R‐ToF 3D imaging and memristive classification. This R‐ToF system opens a new pathway for miniaturized and energy‐efficient neuromorphic vision engineering that can be harnessed in light‐detection and ranging (LiDAR), automotive vehicles, biomedical in vivo imaging, and augmented/virtual reality.",

However, no laboratory‐based artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic system has been applied in current clinical practice due to the lack of robustness and interpretability. Although many attempts have been made, it is still difficult for doctors to adopt the existing machine learning (ML) patterns in interpreting laboratory (lab) big data. Here, a knowledge‐and‐data‐driven laboratory diagnostic system is developed, termed AI‐based Lab tEst tO diagNosis (AI LEON), by integrating an innovative knowledge graph analysis framework and “mixed XGboost and Genetic Algorithm (MiXG)” technique to simulate the doctor's laboratory‐based diagnosis. To establish AI LEON, we included 89 116 949 laboratory data and 10 423 581 diagnosis data points from 730 113 participants. Among them, 686 626 participants were recruited for training and validating purposes with the remaining for testing purposes. AI LEON automatically identified and analyzed 2071 lab indexes, resulting in multiple disease recommendations that involved 441 common diseases in ten organ systems. AI LEON exhibited outstanding transparency and interpretability in three universal clinical application scenarios and outperformed human physicians in interpreting lab reports. AI LEON is an advanced intelligent system that enables a comprehensive interpretation of lab big data, which substantially improves the clinical diagnosis.",

A negative differential resistance is observed in the RESET process. The result shows that the observed resistive switching is strongly associated with oxygen‐vacancies (OVs) in oxides with dominating contributions from electron hopping between OV trap sites, and can be controlled by oxygen annealing and electron injection. Remarkably, a method is developed by continuous RESET processes to increase the high resistance state by 1–3 orders of magnitude, with an on/off ratio enhanced from ≈10 to ≈10 4 . The work provides a promising pathway to understand conduction mechanism of oxides memristors and promote its application in RRAM and in‐memory computing.",

Although speech signals are considered the best modes of communication in HMC, background noise often interferes with these signals. Therefore, research focused on integrating lip‐reading technology into HMC has gained significant attention. However, lip‐reading functions effectively only in well‐lit environments. In contrast, HMC may occur daily in dark environments owing to potential energy shortages, increased exploration in darkness, nighttime emergencies, etc. Herein, a possible method for HMC in the dark mode is presented, which is realized based on deep learning motion patterns of persistent luminescence (PL) of the skin surrounding the lips. An ultrasoft PL–polymer composite patch is used to record the motion pattern of the skin during speech in the dark. It is found that visual geometric group network (VGGNET‐5) and residual neural network (ResNet‐34) could predict spoken words in darkness with test accuracies of 98.5% and 98.75%, respectively. Furthermore, these models could effectively distinguish similar‐sounding words such as “around” and “ground.” Dark‐mode communication can allow a wide range of people, including disabled people with limited dexterity and voice tremors, to communicate with artificial intelligence machines.",

Traditional interaction methods using robot proprioceptors rely on robot dynamic models that complicate robotic controls and narrow their adaptabilities. Herein, an intelligent interactive control method is proposed based on a generalized virtual spring‐damping force‐touch mechanism using haptic e‐skin, which converts contact forces and contact positions on the e‐skin to generalized forces for implementing robot compliance controls of multidimensional movements. By touching the e‐skin mounted on a robot arm, a human can readily manipulate the robot arm, achieving flexible movement and rotation. An intelligent architecture of human–robot‐in‐the‐loop is proposed to accomplish versatile interactive and collaborative actions.

By employing integrated nanoscopic correction (iNC) designed to eliminate depolarization effects, which compromise background elimination, a real‐time algorithm to subtract and increment orthogonal pairs of polarizations for real‐time nanoscale background elimination is introduced. The ability to analyze orthogonal pairs at high speed over the entire polarization range is currently difficult to achieve using conventional methods. By processing orthogonal pairs in real time, this method minimizes movement artifacts during the background elimination process. Nanometer spatial stability which enables two orders of magnitude increase in signal‐to‐noise ratio of cellular metallic nanoprobes is shown.

    "abstract": "During evolution, plants have developed various functional principles for sealing and healing wounds. Prime examples are succulent leaves of Delosperma cooperi that seal external injuries within 60 min. Cross sections of intact leaves show a centripetal multilayer structure consisting of five tissues alternately under tensile and compressive prestress. Injuries destroy this mechanical equilibrium causing a deformation of the entire leaf until a new equilibrium is reached, and the wound edges meet, thereby sealing the fissure. Following this functional principle of D. cooperi leaves, a planar three‐layer materials system consisting of a sheet of shape memory polymer (SMP) with programmed temporary geometry sandwiched between two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets is developed. After the individual sheets are bonded at room temperature, the application of heat treatment without mechanical constraints results in a prestressed multilayer system. The damage‐triggered bending behavior of the three‐layer system is described by means of an analytical model and feasibility tests establishing the self‐sealing functionality of the system. Thus, a biomimetic materials system with a self‐sealing function within the framework of a biomimetic biology push process is developed. However, the discussion herein has gone beyond the biological model, because the self‐sealing three‐layer materials system can additionally serve as an actuator.",

However, the optimization performance of generative networks is restricted by the increasing discrepancy between the optimized input and the prescribed input domain as the design loop increases. Herein, a correction technique is incorporated into generative deep neural network (GDNN) and generative deep convolutional neural network (GDCNN). The correction is performed by pulling the machine learning (ML)‐optimized inputs back to the prescribed domain at certain interval during the optimization process instead of only postprocessing at the end. A DM system with two phases, i.e., the matrix phase and the pore phase, is used for the structural design. The datasets are produced using a numerical model and describe the relationship between the material structure and the elastic modulus and tensile strength. The results show that the optimization effectiveness of corrected GDNN/GDCNN significantly improves given the fact that more structures converge to the best structures and fewer nonrepetitive structures are left after optimization, which helps to search for the best structures and decreases the computational burden when verifying the ML‐recommended structures. The corrected GDNN and GDCNN also manage to find structures with higher tensile strength in the new inverse design.",

Herein, a data‐driven control method that uses a continuum laparoscope to adjust the FOV by tracking the surgical instruments is presented. A Koopman‐based system identification method is first applied to linearize the nonlinear system. Shifted Chebyshev polynomials are used to construct observation functions that transfer low‐dimension observations to high‐dimension ones. The Koopman operator is approximated using a finite‐dimensional estimation method. An optimal controller is further developed according to the trained linear dynamic model. Furthermore, a learning‐based pose estimation framework is designed to detect keypoints on surgical instruments and provides visual feedback for the control system. Compared with other detection methods, the proposed scheme achieves a higher detection precision and provides more optional keypoints for tracking. Simulation and experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed control method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can automatically adjust the field of continuum laparoscope by tracking surgical instruments in real time and satisfy the clinical requirements.",

The selection of a suitable V th extraction method is a complicated task because it involves a trade‐off between accuracy and simplicity according to the device scheme. Herein, an automatic‐prediction method of the MOSFET V th using machine learning (ML) is proposed. The ML model is trained with V th , extracted using different methods (2nd derivative, constant current, and Y ‐function) and from various kinds of FETs (finFET, 2D FET, and metal–oxide thin‐film transistors). The concept of threshold ratio ( R th ) for universal V th prediction, which considers the normalized V th within certain V G ranges, is suggested. The precision and accuracy of ML models are statistically verified by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error, and mean coefficients of determination ( R 2 ) values. The universal ML model ( k ‐nearest neighbor (kNN)) achieves 1.35% of RMSE and 0.98 of R 2 for the best score. The ML model eliminates the ambiguity in V th extraction and provides objective V th prediction for most FET schemes used in the semiconductor industry and research field.",

The actuation of TOCNs is driven by the interfacing 2D PtTe 2 layers whose electrothermal proficiency precisely controls their hydration/dehydration states sensitive to mechanical deformation. These vertically stacked TOCN/2D PtTe 2 actuators present excellent actuation characteristics such as high linearity of bending curvature versus applied voltage and well‐preserved reversibility during cyclic operations. Most notably, they exhibit an extremely large weight‐lifting ratio, i.e., ≈1000 times the mass of the TOCN layers, confirming superior mechanical robustness. Furthermore, complicated actuations such as twisting in a 3D manner are demonstrated by judiciously controlling the surface wettability of TOCN layers. This study unveils opportunities for CNFs and 2D materials for actuator applications, as well as suggests new design strategies broadly applicable to soft robotics and biomimetic devices.",

Nevertheless, PSG is a time and money consuming test, and patients have to wait long for arranging a PSG test in a hospital. In light of this, portable and wearable tools for OSA classification have been developed recently as a low‐cost and easy‐to‐use screening method before undergoing PSG. Using unsegmented electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, a deep neural network (DNN)‐based model is developed here to categorize OSA severity with the following features. First, the model takes unsegmented ECG signals recorded overnight as input, and then generates a four‐level scale as output. Since all the input ECG signals are unsegmented, the tremendous amount of effort spent on signal annotation can be fully saved. Second, the largest amount of data is used to test the model and consequently provide a high generalization ability, as compared with others in the literature. The overall outperformance of this work is highlighted at the end of this article, and this work is validated as an easy‐to‐use and effective screening tool for OSA accordingly.",

Herein, a methodology that enables predicting rwTTD is developed. First, the robust performance of the model in predicting rwTTD across populations of similar or distinct properties with simulated data using a variety of commonly used base learners in machine learning is demonstrated. Then, the robust performance of the approach both within‐cohort and cross‐disease using real‐world observational data of pembrolizumab for advanced lung cancer and head neck cancer is demonstrated. This study establishes a generic pipeline for real‐world time on treatment prediction, which can be extended to any base machine learners and drugs. Currently, there is no existing machine learning approach established for predicting population‐wise rwTTD, despite that it is an essential metric to report real‐world drug efficacy. Therefore, we believe our study opens a new investigation area of rwTTD prediction, and provides an innovative approach to probe this problem and other problems involving population‐wise predictions.

Still, variations in the memristor induce reliability issues for practical applications. Previous error detection and correction modules in the inmemory logic gates can handle the errors but only account for nonswitching errors of the output memristor, while the highly probable switching error of the output memristor is neglected, reducing overall efficiency. Moreover, the module operations use other added stateful logic gates, which may add errors. Herein, modules to handle both nonswitching and switching error cases within the three average steps using reliable logic gates consisting of five memristors are proposed. Detecting both error cases allows logic gates to be still operated in the optimized region for high‐energy efficiency and stability. In addition, combining two different logic families of stateful and sequential logic gates provides the reliability of the stateful logic gates and a possible solution to the peripheral complexity of cascading sequential logic gates. Although detection and correction are demonstrated in NOR and NAND logic gates with the memristor model, the other logic gates can be applied with the same algorithm with the appropriate module‐enable signal and input‐checker bits.",

To tackle this challenge, it is important to design appropriate regimens based on data regarding the species identity of bacterial pathogen concerned, as well as their antimicrobial‐resistance genotypes and phenotypes. Herein, a novel method that utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze Raman spectra to identify microbes and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics at both genotype and phenotype level is developed. A total of 130 strains of Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus capitis with known minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of commonly used antimicrobial agents are included in this study. After the models are configured and trained, long short‐term memory (LSTM) based Raman platform is developed and is found to be able to offer an accuracy of 89.9 ± 1.1%, 82.4 ± 0.6%, and 60.4–89.2% in bacterial species classification, identification of antimicrobial‐resistance genes (ARGs), and prediction of resistance phenotypes, respectively. This novel method exhibits higher level of accuracy than those using the machine learning algorithms. The results indicate that Raman spectroscopy combined with LSTM analysis can be used for rapid bacterial species identification, detection of ARGs, and assessment of drug‐resistance phenotypes.",

Conventional hot‐spot engineering methods still suffer from complexity, high process cost, and static generation of hot‐spots, thus, underperforming particularly in the application side. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy based on plasmonic nanoparticles decorated cilia‐inspired magnetic actuators that enable highly accessible millimeter‐sized hot‐spot generation via bending motion under a magnetic field. The hot‐spot formation is shown to be reversible and tunable, and leads to excellent Raman signal enhancements of up to ≈120 folds compared to the unactuated platforms. Accessible electromagnetic field magnification in the platforms can be manipulated by controlling magnetic field strength, which is further supported by finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations. As a proof‐of‐concept demonstration, a centipede‐inspired robot is fabricated and used for sample collection/analysis in a target environment. Our results demonstrate an effective strategy in soft actuator platforms for reversible and tunable large‐area hot‐spot formation, which provides a promising guidance toward studying the fundamentals of hot‐spot generation and advancing real‐life plasmonic applications.",

However, the advent of advanced functional materials, compliant structures/mechanisms, and flexible fabrication techniques has brought new evolution directions to robotics. These technologies enrich the robots' actuation strategies, improving their performance of small robots while simplifying the complexity of the system and thus making it possible to be applied in diverse scenarios, such as disaster rescue, medical, and environmental exploration. In nature, small organisms have shown numerous efficient survival strategies. They can easily achieve locomotion tasks with low energy consumption. For example, dragonflies complete long flights with the help of wind, and stenus (one kind of rove beetle) uses the surface tension of liquids to dodge prey quickly. Insects are usually considered to be agile, efficient, and intelligent, which is the same requirement as for small robots. Yet the corresponding bioinspired design strategies bring new opportunities and challenges to the development of small‐scale robots.

These artificial cilia can operate their sensing and actuation individually to sense the flow speed and collaboratively transport objects. More importantly, they can also sense the viscosity of the fluid and the distance from the wall by beating and feeling their own motion. In the latter function, two different sensing modes (modes 1 and 2) are proposed for low and high Reynolds numbers. They are investigated through both computational fluid dynamics and experiments. It is found that mode 1 can sense a wall distance up to 3 times the body length of the cilium, while mode 2 can sense up to 2 times. Such sensing of distance can be further converted into the ability to compute the morphology of the boundary inside the fluid.

    "abstract": "Origami and kirigami have become foundations for programmable sheet materials that fold along flexible creases. However, since they are originated from folded paper that allows no in‐plane sheet deformation, they suffer from limited folding energy arising from narrow creases, and large varieties of crease patterns are completely non‐foldable due to over‐constraint. Herein, a new strategy that breaks the limitations of the conventional crease‐induced folding kinematics by leveraging a folding effect from in‐plane shear deformation of the sheet is reported, and it is referred to as shearigami. It is shown that shearigami extends the realm of foldable structures to include the strictly non‐foldable origami patterns such as degree‐3 vertices, and the sheet‐stored self‐folding energy outperforms the crease‐stored energy by a potentially two orders of magnitude. Shearigami also inherits the mathematical framework of paper folding and provides a unified view that regards origami and kirigami as two special cases. Herein, self‐folding shearigami models are experimentally demonstrated based on previously non‐foldable patterns, including artificial muscles with rapid shear‐induced extension. The way is paved toward active structures and architectured materials with design freedom and self‐folding capabilities beyond origami and kirigami.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge of pneumatically powered soft robotic devices is the scalability of fluidic control systems to address each actuated degree of freedom, as the required electromechanical valves are bulky and expensive. Previous solutions have compromised the reprogrammability and/or the bandwidth of the fluidic system. This article describes and models a fluidic subsystem, a fluidic matrix circuit (FMC) , that enables the independent control of many () actuators using a limited number () of electromechanical valves. The fundamental unit, a fluidic logic module (FLM) , generates a bidirectional pressure signal (vacuum or positive pressure) based on the state of the mass flow through it. Thus and array of pneumatic actuators can be addressed individually using an array of FLMs integrated into a matrix (i.e., an FMC), with electromechanical valves to switch the mass flow through each row and column of the matrix. The resulting refresh rates are an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches. This concept with a prototype FMC able to control 25 actuators using 10 electromechanical valves for applications including a fluidic shape display and a wearable haptic vest is demonstrated. This approach could enable more complex and sophisticated soft robotic devices with scalable control hardware.",

    "abstract": "The current paper addresses the problem of stabilizing multiple aerial robots cooperatively transporting a cable‐suspended payload by an aeromechanic method. Instead of relying on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) or vision and communication for agents to actively estimate and control the state of the multibody dynamics, lightweight air dampers to make the multiagent system inherently stable at its equilibrium state, permitting the robots to safely carry a load at a constant velocity are employed. This is achieved without additional state estimation or active correction. The proposed framework is proven stable and verified by simulations and extensive flight experiments. Lightweight mechanical dampers (under 7 g) are shown to be effective in attenuating undesired oscillations and overcoming disturbances. To this end, a team of four robots cooperatively transporting a payload over 20 m in open space is demonstrated, and three robots safely transporting a point‐mass payload over a distance of 45 m outdoors. The promising outcomes highlight the benefits of the passive strategy, which demands minimal hardware components and computation to realize the sophisticated aerial transport task.",

    "abstract": "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool in prostate lesion assessment. However, training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) inevitably involves magnetic resonance (MR) images from multiple cohorts. There always exists variation in scanning protocol among cohorts, inducing significant changes in data distribution between source and target domains. This challenge has greatly limited clinical adoption on a large scale. Herein, a coarse mask‐guided deep domain adaptation network (CMD 2 A‐Net) is proposed to develop a fully automated framework for prostate lesion detection and classification (PLDC). No category or mask label is required from the target domain. A coarse segmentation module is trained to cover the possible lesion‐related regions, so that attention maps can be generated to dedicate the local feature extraction of lesions within those regions. Experiments are performed on 512 mpMRI sets from datasets of PROSTATEx (330 sets) and two cohorts, A (74 sets) and B (108 sets). Using ensemble learning, CMD 2 A‐Net accomplishes an AUC of 0.921 in cohort A and 0.913 in cohort B, demonstrating its transferability from a large‐scale public dataset PROSTATEx to small‐scale target domains. Results from an ablation study also support its effectiveness in classification between benign and malignant lesions, compared to the state‐of‐the‐art models.

To detect the MGs, the swept frequency capacitive sensing technology to is adopted capture the MG signals and the random forest model to detect the MGs effectively is applied. 16 participants are recruited in the pilot study to verify the correlation between stress level and MG frequency. The experimental results further verify that stress level is highly related to other negative emotions that should be studied while handling high stress levels.",

    "abstract": "Dysarthria is common in movement disorders, such as Wilson's disease (WD), Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease. Dysarthria severity assessment is often indispensable for the management of these diseases. However, such assessment is usually labor‐intensive, time‐consuming, and expensive. To seek efficient and cost‐effective solutions for dysarthria assessment, an artificial intelligence (AI)‐powered acoustic analysis system is proposed and its performance in a valuable sample of WD, an ideal disease model with mainly mixed dysarthria, is verified. A test‐retest reliability analysis yields excellent reproducibility in the acoustic measures (mean intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.81). Then, a system for dysarthria assessment is trained with WD patients ( n = 65) and sex‐matched healthy controls ( n = 65) using a machine learning approach. The system achieves reasonable performance in evaluating dysarthria severity with either stepwise classification or regression (all areas under the curve &gt;80%; mean absolute error = 6.25, r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.0001). The diadochokinesis and sustained phonation tasks contribute the most to prediction, and the corresponding acoustic features can provide significant and independent contributions. The present study demonstrates the feasibility and good performance of the AI‐powered acoustic analysis framework, offering the potential to facilitate early screening and subsequent management of dysarthria.",

Multiple performance characteristics are determined by conducting controlled experiments. Various methods are demonstrated to control the fuel‐based valve system and the actuation of the chemically driven artificial muscle. Lastly, to evaluate its functionality, the curling movement of a robotic finger using BiMAM is demonstrated.",

In response to these challenges, a novel hybrid residual SNN (HRSNN) is proposed that incorporates a new neuron circuit and a weight‐dependent loss function. The HRSNN in a high‐intensity noise environment is evaluated using the neuromorphic DVS128 Gesture dataset. The achieved accuracy rate of 92.71% is only 2.15% lower than that of the noise‐free environment.

Movement‐type simulations, viz., the esports game Street Fighter (SF), recapitulate the complex multicharacter interactions and, concurrently, generate the millisecond‐level control challenges of human athletes. Herein, the physical and mental signatures of the SF agent (it is called SF R2) are controlled by utilizing a previously unreported model‐free, natural, deep reinforcement learning algorithm “Decay‐based Phase‐change memristive character‐type Proximal Policy Optimization” (DP‐PPO) through an assemblage of hybrid case‐type training processes; and an integrated training configuration for time‐trial evaluations, as well as competitions with a world's best SF player, is developed. A short length of time utilized by the SF R2 to defeat the opponent and, simultaneously, maintaining a good health level is achieved, as well as excellent handling of imperfect information settings. Training studies reveal a moderate maneuver etiquette in the SF R2, along with rapid, effective head‐to‐head competitions with one of the world's best SF player. This paves the way for achieving a broadly applicable training scheme, capable of quickly controlling complicated‐movement systems in fields where agents should observe unspecified human norms.",

However, many of them are still controlled by rigid solenoid valves and microcontrollers. Recent research works have introduced various electronics‐free computational devices for soft robotic applications.

The manual circuit design, fabrication, and piping process can bring inefficient circuit layout, redundant tubing, unreliable fittings, and potentially human mistakes. This work presents an open‐source toolbox for automatically designing pneumatic circuits for soft robotic applications. The toolbox takes the desired computation function along with some space constraints as inputs, and generates a 3D‐printable file of a pneumatic circuit that can be fabricated and used directly. This is achieved by efficiently positioning the logic gates and air channels while considering the workspace constraints, fabrication limits, material cost, and system complexity. The versatility of the design automation algorithm has been tested with two different truth tables and six different workspaces. The work also showcases utilizing the toolbox to design a computational circuit that governs the movements of a soft robotic hand with four pneumatic actuators.",

They exhibit promising potential in a wide variety of applications, particularly for tasks in clinic workspaces.

Herein, a computer‐aided teleoperation platform is developed to operate a soft millirobot, with its feedback control being conducted behind‐the‐scenes, bridging the user's inputs directly with the millirobot's actions to offer an intuitive control. This system enables untrained users to conveniently control the position and actions of the millirobot inside a human stomach phantom by pointing‐and‐clicking on a real‐time video monitor or using a keyboard. The platform automatically materializes the user's instructions by maneuvering a robotic arm with a tip‐mounted magnet to exert a magnetic field to induce the desired response from the millirobot. Experiments show that the system allows the user to intuitively operate the millirobot and deliver its cargo without splitting their attention to monitor the workspace or to calculate the constantly changing control parameters. This platform can lower the barrier for healthcare practitioners without engineering expertise to adopt miniature robotic systems into their workflow and realize these systems’ promising potential.",

Accurately identifying the surface deformation of elastomers has been a key issue for understanding the contact state in a soft touch. However, effective monitoring of the deformed surface topography during soft‐touch processes is difficult due to the complexity of interfacial deformation. Herein, the optical detection method based on an ideal diffuse reflection model is proposed to monitor the deformation of the elastomer, enabling the acquisition of a spatially continuous deformation of the surface in a soft touch. This optical system with the parallel incident light can distinguish the elastomers’ surface deformation field by constructing the correlation between the reflected light irradiance and the surface deformation angle. This method allows for the perception of the contact area. Through the deep learning method, the recognition rate can reach more than 84.24% when there are slight differences in the contact of objects with different geometric shapes. The design offers valuable insights for contact state detection tasks and facilitates soft‐touch sensing functions through the high precision of optical signal acquisition.",

Addressing this, the article introduces an ultrasonically powered light delivery implant (LDI) utilizing lead-free piezoelectric material (Li0.08K0.46Na0.46) NbO3 to harvest energy from external ultrasonic waves. The prototype includes a piezoelectric cube, a chip fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology, and a microscale light-emitting diode (μ-LED) for optogenetics. Achieving an end-to-end efficiency of 0.75%, the LDI holds promise for various optogenetic studies, particularly in animal studies targeting specific brain areas for treating Parkinson’s disease. The delivered optical power on the μ-LED surface, at 14.1mWmm2, presents applicability to diverse studies involving specific opsins.",

    "abstract": "Computing‐in‐memory (CIM) is a promising approach for overcoming the memory‐wall problem in conventional von‐Neumann architectures. This is done by performing certain computation tasks directly in the storage subsystem without transferring data between storage and processing units. Stateful and non‐stateful CIM concepts are recently attracting lots of interest, which are demonstrated as logical complete, energy efficient, and compatible with dense crossbar structures. However, sneak‐path currents in passive resistive random access memory (RRAM) crossbars degrade the operation reliability and require the usage of active 1 Transistor–1 Resistance (1T‐1R) bitcell designs. In this article, the arithmetic performance and reliability are investigated based on experimental measurements and variability‐aware circuit simulations. Herein, it is aimed for the evaluation of logic operations specifically with fully integrated 1T–1R crossbar devices. Based on these operations, an N‐bit full adder with optimized energy consumption and latency is demonstrated by combining stateful and non‐stateful CIM logic styles with regard to the specific conditions in active 1T–1R RRAM crossbars.",

    "abstract": "Metallic plastic deformation involves complex microstructural changes and defect evolution, posing challenges in predicting and controlling the quality and performance of formed parts. Therefore, a pressing demand exists for a proficient online defect‐sensing system to monitor defects evolution continuously within components during plastic deformation in real time. This article proposes an intelligent online sensing approach for detecting defects in metallic plastic forming based on acoustic emission (AE) and machine learning. A comparative analysis is conducted on AE amplitude signals, stress–strain curves, and defect evolution during the tensile process of TA15 titanium alloy specimens under different stress states. It is found that the defect formation process can be divided into four stages based on the AE amplitude signals. A convolutional neural network model for intelligent defect sensing is established. It leverages transfer learning and is grounded in the relationship between AE signals and the evolution of internal defects. The prediction accuracy using different pretrained models is investigated and compared. It is discerned that utilizing GoogleNet as the pretrained model offers the swiftest training pace with a prediction accuracy of 97.57%. This approach enables intelligent online sensing of internal defect evolution in metal plastic deformation processes.",

Although various underwater robotics have been proposed and developed, the requirements of noise‐free, environmental tolerance, and low energy consumption in hovering manipulation, are still attracting a lot of attention for underwater tasks. Herein, a submersible soft‐robotic platform driven by the self‐contained liquid–vapor phase transition is developed. The proposed soft‐robotic platform precisely modulates its buoyancy, showing an excellent positioning ability underwater. The proposed soft‐robotic platform performs reversible rise‐and‐sink motions underwater, and generate a buoyancy force of 0.93 N (131% of its weight) with an accuracy of ±2.5 mN, at a heating temperature of 63 °C. It shows that more than 40% of the total buoyancy change is achieved within 55 s, and the platform hovers in any depth in a range of 450 mm (limited by the adopted water container) in 18 s, with positioning fluctuation of 17.42 mm. This soft‐robotic platform demonstrates active vertical motions in water and suggests a feasible approach to develop noisy‐free and high‐reliability underwater robots, which guide the further design of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).",

The aim herein is to establish an open‐access web‐based prediction system, which estimates CDI patients’ mortality and recurrence outcomes and explains machine learning prediction with patients’ characteristics. Prognostic models are developed using four various types of machine learning algorithms and the statistical logistics regression model utilizing over 15 000 CDI patients from 41 hospitals in Hong Kong. The boosting‐based machine learning algorithm gradient boosting machine (GBM) (Mortality AUC: 0.7878; Recurrence AUC: 0.7076) outperforms statistical models (Mortality AUC: 0.7573; Recurrence AUC: 0.6927) and other machine learning algorithms. As the difficulty to interpret complex machine learning results limits their use in the medical area, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) are adapted to identify which features are crucial to the machine learning models and associate them with clinical findings. SHAP analysis shows that older age, reduced albumin levels, higher creatinine levels, and higher white blood cell count are the most highly associated mortality features, which is consistent with existing clinical findings.

The considered scenario consists of an industrial warehouse with laser guided vehicles (LGVs), manual forklifts, and people. In the considered localization setup, three RCMs are placed on an LGV and an additional RCM acts as a Target Node (TN), whose position needs to be estimated. As the laser guarantees perfect knowledge of the LGV position inside the building, the three RCMs on board can be considered as Anchor Nodes (ANs) with known positions. The TN is supposed to be placed on a manual forklift or in the belt of a person inside the warehouse. Two localization algorithms that rely on the distance estimates between pairs of UWB sensors positioned on the automated guided vehicles (AGV) and the UWB sensor that acts as TN are proposed. Extensive performance results based on an experimental campaign performed in an industrial warehouse is also shown, for different TN positions around the LGV.",

An interesting alternative is to use intrinsic features of the swimmers, which allow them to exhibit chemotaxis. Such a built‐in “intelligence” enables more complex trajectories, relying on mechanisms that can be considered very basic analogs of decision‐making processes. Herein, autonomous light‐emitting chemoelectronic swimmers are presented that are able to navigate along trajectories with increasing complexity. Their decision‐making capacities are characterized by recording the light emitted along their path by a fully integrated light‐emitting diode.

To understand the barriers in designing an educational scheme for those often missed by other initiatives, a pilot study was conducted. Twenty‐one semi‐structured interviews were held with Thought‐Leaders, Industry, Adult Educators, and Members of the Public. A thematic analysis was used to allow themes not previously thought of to arise. Looking at the findings through the lens of leaving no one behind presents three themes, which need to be addressed for education to be successful. First, as well as education for those designing RAI and education for everyday life, there needs to be education for those working with RAI. Second, work is needed to overcome preconceptions. The views of learners on RAI, potential “gatekeeping” of experts, and attitudes to training from industry can create barriers to education. Finally, education should be co‐designed with communities to ensure it is relevant to the learners' needs and lives.",

In this method, the gradients of a cost function with respect to the weights are calculated directly by sequentially applying a small temporal change to each weight and then measuring the change in cost value. DGC achieves a similar accuracy to that of BP while performing a handwritten digit classification task, validating its training feasibility. In particular, DGC can be applied to analog hardware‐based convolutional NNs (CNNs), which is considered to be a challenging task, enabling appropriate on‐chip training. A hybrid method is also proposed that efficiently combines DGC and BP for training CNNs, and the method achieves a similar accuracy to that of BP and DGC while enhancing the training speed. Furthermore, networks utilizing DGC maintain a higher level of accuracy than those using BP in the presence of variations in hardware (such as synaptic device conductance and neuron circuit component variations) while requiring fewer circuit components.",

Herein, an asynchronous flight assembly via electrostatic actuation of flapping wings in analogy to the asynchronous mechanism in natural flying insects is demonstrated. The wing motions are driven by the self‐sustained oscillation of metal beams in a steady electric field and regulated by the input voltage between two stationary electrodes, whereas the discharging process occurs repetitively as the oscillating beams hit and exchange charges with the electrodes. Several advancements in the oscillation and flight demonstrations have been achieved: 1) self‐sustainable and asynchronous oscillations for biomimetic flapping‐wing motions with high efficiency, 2) the first takeoff of an asynchronous flight assembly along the fixed electrodes, and 3) the first self‐adaptive hovering assembly via the passive modulation of the flapping frequency and amplitude when a disturbance is introduced.",

    "abstract": "The use of physical paper is often preferred due to its unique physical properties that improve various aspects of reading. However, digital media and information are more engaging, diverse, and up to date, thereby challenging the existence of paper in our everyday life. By combining the two types of media in a seamless way, the interactivity of multimedia content can complement the reading experience, maintaining the unique feel of paper books. The current state of the art addressing this application negatively impacts the reading experience and often does not consider the manufacturability and sustainability of the proposed solutions. Herein, the Magic Bookmark, a technical solution for automatically recognizing the open page of a physical book, to provide seamless augmentation without changing the user's behavior and experience significantly is introduced. Three alternative solutions are implemented, with various degrees of ease of use, manufacturability at scale, and reliability of data reading. The optimal realization is found to be a reflective optical readout array, for which routes to implementation that may allow blending the graphical and functional aspects of the augmented book are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Soft actuators and flexible devices such as stretchable sensors, with their inherent compliance, can exhibit large deformation and high adaptability to complex environments. By utilizing various actuation mechanisms, soft actuators have been applied to versatile manipulation, bionic soft robots, energy harvesting, and medical surgery across scales. Moreover, to endow soft robots with abilities of perception and human-machine interaction, stretchable and wearable sensors have been introduced in recent years. These flexible sensors are capable of detecting external physiological signals, e.g., pressure, temperature, and provide feedback for the control system. To date, owing to advances in material science, various types of smart materials have been developed for soft robots and sensors, such as pH-responsive hydrogels used for 4D printing, dielectric elastomers, liquid crystal elastomers, and liquid metal. These smart materials enable soft structures to achieve programmable shape-morphing and perceive changes in environments. On the other hand, the development of manufacturing techniques has revolutionized the construction of soft actuators and flexible devices. For instance, multi-materials printing techniques and hybrid assembly, i.e. combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, result in new types of 2-D and 3-D flexible devices with controllable material distribution. Also, progress in control strategies and systems, such as built-in feedback control, has led to the realization of high-performance soft robotic systems. With the growing interest in soft actuators and flexible devices, considerable achievements have been made in this interdisciplinary field. To summarize recent advances and updates in this field, we organized this special issue of Advanced Intelligent Systems which focuses on \"Intelligent soft actuators and flexible devices\". This issue brings a collection of papers covering a wide range of materials, fabrication techniques, actuation, and potential applications for soft actuators and flexible devices, which can be basically divided into the following three key aspects: Soft materials with stimuli-responsive or conductive properties have demonstrated great potential in constructing flexible devices and robots. For instance, liquid crystal polymers actuated by UV or visible light have been used for intelligent actuators. To enhance the capability of liquid crystal polymers, Yanlei Yu and co-workers developed a facile strategy to synthesize reactive azobenzene-containing liquid crystal polymers (azo-LCPs) and photo-deformable fibers (article number 2000254). These reactive azo-LCPs exhibit stable liquid crystallinity and reversible photochemical properties. In addition, metal oxides/hydroxides materials such as cobalt oxides/hydroxides and manganese oxides can undergo electrochemical actuation behavior through volume-changing redox reactions. Alfonso H.W. Ngan et al. reviewed a class of stimuli-responsive oxides/hydroxides with turbostratic crystal structures (article number 2000215). Liquid metal alloys are widely used in stretchable strain sensors due to their high electrical conductivity under stretch conditions. Run-wei Li and co-workers used selective wetting and transferring process to fabricate a liquid metal-based resistive strain sensor that exhibits broad strain sensing range, ultralow detection limit, high mechanical robustness, and good repeatability (article number 2000235). The flexible sensor exhibits minimal hysteresis and fast response and demonstrates great potential in human health and motion monitoring, and virtual reality applications. To improve practical outcomes of soft actuators and robots under complex environments, developing suitable and reliable actuation and control strategies is indispensable. Due to the capabilities of generating large deformation and high force output, pneumatic actuation becomes one of the most promising actuation strategies for soft robots. Guoying Gu and co-workers presented a planar laser cutting and stacking fabrication (PLCSF) approach to create multimaterial pneumatic soft actuators and robots with complex structures (article number 2000257). Multiple degrees of freedom pneumatic soft robots including bioinspired soft hand and crawling robots are fabricated to verify the effectiveness and scalable capability of the PLCSF approach. Dielectric elastomer actuators have been widely used in artificial muscles and soft robots owing to their fast response and high energy density. Jinsong Leng and co-workers reviewed dielectric elastomer actuators and their applications in soft robots (article number 2000282). This review summarizes the working principle, designs, and challenges of dielectric elastomer actuators. To perform targeted operations inside microenvironments, mobile micromachines with external power sources or chemical fuels are essential. Mahmut Selman Sakar et al. delivered a progress report on on-board control systems for untethered microrobots (article number 2000233). A novel shape-morphing strategy for the construction of intelligent micromachines with the capabilities of self-locking and unlocking is developed by Huiling Duan and her team (article number 2000232). The strategy for developing tunable locking couplings offers broad potentials for micromanipulation and promises benefits in developing intelligent micromachines with great adaptability to complex situations. Soft actuators and flexible devices with shape-changing capability exhibit promising applications in cargo manipulation, energy harvesting, motion monitoring, and medical treatment. Achieving adaptable and effective grasping for various irregular objects has attracted growing attention in the soft robotics field. Li Wen and co-workers developed a bioinspired origami gripper based on the Yoshimura structure to achieve variable effective length and exhibit adaptation to objects with different sizes and shapes (article number 2000251). Biomimetic approach plays an important role in the design and actuation of soft actuators and robots to generate optimized performance. Inspired by natural plants, Ximin He and co-workers reported a liquid crystal elastomer-based sunlight-driven phototropic system that can achieve large-angle reorientation and enhanced light harvesting (article number 2000234). Cilium structures have been widely found in various species and demonstrate capabilities of guiding movements and clearing foreign matters. Yuanjin Zhao and co-workers reviewed recent progress on tailoring flexible artificial cilia actuators and highlighted their applications on particle/fluid manipulation as well as sensors and robots (article number 2000225). Moreover, miniature soft robots are capable of executing various medical tasks. Lianqing Liu and co-workers developed a flexible magnetically controlled continuum robot in a magnetic actuation system, which exhibits improved manipulability and expanded effective workspace in phantoms (article number 2000211). The integration of new actuation strategies and smart materials into robotic systems is crucial to develop a system-engineered miniaturized robot (SEMR). Vineeth Kumar Bandari and Oliver Schmidt reviewed recent developments and challenges in constructing intelligent SEMRs with functionalities including actuation, sensing, and energy supply (article number 2000284). Soft actuators and flexible devices are rapidly growing research fields. We hope the papers in this special issue could attract researchers from different disciplines and promote more interdisciplinary cooperation. We also look forward to more advancement to accelerate the growth of this emerging field.

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) has matured in parallel with advances in computation. This is not a coincidence as taking advantage of the structural freedom afforded by AM requires detailed calculations and an ability to design and process complex structures in three dimensions. However, the ability to program AM systems is not the only way in which computation, and more recently machine learning, have impacted AM as a field. In fact, recent years have seen a number of innovations in AM that have endowed the process with varying degrees of ‘intelligence’ in distinct ways. While many of these are connected, several of these approaches to smart AM are wholly distinct in that they advance different aspects of the state-of-the-art. Our goal in this editorial is to highlight three such dimensions of intelligence in AM and connect them to articles in this special issue of Advanced Intelligent Systems that discuss innovations along these dimensions. These dimensions include advances in the materials and structures produced by AM to make them smarter or more functional, advances in processing to produce better and more reliable products, and advances in using AM as an ecosystem that is more agile and capable than traditional manufacturing (Figure 1). Advances in AM have enabled the fabrication of multimaterial, multiscale, and multifunctional structures. Machine learning and optimization algorithms have extended the structures created by AM with specific functions and desired properties of interest. This is especially useful when it comes to exploring the vast design space offered by AM. Several methods of integrating data-driven tools in various materials design problems in AM are reviewed by Tian et al. (article number 2100014). Specifically, they mention several methods such as genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, topology optimization, high-throughput simulations, among others that can be utilized to design materials to be additively manufactured. Smart engineered multifunctional structures and designs with controlled deformation, self-repair, and sensing characteristics are highlighted by Ji et al. (article number 2000271). Chen et al. reviewed the 3D-printing of smart electroactive materials that form the backbone of printable devices with a wide variety of applications throughout biology, engineering, and chemistry (article number 2100019). They further expand on the use of machine learning methods to aid in the development, design, and manufacturing of electrically conductive materials. These articles delineate the use of AM systems and data-driven approaches to create smart, multifunctional materials and structures. While AM has made large strides in the past decades, challenges still remain when it comes to optimizing the process. In addition to materials design problems, data-driven approaches have been applied to the process parameters of AM for improved resolution and detection of defects. For instance, Zhou et al. created a data-driven mask image planning method based on subpixel shifting in a split second by tuning the process in both temporal and spatial domains to improve printing resolution (article number 2100079). Their experimental results show that the data-driven based mask image calibration and planning techniques can drastically improve the printed part quality without compromising the process efficiency. Nassar et al. have explored using multimaterial fused deposition modeling 3D-printing methods as a method of embedding electrical interconnects from a copper-based conductive polymer composite (article number 2100102). The authors systematically explored the effects of printing conditions and orientations on resolution and conductivity of the printed part. Seifi et al. discussed the presence of process-induced internal defects such as pores and microcracks on the structural durability of parts created by AM. They developed a nondestructive evaluation method of fatigue performance from the process of laser-based AM processes, specifically with a focus on in-situ monitoring of the thermal history (article number 2000268). These show examples of the impact data-driven methods can have on improving AM processing. While AM is but one facet of modern manufacturing, it has the unique feature that it is massively decentralized. As such, AM presents a unique opportunity for building an ecosystem in which knowledge and materials are widely shared and co-developed. In many ways, this community has already evolved through online communities and shared repositories of digital designs. There are many ways that this community, and the ecosystem in which it operates, can advance in ways that enhance the capabilities of AM and its broader role in society. Sustainability is one arena that has recently received attention and Li and Yeo write about how sustainability can be designed into AM (article number 2100069). AM has some obvious advantages in the context of sustainability such as shorter supply chains, but there are challenges when facing the economies of scale presented by centralized manufacturing. Li and Yeo argue that these obstacles can in part be overcome through shared bodies of knowledge related to life cycle analysis, design optimization for sustainability, and recycling. One additional virtue of AM is that systems can be retasked at a moment's notice to adapt to changing circumstances or needs. Raeymaekers et al. write about how this versatility could be used to make AM a resilient backbone of production for disaster scenarios (article number 2100121). Such a “rideshare-like” model has the potential for leveraging decentralized manufacturing to dynamically meet manufacturing needs of individuals or small companies. These examples highlight some of the advances that are possible with the collective action of the AM community. While these three dimensions of AM represent areas of high present research interest, they are by no means the only ways in which AM is advancing. Indeed, the natural partnership of AM and the advancing fields of machine learning, computation, and widespread connectivity are only in its infancy. We hope that this special issue will draw attention to the diversity of ways in which AM can be enriched through this partnership. Keith A.

    "abstract": "Facial expression conveys nonverbal communication information to help humans better perceive physical or psychophysical situations. Accurate 3D imaging provides stable topographic changes for reading facial expression. In particular, light‐field cameras (LFCs) have high potential for constructing depth maps, thanks to a simple configuration of microlens arrays and an objective lens. Herein, machine‐learned NIR‐based LFCs (NIR‐LFCs) for facial expression reading by extracting Euclidean distances of 3D facial landmarks in pairwise fashion are reported. The NIR‐LFC contains microlens arrays with asymmetric Fabry−Perot filter and NIR bandpass filter on CMOS image sensor, fully packaged with two vertical‐cavity surface‐emitting lasers. The NIR‐LFC not only increases the image contrast by 2.1 times compared with conventional LFCs, but also reduces the reconstruction errors by up to 54%, regardless of ambient illumination conditions. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifies input vectors, consisting of 78 pairwise distances on the facial depth map of happiness, anger, sadness, and disgust, and also exhibits exceptional average accuracy of 0.85 ( p&lt; 0.05). This LFC provides a new platform for quantitatively labeling facial expression and emotion in point‐of‐care biomedical, social perception, or human−machine interaction applications.",

While connections between psychopathology and brain functional connectivity are studied, the use of deep learning to elucidate overlapping neural mechanisms through multimodal brain images remains nascent. Utilizing two adolescent datasets—the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC, n = 1100) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD, n = 7536)—this study employs interpretable neural networks and demonstrates that incorporating brain morphology, along with functional and structural networks, augments traditional clinical characteristics (age, gender, race, parental education, medical history, and trauma exposure). Predictive accuracy reaches 0.37–0.464 between real and predicted general psychopathology and four psychopathology dimensions (externalizing, psychosis, anxiety, and fear). The brain morphology and connectivities within the frontoparietal, default mode network, and visual associate networks are recurrent across general psychopathology and four psychopathology dimensions. Unique structural and functional pathways originating from the cerebellum, amygdala, and visual‐sensorimotor cortex are linked with these individual dimensions. Consistent findings across both PNC and ABCD affirm the generalizability. The results underscore the potential of diverse sensory inputs in steering executive processes tied to psychopathology dimensions in adolescents, hinting at neural avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions and preventive strategies.",

Herein, exciting advances are made by mimicking Cephalopod strategies. An alternative geometrically structured biomimetic scale‐based strategy, which is purely mechanical and simple but at the same time rapid, tailorable and tunable, and inherently multifunctional, is presented. Surfaces covered by biomimetic scales that are themselves covered by lenticular images are investigated. A concurrent programming strategy to tune surface morphology and color by controlling the angle of individual scales is introduced. As an example, a pneumatic design to control individual‐scale orientations using airflow, which enables both morphology and color camouflaging in less than a second, is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Multiple band optical filters for optical smart sensing, which is simultaneous multispectral detection of objects, are intensively used in many applications, such as remote monitoring, biomedical imaging, wearable optical sensors, and wireless communication. Typically, periodically stacked dielectric layers are used in multiple band optical filters. However, the use of dielectrics inevitably results in rigidity and inflexibility, which is not suitable for advanced smart optical sensors fabricated on flexible substrates. Therefore, herein, a strategy to implement soft/tunable multiband optical filters made from silicon nanowire array‐based stackable optical filters (Si NW‐SOFs) composed of polymeric membranes containing vertical silicon nanowire arrays that filter light from visible to near‐infrared regions with a narrow bandwidth is proposed. Theoretical and experimental results indicate wavelength selectivity by geometrical parameters (e.g., diameter, period, and height) and the absence of optical disturbance between the layers in the integrated states. Therefore, multiband optical filters with single‐ to triple‐band stops are easily created by changing Si NW‐SOFs. Finally, imaging demonstrations that involve the filtering of monochromatic light sources of three wavelengths (i.e., red, green, and blue) and fluorescent biological tissues show the practical multiple band characteristics of Si NW‐SOFs.",

Upon an external stimulus, the MOF particles change their interfacial orientation/packing, allowing the membranes to stretch, open, and close. At the same time, these MOF particles catalytically decompose hydrogen peroxide fuel to provide the gas‐bubble recoil needed to propel the droplets; when the droplets are covered with only patches of the ZIF‐67 MOFs, the recoil and self‐propulsion are directional. A combination of all these effects underlies the construction of a chemical system in which the external objects are engulfed by the droplet opening up and closing its MOF membrane, are subject to chemical processing inside of the droplet, are transported to another location, and are ultimately expelled into the surrounding solvent, in effect realizing a primitive chemical mimic of phagocytosis.",

In the existing design, to transmit the fuel, the pressure of the fuel tank must exceed that of the actuator. Consequently, the fuel tank must be sufficiently stiff, which hardens the robot. Herein, inspired by pit membranes in trees, a chemical pump is developed, which is consisting of a nanoporous membrane between the fuel tank and the actuator, and coated with a catalyst on the side of the actuator. The fuel in the fuel tank migrates across the membrane and, on meeting the catalyst, decomposes into a pressurized gas and inflates the actuator. The chemical pump is driven by the free energy of reaction, against the difference in pressure. The pores in the membrane are large enough for the fuel molecules to migrate through, but small enough to block the pressurized gas to tunnel back. In a demonstration, the fuel tank has ambient pressure, and the actuator has a pressure of 350 kPa, comparable to the pressure in a car tire. The chemical pump enables pneumatic robots to be autonomous, powerful, and soft.",

An iterative method is introduced to calculate the node voltages of the 1S1R CBA, which arises from the variable voltage drop through the wires with rcc and g i,j . Several mathematical approximations are introduced for fast and efficient calculation. The proposed method trains the HNN to have an inference accuracy of 85.9%, whereas the inference accuracy of HNN without the rcc consideration drops to 38.5%. The inference running time with the proposed method is 1% of the HSPICE‐based simulation for the given HNN structure. As the rcc increases, the inference accuracy declines due to the decreased device voltage from the target values. The worst voltage model is adopted to identify the design factors that affected the accuracy. A CBA with a size almost three times larger can be used for the HNN if the rcc is appropriately addressed under the given device conditions.",

However, traditional assessment by X‐ray cannot assess patients’ knee functions and disorders dynamically, making it impossible to achieve a direct functional assessment of KOA. To solve this problem, here it is shown that 3D knee gait parameters could be used to diagnose KOA and guide its therapeutic strategy through direct functional assessment. We employ a total of 1201 participants, and successfully build and validate diagnostic and predictive models for KOA diagnosis and therapeutic strategy using an artificial intelligence (AI)‐based method, logistic regression, a kind of interpretable machine learning. Four diagnostic models are successfully established including angular (AM), translational (TM), composite (CM), and ATCM (a parallel conjoint model of AM, TM, and CM) model with a Youden index of 0.7312, 0.6689, 0.8214, and 0.7492, respectively. The same AI‐based method is also used to develop medical decision classification (MDC) for predicting whether a KOA patient needs operative intervention or not. MDC has a Youden index, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.8886, 92.11%, and 96.75%, respectively. These findings contribute to new knowledge of knee kinematics and KOA diagnosis and represent a new approach to accurate KOA diagnosis and assessment.",

    "abstract": "Being minimally invasive and highly effective, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is widely used for small‐sized malignant tumor treatment. However, in clinical practice, a large number of tumors are found in irregular shape, while the current RFA devices are hard to control the morphologic appearance of RFA lesions on demand, which usually ends up with unnecessarily excessive tissue ablation and subsequently often brings irreversible damage to the organs’ functions. Herein, active cannulas for each of the individually controlled subelectrodes to achieve an on‐demand shape morphing and thus conformal RFA lesion are introduced. The target shape as well as the length of inserted subelectrodes can be precisely controlled by tuning the active stylets and cannulas. What's more, owing to independent movement and energy control of each subelectrodes, the electrode is shown to be not only efficient enough to accomplish accurate trajectory control to target tissue in a single insertion, but also adaptive enough to ablate target tissues with diverse morphologic appearances and locations. On‐demand conformal ablation of target tissue is demonstrated as well under the guidance of ultrasound imaging with the device. Potentially, the RFA electrode is a promising minimally invasive treatment of malignant tumors in future clinical practice.

Building and powering small‐scale cogwheels are key steps toward feasible micro and nanomachinery. Assembly, energy injection, and control are, however, a challenge at the microscale. In contrast with passive gears, whose function is to transmit torques from one to another, interlocking and untethered active gears have the potential to unveil dynamics and functions untapped by externally driven mechanisms. Here, it is shown the assembly and control of a family of self‐spinning cogwheels with varying teeth numbers and study the interlocking of multiple cogwheels. The teeth are formed by colloidal microswimmers that power the structure. The cogwheels are autonomous and active, showing persistent rotation. Leveraging the angular momentum of optical vortices, we control the direction of rotation of the cogwheels. The pairs of interlocking and active cogwheels that roll over each other in a random walk and have curvature‐dependent mobility are studied. This behavior is leveraged to self‐position parts and program microbots, demonstrating the ability to pick up, direct, and release a load. The work constitutes a step toward autonomous machinery with external control as well as (re)programmable microbots and matter.",

Herein, an intelligent system integrating a drone and a synaptic resistor (synstor) circuit that concurrently executes inference and reinforcement learning algorithms in real‐time is reported. Without any prior learning or programming, the conductance matrix of the synstor circuit is dynamically optimized in its real‐time learning processes, thus enabling the drone to adapt and fly toward its target positions in erratic aerodynamic environments. In learning experiments involving a drone driven by synstor circuits, humans, or computers, the real‐time learning by the synstor circuit is superior to the real‐time learning by humans and the cloud learning by computers, in terms of key benchmarks including adaptability, learning time, precision, power consumption, and energy efficiency. By circumventing the fundamental limitations in computers, synstor circuits open up new directions to establish AI systems with brain‐like fast real‐time learning functionality, high computing energy efficiency, and adaptability in complex, erratic real‐world environments for versatile applications.",

As a representative scenario, environmental temperature variation may degrade image quality due to thermal defocus and sensor response, resulting in blur and noise. However, extensive athermalization in optics usually requires a complex design process and is limited by materials. Herein, a multibranch computational imaging scheme is developed, using emerging generative adversarial networks as the postprocessing to compensate for degradation of all kinds caused by thermal defocus and noise. In addition, a temperature controllable data acquisition, division, and mixture scheme is described to facilitate effective datasets for model robustness. Experiments on a vehicle lens and a mobile phone lens reveal that the proposed multibranch learned strategy notably increases image quality in the temperature range of 0–80 °C, and outperforms conventional athermalization in most instances, which is beneficial to lowering the design and manufacturing costs of imaging systems.",

    "abstract": "Network features found in the brain may help implement more efficient and robust neural networks. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process spikes in the spatiotemporal domain and can offer better energy efficiency than deep neural networks. However, most SNN implementations rely on simple point neurons that neglect the rich neuronal and dendritic dynamics. Herein, a bio‐inspired columnar learning network (CLN) structure that employs feedforward, lateral, and feedback connections to make robust classification with sparse data is proposed. CLN is inspired by the mammalian neocortex, comprising cortical columns each containing multiple minicolumns formed by interacting pyramidal neurons. A column continuously processes spatiotemporal signals from its sensor, while learning spatial and temporal correlations between features in different regions of an object along with the sensor's movement through sensorimotor interaction. CLN can be implemented using memristor crossbars with a local learning rule, spiking timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP), which can be natively obtained in second‐order memristors. CLN allows inputs from multiple sensors to be simultaneously processed by different columns, resulting in higher classification accuracy and better noise tolerance. Analysis of networks implemented on memristor crossbars shows that the system can operate at very low power and high throughput, with high accuracy and robustness to noise.",

However, currently available laser scanners require further improvements in terms of miniaturization, driving voltage, and stability to steer the laser beam accurately within a constrained environment. Herein, the development of a liquid‐driven laser scanner installed on the end effector of a continuum endoscope to perform fast and reliable laser steering is proposed. The developed laser scanner is 7 mm in diameter and 7 mm in length, and it is actuated with a voltage lower than 15 V due to the liquid‐infused membrane. The miniature size and low driving voltage of the proposed laser scanner facilitate safe laser‐assisted surgery in confined spaces. A theoretical model is established to predict laser spot position quantitatively, and laser steering ability is also tested experimentally. The fiber‐delivered laser beam can be steered for 21.2° (±10.6°) with a standard deviation of 0.3° in 1000 cycles, demonstrating excellent stability. A laser steering speed of up to 27.3 mm s −1 and a reflection loss of less than 3.1% are achieved.",

This method allows the quantification of joining space narrowing to approach the clinical upper limit. Beyond predictive performance, we integrate the multilevel interconnections across joints and damage types into the machine learning model and reveal the cross-regulation map of joint damages in rheumatoid arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Soft manipulators integrated with optical laser fibers offer new opportunities for endoscopic noncontact laser surgery. To achieve precise laser projection in a confined workspace and avoid damage, a controller with high accuracy and stability is required. An effective way is to close the control loop. Therefore, a visual servo controller that allows automatic laser spot steering using soft manipulators is proposed. An epipolar geometry model is established to acquire the inverse transition mapping from image to actuation. With this mapping, a feedback controller is derived without prior information of tissue surface geometry. Experimental validation demonstrates accurate path following using a magnetic resonance‐safe manipulator, with root‐mean‐square (RMS) tracking errors &lt;4 pixels (140 μm) in the camera view. This is maintained even throughout 70 repeated cycles, with a maximum tracking error &lt;11.32 pixels (≈396.2 μm). The controller enables laser spot following of the mouse cursor with an RMS tracking error of 3.97 pixels (≈180.5 μm). Ex vivo tissue ablation tests are conducted to validate the laser ablation pattern, with an RMS tracking error of about 5.75 pixels (≈201.3 μm). A laser ablation test is conducted under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to validate the feasibility of MRI‐guided laser surgery.",

    "abstract": "The human visual system plays the most important role in information perception. Inspired by its structure and processing mechanism, novel optoelectronic memristor‐based artificial visual systems have emerged, thanks to the advantages of time latency and energy efficiency. However, the established systems lack a complete hardware supporting system to demonstrate the potential of large‐scale integration. Herein for the first time, a gate multiplexing architecture for optical signal sensor and memory integration is proposed, which can achieve multivalue storage of 3‐bit optical signal in the analog domain. Based on this novel structure, an artificial visual sensor and memory system (AVSMS) is implemented with a 5 × 6 photodiode array, an I / V conversion circuit, and a 32 × 32 1T1R memristor array for image sensor and memory integration. Furthermore, a parallel pipeline storage strategy is proposed to enable AVSMS to store 32 images with a size of 5 × 6 pixels and 3‐bit grayscale without erasing operation and achieve an ideal frame rate of more than 60 000 frames per second for high‐speed storage. Experimental results demonstrate that AVSMS can directly eliminate repeated background information in sequential images through peripheral hardware circuitry. The AVSMS provides a promising hardware solution for large‐scale image sensor and memory integration in artificial visual systems.",

    "abstract": "The nervous system is controlled by a collection of neurons that transmit electric signals through the organism. These signals respond to internal and external stimuli and regulate many involuntary physiological functions. The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary behaviors, such as heart rate, breathing, or pupil size through the action of neuroendocrine substances that modulate the biological processes. These physiological processes allow to express the internal state while interacting with others. This manuscript presents an artificial neuroendocrine model for regulating and expressing the involuntary physiological functions emulated in the Mini social robot. This model employs the robot's perception and simulated biological clock to generate neuroendocrine responses using simulated neuroendocrine substances to control the robot's autonomic processes of heart rate, pupil size, breathing rate, blinking rate, and locomotor activity. The primary contribution of this work is to provide biological modeling to replicate the evolution and effects of neuroendocrine substances on the regulation of autonomic processes and demonstrate how to express them in social robots using their actuators to improve their responsiveness and naturalness. These experiments show that the robot's autonomic processes can maintain proper evolution during long periods, while exhibiting circadian rhythms and responding to unexpected environmental changes.",

This limits the obtained solutions to the collision‐free space and leads to failures if the path to the goal is obstructed. In contrast, humans actively modify their environment by repositioning objects if it assists locomotion. This article aims to bring robots closer to such abilities by providing a framework to detect and clear movable obstacles to continue navigation. The approach leverages a multimodal robot skin that provides both local proximity and tactile feedback regarding physical interactions with the surroundings. This multimodal contact feedback is employed to adapt the robot's behavior when interacting with object surfaces and regulating applied forces. This enables the robot to remove bulky obstacles from its path and solves otherwise infeasible navigation problems. The system's ability is demonstrated in simulation and real‐world scenarios involving movable and nonmovable obstacles.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has made remarkable strides in restoring sensory feedback for prosthetic users, including tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal feedback. Herein, a sensory modality that has been largely neglected is explored: the ability to perceive wetness. Providing moisture‐related information to prosthesis users can increase their overall sensory palette toward a more natural sensory experience. A rapid decrease in skin temperature is found to trigger the illusion of contact with something wet. Two body parts were tested, the upper arm and the lateral abdomen, in a group of non amputated participants, and it was found that a wetness sensation can be elicited and maintained for at least 10 s in 86% and 93% of participants, respectively. It is then demonstrated how to mediate the wetness sensation in real‐time using a thermal wearable device that mimics the thermal properties of the skin. Finally, two upper limb amputee individuals used their prosthetic arm, sensorized with the device, to discriminate between three levels of moisture; their detection accuracy was similar to one they had with their intact hands. The current study is a stepping stone for future prostheses aimed at restoring the richness of sensory experience in upper limb amputees.",

Adversarial training and its variants have shown great potential in addressing this problem. However, such approaches, which directly optimize the decision boundary, often result in overly complex adversarial decision boundaries that are detrimental to generalization. To deal with this issue, a novel plug‐and‐play method known as Misclassification‐Aware Contrastive Adversarial Training (MA‐CAT) from the perspective of data distribution optimization is proposed. MA‐CAT leverages supervised decoupled contrastive learning to cluster nature examples within the same class in the logit space, indirectly increasing the margins of examples. Moreover, by taking into account the varying difficulty levels of adversarial training for different examples, MA‐CAT adaptively customizes the strength of adversarial training for each example using an instance‐wise misclassification‐aware adaptive temperature coefficient. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR‐10, CIFAR‐100, and SVHN datasets demonstrate that MA‐CAT can be easily integrated into existing models and significantly improves robustness with minimal computational cost.",

This work proposes a novel markerless 3D tracking framework for continuum surgical tools using a proposed surgical tool partial pose estimation network (STPPE‐Net) based on U‐Net and ResNet. The STPPE‐Net estimates the segmentation and a 5‐DoF pose of the tool end‐effector. This network is entirely trained by a synthetic data generator based on domain randomization (DR) and requires zero manual annotation. The 5‐DoF pose estimation from the STPPE‐Net is combined with the surgical tool axial rotation from the robot control system. Then, the entire pose is further refined via a region‐based optimization that maximizes the overlap between the tool end‐effector segmentation from the STPPE‐Net and its projection onto the image plane of the endoscopic camera. The segmentation accuracy and 6‐DoF pose estimation precision of the proposed framework are validated on the images captured from an endoscopic single‐port system. The experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracking framework for continuum surgical tools.",

The triangular geometry parameter, materials type, etc. have been investigated to illustrate their basic mechanical and triboelectric properties and their coupled influence. Further, the results of the shock test show that MMEL can decrease the peak force from approximately 625 to 90 N and convey the V oc impulse signal simultaneously. The vibration signal has been collected through the MMEL to detect the vibration frequency and charge a watch simultaneously, demonstrating the feasibility and practical potential of the MMEL.

In biomedical applications, this challenge is exacerbated by the dense surrounding environments with feature sizes and shapes comparable to microrobots. Herein, Motion Enhanced Multi‐level Tracker (MEMTrack) is introduced for detecting and tracking microrobots in dense and low‐contrast environments. Informed by the physics of microrobot motion, synthetic motion features for deep learning‐based object detection and a modified Simple Online and Real‐time Tracking (SORT)algorithm with interpolation are used for tracking. MEMTrack is trained and tested using bacterial micromotors in collagen (tissue phantom), achieving precision and recall of 76% and 51%, respectively. Compared to the state‐of‐the‐art baseline models, MEMTrack provides a minimum of 2.6‐fold higher precision with a reasonably high recall. MEMTrack's generalizability to unseen (aqueous) media and its versatility in tracking microrobots of different shapes, sizes, and motion characteristics are shown. Finally, it is shown that MEMTrack localizes objects with a root‐mean‐square error of less than 1.84 μm and quantifies the average speed of all tested systems with no statistically significant difference from the laboriously produced manual tracking data. MEMTrack significantly advances microrobot localization and tracking in dense and low‐contrast settings and can impact fundamental and translational microrobotic research.",

However, the clutter echoes originating from such environments have been difficult to analyze. To study the problem of sonar‐based navigation in dense foliage in simulation, an artificial generation system for leaf impulse responses (IRs) based on variational auto‐encoders is proposed. The system is to aid the construction of artificial foliage echo environments. A dataset of leaf echoes was collected in an anechoic chamber and convolved with the original signal to estimate the IR of each leaf. A modified version of the conditional variational autoencoder ‐ generative adversarial network (cVAE‐GAN) architecture was trained successfully on this dataset to produce a generative model that was conditional on leaf viewing angles, size, and species. The IRs generated by the model capture quantitative and qualitative similarity to the measured IRs. It surpasses the previous state of the art foliage echo model based on reflecting disks. The model's computational efficiency and its success suggest its potential use for simulating large environments of foliage to study bat biosonar and aid in engineering biomimetic sonar devices.",

This pertains particularly to its cameras as predominant sensors to perceive the environment and support actions. A fundamental camera problem addressed in this study is noise. Solutions often focus on denoising images a posteriori, that is, fighting symptoms rather than root causes. However, tackling root causes requires identifying the noise sources, considering the limitations of mobile platforms. This work investigates a real-time, memory-efficient and reliable noise source estimator that combines data- and physically-based models. To this end, a DNN that examines an image with camera metadata for major camera noise sources is built and trained. In addition, it quantifies unexpected factors that impact image noise or metadata. This study investigates seven different estimators on six datasets that include synthetic noise, real-world noise from two camera systems, and real field campaigns. For these, only the model with most metadata is capable to accurately and robustly quantify all individual noise contributions. This method outperforms total image noise estimators and can be plug-and-play deployed. It also serves as a basis to include more advanced noise sources, or as part of an automatic countermeasure feedback-loop to approach fully reliable machines.",

    "abstract": "The fabric‐based pneumatic exosuit is now a hot research topic because it is lighter and softer than traditional exoskeletons. Existing research focuses more on the mechanical properties of the exosuit (e.g., torque and speed), but less on its wearability (e.g., appearance and comfort). This work presents a new design concept for fabric‐based pneumatic exosuits: volume transfer, which means transferring the volume of pneumatic actuators beyond the garment's profile to the inside. This allows for a concealed appearance and a larger stress area while maintaining adequate torques. In order to verify this concept, a fabric‐based pneumatic exosuit is developed for knee extension assistance. Its profile is only 26 mm and its stress area wraps around almost half of the leg. A mathematical model and simulation is used to determine the parameters of the exosuit, avoiding multiple iterations of the prototype. Experiment results show that the exosuit can generate a torque of 7.6 Nm at a pressure of 90 kPa and produce a significant reduction in the electromyography activity of the knee extensor muscles. It is believed that volume transfer can be utilized prevalently in future fabric‐based pneumatic exosuit designs to achieve a significant improvement in wearability.",

This article presents an approach to achieve simple and controllable morphing onto multiple stable complex 3D surfaces—a long sought after goal in the field. The method is based on interconnected multistable straw‐like deformable tubes, constrained by rigid links that can be assembled and connected in many different ways. By leveraging the director‐field theory, the links and their assembly process are modeled and designed to reach a variety of desired final operational shapes from a single base‐structure. The use of viscous‐fluid actuation enables precise control and predictable shape‐morphing while facilitating a wide range of configurations through inflation and deflation sequences, all with a single input.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has been harnessed as a promising modelling tool for materials research. However, small data, or data scarcity, is a bottleneck when incorporating ML in studies involving experimentation. Current experiment planning methods show several disadvantages: one‐factor‐at‐a‐time (OFAT) experimentation became impractical due to limited laboratory resources; conventional design of experiments (DoE) failed to incorporate high‐dimensional features in ML; Surrogate‐based or Bayesian optimization (BO) shifted the goal to optimize material properties rather than guiding training data accumulation. The present research proposes leveraging active learning (AL) to strategically select critical data for experimentation. Two AL strategies, query‐by‐Committee (QBC) algorithm and Greedy method, are benchmarked against random query baseline on various materials datasets. AL is shown to efficiently reduce model prediction errors with minimal additional experiment data. Investigation of hyperparameters revealed benefits of applying AL at an early stage of experimental dataset construction. Moreover, AL is implemented and validated for an in‐house materials development task ‐ electrospray modelling. AL exploration as a paradigm is highlighted to guide experiment design for efficient data accumulation purposes, and its potential for further ML modelling. In doing so, the power of ML is expected to be fully unleashed to experimental researchers.",

    "abstract": "The 6G network, the next‐generation communication system, is envisaged to provide unprecedented experience through hyperconnectivity involving everything. The communication should hold artificial intelligence‐centric network infrastructures as interconnecting a swarm of machines. However, existing network systems use orthogonal modulation and costly error correction code; they are very sensitive to noise and rely on many processing layers. These schemes impose significant overhead on low‐power internet of things devices connected to noisy networks. Herein, a hyperdimensional network‐based system, called , is proposed, which enables robust and efficient data communication/learning. exploits a redundant and holographic representation of hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to design highly robust data modulation, enabling two functionalities on transmitted data: 1) an iterative decoding method that translates the vector back to the original data without error correction mechanisms, or 2) a native hyperdimensional learning technique on transmitted data with no need for costly data decoding. A hardware accelerator that supports both data decoding and hyperdimensional learning using a unified accelerator is also developed. The evaluation shows that provides a bit error rate comparable to that of state‐of‐the‐art modulation schemes while achieving 9.4 faster and 27.8 higher energy efficiency compared to state‐of‐the‐art deep learning systems.",

Herein, advanced in vitro models based on scaffolds that support the 3D growth of glioma cells, further allowing the cocultures with healthy brain cells, are presented. These scaffolds, doped with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and obtained through 2‐photon polymerization, can be remotely manipulated thanks to an external magnet, thus obtaining biomimetic 3D organization recapitulating the brain cancer microenvironment. From a geometric point of view, the structure is functional to both cell culture on individual unit scaffolds and to tailored cocultures fostered by magnetic‐driven unit assembly, also allowing for cell migration thanks to passages/fenestrations on adjacent structures. Leveraging magnetic dragging, for which a mathematical model is introduced, multiple cocultures are achieved, highlighting the high versatility and the user‐friendly character of the proposed platform that can help overcome the current challenges in 3D cocultures handling, and open the way to the construction of increasingly biomimetic artificial systems.",

This study presents an innovative weight‐level pruning technique that mitigates the challenges of overparameterization, and subsequently minimizes the electricity usage of such large deep learning models. The method focuses on removing redundant parameters while upholding model accuracy. This methodology is applied to classify Eimeria species parasites from fowls and rabbits. By leveraging a set of 27 pretrained CNN models with a number of parameters between 3.0M and 118.5M, the framework has identified a 4.8M‐parameter model with the highest accuracy for both animals. The model is then subjected to a systematic pruning process, resulting in an 8% reduction in parameters and a 421M reduction in floating point operations while maintaining the same classification accuracy for both fowls and rabbits. Furthermore, unlike the existing literature where two separate models are created for rabbits and fowls, this article presents a combined model with 17 classes. This approach has resulted in a CNN model with nearly 50% reduced parameter size while retaining the same accuracy of over 90%.",

Herein, emerging MNRs with hydrogel‐loaded magnetic particles are designed. The proposed hydrogel MNRs (HMNRs) exhibit biocompatible and controllable characteristics. The motion controllability of HMNRs is realized by applying oscillating magnetic field and customized magnetic field. Experimentally, it is demonstrated that the HMNR swarms driven by the oscillating magnetic field exhibit a faster motion speed than the MNR swarms composed of magnetic particles. The HMNRs show precise controllability of the movement in the complex pipeline under the control of customized magnetic field.

Following the recent advances in cell culture technology, traditional monolayers are optimized to resemble more 3D, organ‐like structures. The biological and electrochemical complexity of these structures requires devices with adaptive shapes and novel features, such as precise electrophysiological mapping and stimulation in the case of brain‐ and heart‐derived tissues. However, conventional organ‐on‐chip platforms often fall short, as they do not recreate the native environment of the cells and lack the functional interfaces necessary for long‐term monitoring.

This study introduces the double‐layered metal‐organic‐frameworks (MOFs)‐based microswimmers for sustained dual‐drug delivery. These microswimmers are made up of ZIF‐8 and MIL‐100, biocompatible MOFs, that can selectively adsorb two types of drugs. The MOFs increase the surface area of the microswimmers by ≈2.42 times, which greatly enhances drug adsorption, and improves hydrophilicity, which reduces adhesion for surface locomotion. Their biocompatibility and dual‐drug adsorption are verified through cell viability and drug‐loading tests. The microswimmers have remarkable versatility in loading different drug combinations (DHA + 5‐FU, CPT‐11, or DOX), indicating the potential for adaptive therapy. They can inhibit cancer cells for up to 72 h through the sustained release of dual drugs. In contrast, drug treatments without microswimmers only inhibit cell proliferation for 24 h, leading to a significant rebound. This study provides a method to mass fabricate fully biocompatible microrobots with dual drug loading versatility and high drug adsorption capacity; thus, suggests a powerful platform for sustained adaptive dual‐drug therapy.",

From the individual station on a production line to the global supply chain, everything is connected, making regulation and control a complex task. Biological molecular processes, such as the metabolism of living organisms or the cell cycle, are also extremely complex processes that can be compared to industrial production processes, both of which involve a series of intermediate steps and products. Thanks to (self‐)regulatory mechanisms that have evolved over time, these biological mechanisms are very efficient and robust in the face of perturbations. This article proposes an explanatory representation of these complex processes, considering both biological and technical aspects. The aim is to facilitate biomimetic transfer of biological regulation mechanisms into the technical domain. It presents concepts for biomimetic regulation of production lines and sourcing strategies and introduces a workflow for generating digital twins. This workflow is inspired by the cell cycle checkpoints, which ensure that only perfect copies of DNA are passed on during cell replication. By leveraging this understanding, the production industry can potentially improve its own processes and efficiency.",

Ferroelectric thin‐film transistors (Fe‐TFTs) attract attention for neuromorphic computing and back‐end‐of‐the‐line (BEOL) compatibility.

This work demonstrates the effect of temperature impact on single‐gate (SG) Fe‐TFT reliability. SG Fe‐TFTs have limitations such as read‐disturbance and small memory windows, constraining their use. To mitigate these, dual‐gate (DG) Fe‐TFTs are modeled using technology computer‐aided design, comparing their performance. Compute‐in‐memory (CIM) architectures with SG and DG Fe‐TFTs are investigated for deep neural networks (DNN) accelerators, revealing heat's detrimental effect on reliability and inference accuracy. DG Fe‐TFTs exhibit about 4.6x higher throughput than SG Fe‐TFTs. Additionally, thermal effects within the simulated M3D architecture are analyzed, noting reduced DNN accuracy to 81.11% and 67.85% for SG and DG Fe‐TFTs, respectively. Furthermore, various cooling methods and their impact on CIM system temperature are demonstrated, offering insights for efficient thermal management strategies.",

Extensive benchmarking confirms state‐of‐the‐art performance from WACEfNet for aerial imaging applications while remaining suitable for embedded deployment.

In previous work, an implantable ADDS with a capsule docking system is introduced for non‐invasive reservoir refilling. Yet, it encounters reliability issues in manufacturing, sealing, and docking design and lacks evidence on intestinal tissue compression effects and chronic in vivo data. This work proposes an optimization of the different components featuring this ADDS.

A magnetic docking system is optimized, ensuring reliable and stable capsule docking at a clinically relevant distance of 5.92 mm. Histological tests on human intestinal tissues confirm safe capsule compression during docking. Bench tests demonstrate that the integrated mechatronic system effectively docks capsules at various peristalsis‐mimicking velocities. A six‐week in vivo test on porcine models demonstrates chronic safety and provides hints on fibrotic reactions. These results pave the way for the further evolution of implantable ADDS.",

    "abstract": "Designing actuators that can modulate power, achieve high energy efficiency, and ensure safe collision remains a challenge, especially for dynamic energy robot systems (DERS) with high‐performance requirements. Herein, a novel multi‐configuration elastic actuator (MCEA) is proposed based on a controllable planetary differential mechanism (PDM) with one power port from three springs. These springs, positioned between the inner gear ring and the fixed housing shell, are regulated by a single servo motor through a ratchet–pawl mechanism. This setup enables the springs to absorb energy during collisions, reducing impact and subsequently releasing this energy to boost power output. The inner gear ring functions as a controllable one‐way rotating element, acting either as an input or output for power. The MCEA's ability to manage power modulation and energy flow is demonstrated through experiments that highlight its potential for safe collision management, energy recycling, and power modulation. Experiment results indicate that the maximum output power of the MCEA in the proposed hybrid elastic actuation (HEA) mode is 8.05 times higher than that in the traditional actuation (TA) mode. A single‐legged robot with a four‐link mechanism is also built to validate the considerable performance in the application of legged robots, showing considerable adaptability and prospects for DERS.",

    "abstract": "Surgical simulators are valuable educational tools for physicians, enhancing their proficiency and improving patient safety. However, they typically still suffer from a lack of realism as they do not emulate dynamic tissue biomechanics haptically and fail to convincingly mimic real‐time physiological reactions. This study presents a dynamic tactile synthetic tissue, integrating both sensory and actuatory capabilities within a fully soft unit, as a core component for soft robotics and future hybrid surgical simulators utilizing dynamic physical phantoms. The adaptive surface of the tissue replica, actuated via hydraulics, is assessed by an embedded carbon black silicone sensor layer using electrical impedance tomography to determine internally or externally induced deformations. The integrated fluid chambers enable pressure and force measurements. The combination of these principles enables real‐time tissue feedback as well as closed loop operation, allowing optimal interaction with the environment. Based on the concepts of soft robotics, such artificial tissues find broad applicability, demonstrated via a soft gripper and surgical simulation applications including a dynamic, artificial brain phantom as well as a synthetic, beating heart. These advancements pave the way toward enhanced realism in surgical simulators including reliable performance evaluation and bear the potential to transform the future of surgical training methodologies.",

Carnivorous plants feed by trapping insects, sunflowers grow by following the sun, and pine cones control the dispersal of their seeds under optimal conditions. This comprehensive review first analyses the mechanisms responsible for these adaptive movements highlighting the need for a gradient in one of the physico‐chemical properties to enable morphing. Next, the main synthetic shape‐changing soft systems are presented in terms of their mechanism of action. A gradient in water‐swelling, magneto‐rheological properties, residual deformation, or extensibility gives hygromorphs, magnetomorphs, mechanomorphs, and baromorphs, respectively. The various morphing triggers, namely light, heat, pH, tensile stress, pressure, electric, and magnetic fields, are described. The opportunities and challenges of each system are put into perspective. This report aims to provide the reader with a toolbox for designing shape‐changing materials considering the targeted trigger, as well as providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms paving the way for future discoveries.",

To be able to reach a maximum travel distance in one turn of work with a full battery charge, the vehicle should follow the reference route with minimum tracking errors. One of the reasons which prevents a good path tracking is the slippage because slippage causes tracking errors in both longitudinal and lateral directions. Herein, a modeling structure for a mecanum‐wheeled autonomous electric vehicle used for the heavy duties in iron–steel industry is proposed by taking the slippage information into account. The objective is to reach more travel distance and reduce the energy loss of the battery which causes to carry load less than planned. The modeling structure proposed is adapted and tested for an autonomous path tracking task in a galvanization line of an iron–steel industry. Five tons of zinc ingots are carried from the storage area to the melting pot using an autonomous electric vehicle in a predefined reference route. More than 5 km autonomous drive is performed and the experiments show that slippage causes an energy loss of 6.1786%, which means battery allows 6.1786% less distance than planned travel.",

However, the limited visual perception ability makes robots difficult to directly detect the complete appearance of objects. Building predefined models is also a costly procedure.

To solve it, this article proposes an interactive robotic grasping method based on promptable segment anything model and force‐closure analysis. A human operator can mark a prompt on any object using a laser pointer. Then, the robot extracts the edge of the marked object and calculates the optimal grasp through the edge. To validate feasibility and generalizability, the grasping generation method is tested on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets and a novel benchmark test set of 36 diverse objects is constructed to conduct real‐world experiments. Furthermore, the contributions of each step are demonstrated through ablation experiments and the proposed method is tested in the occlusion scenarios.

Game theory is employed to determine the optimal confrontation paths for defenders against the intruders. The probability perception model is utilized for evaluating the dynamic target tracking capability and designing a tracking merit function to assess tracking performance, taking into account both the target's position and the perception relative angle. Furthermore, considering the dynamic interactive behaviors between intruders and defenders, the iterative linear quadratic game (ILQG) algorithm is employed to solve the Nash equilibrium of the non‐cooperative target tracking game.

This study proposes a hybrid offline and online data‐driven scheme to achieve high‐precision tracking control of a soft continuum manipulator. First, a novel multiscale deep neural network learns the manipulator model offline. Specifically, the feature fusion module extracts highly discriminative features and captures long‐term dependencies from the temporal trajectory data. The self‐attention module strengthens the ability to represent fusion features and enhances the model prediction accuracy. Then, the learnt model is updated using multisensor data online, and the proposed controller further compensates for the updated model and enhances the tracking accuracy in the movement stage. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in motion accuracy under different trajectory‐tracking scenarios (i.e., deviations of &lt;1 mm in position and &lt;0.8° in orientation). The example of the multiwire cable sorting proves the feasibility of the proposed scheme in high‐precision industrial applications.",

Herein, minimally functional robotic entities modeled on readily achievable state‐of‐the‐art features in a modern lab or cleanroom are computationally simulated. Inspired by Dou and Bishop ( Phys Rev Res . 2019;1(3):1–5), it is shown that the simple combination of unidirectional steering connected to a single environmental (chemical) sensor along with constant propulsion gives rise to highly complex functions of significant utility. Such systems can trace the contours orthogonal to arbitrary chemical gradients in the environment. Also, pairs of such robots that are additionally capable of emitting the same chemical signal are shown to exhibit coupled relative motion. When the pair has unidirectional steering in opposite directions within the 2D plane (i.e., counter‐rotating), they move in parallel trajectories to each other. Alternatively, when steering is in the same direction (corotation), the two move in the same epicyclical trajectory. In this way, the chirality of the unidirectional steering produces two distinct emergent phenomena. The behavior is understood as a ratchet mechanism that exploits the differential in the radii of curvature corresponding to different spatial locations. Applications to environmental detection, remediation, and monitoring are discussed.",

Inspired by tiny bubbles in nature, a new paradigm is proposed for achieving multifunctional manipulation and sensing using microbubbles for biological application in aqueous environments at low cost. Without demanding the expensive cost of fabrication devices, bubbles with various sizes are easy to generate in situ, which is enabled by bubble‐endowed interface interactions. It is demonstrated that bubbles acting as micro end‐effectors rapidly and adaptively realize dexterous manipulation of microobjects such as biological organisms and droplets. They can function as microgrippers to grasp microobjects based on interface interaction‐induced adhesion and act as soft micromanipulators to safely manipulate fragile objects. Moreover, the bubble micro end‐effector can sense and perceive the designated objects for contact measurement of microforces or surface textures at a microscopic scale via the shape changes of their ultrasoft structures. The reported method successfully integrates grasping, manipulation, and measurement functions in liquid using a single microbubble of less than 1 mm 3 volume. These nondestructive functionalities showcase promising prospects for bubble‐based micro end‐effectors in biological manipulation and sensing applications.",

By collaborating across multiple institutions, the study seeks to develop models that allow rapid online estimation of organ doses, eliminating the need for complex organ segmentation. Researchers delineate skin outlines from chest CT images obtained from two different institutions. Radiomics features are extracted from the chest CT data and skin contours. Organ doses are computed using Monte Carlo simulations as reference organ doses. Single‐ and cross‐institutional support vector regression (SVR) models are trained with radiomics features to predict organ doses from chest CT scans. Model performance is assessed using metrics like maean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R ‐squared ( R 2 ). For chest organs (lungs, heart, spinal cord, trachea, and esophagus), single‐institutional SVR models achieve MAPE values ranging from 4.72% to 15.31% and R 2 values from 0.73 to 0.93. Cross‐institutional models have MAPE values in the range of 2.16–7.49% and R 2 values from 0.84 to 0.99.

    "abstract": "Human–robot physical interaction in shared object manipulation can fully leverage the strengths of both humans and collaborative robots, achieving better interaction outcomes. However, in typical physical interactions, the inertia parameters of the object are either assumed to be known or ignored, simplifying the interaction to be directly between the human and the collaborative robot. This simplification can lead to inaccuracies in the robot's understanding of human intent due to deviations in object dynamics. This article presents a method that eliminates the need for a force sensor on the human side during human–robot collaboration. Using an extended Kalman filter, the method estimates object parameters online and applies a disturbance observer to determine human force. This approach reduces human effort and improves tracking performance compared to traditional methods. It also avoids the hassle of installing and removing sensors in complex scenarios. By estimating object mass and human force in real time, the robot can adjust its behavior to ensure safer and smoother interactions. Furthermore, the system can handle various objects without requiring specific programming for each case.",

However, it remains difficult for existing methods to achieve the trade‐off of the three key criteria in interpretability, namely, reliability, understandability, and usability, which hinder their practical applications. In this article, we propose a self‐supervised automatic semantic interpretable explainable artificial intelligence (AS‐XAI) framework, which utilizes transparent orthogonal embedding semantic extraction spaces and row‐centered principal component analysis (PCA) for global semantic interpretation of model decisions in the absence of human interference, without additional computational costs. In addition, the invariance of filter feature high‐rank decomposition is used to evaluate model sensitivity to different semantic concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that robust and orthogonal semantic spaces can be automatically extracted by AS‐XAI, providing more effective global interpretability for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generating human‐comprehensible explanations. The proposed approach offers broad fine‐grained extensible practical applications, including shared semantic interpretation under out‐of‐distribution (OOD) categories, auxiliary explanations for species that are challenging to distinguish, and classification explanations from various perspectives. In a systematic evaluation by users with varying levels of AI knowledge, AS‐XAI demonstrated superior “glass box” characteristics.",

In this approach, a designer specifies a mission that the swarm must perform, and an optimization algorithm searches for the control software that enables the robots to perform the given mission. Traditionally, research in automatic design has focused on missions specified by a single design criterion, adopting methods based on single‐objective optimization algorithms. In this study, we investigate whether existing methods can be adapted to address missions specified by concurrent design criteria. We focus on the bi‐criteria case. We conduct experiments with a swarm of e‐puck robots that must perform sequences of two missions: each mission in the sequence is an independent design criterion that the automatic method must handle during the optimization process. We consider modular and neuroevolutionary methods that aggregate concurrent criteria via the weighted sum, hypervolume, or ‐norm. We compare their performance with that of Mandarina, an original automatic modular design method. Mandarina integrates Iterated F‐race as an optimization algorithm to conduct the design process without aggregating the design criteria. Results from realistic simulations and demonstrations with physical robots show that the best results are obtained with modular methods and when the design criteria are not aggregated.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning (IL) facilitates intuitive robotic programming. However, ensuring the reliability of learned behaviors remains a challenge. In the context of reaching motions, a robot should consistently reach its goal, regardless of its initial conditions. To meet this requirement, IL methods often employ specialized function approximators that guarantee this property by construction. Although effective, these approaches come with some limitations: 1) they are typically restricted in the range of motions they can model, resulting in suboptimal IL capabilities, and 2) they require explicit extensions to account for the geometry of motions that consider orientations. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel stability loss function that does not constrain the function approximator's architecture and enables learning policies that yield accurate results. Furthermore, it is not restricted to a specific state space geometry; therefore, it can easily incorporate the geometry of the robot's state space. Proof of the stability properties induced by this loss is provided and the method is empirically validated in various settings. These settings include Euclidean and non‐Euclidean state spaces, as well as first‐order and second‐order motions, both in simulation and with real robots.

This study, for the first time, represents the configuration of shape‐morphing devices using point cloud data and employing deep learning to map these configurations to control inputs. Shape Morphing Net (SMNet), a method that realizes the regression from point cloud to high‐dimensional control input vectors, is proposed. It has been applied to 3D PSM devices with three different actuator mechanisms, demonstrating its universal applicability to inversely reproduce the target shapes. Further, applied to previous 2D PSM devices, SMNet significantly enhances control precision from 82.23% to 97.68%. In the demonstrations of morphology mimicking, 3D PSM devices successfully replicate arbitrary target shapes obtained either through 3D scanning of physical objects or via 3D modeling software.

    "abstract": "Solar cell research aims to improve power conversion efficiency (PCE). This field has an extensive body of literature on the Web of Science. For researchers, it is impossible to understand the development of the entire field comprehensively through traditional reading methods. Knowledge is recorded in the literature by text and numbers. Researchers acquire knowledge through literature surveying, text reading, and thinking. The conversion from text and numbers to knowledge can be automatically completed by machines, which can avoid path‐dependent perspectives. In this work, an intelligent machine learning method for literature structure delineation and information extraction is proposed. As an example, a knowledge base of organic solar cells (OSCs) is extracted including topic analysis of literature, numerical characteristics of performance, and material information. Seven major research directions of OSCs are identified. The correlations between key performance parameters, including PCE, short‐circuit current density ( J SC ), open‐circuit voltage ( V OC ), and fill factor (FF), are revealed from text mining. A donor–acceptor material map of PCE is constructed which provides a road map for OSCs, indicating the bottleneck of this field. Moreover, the method of machine intelligence developed here can be used in any other materials field, aiding a comprehensive understanding of the development quickly.",

    "abstract": "Surface functional microstructures exhibit extensive application requirements in an array of breakthrough areas. One critical problem that restricts their industrial application is the lack of scalable fabrication techniques due to the limitation of conventional machine tools. This study proposes a scalable surface texturing technique using a portable small (30 × 19 × 22 mm) three‐leg robot that walks and works on the workpiece surface. Due to the elliptical tool vibration, microgrooves can be created on the workpiece surface periodically; meanwhile, the machining force drives the robot to walk forward. Surface texturing experiments are conducted on aluminum and copper workpieces to explore the machining performance of the small robot. The robot can reach a maximum moving velocity of 6.3 mm s −1 and can produce microstructures with a spacing of 4–14 μm on workpiece surfaces. Owing to its unique working principle, the small robot can maintain a constant depth of cut, demonstrating its capacity to adapt to the surface waviness of the workpiece. Finally, the motion straightness of the robot is greatly improved by combining it with the auxiliary track, and multiline microstructures are obtained. In short, the developed small robot presents a promising solution to the challenge of scalable surface texturing.",

The existing perception solutions, such as camera or light detection and ranging (LiDAR)‐based methods, are inadequate when faced with visually degraded conditions caused by smoke. In this work, SmokeNav, a novel system that combines data from an inertial sensor and millimeter‐wave (mmWave) radar, is proposed to enhance situational awareness for first responders in smoky environments. SmokeNav utilizes an inertial positioning module that exploits the human motion constraints with a foot‐mounted inertial measurement unit to provide accurate user localization. By integrating this location information with mmWave radar data, it employs a probabilistic occupancy map construction to reconstruct an accurate metric map. To enable semantic understanding of the environment, a DNN‐based semantic segmentation model that incorporates radar reflectivity and employs focal loss to improve performance is introduced. Herein, extensive real‐world experiments in smoky environments is conducted to demonstrate that SmokeNav precisely localizes the user and generates detailed maps with semantic segmentation. In this work, potentials are held for enhancing the safety and effectiveness of first responders in hazardous conditions.",

The system is small (primary dimension 25.2 cm), lightweight (260 g), and agile (thrust‐to‐weight ratio of 3.3) while simultaneously integrating sensorized flexible joints in its arms. These elastic joints unlock the potential of experiencing flexible deformations, thus enabling the robot to resiliently withstand collisions at high speeds and squeeze through openings more narrow than its nominal dimensions. Extensive analysis of the flexible joints’ behavior under static loads and in free flight is conducted. Driven by the deformations that the robot can experience, adaptive control allocation exploiting real‐time angle deflection feedback from Hall‐effect sensors embedded in the joints is proposed and combined with fixed‐gain control. To demonstrate Morphy's performance, multiple experiments are conducted, including free flight trajectory tracking, impacts with the environment, and flying through narrow passages. As shown, the system can withstand collisions up to 7.6 m s −1 in drop tests and 3 m s −1 midflight while recovering back to hover. Finally, Morphy's capability to passively change its shape and squeeze through openings smaller than its nominal size is showcased both in the horizontal and in the vertical directions.",

While the rotation of flexible wings enhance the thrust generation, two‐winged ornithopters did not scale up well because of higher disk loading. In comparison, the X‐winged or multiple‐V‐winged ornithopters enjoy a lower disk loading by beating multiple wings slower, at a smaller stroke angle or a longer span. Further, the clap‐and‐fling interaction of V and X‐wings boosts the thrust generation. Future works can explore the wing flexibility and morphology change to improve the hoverability and flight agility of ornithopters.",

The IMADC‐based CIM system achieves software‐comparable accuracy in CIFAR‐10 image classification on the VGG‐9 network. The IMADC exhibits significantly reduced area occupancy (45 μm 2 ) and energy consumption (29.6 fJ) compared to conventional CMOS‐based ADCs.

    "abstract": "For energy‐ and time‐efficient artificial intelligence (AI) computing, implementing hardware‐based spiking neural networks (SNNs) has become a core technology. In SNNs, synaptic devices store weights in memory, and neurons process received weighted information and generate spike signals. Upon feeding spike signals into synaptic arrays, the synaptic weights multiply the signals, which subsequently sum up to perform vector‐matrix multiplication (VMM). Simultaneous access to multiple synaptic devices, however, reduces the equivalent resistance of these synaptic arrays. This reduction alters the voltage division between the pre‐synaptic array and the input resistance of the neuron circuit, distorting the read voltage across synaptic devices. This phenomenon is known as the fan‐in problem, which leads to non‐ideal VMM operations and degrades system accuracy. To address this issue, a novel compensated current mirror (CCM) neuron circuit is proposed, which incorporates a single additional transistor into a conventional current mirror. This CCM neuron achieves exceptional current linearity ( R 2 &gt; 0.999) and efficiently compensates for VMM error with low complexity and energy consumption (3.33 pJ spike −1 ). Furthermore, the CCM neuron demonstrates ≈7‐%p higher inference accuracy than conventional ones when integrated with a 512 × 512 large‐scale synaptic array, which is comparable to the accuracy of software‐based SNNs.",

However, their softness makes accurate control challenging, requiring high‐fidelity sensing for posture and contact estimation.Traditional camera‐based sensors and load cells have limited portability and accuracy, and they will inevitably increase the robot's cost and weight. In this study, instead of using specialized sensors, only distributed pressure data inside a pneumatics‐driven soft arm are collected and the physical reservoir computing principle is applied to simultaneously predict its kinematic posture (i.e., bending angle) and payload status (i.e., payload mass). Results show that, with careful readout training, one can obtain accurate bending angle and payload mass predictions via simple, weighted linear summations of pressure readings. In addition,analysis show that, to guarantee low prediction errors within 10%, bending angle prediction requires less training data than payload prediction. This reveals that balanced linear and nonlinear body dynamics are critical for the physical reservoir to accomplish complex proprioceptive and exteroceptive information perception tasks. Finally, the method of exploring efficient readout training methods presented here could be extended to other soft robotic systems to maximize their perception capabilities.",

With unknown faults as a zero‐shot learning problem, this article proposes a method for detecting and isolating unknown faults based on knowledge distillation within a teacher–student framework. Process data and image data are equivalent in their spatiotemporal dimensions, and convolutional neural networks are selected as the teacher model, pretrained on image data. Information under both normal and fault conditions is then effectively extracted from process data by the well‐trained teacher model. Subsequently, knowledge distillation is used to transfer only the data of normal conditions in the teacher model to the student model. When an unknown fault arises, there exist differences between the information extracted by the teacher model and the student model. Contributions of variables to faults are calculated by quantifying these differences through gradients, thereby isolating the unknown fault. Finally, compared with a series of baseline methods and two state‐of‐the‐art methods, the proposed method improves fault diagnosis accuracy by 3.08% to 26.13% in the Tennessee Eastman process and by 3.48% to 41.45% in the sour water treatment process.

    "abstract": "Touchscreens are essential parts of many electronics in daily lives of sighted people in the digital information era. On the other hand, visually impaired users rely on tactile displays as one of the key communication devices to interact with the digital world. However, due to their working mechanism and the uneven surface of tactile displays, one of the key features of screens for sighted users is surprisingly challenging to implement: precision touch input. To overcome this, a hand gesture recognition system is developed using a frequency‐modulated continuous wave millimeter‐wave radar. A multifeature encoder method is used to obtain the range and velocity information from the radar to translate the data into spectrogram images. Gesture recognition is implemented for common input gestures: single/double‐click, swipe‐right/left, scroll‐up/down, zoom‐in/out, and rotate‐anticlockwise/clockwise. The gesture recognition and classification are based on machine learning, support vector machines, deep learning, and convolutional neural network approaches. The chosen model You‐Only‐Look‐Once (YOLOv8) shows a high accuracy of 97.1% by iterating only 30 epochs with only 500 collected data samples per gesture. This research paves the way toward using radar sensors not only for tactile displays but also for other digital devices in human–computer interaction.",

As artificial intelligences (AIs) become integrated or “embodied” with CBLs and gain independence from human oversight, efforts to identify novel pharmaceuticals, renewable energies, and agricultural biotechnologies will accelerate. AI‐driven CBLs can perform tasks more efficiently and accurately than human scientists at lower costs, achieving results in weeks rather than years. However, as AI systems approach or exceed human intelligence, their decision‐making abilities could outpace the need for human input, raising ethical, economic, and safety concerns. Aligning AI goals with human values is critical, as unregulated systems could pose existential risks, including global health hazards or the distortion of knowledge‐generating systems. AI‐driven misinformation in research highlights the need for transparency and data integrity, which may be achieved by aligning incentivizes and engineered fail‐safes to promote long‐term human flourishing. To mitigate risks, strict compartmentalization of AI systems and CBLs with third‐party supervision at fine temporal resolutions will be necessary. While current CBLs are piloted by humans, future AI systems may relegate humans to the role of co‐pilot.

The OCO estimation algorithm cascades a backpropagation (BP)‐based offline learning network and a radial basis function (RBF)‐based online learning network, realizing the prior estimation and error compensation, respectively. The BP network is pretrained offline based on the data collected in free spaces, while the RBF network could be updated online by the least squares method with the historical data in unstructured working spaces to avoid the local optimum problem. Furthermore, a modified loss function consisting of three terms is proposed for the RBF network to improve the estimated distal trajectories’ accuracy, smoothness, and stability in complex unstructured environments. Experimental results indicate that the proposed OCO estimation algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy, with an average relative estimation error of 1.36% in two types of unstructured environments with visual occlusion. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is improved by more than 30% in the trajectory estimation of two consecutive loops, demonstrating its outstanding online learning ability. Moreover, experiments on another type of continuum manipulator have also validated its high transferability and strong robustness.",

SuperResNET computational modules include correction for multiple blinking of single fluorophores, denoising, segmentation (clustering), feature extraction used for cluster group identification, modularity analysis, blob retrieval, and visualization in 2D and 3D. Here, a graphical user interface version of SuperResNET was applied to publicly available direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) data of nucleoporin Nup96 and Nup107 labeled nuclear pores that present a highly organized octagon structure of eight corners. SuperResNET effectively segments nuclear pores and Nup96 corners based on differential proximity threshold analysis from 2D and 3D SMLM datasets. SuperResNET quantitatively analyzes features from segmented nuclear pores, including complete structures with eightfold symmetry, and from segmented corners. SuperResNET modularity analysis of segmented corners from 2D SMLM distinguishes two modules at 10.7 ± 0.1 nm distance, corresponding to two individual Nup96 molecules. SuperResNET is therefore a model‐free tool that can reconstruct network architecture and molecular distribution of subcellular structures without the bias of a specified prior model, attaining molecular resolution from dSTORM data.

The neural networks are trained using 18 000 data points generated from numerical simulations with input powers ranging from sub‐kW‐ to kW‐class.

Most proposed planetary excavation systems are integrated with a wheeled vehicle, but none yet have used a screw‐propelled vehicle which can significantly enhance the excavation performance. Therefore, CASPER, a novel screw‐propelled excavation rover, is developed and analyzed to determine its effectiveness as a planetary excavator. The excavation rate, power, velocity, cost of transport, and a new parameter, excavation transport rate, are analyzed for various configurations of the vehicle through mobility and excavation tests performed in silica sand. The optimal configuration yields a 30 kg h −1 excavation rate and 10.2 m min −1 traverse rate with an overall system mass of 3.4 kg and power draw of less than 30 W. These results indicate that this architecture shows promise as a planetary excavation because it provides significant excavation capability with low mass and power requirements.

Typically, the soft robot designer starts from a type of soft actuation technology at a component level, rather than from a systems engineering level. The characteristics of soft actuation technology may apply constraints on the final system. Bond‐graph theory can be used to graphically represent a model of the energy transfer through a system. Top‐level abstraction can be in the form of a word bond‐graph and bond‐graph elements can form a lower component level abstraction. Herein, bond‐graph abstraction is applied to different soft actuators and their essential characteristics are identified from an energy‐based perspective. Several distinct soft actuation technologies are represented using bond‐graph components for each of the key elements: the energy source, the intermediate energy storage, energy dissipation, energy transformation, and the interaction with the environment. By applying this analysis, the soft robot designer is enabled to select the most suitable actuation technology to fulfill their top‐level system requirements independently of the actuation domain.

Roboticists endeavor to close the gap between robots and their biological counterparts by developing various active tails. This work explores these active tails and establishes a design strategy to enhance reorientation performances. A dynamic model to describe the transmitted torques at the body from the single‐axis active tail is suggested. The design parameters, which define the transmitted torques, are analyzed through the dynamic model to understand their contributions. The effects of aerodynamics on the active tail's performance are also explored. The active tails are categorized according to inertial tail designs (unbalanced distal mass or mass‐balanced about a rotating point), aerodynamic configurations (inertial, aerodynamic, aerodynamic with external airflow), and operating strategies (partial oscillation, symmetric oscillation, asymmetric‐oscillation or full rotations). The reorientation performance of 24 possible active tail combinations is explored and design strategies to select the proper combinations according to the target system's conditions are provided. This work can help in guiding the advanced active tail designs for future agile mobile robots.",

Particularly, the flipper‐propelled locomotion exhibits traits such as super‐redundancy and large deformations, necessitating depiction of both movements of the rigid skeletons as well as local deformations of the soft tissues. However, there are few well‐established kinematic/hydrodynamic framework models and constitutive equations for such rigid–flexible intrinsically coupled biosystems. Herein, combined with a skeletal skinning algorithm to handle the deformation of a flexible body attached to a rigid body, a numerical computation framework for an in‐depth fluid–structure interaction is presented, which enables the capture of viscoelastic and anisotropic characteristics of a highly compliant 3D rigid–flexible coupled model in a low‐Reynolds‐number flow. Considering the biorobotic cormorant flipper with a nonuniformly distributed stiffness as a representative, the challenging issue of controlling a biomechanically compliant flipper to synthesize realistic locomotion sequences, including rigid skeleton movements and soft tissue deformations, is addressed. Furthermore, a numerical computational hydrodynamic analysis is performed to demonstrate that the cormorant flipper can generate 5 N fluid force and 0.45 N m fluid moment during the turning operation in 0.8 s, which is consistent with the former experimental results.",

An interpretable deep learning model is developed to distinguish morphological changes with varied HAT1 expressions in esophageal squamous carcinoma cells (ESCC). The gradient‐weighted class activation mapping and prediction score analysis reveal that the computer's vision focuses on the nuclear sizes of ESCC. The hypothesized phenotype is verified in HAT1‐knockdown ESCCs. Finally, HAT1 regulating cell senescence by affecting the H3K27 acetylation and E2F transcription factor 7 (E2F7) expression is shown.

Herein, pa novel microfluidic flow field generator is proposed, capable of generating stable flow field down to the limit of thermal noise. Integrated with a customized MATLAB program controlling timely open–close of 18 monolithic PDMS valves, the flow generator outperforms the existing methods by both achievable low flow rate, that is, 0.01 nL s −1 , temporal resolution of flow rate fluctuation down to 100 ms, and provides complex flow patterns. Moreover, unlike external devices (e.g., the syringe pump), the design can be easily integrated into any fluidic chip and sealed from the disturbance of experimental conditions, for example, the airflow and the movement of connected pipelines. The methodology is, therefore, suitable for biological and biophysical studies requiring a well‐defined flowing environment.",

An human‐in‐the‐loop procedure to tailor the implementation of ML for multicriteria optimization is described. The effectiveness of this procedure in the development of a nafion‐based membrane electrode assembly for electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) into CO for two targets is demonstrated: energy efficiency (EE) and partial current density for CO 2 RR (). Model‐agnostic nonlinear correlation analyses identify the 11 features relevant to those targets. The three studied decision tree‐based ML models yield similar cross‐validation errors so an ad hoc feature analysis of the models is done with SHapley Additive exPlanations and nonlinear correlation techniques. The predicted EE‐ space and the functional dependency of the predictions are investigated to assess model plausibility. A genetic algorithm with CO production cost as the final target with subsequent validation experiments of candidate conditions is devised. The model chosen through ad hoc analysis yields the highest accuracy and the only one that can locate the Pareto front with a single round of experiments, demonstrating how appropriate model selection through careful inspection can greatly accelerate the research cycle.",

Self‐folding method is effective for fabricating origami structures, but conventional strategy of self‐folding by driving all hinges is unsophisticated and thus makes redundancy and unnecessary limitations in fabrication. The behavior of deformation of origami structures can be described as a linkage mechanism, so that the degree of freedom of the origami structure is essentially not equal to the number of hinges. Herein, a self‐folding method is proposed for origami structures such that an entire structure can be folded by driving only a few hinges using the characteristics of force transmission of origami as a linkage mechanism. This proposed self‐folding method allows the selection of the position of the driving hinges and enables the self‐folding of origami structures with the restrictions of the position of the driving hinge. In addition, the method can provide high process compatibility for the fabrication and folding processes of origami devices.",

Accurate local stiffness control is of considerable significance to the design and application of 3D variable–stiffness structures although it is challenging. Herein, a 3D variable–stiffness structure realization scheme based on a patterned heating network is introduced. The laser‐engraving and 3D‐printing technologies are combined to obtain a 3D variable–stiffness structure composed of a patterned graphene‐heating network (PGHN) and polylactic acid (PLA). The proposed scheme uses PGHN to accurately control the local stiffness of 3D PLA and realize programmable design and fabrication of 3D variable–stiffness structures. The “torsional structure,” “hexagonal structure,” and “spring” cases are used to elaborate the designability, excellent deformation and reconstruction capacity, and reasonable load bearing capacity of the PGHN/PLA variable–stiffness structure. A pneumatic disc, which is used as a reference for studies on shape control of PGHN/PLA variable–stiffness structures, is designed. Also, a pneumatic robot is designed based on the local stiffness control and shape‐locking function of PGHN/PLA to achieve multimode motion control using a single air source. The PGHN/PLA variable–stiffness structure has potential applications in multimode robots, wearable devices, and deployable structures.",

By exploiting scaling laws and bioinspired designs, insect‐scale micro‐aerial‐vehicles (MAVs) have demonstrated impressive flight capabilities such as in‐flight collision resilience and acrobatic maneuvers. However, existing subgram MAVs are difficult to design, construct, and repair. Coupled with challenges in robot sensing and control, existing subgram MAVs have not achieved insect‐like swarm flight, which limits potential studies of swarm behaviors and future applications such as collective sensing. Herein, a new design and fabrication method is developed to substantially improve the fabrication scalability of subgram MAVs. Based on a small set of design parameters, an automated algorithm generates the laser cut files of microrobotic components. To reduce fabrication and assembly time, stereolithographic 3D printing is used for making static components such as the airframe and connectors. The modular design enables straightforward assembly and repair, which reduces the overall fabrication time by over 2 times. Owing to the ease of fabrication and good reliability, two subgram MAVs demonstrate controlled hovering flight and coordinated lifting of an object. This result lays the foundation for future robotic studies of collective insect flight.",

Herein, an offline programming guidance (OLPG) scheme for aggregated MNPs is proposed based on a real‐time aggregation volume estimator. The proposed aggregation volume estimator based on a magnetic drug‐targeting simulator reflects volume changes of aggregated MNPs; hence, it can model a magnetic force acting on aggregated MNPs in real time while enhancing targeting performance. The proposed guidance system is evaluated using a simulation testbed and in vitro model of the rat brain, which yields comparable results at different fluid viscosities, flow velocities, target areas, and flow types. The OLPG with the aggregation volume estimator improves targeting performance by 116%–409% compared with the default mode, and by 111%–180% compared to the performance without the aggregation volume estimator. Furthermore, a guidance margin predicts enhanced targeting performance (root‐mean‐square error &lt; 5%) irrespective of the flow environment. The proposed guidance strategy has the potential to overcome the problems caused by the lack of an imaging modality, control‐system complexity, and low targeting performance.",

    "abstract": "Lung disease has become a leading cause of disease‐related death, making it one of the most serious health problems in the world. Due to the advantages of fast postoperative recovery and small trauma, transbronchoscopic biopsy has become the main method for the diagnosis of lung diseases. However, limited by the large outer diameter of the bronchoscope, insufficient flexibility of the biopsy needle, and lack of force sensing, traditional biopsy operation is simple and rough, and it is difficult to enter the deep narrow areas of the lung for examination. In this article, a flexible biopsy robot with force‐sensing ability is proposed. The robot is composed of a tendon‐actuated catheter and an inner sliding flexible needle as well as their driving systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the robot has good positioning accuracy of 0.72 mm and high flexibility and repeatability. With the cooperation of the commercial bronchoscope, the robot can reach various narrow areas of the lung to perform biopsy operations. The proposed robot has the potential to improve the diagnosis rate of lung diseases and reduce related deaths.",

First, the raw time‐series data of 33 body nodes are transformed to red–green–blue images by encoding the 3D positional information to one pixel. Second, the LeNet‐5 network is enhanced by expanding the receptive field, introducing coordinate attention and the smooth maximum unit to improve smoothness and feature extraction. Third, the ability of coded images to express human activities is studied in various environments. It is shown in the experimental results that the method achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.02% in recognizing 25 daily human activities, such as running, writing, and walking.

Moreover, one of the brain's remarkable properties is its ability to process complex information by resolving it on different timescales. In synapse‐emulating artificial devices, some form of memory (e.g., hysteresis in current–voltage characteristics) is required. One of the important characteristics of biological synapses is the coexistence of short‐ and long‐term memory, also called plasticity. However, a broader exploration of memory at multiple timescales in materials remains limited. Herein, the first example of synaptic transistors utilizing colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as active material is reported. It is demonstrated that PbS‐CQDs, with metal halide and perovskite‐like ligands, are ideal as an active material for synaptic transistors exhibiting both short‐ and long‐term plasticity. Most interestingly, by changing the chemistry of the quantum dot outer monolayer, a drastic change in the temporal response of the learning is observed, demonstrating the possibility of engineering materials exhibiting learning at multiple timescales, similar to the biological synapses.",

Although most fusion methods can achieve good performance, there are still shortcomings in extracting feature information from source images, which make it difficult to balance the thermal radiation region information and texture detail information in the fused image. To address the above issues, an expectation maximization (EM) learning framework based on adversarial generative networks (GAN) for infrared and visible image fusion is proposed. The EM algorithm (EMA) can obtain maximum likelihood estimation for problems with potential variables, which is helpful in solving the problem of lack of labels in infrared and visible image fusion. The axial‐corner attention mechanism is designed to capture long‐range semantic information and texture information of the visible image. The multifrequency attention mechanism digs the relationships between features at different scales to highlight target information of infrared images in the fused result. Meanwhile, two discriminators are used to balance two different features, and a new loss function is designed to maximize the likelihood estimate of the data with soft class label assignments, which is obtained from the expectation network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of EMA‐GAN over the state‐of‐the‐art.",

Current recognition methods for HRRP sequences mainly focus on the temporal information of HRRP sequences, which cannot fully utilize the temporal and spatial information contained in HRRP sequences. Moreover, most of these methods fail in long‐range modeling and global information extraction of HRRP sequences. To solve above problems, a HRRP sequence recognition method based on transformer with temporal–spatial fusion and label smoothing (TSF–transformer–LS) is proposed. TSF–transformer–LS contains temporal transformer blocks and spatial transformer blocks, which are used to extract deep global features of HRRP sequences in the time domain and space domain, respectively. Then, an attention fusion mechanism is developed to realize the adaptive fusion of temporal and spatial features. Moreover, label smoothing is used to add noise to sample labels, which can solve the overfitting problem of transformer caused by a large amount of noise hidden in HRRP in real scenes. Experiments on MSTAR, a standard dataset, show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in recognition performance.

They allow one to capture intrinsic state parameters in a highly conformable manner. However, due to the nonlinearities in the materials that make up a soft sensor, it is difficult to develop accurate models of these systems. Consequently, design of these soft sensors is largely user defined or based on trial and error. Since these sensors conform and take the shape of the sensing body, these issues are further exacerbated when they are installed. Herein, a framework for the automated design optimization of soft sensors using closed‐loop 3D printing of a recyclable hydrogel‐based sensing material is presented. The framework allows direct printing of the sensor on the sensing body using visual feedback, evaluates the sensor performance, and iteratively improves the sensor design. Following preliminary investigations into the material and morphology parameters, this is demonstrated through the optimization of a sensorized glove which can be matched to specific tasks and individual hand shapes. The glove's sensors are tuned to respond only to particular hand poses, including distinguishing between two similar tennis racket grip techniques.",

CT‐TFETs cointegrated with charge‐trapping metal–oxide–semiconductor FETs (CT‐MOSFETs) through complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor logic process exhibit ≈2,000× lower on‐current ( I on ) and ≈3,000× lower off‐current ( I off ) than CT‐MOSFETs, rendering them suitable for high‐accuracy large‐scale neuromorphic systems. According to the experimental and simulation results, CT‐TFETs outperform CT‐MOSFETs in terms of more accurate analog vector‐matrix multiplication than that of CT‐MOSFETs due to the following two reasons: first, CT‐TFETs feature a lower voltage (IR) drop resulting from lower I on than that of CT‐MOSFETs. Second, the former is more robust to the IR drops than the latter due to weak channel length modulation. For example, unlike CT‐MOSFETs, the proposed CT‐TFETs exhibit ignorable weight degradation in spite of the 1 Ω wire resistance. CT‐TFET arrays show ≈700× lower power consumption and ≈10% higher MNIST classification accuracy than CT‐MOSFET arrays, making CT‐TFET arrays promising for extensive and versatile neuromorphic computing applications.",

However, previous studies have typically labeled each specimen as either healthy or with a specific disease, ignoring prevalence of complications or comorbidities in actual cohorts, which may confound the microbial–disease associations. For instance, a patient may suffer from multiple diseases, making it challenging to detect their health status accurately. Furthermore, host phenotypes like physiological characteristics and lifestyles can alter microbiome structure, but such information has not yet been fully utilized in data models. To address these issues, a highly explainable deep learning (DL) method called Meta‐Spec is proposed. Using a deep neural network (DNN)‐based approach, it encodes and embeds refined host variables with microbiome features, enabling the detection of multiple diseases simultaneously. Experiments show that Meta‐Spec outperforms regular machine learning (ML) strategies for multilabel disease screening in several cohorts. More importantly, Meta‐Spec successfully detects comorbidities that are often missed by other approaches. In addition, for its high interpretability, Meta‐Spec captures key factors that shape disease patterns from host variables and microbes. Hence, these efforts improve the feasibility and sensitivity of microbiome‐based disease screening in practical scenarios, representing a significant step toward personalized medicine and better health outcomes.",

This is likely due to artificial muscle's low effective strain and high radial expansion, limiting parallel operating efficiencies. To address these challenges, a class of compact versatile pneumatic actuators, called multilayer artificial muscle (MAM), that are capable of deployment to different applications through configurable modularity, is presented. The MAMs are biomimetically inspired by the sarcomere, the building block for natural muscle architecture. Similarly, MAM can extend and contract as well as be rearranged to mimic muscle‐like actions and functions, such as a caterpillar locomotion robot and an entire robotic arm. The MAMs are fabricated through multilayer, multimaterial, low‐cost additive manufacturing, which offers certain advantages such as higher extension, contraction force, and durability.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to model 3D NAND flash memory using GNN. This method has good generalization performance across various retention times and temperatures, achieving a remarkable overlap of 95.28% between ground truth and predicted distributions. Moreover, two applications of this method are introduced that contribute to the NAND flash memory improvement. One is a GNN‐assist program, which leverages well‐trained GNN to suppress the degradation affected by cross‐temperature, resulting in reduced shift and narrower distribution width. The other is the sensitivity decomposition to identify parameters influencing the cell at cross‐temperature. It is found that cross‐temperature impact extends beyond physically connected cells to adjacent cells at close distances.

Inspired by the working principle of the clearnose skate , herein, an undulation robotic structure is presented. Considering the hydrodynamic skeleton and propulsion mechanism of the clearnose skate , the solution is based on a piezoelectric composite for realizing undulatory propulsion. This approach leverages the converse piezoelectric effect and modal coupling to produce the desired undulating motion, thereby achieving the undulation design of the robot. The proposed robotic structure can realize the propulsion mode using piezoelectric composites to undulate in the same direction and can use the clockwise or counterclockwise undulation of piezoelectric composites to achieve the steering mode. In addition, finite element analysis is employed as an approach to investigate the undulation characteristics and transient vibration characteristics of the robot. The operational efficiency of the robotic structure is assessed through experiments. The results show that the propulsion mode achieves the speed of 3.33 body‐length s −1 .

To realize ONNs, linear combinations and nonlinear activation functions have to be implemented in an optical fashion. Optical nonlinearities are, however, still difficult to achieve, and existing designs are usually too inflexible to offer different activation functions as used in artificial neural networks. Herein, the nonlinear properties of the large and highly adaptive class of photoswitchable chemical compounds is made accessible as activation functions in ONNs by employing photo‐induced isomerization in azobenzenes to steer activation behavior through nonlinear modulation of an information‐carrying optical signal. The strength of the nonlinearity can be controlled by the chemical concentration while a physically motivated model describes the experimental data for systematically varied photoswitching parameters, resulting in a tunable yet interpretable activation function. Employing such an activation function in a neural network then allows to gauge its strength and perform established classification tasks. The work combines recent advances with photoswitchable chemical compounds and optical neural networks to enable control over the design of nonlinear activation functions, thus opening exciting perspectives for explaining the emergence of intelligent behavior in neural networks.",

Both of them suffer from lower accuracies compared with their reference ANNs and need lots of time steps to achieve stable performance in deep architectures. In this article, a novel conversion framework is presented for deep SNNs with negative‐spike dynamics, which takes a quantization constraint and spike compensation technique into consideration during ANN‐to‐SNN conversion, and a truly lossless accuracy performance with their ANN counterparts is obtained. The converted SNNs can retain full advantages of simple leaky‐integrate‐and‐fire spiking neurons and are very suited for hardware implementation.

    "abstract": "In this work, the requirement of using high‐precision (HP) signals is lifted and the circuits for implementing deep learning algorithms in memristor‐based hardware are simplified. The use of HP signals is required by the backpropagation learning algorithm since the gradient descent learning rule relies on the chain product of partial derivatives. However, it is both challenging and biologically implausible to implement such an HP algorithm in noisy and analog memristor‐based hardware systems. Herein, it is demonstrated that the requirement for HP signals handling is not necessary and more efficient deep learning can be achieved when using a binary stochastic learning algorithm. The new algorithm proposed in this work modifies elementary neural network operations, which improves energy efficiency by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional memristor‐based hardware and three orders of magnitude compared to complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor‐based hardware. It also provides better accuracy in pattern recognition tasks than the HP learning algorithm benchmarks.",

The proposed design has the advantages of low inertia, high load‐to‐weight ratio, and impact resistance. First, to solve the redundant motion‐transmission problem, a refined virtual chain method is proposed for the type synthesis of the 4‐DOF parallel thigh mechanism. Second, the relationship equation for each actuated wrench component in a reasonable actuated joint arrangement is derived, and the number and location of the actuated joints are determined. Third, by optimizing the design of the hip joint as a 2‐DOF counter‐centered five‐link spherical mechanism with different rotation centers, passive knee and ankle joints are designed based on the bionic principle. This design is performed to make the PBM isotropic and minimize inertia. The proposed PBM can withstand heavy loads and impacts owing to its humanoid crossed four‐link knee joint mechanism and compliant calf mechanism. Finally, the prototype is processed, and the rationality of the design and excellent performance of the PBM design are verified by dynamic and static simulations and gait experiments.",

As a result, many individuals suffer from frustration, isolation, and depression. Natural verbal communication for SSD patients is now more feasible than ever thanks to advancements in wearable artificial skins and machine learning. This article presents an assistive magnetic skin system for speech reconstruction (AM2S‐SR), which enables SSD‐afflicted people to communicate with their mouths. Using magnetic field sensors integrated into Magnetphones, the system reads the movement of the mouth by tracking the movement of magnetic skin patches attached next to the bottom lip. The measured magnetic field signals data are then processed using a Fine K‐Nearest Neighbor machine learning classifier. The classified data are then exported verbally on speakers, or visually on a display. AM2S‐SR successfully identifies the full English alphabets with average success rate of 94.96%, thus enabling SSD people to talk using the mouth and have a more natural conversation with others.",

    "abstract": "Achieving crowd formation transformations has wide‐ranging applications in fields such as unmanned aerial vehicle formation control, crowd simulation, and large‐scale performances. However, planning trajectories for hundreds of agents is a challenging and tedious task. When modifying crowd formation change schemes, adjustments are typically required based on the style of formation change. Existing methods often involve manual adjustments at each crucial step, leading to a substantial amount of physical labor. Motivated by these challenges, this study introduces a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating crowd formation transformations. The proposed GAN learns specific styles from a series of crowd formation transformation trajectories and can transform a new crowd with an arbitrary number of individuals into the same styles with minimal manual intervention. The model incorporates a space–time transformer module to aggregate spatiotemporal information for learning distinct styles of formation transformation. Furthermore, this article investigates the relationship between the distribution of training data and the length of trajectory sequences, providing insights into the preprocessing of training data.",

As a result, coming up with a robust method to provide the probability generator is an essential knob for its physical implementation. Here, implanting such stochastic behavior into the weight update signal itself is proposed, by multiplying it with the randomized probability sequence. To generate such probability sequence, bang‐bang dithering of a phase‐locked loop (PLL) with a binary phase detector (PD) is used. The programmable probability is enabled by introducing an offset for the PD outputs. Yet the dithering sequence has deterministic nature, phase noise of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) ring oscillator to randomize the deterministic dithering is exploited. As a result, this lower power oscillator offers a better probability sequence, which enables an ultralow power circuit implementation.",

To train the memristor cells in a memristive neural network, the analog conductance state of the memristor should be programmed in parallel; otherwise, the resulting long training time can limit the size of the neural network. Herein, a novel parallel programming method using the self‐limited analog switching behavior of the memristor is proposed. A Pt/Ti:NbO x /NbO x /TiN charge trap memristor device for the programming demonstration is utilized, and a convolutional neural network is emulated to train the MNIST dataset, based on the device characteristics. In the simulation, the proposed programming method is able to reduce programming time to as low as 1/130, compared with the sequential programming method. The simulation suggests that the programming time required by the proposed method is not affected by array size, which makes it very promising in a high‐density neural network.",

    "abstract": "A lack of sensory feedback often hinders minimally invasive operations. Although endoscopy has addressed this limitation to an extent, endovascular procedures such as angioplasty or stenting still face significant challenges. Sensors that rely on a clear line of sight cannot be used because it is unable to gather feedback in blood environments. During the stent deployment procedure, feedback on the deployed stent's state is critical because a partially open stent can affect the blood flow. Despite this, no robust and noninvasive clinical solutions that allow real‐time monitoring of the stent deployment exists. In recent years, radio frequency (RF)‐based sensors can detect the shape and material of an object that is hidden from the direct line of sight. Herein, the use of a 3D RF‐based imaging sensor and a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called StentNet is proposed for detecting the stent's state without a need for a clear line of sight. The StentNet achieves an overall accuracy of 90% in detecting the state of an occluded stent in the test dataset. Compared with an existing CNN model, the StentNet significantly outperforms the 3D LeNet in the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1‐score.",

    "abstract": "Nature is an unlimited source of inspiration for soft bionic sensors and actuators, which have been recently spotlighted for applications in soft robotics. Soft bionic sensors are sensing platforms that can bend, stretch, or morph shapes to allow for the detection of external stimuli such as force, displacement, pressure, temperature, or chemicals under slight mechanical deformations. Soft robotics technologies have now evolved beyond tactile sensing, and devices with displacement, temperature, or light detection capabilities are currently under development. Owing to advances in the field of conductive composite materials, various types of soft bionic sensors have been introduced, such as flexible, stretchable, and wearable sensors. With respect to soft bionic actuators, early developments on dielectric elastomers have led to the recent realization of artificial muscles based on smart polymer materials. While pneumatic actuators have opened the field of soft robotics, recent developments include various soft and smart actuating mechanisms using fluids, chemicals, and soft materials. Also, novel manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing, have been ushering the advancedment of soft bionic actuators for soft robotic fingers inspired by biomimetic structures such as insects, or adopted by architectured solids like auxetic or origami structures. Owing to the increased interest in flexible soft robotics, which is expected to offer alternative ways to build soft and diverse robots, soft bionic sensors are anticipated to consistently grow in importance and become industrially relevant. Before considering the creation of novel soft bionic sensors and actuators, it is highly recommended to consult other fields such as material science to consider existing knowledge on soft and smart concepts. Thus, one of the challenges in soft bionic sensors and actuators is the interdisciplinary collaboration among other engineering fields. To showcase recent advances in this rapidly growing field, we have organized this special issue of Advanced Intelligent Systems focusing on \"Soft Bionic Sensors and Actuators\". It is intended to make an open discussion for ongoing interdisciplinary research from various fields and to provide an outline for potential applications. The issue brings contributions together from experts and covers the following three key aspects of soft bionic sensors and actuators: Michael D. Dickey, Tae-il Kim, and co-workers (article number 2000159) reviewed gallium-based liquid metals for the biomedical sensors and soft actuators, which are representative stretchable conductors with metallic conductivity and nearly unlimited extensibility due to their liquid nature. Despite their enormous surface tension, liquid metals can be patterned into non-spherical shapes, such as wires, due to the presence of a native oxide shell. The thin oxide layer also enables the formation of stable liquid colloids and micro/nanosized droplets that do not coalesce so easily. The oxide layer can be exfoliated and chemically modified into semiconductor 2D materials to create and deposit atomically thin materials at room temperature. This review summarizes physical and chemical methods of modifying the surface of liquid metal to tune its properties. The surface modification of liquid metal provides unique applications, including use in soft biomedical sensors and actuators with mechanical properties similar to human tissue. Hyun-Joong Chung and co-workers (article number 2000186) reviewed magnetically controlled soft robotics utilizing elastomers and gels in actuation. A magnetic field has unique advantages in controlling soft robotics inside of an enclosed space, such as surgical catheters or untethered drug-delivering robots operating in the human body. Soft actuators, made of elastomers and gels functionalized with magnetically active materials, are a natural choice to drive magnetically controlled motions of the soft robots. Recent innovations in soft material technologies, including 3D printing, origami/kirigami, tough hydrogels, mechanical metamaterials, and liquid metal injected elastomers, offer technological foundations to develop soft actuators and robots with significantly enhanced performance. This review provides an overview of magnetic soft actuators and robots from a materials engineer's perspective. In this review, the applications of the magnetically-controlled soft robotics in surgical and therapeutic medical devices are discussed. Jamie Paik and co-workers (article number 2000168) developed a novel wearable haptic feedback device. While there have been continuous efforts to recreate these haptic experiences for applications in rehabilitation, or medical and educational tools using master/slave control, haptic devices are still limited in invoking intricate and rich sensations. This paper presents the design, model, and experimental validation of a wearable skin-like interface able to recreate the roughness, shape, and size of a perceived object; a platform for an immersive physical experience. They demonstrated for the first time how artificially created tactile feedback can indeed simulate physical interaction such as surface roughness, dimension, and shape, transferring a virtual experience effectively into a physical one. Ravinder Dahiya and co-workers (article number 1900145) demonstrated a novel tactile sensing device (SensAct) with soft pressure sensor seamlessly integrated as an integrated flexible actuator. The soft sensor was embedded in a custom 3D-printed fingertip of a prosthetic/robotic hand to demonstrate its use for pressure mapping alongwith remote vibrotactile stimulation using SensAct device. The self-controllable actuation of SensAct could provide eSkin the ability to tune its stiffness, while the vibration states could be utilized for controlled haptic feedback. Soft robots have been considered to have infinite degrees of freedom based on their structural compliance, providing high adaptability to the environments, and recent study has focused mostly on their physical designs for increasing the adaptability. Yong-Lae Park and co-workers (article number 2000061) demonstrated hybrid system analysis and control of a soft robotic gripper. They consider a soft robotic system as a hybrid system described by both discrete and continuous states and propose a method of analysis for enhanced manipulation performance. Therefore, they first determined the optimum location of sensor embedment on the actuator based on the calibration map obtained from actuator characterization, and developed a control strategy for the gripper to find the best position to grip the object based on the estimated states. For human-robot collaboration, the exterior material of robot body is required to have the the ability to sense the external environment, and needs to possess the function of cushioning the collision between human and robot. Geng Yang and co-workers (article number 2000038) demonstrated fluid-driven soft CoboSkin for safer human-robot collaboration. In this article, a fluid-driven soft robot skin with sensing and actuating functions is applied to a collaborative robot and working well with the host robot. By altering the internal air pressure in pneumatic actuators, the developed robot skin can provide more than ten times higher tunable stiffness and sensitivity. The 3D printed skin is attached to a collaborative robot conformally. The Coboskin provides the robot with multi-functions, which are similar to those of human muscles and skin attached to human bones. By mimicking human skin and muscle's tactile sensing and stiffness tuning functions, CoboSkin demonstrated better human–robot interaction in our daily activities. Continuous monitoring of vital signs can be a life-saving matter for different patient groups. Matti Mäntysalo and co-workers (article number 2000030) developed an unobtrusive, low-cost measurement and monitoring system for out-of-hospital and in-hospital applications. More intelligent and unobtrusive systems are currently being developed in order to improve the usability of body-worn monitoring devices. Body-worn devices can be skin-conformable, patch-type monitoring systems that are comfortable to use even for prolonged periods. In this study, they propose an intelligent and wearable, out-of-hospital, and in-hospital 4-electrode electrocardiography (ECG) and respiration measurement and monitoring system. The system consists of a conformable screen-printed disposable patch, a measurement unit, a gateway unit, and cloud-based analysis tools with reconfigurable signal processing pipelines. The performance of the ECG patch and the measurement unit was tested with cardiac patients and compared with a Holter monitoring device and discrete, single-site electrodes. Tse Nga Ng and co-workers (article number 2000106) developed artifacts mitigation in sensors for spasticity assessment. Spasticity is a pathological condition that can occur in people with neuromuscular disorders. This paper presents an instrumented bi-modal glove with force and movement sensors for spasticity assessment. The motorized robotic arm system offers adjustable resistance to simulate different levels of muscle stiffness in spasticity, and the sensors on the robot provide ground-truth measurements of angular displacement and force applied during flexion and extension maneuvers. The robotic sensor measurements are used to train the instrumented glove data through multi-task learning. After processing through the neural network, the Pearson correlation coefficients between the processed signals and the ground truth are above 0.92, demonstrating successful signal calibration and noise mitigation. We hope that this special issue focusing on soft bionic sensors and actuators will bring knowledge, insight, and inspiration to readers. The research in this area is highly interdisciplinary and combines expertise from several fields, such as materials science, physics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, etc. We look forward to the accelerated growth of development efforts in this field which would lead to expansive possibilities for technological translation to relevant fields. To close, we are indebted to all the authors with their insights on this exciting and explorative area of soft bionic sensors and actuators for the contribution to this Special Issue.

    "abstract": "Resistance switching devices are potential candidates for future memory applications. However, sneak‐path current issues in crossbar array cause energy and heat dissipation, and it requires additional circuitry for mitigation. To address this, we introduce a hybrid device with functional oxide as bilayer of amorphous strontium titanium oxide ( a ‐STO) and vanadium oxide ( a ‐VO x ). High‐performance resistive switching material a ‐STO is coupled with a ‐VO x having fast apolar threshold switching. The hybrid device gives performance equivalent to conventional one resistance switch and one selector architecture with stability of 6000 endurance cycles. Non‐linearity factor of the hybrid device is 4.8, which is slightly higher than only a ‐STO device of 4.7. Using I – V measurements, readout margin is calculated, which suggests integration into 10 4 × 10 4 array when 10% readout margin is considered at switching ratio of 8. Further, the selector effect using non‐zero‐crossing property of memristors, which reveals six times reduction in OFF current in the hybrid device, is quantified. Compositional analysis along the device cross‐section to understand elemental distribution and interface effects of two unique, multifaceted oxides is presented. As such, in the hybrid structure non‐linearity factor remains nearly constant, while the absolute value of non‐zero‐crossing current is reduced six times, which can reduce the overall sneak current in crossbars.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent micromachines that perform tasks in complex microenvironments by adjusting structural configurations and physical properties offer substantial potential for use in many fields, including precision medicine, microfluidic channels, micromanipulations, and bioengineering. Recent progress in smart materials and 4D microprinting provides a feasible strategy for fabricating compound micromachines by designing and assembling predictable 3D‐to‐3D shape‐morphing components. However, shape transformations of these components can only be triggered simultaneously by external stimuli, and orderly triggering among them cannot be achieved yet for an intended purpose of performing more efficient actions. Herein, a novel sequentially triggered strategy is proposed for developing intelligent micromachines that consist of multiple reconfigurable components that work interactively with each other. Furthermore, self‐locking micromachines with tunable coupling mechanisms that coordinate accurate time‐sequence deformations among components are achieved. Three types of locking couplings are modulated based on finite‐element analysis (FEA)‐aided design. The proposed method provides an effective strategy to create next‐generation intelligent micromachines that can change their shapes to adapt to complex situations and complete multiple tasks.",

However, molecular transistors are not used to build up the quantum logic gate. Herein, it is demonstrated that DNA, RNA, and protein are promising media for QCs, and one uses residue pairs, including nucleotide base pairs and amino acid pairs, via proton‐coupled electron transfer to fabricate a quantum logic gate. In the residue pair, the proton transfer between donor and acceptor states fulfills a qubit. Both the DNA‐CG (3‐qubit) nucleobase pair and nucleotide base pair obey the Toffoli gate. AT (2‐qubit) nucleotide base pair behaves as a SWAP gate and a CNOT gate. Furthermore, the AU and RNA‐CG nucleotide base pairs follow the CNOT gate and Toffoli gate, respectively. In addition, a pair of amino acids achieves 1‐qubit and satisfies the Pauli‐ X , ‐ Y , and ‐ Z gates. The generators of universal quantum logic gates are obtained.",

To this end, a facile and scalable approach that can be utilized for mass‐producing sandwich‐structured photoresponsive polyimide (PI)/Au/low‐density polyethylene (LDPE) nanocomposite films is reported. Attributed to the remote and precise‐driven mode, reversible and stable actuation behavior, and the ultrarobust mechanical properties of the sandwich‐structured PI/Au/LDPE nanocomposite films, it was possible to devise a variety of photoresponsive biomimetic soft robots such as artificial flytrap, directionally moveable caterpillar‐inspired walker, and dolphin‐like cruisable and loadable swimmer via simply tailoring them into predesigned geometries.",

    "abstract": "Memristor crossbar is extensively investigated as an energy‐efficient accelerator for neural network (NN) computations. However, hardware implementation of NNs using realistic memristors is challenging due to the ubiquity of faults (mainly classified into hard and soft faults) in memristors. Herein, a hardware‐friendly, low‐power multifault‐tolerant training (MFTT) scheme capable of addressing both hard and soft faults simultaneously for memristive NNs is proposed. The MFTT scheme consists of multifault detection, targeted weight pruning, and in situ training with the Manhattan update rule. Specifically, multifault detection is first conducted to detect both hard and large soft faults. The detected faulty weights are subsequently pruned to prevent them from disturbing the NN. The sparsified NN after pruning is in situ trained so that the hard and large soft faults can be effectively tolerated using the sparsity and self‐adaptivity of NNs. In addition, the remaining small soft faults can be well tolerated by the Manhattan update rule. Experimentally, MFTT demonstrates the lowest accuracy losses among several representative fault‐tolerant schemes not only in the hard fault‐only (when the hard fault ratio exceeds 10%) and soft fault‐only (when the soft faults are large) cases, but also in the case where both types of faults coexist.",

    "abstract": "Modular robots hold promise of adaptability, robustness, and versatility. Synchronization of modules is critical; if a module is asynchronous, not only will the robot fail to perform tasks properly, but its behavior may be self‐destructive through self‐collision. To avoid this, modern modular robots tend to have several separate communication systems. Wireless communication is used for interfacing with an external controller and synchronizing all modules, but is power‐hungry and prone to congestion with a large number of modules. Neighbor‐to‐neighbor (local) communication is necessary for configuration discovery and for synchronizing orientations, but cannot connect to wireless. As it stands, local communication is underutilized and wireless communication struggles with scalability due to number. A novel hybrid protocol is presented, where only a fraction of the modules connect to wireless and act as hubs which propagate messages through the local system. This method reduces both energy consumption and global network traffic while maintaining functionality and adding redundancy in communication. Through careful selection of hubs, it is shown that the operational time of a modular robot can be extended by 20%.",

    "abstract": "With the growing demand for soft robots capable of various degrees of locomotion based on reversibly actuating liquid crystalline networks (LCNs), the fabrication of complex 3D architectures from 2D LCN films via shape reconfiguration and/or assembly techniques are studied recently. However, once a system is formed and fixed into a specific 3D structure, only certain movements can be implemented using the fixed structure, and disassembly into the original 2D films is challenging. Therefore, studies to overcome this irreversible fabrication process become increasingly important. Herein, an effective and simple preparation of static and dynamic covalent dual‐cross‐linked, photo‐controllable LCN (pc‐LCN) films as building blocks for lego‐like, monolithically assembled 3D soft transformable robots is presented. By tailoring the static and dynamic covalent linkages in the networks, pc‐LCN films can be readily reconfigured and assembled into complex 3D structures under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Such monoliths can also be disassembled into their constituent building block films and reassembled into different architectures under the same UV stimulation. Moreover, by adopting selective visible‐light‐responsive dopant dyes to actuate pc‐LCN building blocks, 3D soft transformable robots with versatile motion capabilities, including rolling, gripping, and cargo transport in multiple directions, are demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Not all wearable fitness devices are suitable for children. Due to the decay of activity recognition accuracy and exercise requirement variety caused by the physical differences between adults and children, devices developed for adults cannot provide appropriate exercise guidance to children. Considering the complexity and time‐consuming nature of developing a new children‐specific model, this article proposes a child adaptation mechanism that can be integrated into current adult wearable devices. Two algorithms using unlabeled children's data for age group recognition and activity recognition inspired by the visual variability in cognitive process and visuo‐tactile coordination phenomenon in cortical plasticity are proposed. During an experiment on 30 adults and children, the age group recognition algorithm achieves 93.33% recognition accuracy, and the activity recognition algorithm achieves 88.57% recognition accuracy. This is an 11.16% improvement compared with the baseline and 2.87–4.1% improvement compared with the state‐of‐the‐art transfer learning or self‐adaptation algorithms. The proposed mechanism ameliorates current wearable devices with minimum cost to make them suitable for children and can serve as an alternative to help children learn healthy exercise habits. It is hoped that the work can draw the attention of academia to vulnerable groups, including children, to build a friendlier artificial intelligence network.",

    "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is routinely used as a metrological tool among diverse scientific and engineering disciplines. A typical AFM, however, is intrinsically limited by low throughput and is inoperable under extreme conditions. Thus, this work attempts to provide an alternative to a conventional optical microscope (OM) by training a deep learning model to predict surface topography from surface OM images. The feasibility of this novel methodology is shown with germanium‐on‐nothing (GON) samples, which are self‐assembled structures that undergo surface and sub‐surface morphological transformations upon high‐temperature annealing. Their transformed surface topographies are predicted based on the OM‐AFM correlation of three different surfaces, bearing an error of about 15% with a 1.72× resolution upscale from OM to AFM. The OM‐based approach brings about significant improvement in topography measurement throughput (equivalent to OM acquisition rate, up to 200 frames per second) and area (≈1 mm 2 ). Furthermore, this method is operable even under extreme environments when an in situ measurement is impossible. Based on such competence, the model's simultaneous application in further specimen analysis, namely surface morphological classification and simulation of dynamic surfaces’ transformation is also demonstrated.",

Ratchet transport garners considerable attention due to its potential for application in smart transport techniques on a micrometer scale. In previous studies, either particle self‐propulsion or time‐varying potential has been introduced to realize unidirectional transport. The ratchet transport through particle interactions during crowding without utilizing these two factors is experimentally demonstrated. Such ratchet transport induced by particle interaction has not previously been experimentally demonstrated, although some theoretical studies have suggested that particle crowding enhances ratchet transport. In addition, a model for such transport in which the potential varies depending on the particle density is constructed, which agrees well with the experimental results. The development of transport techniques on a micrometer scale is accelerated.",

A well‐organized lab is crucial for a wide range of reasons, from keeping costs low, to protecting the health and safety of users. The focus herein is on developing lab‐level systems that create a lean and productive space in the context of academic cleanrooms. The efforts made at implementing the 5S organizational methodology to improve cleanroom functions, including regulatory compliance, organization, and resource stewardship, is described. The quantifiable result is that chemical consumption spending is reduced by 41%, between 2018 and 2019, whereas materials consumption spending is reduced by 52%. Meanwhile, there is a 116% increase in the number of fabricated devices, showing greater output using less resources. This management system also proved itself to be beneficial during emergency situations. The recent COVID‐19 pandemic is one such instance that showcased the ability to systematically ramp‐down operations within 15 min, taking a huge burden away from the research group, and thus allowing to focus on what is most important during this time of crisis: the health and safety of the group and community.",

However, there are some challenges for photoresponsive materials for certain applications: 1) Only a few photoresponsive surfaces are transformed into multiple states after photoreactions to adapt to changing environmental conditions; 2) Photoresponsive materials may not function properly in cold environments, especially for gels. To address these problems, we have recently developed photoresponsive materials based on ruthenium (Ru) complexes. Such Ru complexes showed a photoinduced ligand substitution under visible light irradiation. Reconfigurable surfaces that can adapt to environmental changes and photoresponsive organohydrogels that function effectively at sub‐zero temperatures have been fabricated using photoresponsive Ru complexes. Herein, it is demonstrated that based on photocontrolled Ru–ligand coordination, reconfigurable surfaces can be modified for user‐defined functions via visible light irradiation and that photoresponsive gels can function even at –20 °C. As a perspective, Ru‐containing photoresponsive complexes could open up pathways for a variety of applications.",

The basic element in the brain, a synapse, has the function to process and learn from signals in real time by following Hebb's rule, which is a critical function missing from the transistor, the basic device in computers. In this work, a computing circuit based on synaptic resistors (synstors) with signal processing and Hebbian learning functions is modeled and analyzed. A synstor circuit emulates a neurobiological network to concurrently execute signal processing and learning algorithms in parallel mode, does not need to be preprogrammed, and has the capability to optimize and create new algorithms in complex and erratic environments with speed and energy efficiency significantly superior to those of existing computing circuits. The synstor circuit can potentially circumvent the fundamental limitations of existing computing circuits, leading to a new computing platform with real‐time self‐programming functionality and general intelligence in complex and erratic environments.",

    "abstract": "Physical interactions with the real world have many degrees of freedom, which has led to the development of novel input devices with a multitude of sensors to capture increasingly high‐dimensional data. This high dimensionality makes the design of interactive systems more complex. Herein, the use of autoencoder‐based dimensionality reduction is explored to simplify the design process. For this purpose, a data glove equipped with accelerometers is used to record high‐dimensional hand movement data that are thereafter reduced to 2D embeddings using autoencoders. The exploration and evaluation of the resulting embeddings suggest that autoencoders can be used to create meaningful low‐dimensional representations of complex human movement. The characteristics generality , variability , connectivity , and distinguishability are established and a guideline is provided for assessing low‐dimensional embeddings. Referring to these characteristics, system engineers can evaluate different input modalities and gestures for their specific interaction task. Further, a framework is outlined for designing and evaluating gesture interaction in the low‐dimensional space. By demonstrating the exemplary design of the interaction with a virtual lever, this research gives system engineers a template for interaction design in the low‐dimensional space.",

The proposed scheme is compatible with the European Article Number (EAN)‐13 encoding/decoding system. First, the transformation mechanism among different barcodes is analyzed. Two different transformation strategies, the bar transformation and the background color transformation, are discussed. To demonstrate the possible applications, a temperature‐sensitive barcode tag (TSBT) and pH‐indicative barcode tag (PSBT) are developed by embedding the corresponding thermochromic and pH‐sensitive materials into the traditional EAN‐13 barcodes. Except for the conventional identification function, these tags can be used as environmental sensors to sense temperature and pH values. The maximum recognition rates of the TSBT and PSBT are 100% and 98%, respectively. The technology is universal and versatile because different kinds of sensitive tags can be constructed easily. This sensitive barcode technology can be expected to provide an efficient, accurate, and low‐cost solution to real‐time detection.",

To address these two issues, herein, a visual feedback technique is developed which allows users to recognize machine's vision by positioning a laser spot to the user watched object, according to the location information interpreted from user's eye movement. Through the visual feedback technique, users not only obtain real‐time feedback, but also can fine‐tune the laser spot to the desired location before performing further operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented work can successfully reduce user's fatigue and boost operation accuracy by 25.1% and 27.6%, respectively, therefore, advancing the field of intelligent assistive technologies.",

Following a biomimetic approach, rapid prototyping methods are combined with high‐speed videography and 2D particle tracking. In addition, preliminary work on the functional morphology and hydrodynamic characteristics of the olfactory organ of Sphyrna tudes is utilized to generate a flow channel module suitable for the implementation of diverse state‐of‐the‐art sensor technologies into innovative washing machines. The module's fluid dynamics are essentially determined by its optimized channel geometry and the fluid's inflow velocity. Future investigations will reveal whether a precise change of individual hydrodynamic parameters can solely be achieved by a variation of the inflow velocity and whether specific flow profiles can be established to allow for dynamic online analytics of multiple sensors during washing.",

Taking advantage of this, a shape is systematically reproduced that was formerly identified while screening randomly shaped propellers. Its nonlinear behavior, which is called frequency‐induced reversal of swimming direction (FIRSD), allows a propeller to swim in opposing directions by only changing the applied rotating field's frequency. However, the identically shaped swimmers do not only display the abovementioned swimming property but also exhibit a variety of swimming behaviors that are shown to arise from differences in their magnetic moment orientations. This underlines not only the role of shape in microswimmer behavior but also the importance of determining magnetic properties of future micropropellers that act as intelligent devices, as single‐shape templates with different magnetic moments can be utilized for different operation modes.",

However, the operation speed, power consumption, and error rate of these devices are incompatible with complementary metal−oxide−semiconductor (CMOS) logic, and moreover, cascading of the devices is difficult. Herein, instead, a new voltage‐dominated magnetic logic‐memory device is proposed, with switching time of 300 ps and power consumption of 150 fJ, representing ≈10 times improvement compared with CMOS logic on the same scale. The device has a reliable output ratio of &gt;3000%, a low working magnetic field of &lt;10 mT, and a low error rate of ≈10 −7 . Moreover, complex logic operations, such as XOR gates and a full adder, can be realized using this device via cascading. As a result of these advantages, the magnetic logic‐memory device is well suited for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Remote propulsion of miniature mechanical devices possesses a great challenge to the scientific community. Herein, a lightweight two‐way shape memory polymer (2WSMP)‐based motor is presented, which operates a demo vehicle via a novel infrared‐irradiated 2WSMP actuator. Most of the polymers that possess 2WSMP properties suffer from inadequate mechanical properties and low durability in harsh environments. Herein, the 2WSMP bilayer actuator, based on Kapton and polyPOSS (PP), possesses superior 2WSMP and mechanical properties, high lifting abilities, and durability in harsh environments. Kapton is well known for its outstanding physical properties. PP, a polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)‐based epoxy‐like thermoset, possesses unique properties. Its advanced ability to maintain mechanical properties over a range of temperatures, while presenting a constant coefficient of thermal expansion, is essential for its 2WSMP actuation properties. The effects of the Kapton and PP layers’ thickness on the force and deflection, generated by the 2WSMP actuators during heating, are studied. A theoretical model is used to predict the actuator's deflection, based on the layers’ thickness. These actuators present excellent thermal stability at temperatures as high as 150 °C, while maintaining outstanding motion repeatability and extremely high lifting capacity of up to 6500 times of their own weight.",

Herein, quantum dots‐functionalized encryption (QDE) camera is proposed by integrating the fluorescence emission of quantum dots (QDs) with charge coupled device or complementary metal oxide semiconductor detector arrays during the imaging process. The variation of the photoluminescence emission from QDs controlled by UV365 nm illumination provides a convenient way to scramble the spatial distribution of RGB values in the captured image, which expands the information entropy of the captured image to realize in situ image encryption. The encrypted text images can be decrypted by a convolutional neural network‐based algorithm, resulting in high‐quality decrypted images with peak signal‐to‐noise ratio up to 45 dB. Compared with the previous reported image encryption techniques of chaotic cryptosystem, fluorescent material‐based encryption, and optical encryption, the proposed QDE camera shows advantages of high execution speed and easy miniaturization. It provides a promising in situ image encryption technique to guarantee information security in digitization process.",

    "abstract": "Traditional digital computers have physically separated memory and computing units, where data movements cost extensive time and energy consumption. As Moore's law slows down and memory-intensive tasks get prevalent, such von Neumann computing architecture becomes increasingly capacity- and power-limited. In order to meet the requirement for increased computing capacity and efficiency in the post-Moore era, emerging computing architectures, such as in-memory computing and neuromorphic computing, have been extensively pursued and become important candidates for new-generation brain inspired computers. In consideration of the memory access bottleneck, an important trend of evolution in computing technology is data-centric architecture, such as near-memory computing and in-memory computing, which are particularly promising for memory-intensive workloads, such as neural networks. By incorporating memory die and processing die together using advanced IC package, the data movements between memory and processing units can be significantly reduced and the memory bandwidth bottleneck can be mitigated. Instead, compute periphery can be put inside an embedded memory chip, therefore enhancing energy efficiency. The data movement can be further reduced by performing computing inside memory devices, including conventional storage class memory, SRAM and advanced nonvolatile memories (ReRAM, PCM, MRAM, etc.). Currently, compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures are gaining steam, and there still exist different CIM chip designs depending on the specific requirements on throughput, energy efficiency and compute precision, etc., which are under active developments. In addition to near-memory and in-memory computing, a more radical architecture shift is neuromorphic computing. The idea is supported by several national neuromorphic computing projects worldwide, and a couple of CMOS based neuromorphic chips have been developed.[1] Emerging devices with high integration density and rich dynamics, such as memristors, have also been exploited for the construction of neuromorphic systems. The physical embodiments of memristors correspond to various resistive switching devices based on different mechanisms, which endow the memristors with rich nonlinear dynamics, but theoretically all memristors can be described as a set of differential equations that indicate how the internal state variables determine device characteristics and how external electrical stimulations influence these state variables. The increases in the number of state variables and internal dynamics have dramatically enriched the dynamics and functionality of memristors (Figure 1). Further exploration and engineering of such dynamics are essential for highly efficient information processing applications.[2] The above developing trends in new computing technologies in post Moore era are well covered in this special issue. Emerging memories (memristive devices, spintronics, and electronics based on 2D materials) constitute promising building blocks for realizing artificial synapses and neurons as well as construction of hardware neural networks (2200068). Moreover, intelligent systems interacting with the environment need to process huge amount of data produced from sensors, which suffer from the separation of sensors from the memory and processor. The rise of in-sensor computing, where artificial sensory synapses and neurons are important building blocks, facilitates efficient signal processing at the edge. Although memristors have been widely investigated as artificial synapses, the majority of memristors need a forming process, which brings about extra energy consumption and peripheral circuits. Thus, forming-free memristors are highly desirable. 5 nm thick TiO2 memristors (2200001) and 1.5 nm thick HfO2 memristor array (2200053) are demonstrated separately, exhibiting initially low resistance states and analog switching characteristics. Since tuning resistive switching characteristics is of great importance for neuromorphic applications, Xiao et al. (2100244) investigated the strain effect of HZO-based memristors systematically, which can simulate learning behaviors and the switching mechanism stems from joint participation of ferroelectricity and oxygen vacancy migration. Ferroelectric HZO is also explored for capacitive synaptic array with high linearity (2100258). Array-level simulation shows 20–200× lower energy consumption compared with resistive crossbar array counterparts. For artificial visual applications, an optoelectronic synapse based on three-terminal flexible memory phototransistors is demonstrated (2100257), which exhibits high responsivity, high detectivity and emulates the visual nociceptive behavior. In addition, artificial neurons play an important role in encoding the information, where oscillation neurons are investigated for rate coding. An adaptive neuron is demonstrated with VO2/HfO2 memristor, where the firing threshold and firing rate can be modulated by changing the conductance of the HfO2 layer. This adaptive neuron possesses spatiotemporal encoding capabilities via the correlated neural firing patterns (2100264). An artificial sensory neuron can be constructed by a serial connection of piezoresistive sensor and VO2 volatile memristor. Based on the voltage dividing effect and the intrinsic thermal sensitivity of VO2, multimodal haptic/temperature patterns are detected, encoded, fused and recognized (2200039). In the construction of CIM systems, a synaptic crossbar array can naturally implement vector-matrix multiplication with high efficiency and parallelism, whereas the non-idealities of the array may affect the network performance. The current approaches of tolerating noise effects for both training and inference phases, and solutions from hardware-software co-design, circuit, algorithm and system levels are discussed (2200029). Influence of programming variation on inference accuracy is also investigated with realistic system limitations. Approaches to mitigating such non-idealities via architecture-aware training are evaluated (2100199). An off-chip training method of one selector one resistor (1S1R) crossbar array considering nonlinearity and wire resistance is proposed, which significantly improves the inference accuracy and reduced the running time to 1% of HSPICE-based simulation (2100256). Yang et al. (2200032) proposes a hardware-friendly distributed computing algorithm based on cellular neural network. A distributed design considering the hardware limitations (e.g., overhead and limited bit precision) is also discussed. A mix-precision continual learning model is deployed on a hybrid analogue-digital hardware system with a ReRAM chip (2200026), which circumvents the requirement for high-precision weights during inference. Combined with in-situ fine-tuning method, high classification accuracies are achieved and the energy consumption is reduced by ~200 times. Non-idealities can also be exploited to facilitate computing, where stochasticity in memristor programming is utilized to produce random matrices for random convolutional-pooling. Combined with echo state networks, energy efficient spatiotemporal signal classification is realized (2200027). In particular, hardware neural networks based on synaptic arrays and peripheral circuits from PCB suffer from RC delay and signal loss, thus the tight integration of synaptic array and peripheral circuits on chip is essential. Cai et al. (2200014) designed system-on-chip with integrated ReRAM tiles and a RISC-V processor. The ReRAM tile is designed as an independent IP, flexible for different ReRAM technologies and expandable for larger-scale neural networks. In the work of Shin et al. (2200034), a spiking restricted Boltzmann machine is implemented on an on-chip trainable spiking neural network chip with 6T2R PCM cell, where pattern training, inference, and regeneration are demonstrated. Looking forward, we believe these novel computing concepts and architectures will find more and more applications, as some key materials and device technologies get mature, yet reconfigurability will be an important consideration in future product delivery. The eventual application will also necessitate developments of new design automation tools, compilers, etc. We hope this special issue focusing on “Computing Technology in Post Moore Era” will further promote the discussion in the community and look forward to continued thriving and progresses of this field.

    "abstract": "A prominent problem in computer vision is occlusion, which occurs when an object's key features temporarily disappear behind another crossing body, causing the computer to struggle with image detection. While the human brain is capable of compensating for the invisible parts of the blocked object, computers lack such scene interpretation skills. Cloud computing using convolutional neural networks is typically the method of choice for handling such a scenario. However, for mobile applications where energy consumption and computational costs are critical, cloud computing should be minimized. In this regard, a computer vision sensor capable of efficiently detecting and tracking covered objects without heavy reliance on occlusion‐handling software is proposed. The edge‐computing sensor accomplishes this task by self‐learning the object prior to the moment of occlusion and uses this information to “reconstruct” the blocked invisible features. Furthermore, the sensor is capable of tracking a moving object by predicting the path it will most likely take while traveling out of sight behind an obstructing body. Finally, sensor operation is demonstrated by exposing the device to various simulated occlusion events.

    "abstract": "The cocktail party problem refers to a challenging process when the human sensory system tries to separate a specific voice from a loud mixture of background sound sources. The problem is much more demanding for machines and has become the holy grail in robotic hearing. Despite many advances in noise suppression, the intrinsic information from the contaminated acoustic channel remains difficult to recover. Herein, a simple‐yet‐powerful laser‐assisted audio system termed robot ear accomplished by laser (REAL) is shown to probe the vibrations of sound‐carrying surfaces (mask, throat, and other nearby surfaces) in optical channel, which is intrinsically immune to acoustic background noises. The results demonstrate that REAL can directly obtain the audio‐frequency content from the laser without acoustic channel interference. The signals can be further transcribed into human‐recognizable audios by exploiting the internal time and frequency correlations through memory‐enabled neural networks. The REAL system would enable a new way in human–robot interaction. An interactive preprint version of the article can be found at: https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202200143 .",

    "abstract": "Welcome to the 5th volume of Advanced Intelligent Systems! Our premium journal had a great year in 2022, establishing its place in the community as a platform to publish and read the best research on topics such as robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and neuromorphic engineering. Thanks to our board members, authors, reviewers, and readers, Advanced Intelligent Systems has gained a very good reputation, which is reflected in its bibliometric indicators. The first impact factor of the journal, released in June by Clarivate Analytics, was 7.298, which places AISY among Q1 journals in three JCR categories: Robotics (5/30), Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence (30/145), and Automation & Control (9/65). Highly cited papers have contributed the most to these successful results. The highest-cited articles published in 2019 or 2020 are included in Table 1. However, impact factor won't be the only metric reported by Wiley journals anymore. As an advocate for responsible research assessment, Wiley signed the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) in May 2022 to formally commit to diverse measurement of impact and contribution. We will soon add additional metrics to our journals’ homepages and promotional materials aiming to provide a well-rounded view of the value and impact of any author's contribution to the field. The scope of Advanced Intelligent Systems covers timely topics that are not only of interest to scientists and engineers but are also closely followed by the general public. Since the launch of the journal, several papers published in the journal have been highlighted by social media platforms and news outlets. This trend has continued in 2022 and is reflected in the Altmetric scores of several of our articles (Table 2). Our promotional activities to enhance the visibility of the journal and its papers continued in 2022. Articles published in Advanced Intelligent Systems are regularly picked up by the editors of our partner news platform, Advanced Science News, and highlighted on their website and Twitter account. Additionally, highlights of the journal shared via our own Twitter account have received noticeable attention from the community. The most outstanding papers published in Advanced Intelligent Systems are identified by the journal's editors and collected in the Editors’ Choice virtual issue on Wiley Online Library. Every month, along with the regular issue, a video featuring a selection of the best content is released, providing additional visibility to the articles and their authors (see the full gallery HERE). Advanced Intelligent Systems was active in the community last year as the organizer and sponsor of several events: It sponsored poster prizes at ICECS 2022 conference and at the Soft Aerial Robotics Workshop at IEEE Robosoft 2022. Additionally, the journal organized two online symposiums titled “Wiley Artificial Intelligence & Quantum Technologies Symposium” and “Soft Robotics Across Scales - Fundamentals and Applications” (see the recordings HERE). Several topics that fall within the multi-disciplinary scope of Advanced Intelligent Systems were spotlighted in 2022 through special issues on (Figure 1): 1) “Interactive Intelligent Systems and Haptic Interfaces” guest-edited by Oliver Ozioko (University of Glasgow), Arokia Nathan (University of Cambridge), and Ravinder Dahiya (University of Glasgow), and 2) “Computing Technology in Post Moore Era” guest-edited by Yuchao Yang (Peking University) and Ilia Valov (Research Centre Jülich). Special issues on Soft Robotics Across Scales, Energy Storage and Delivery in Robotics Systems, and Space Robotics will be published this year. Advanced Intelligent Systems has continued to publish interactive content in its Smart Supporting Information or Interactive Preprints collections on the Authorea platform. These projects enable our authors to publish interactive and data-driven figures, executable and responsive codes, and 3D structures alongside their papers. Further, the interactive preprints are online just a couple of days after submission, which brings greater visibility to the papers. The project has received increasing attention in the last couple of years. We are going to streamline the process even further this year, giving our authors the opportunity to submit interactive content in a faster and easier way. To help standardize data reporting, our editorial teams continue to develop submission checklists that become part of our submission process for new Research Articles. Each checklist indicates what we consider the most essential parameters that should be reported in manuscripts for a particular field of research. These checklists not only help authors understand data reporting expectations and guide their manuscript preparation, but also aid reviewers during manuscript evaluation. Ultimately, we might also publish them as part of the online supporting information, such that they can benefit our readers. We are very happy to announce that Advanced Intelligent Systems and some other Advanced journals have started to pilot a “Machine Learning Data Reporting Checklist”. For more information, please refer to the journal's Author Guidelines. We are confident that Advanced Intelligent Systems will continue to maintain its position as a reputed journal in 2023. We wish you all the best for the new year, and we are looking forward to receiving your comments, feedback, and papers!

    "abstract": "Twisted artificial muscles based on natural fibers are of special interest in diverse fields. However, current research is limited either by the material itself, or by the preparation methods requiring complex processing or specialized equipment. In this study, a facile and green method is introduced to prepare hair artificial muscles with extremely large tensile stroke and fast recovery. The maximum tensile stroke for the hair artificial muscles upon water actuation is as large as 10 000% and the large‐stroke muscles can recover fast in ethanol. In addition, these hair artificial muscles maintain their excellent performance after either 100 water–ethanol stimulation cycles or staying in open air for 5 months. Moreover, the hair artificial muscle is able to contract by 59% when lifting 10 times its own weight, pull a wheel model or climb a long distance under water, and work as a smart water‐sensitive switch.

    "abstract": "Advances in Robotics are challenging our definitions of what robots are and our perspective on how we interact with them. The conventional image of a robot as a large structure made of stiff, rigid links, is slowly being replaced by machines that are more lifelike. Now that we know robots are capable of outperforming humans in terms of strength or precision their role in manufacturing has expanded. As researchers in Robotics push the limits of what robots can be made of, at which scales, and what capabilities they offer, other segments of the economy are considering robots as technological solutions. Healthcare, telecommunications, even agriculture or shipping may become the next arenas for widespread deployment of robots. As robots are developed and deployed, based on different technologies and across a wide range of sizes, there is a growing need for a unified framework of discussion. In particular in the rapidly growing fields of soft and small robots, the importance of energy as a performance metric is paramount. How the robot stores energy, or harvests it from the environment sets the baseline for how much valuable work it can perform in the target environment. How the energy is converted from storage to mechanical work used in manipulation and locomotion, at which scales and with what efficiency are the key metrics for matching a robotic technology to a specific application. As robots are miniaturized, the macro scale distinctions between soft and rigid components become blurred, and energy metrics can be used to describe both technology types and allow for direct comparisons. In this new framework, multiple technologies can be discussed and evaluated across different robotic functionalities. For energy storage, the conventional electrical energy storage in a battery or supercapacitor, can be replaced with chemical fuels, storage in mechanical mechanisms, or even direct harvesting from the environment, for example through turboelectric nano generators. For actuators the broad range of technical solutions (e.g. fluidic soft actuators, chemo-mechanical transducers, dielectric elastomer actuators, piezoelectric actuators, etc.) can be compared across standard metrics, including specific energy and energy density, energy conversion efficiency, and bandwidth. Lastly, new components can provide multi functionality, for example actuators that offer opportunities for embedded sensing and unique control strategies. To showcase the recent advances in these rapidly growing fields, we have organized this special section of Advanced Intelligent Systems focusing on “Energy Storage and Delivery in Robotics”. The special section offers both original research work, as well as reviews and perspective articles from different disciplines, including haptics, mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering, as well as materials science. The general themes and contributions are summarized below: At small scales and with powerful fabrication capabilities, new materials can be developed to push robots towards the performance limit of natural systems. Gracias et al. (article number 2000195) demonstrated solvent responsive self-folding of graphene architectures, an example of chemo-mechanical energy transduction. The researchers were able to show complex structures, including helices and pyramids deforming in response to chemical fuels, with no electronic components. In a similar venue, Ng et al. (2100085) built and operated self-sustained robots based on functionally graded elastomeric actuators carrying up to 22× their body weight. Borrowing lessons from biology, the researchers use soft actuators in combination with a more rigid exoskeleton to boost its performance. Aiming to provide a framework for discussions of energy in soft robotics, Stokes et al. (2000264) analyzed energy-based abstraction for soft robotic system development. In a more conventional robotic framework, Jusufi et al. (2000244) demonstrated modeling and control of a soft robotic fish with integrated soft sensing. The work is a valuable foray into understanding of the swimming mechanics of fish, including the role of stiffness control in achieving adaptable but efficient locomotion underwater. From swimming to flying robots, Floreano et al. (2100150) studied passive perching with energy storage for winged aerial robots. Their experimental work focused on a proof-of-concept claw shows 5% of the kinetic energy can be recaptured during perching, a valuable recovery for an energy intensive locomotion mode, such as flying. Fan et al. (2200045) reviewed next-generation energy harvesting and storage technologies for robots across all scales. Their extensive summary broadly covers energy storage, harvesting and conversion mechanisms, highlighting unique opportunities where significant gains can be made to improve robotic performance. Blurring the lines between material and component, Pikul et al. (2000255) showed computer-free autonomous navigation and power generation using electro-chemotaxis. Their combined power approach can benefit millimeter- to centimeter-scale robots deployed in unstructured environments, alternating between onboard power and the ECVS to extract energy from surrounding metal infrastructure and extend their search time and depth. With a haptics focused application in mind, Wu et al. (2100120) showed self-powered and interface-independent tactile sensors based on bilayer single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerators for robotic electronic skin. For an even broader view of the challenge of energy management at the human/machine interface, Dahiya et al. (2100036) reviewed bioinspired distributed energy in robotics and enabling technologies. Their review highlights opportunities where a robotic platform can benefit from increased energy density, lesser design complexities, improved body dynamics, and operational reliability with distributed energy. Lastly, Duduta (2200093) provided a perspective on robots as energy systems: advances in Robotics across scales and technologies. We hope that this special section focusing on “Energy Storage and Delivery in Robotics” will bring knowledge, insight, and inspiration to readers. We look forward to the rapid growth of the massive developmental efforts in this field which will lead us right into the envisioned smart society. Finally, I want to thank all the authors for their valuable contributions, as well as the editorial team of Advanced Intelligent Systems for their support and the opportunity to organize this special section.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive and extreme changes in shape and configuration are the functional and morphological uniqueness of soft robots, but existing design approaches still rely on the predefined coordination of their “muscle” and “nerve” functions to produce such behaviors. Herein, a strategy is introduced for building modular soft machines that can be innervated in ways that conform to their body extension or shape changes, based on modular soft electronics. The development of soft electronic adhesive interlocking (SEAL) technology allows for instant, robust, and repeatable integration of soft electronic modules that can “innervate” and activate modular soft actuators and machines in a reconfigurable manner. Demonstrations of soft robotic tentacles and their grasping capability show that the robot function can be adapted to or reconfigured within the body with a length extended more than 10 times. The modular strategy presented herein can offer a unique promise to build up future robots with dynamic, reconfigurable functions.",

Specifically, the driving trajectory will inevitably have intersections with other vehicles whose driving intentions can't be directly observed. Herein, a two‐stage algorithm framework that is decomposed into the longitudinal and lateral planning processes for online merging planning is proposed. An improved particle filter is used to estimate the driving models of surrounding vehicles for predicting their future driving intentions. Based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), different action spaces are evaluated for longitudinal merging gap selection and lateral interactive merging operation, while heuristic pruning is used to reduce the computation cost. Moreover, the coefficients related to the driving styles are introduced, and their influences on merging performance are analyzed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented in a two‐lane simulation environment. The results show that the proposal has outperformed other baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "Biological movement is a source of inspiration for designing soft robots that use fluidic actuation for adaptive gripping and locomotion. While many biological systems use networks of non‐Newtonian fluid for movement, to date, most soft robots use Newtonian fluids or pneumatics. Herein, yield stress fluids to manufacture and operate soft devices are exploited, particularly to create soft actuators that exhibit shape memory. Our soft robots are fabricated through embedded 3D printing where the suspension media is a yield stress fluid. Moreover, this complex fluid is encapsulated and used as the hydraulic transmission fluid. Diagnostic designs are developed to characterize the force and shape memory of the yield stress fluid, and the findings are used to create a gripper common in modern soft robotic applications. The diagnostic devices have deformable reservoirs that demonstrate force response, flow behavior, and deformation profiles dependent on the yield stress features of the transmission fluid. The actuation using the yield stress fluid from the retained suspension media creates avenues for partial shape retention and unconventional expansion from localized fluid flow. Looking toward the future of soft robotics, these fabrication and operational approaches using yield stress fluids can provide greater tunability for applications requiring nonlinear actuation and shape memory.",

Herein, SLEPA is applied to optimal molecule generation by combining an irreducible Markov chain in the space of fragment multisets and a probabilistic fragment assembler such as MoLeR. The weighted samples from SLEPA are used to identify salient fragments for the highest occupied molecular orbitals‐lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO‐LUMO) gap maximization and minimization, and the relationship between the identified fragments and the electronic structures is elucidated. This approach offers a viable platform to reconcile the incompatible goals of optimization and interpretation during molecular design.",

Herein, these resistive switches base on oxygen vacancy migration and can be toggled between different resistance states. Internal processes lead to a variability over time in these states. To understand this, a dynamical model is developed, which links the internal physical mechanism to the current response. Thereby, the electronic current is calculated by tunneling processes over oxygen vacancies. The model allows to understand the physical transport properties and the current–voltage dependence. Integrating ionic hopping processes clarifies the variability in the electronic conduction. The derived model does not require empirical input parameters and only depends on the properties of the materials. This allows to use literature values and independently compare them to electrical measurements. The model predicts the experiments correctly. Thereupon, the physical properties of the conduction are investigated with respect to the transport over discrete energy levels, which change under the hopping of oxygen vacancies. Afterwards, the current level and variability are simulated for increasing oxygen vacancy concentrations to investigate analog switching, which is required for neuronal network layers. Finally, the variability is tested with multiple interacting cells in a neuronal layer.",

    "abstract": "Spatial manipulation of liquid droplets holds great significance in various areas from laboratory research to everyday life. Unfortunately, current manipulators are limited to lower responsivity and unreliable durability together with swinging‐dependent manner. Herein, an ultrarobust, sensitive, and swinging‐independent droplet‐spatial manipulator is reported, namely, magnetically actuated shape‐morphing microshutters (MASM) enabled by laser printing and soft transfer technique. Leveraging the loading/discharging of a remote magnet, the MASM can be reversibly switched between a bending mode and an erect mode within 1 s, thereby modulating the three‐phase contact line (TCL). The underlying hydrodynamics is that B‐mode MASM renders a longer TCL and an exaggerated adhesion force ( F a ), thereby pinning the surface droplets under the assistance of a magnetic field. Once the magnetic trigger is removed, the bent shutters reverse back to the E‐mode so as to grant a shorter TCL and smaller F a . Based on this phenomenon, the droplet's capture/release can be readily realized in response to magnetic stimuli. Last but not least, by taking advantage of an optimized MASM, pattern‐free configuration and droplets on‐demand marriage and targeted chemical reaction together with programmable circuit remedy are deployed. This work provides impetus for researchers in constructing intelligent droplet manipulation systems for multidisciplinary areas.",

To overcome the challenge, a genome descriptor, Genic SNPs Composition Tool (GSCtool) is developed, which counts the number of SNPs in each gene of the genome so the dimension of the feature vectors equals the number of annotated genes in a species. Compared to using the genotype matrix, using GSCtool significantly decreases the model training time and has a higher accuracy of phenotype prediction. GSCtool also achieves good performance in variety identification, which is useful in crop variety protection. In general, GSCtool will help facilitate the application and study of genomic ML.

However, traditional molecular detection and identification methods like chromatography often involve expensive and bulky equipment and are required to be operated by trained professionals, which severely hinders the further development of small molecule‐based applications. Herein, a novel molecular detection platform is introduced by imaging a spatial gradient metasurface consisting of millions of different unique atoms and following with deep learning modeling to classify and quantify small molecules from mixed solutions accurately. The metasurface has a circular gradient geometry, which changes its transmittance intensity pattern based on the surrounding molecules under narrow‐band illumination. A convolutional neural network trained on the monochromatic images of the metasurface is employed. The results demonstrate a recognition rate of 96.88% for classification and a mean absolute error of 16.23% for quantification. This novel platform enables label‐free, sensitive, and rapid molecular classification and quantification, which opens a new avenue for small molecule classification and quantification and enables possibilities for real‐time, on‐site, and label‐free applications, including environmental monitoring, drug screening, and early diagnosis.",

This allows the detection of clinically relevant cardiovascular events using P, Q, R, S, and T signature peaks in ECG. These requirements limit the scope of ECG use, especially in proactive monitoring, cardiac event prevention, and wireless wearable devices. Herein, a skin‐mountable 3‐lead wireless sensor patch based on the Einthoven triangle is experimentally demonstrated. It allows us to gather vital cardiac information in place of a conventional 12‐lead ECG system. The patch uses the industry's lowest‐power Bluetooth low‐energy system on chip which requires 50 Hz sampling frequency to detect all critical events. A firmware for the chip is developed to transmit data wirelessly at extremely low power (−19 dB), resulting in uninterrupted operation for ≈4 days using a simple CR1632 battery. An Android app records and plots ECG data on a smartphone for real‐time visual monitoring and transmits the data to the cloud‐connected interface for remote monitoring. The demonstration with low‐power operation and integration to the cloud‐connected interface is a significant step for nonassisted home‐based caring to enable preventive health management without being widely constrained by battery and tethered operation.",

Current predictive models are limited in terms of resolution and accuracy, prompting the construction of a high‐resolution prediction network (HRPN) that estimates the microdistribution of quantum dots, factoring in tumor vascular and nuclear features. The HRPN algorithm is trained using 27 780 patches and validated on 4920 patches derived from 4T1 breast cancer whole‐slide images, demonstrating its reliability. The HRPN model exhibits minimal error (mean square error = 1.434, root mean square error = 1.198), satisfactory goodness of fit (R 2 = 0.891), and superior image quality (peak signal‐to‐noise ratio = 44.548) when compared to a generative‐adversarial‐network‐structured model. Furthermore, the HRPN model offers improved prediction accuracy, broader prediction intervals, and reduced computational resource requirements. Consequently, the proposed model yields high‐resolution predictions that more closely resemble actual tumor microdistributions, potentially serving as a powerful analytical tool for investigating the spatial relationship between the tumor microenvironment and nanoprobes.",

The MEMS sensor comprises a polyvinylidene fluoride flexible (PVDF) piezoelectric flag and a bluff body, with vortex generation influenced not only by the bluff body's geometry but also by the input fluid speed. As a result, mechanical vibrations are induced in the piezoelectric flag, leading to charge displacement and the generation of electrical voltage signals. Through the developed deep learning method, accurate extraction of wind speed and successful classification of turbulence are achieved. Experimental tests in a wind tunnel, involving various wind speeds and bluff body geometries, demonstrate the robust correlation between the extracted continuous manifold in Fourier spectra and wind speed. By incorporating a feed‐forward network alongside the autoencoder, wind speed information even under strong turbulence is extracted. Moreover, the deep learning method's ability to classify different bluff bodies, independent of wind speed, is investigated. The findings reveal a unique capability to fingerprint turbulence and distinguish them for various applications.

    "abstract": "As the name suggests, soft robots are recognized by their active \"deformability\" and passive \"compliance\". In comparison with their rigid-bodied counterparts, soft robots exhibit a library of unique and attractive characteristics, such as the compliant interaction with the environment, the resistance to damages and wear, the shape-morphing capability, the abundant degrees of freedom (DOFs), the ability to be controlled by non-electric signals, and the suitability for batch fabrication and minimization. Research efforts have been devoted to this field and a large variety of intriguing soft robots have been proposed. Some examples are octopus-inspired soft arms, hand-like soft grippers, skin-mimicking soft electronics, and shape-morphing miniature robots. The recent emergence of novel soft materials and advanced fabrication techniques have spurred a new wave of rapid development of soft robots. In addition, the growing interest in miniaturized robots for healthcare, exploratory, and rescue applications has provided new opportunities to take good advantages of the traits of soft robots. Soft robots have become one of the most promising candidates to undertake the tasks at small size scales, where conventional mechanical components can no longer be utilized due to the difficulties in downscaling. In view of the entrancing potential of soft robots in addressing real-world challenges, we have organized this special issue to include high-quality research, review, and perspective articles that study soft robots with a characteristic length ranging from meter to centimeter, then further down to millimeter and micrometer. Most conventional rigid-bodied robots are at the meter size scale. In comparison, soft robots at this size scale excel as agile manipulators that could handle delicate and brittle objects, and also as an advantageous option to build safe interactions with humans. Hao et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300079) reported a tensegrity joint for low-inertia, compact, and compliant soft manipulators, aiming to reinforce the joint motion stability and enable self-contained sensing feedback. The proposed design avoids the requirement of complex kinematics modeling and sophisticated control model with sensing feedback. And the controller was trained with the proper joint configurations selected by a two-step sampling method. Soft robots at the centimeter size scale have a perfect size to go inside human body via natural orifices and ducts. They are small enough to access inner cavities in a minimally invasive manner, while at the same time they are also big enough to conduct meaningful interventional operations such as biopsy and drug delivery. Koszowska et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300062) reported a pair of independently actuated soft magnetic continuum manipulators for bimanual operations in the same confined anatomical cavities. The developed bimanual system was deployed in the confined anatomy of a skull-base phantom to simulate minimally invasive ablation of a pituitary adenoma. Zhang et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300325) reported a flexible biopsy robot with force sensing for deep lung examination. By cooperating with commercial bronchoscope, the proposed robot can reach narrow areas of the lung to perform biopsy operations. Soft robots at this size scale could also interact with organs or parts of human bodies. Lourdes et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202200465) reported a magnetically actuated variable stiffness manipulator based on deployable shape memory polymer springs. Wang et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300127) reported a wearable glove with electrothermal-controlled lonogels for adhesive gripping. Centimeter size scale also corresponds to many fishes and insects we see in our daily lives. These animals demonstrate excellent capabilities in navigating in cluttered spaces and performing challenging functions. Intrigued researchers aim to mimic these capabilities using similar sized soft robots and harness them for transformative applications. Tan et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300083) reported liquid superspreading on surface with microhexagonal structure inspired by rock-climbing fish. Qu et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300299) reviewed recent advances on underwater soft robots. Hsiao et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300059) reported modular and scalable fabrication of insect-scale aerial robots toward demonstrating swarm flights. This study substantially improves the fabrication scalability of subgram micro-aerial-vehicles (MAVs). At this size scale, soft robots can also be made into robotic parts such as actuators, sensors, and color-shifting glasses. Tang et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300047) presented a review on high-frequency dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs). Mak et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300082) reported intelligent shape decoding of a soft optical waveguide sensor. Li et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202200415) reported switchable and tunable chemical/structure color in a flexible hierarchical surface. Soft robots at millimeter scale have been widely acknowledged as promising devices to undertake minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic tasks. Because of their minute body size, these robots often do not carry onboard power sources, but instead they rely on active matters that respond to external stimuli, such as magnetic field, for wireless actuation and control. These magnetic soft robots have been found useful in some healthcare applications. Sun et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300092) designed magnetic hydrogel micromachines (MHMs) with active release of antibacterial agent for biofilm eradication. Wang et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300108) reviewed recent research results in magnetic control methods and diverse microrobotic applications of reconfigurable liquid-bodied miniature machines. The fabrication of these magnetic robots remains as a challenge, especially when complex designs are desired. Li et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300052) reported a 3D printing platform to fabricate multilayer magnetic miniature soft robots with programmable magnetization. This study relaxes the constraint on the design space and enables the realization of complex robot designs. Beside fabrication, control of these untethered devices is also a challenge. Liu et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300325) reported a computer-aided teleoperation system for a stomach capsule robot. The developed teleoperation platform offers an intuitive virtual linkage between the user's inputs and the robot's actions, lowering the barrier for users to employ such novel robotic systems. In addition to magnetically responsive materials, other stimuli-responsive materials could also be utilized to make soft robots at this size scale. A particularly interesting one is liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) that combines the anisotropy of liquid crystals with the elasticity of loosely cross-linked polymers. Nemati et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300054) reported a scalable, incoherent-light-powered, omnidirectional self-oscillator made of LCEs. And Li et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202200402) proposed a novel operation mode of LCE actuators based on the wrinkling behavior of an LCE-elastomer bilayer architecture. Liquid-metal-based conductive ink were embedded inside the LCE as soft Joule heating element to enable electrical control. To contextualize these robots, Li et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300070) reviewed recent advances in 2D and 3D electrically driven soft actuators across dimensional scales. Finally, to identify some common challenges found in various kinds of millimeter-scale soft robots employing different working principles, Chi et al. (article number 10.1002/aisy.202300063) presented a perspective on miniature soft robotics in terms of the actuation, fabrication, control, and application, and Yong et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300061) presented a perspective on bioinspired synergy strategies empower small-scale robots with higher performance. Robots at micrometer size scale can interact with individual cells and organisms. A large number of soft robots at this size scale can be categorized as bio-microrobots, meaning that either they are biologically inspired to imitate biological systems, or they are bio-hybrid ones that combine motile micro-organisms or cells with functional components. Wang et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300093) reviewed the design principles, energy sources, and biomedical applications of existing soft bio-microrobots. Although significant process has been made in soft robotics, there remains several grant challenges to be overcome in future. One is the lack of coordination between the development of new materials, fabrication methods, and control strategies. Many studies only focus on one aspect and lack considerations of the others, causing the developed soft robots unable to function as standalone systems. To bolster the convergence and co-development of these aspects, Berrueta et al. (doi: 10.1002/aisy.202300111) put forward a perspective on materializing autonomy in soft robots across scales. This perspective emphasized that researchers should use tasks alone to impose material and information constraints on soft robot design and proposed a conceptual framework for a task-first design paradigm that sidesteps limitations imposed by control strategies. We hope that this special issue could bring knowledge, insight, and inspiration to readers of different background who share our interest in soft robotics. With a concerted effort made by researchers from copious fields and communities, we envision the growth of soft robotics will continue into the next decade at a breakneck pace, with many disruptive application-oriented, standalone soft robotic systems to be conceived and deployed for real-world tasks.

New approaches for spinning or these materials are needed. Despite recent advances in enhancing fiber tensile properties, achieving significant improvement in tensile properties remains a tedious and challenging task, suffering from little to no controlled extrusion process and difficult optimization in high‐dimensional parameter spaces. Herein, a novel robotic biomimetic pulling method that can rapidly enhance fiber tensile properties surpassing current methods in both speed and resulting fiber properties is shown. Using a controlled fiber‐pulling device with in situ tensile measurements and adaptive optimization based on Bayesian Optimization, fiber strength exceeding 300% of the traditional full factorial design method within just a few experimental iterations is reached. The rapid experimental method presents a potential avenue for enhancing the performance of artificial fibers across diverse industries and applications.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and predicting the motion behavior of fibrous matters is critical for studying the structure, performance, function, and assembly behavior of fibrous matters. However, due to the limitation of characterization technology on a space−time scale, the existing technologies cannot provide real‐time in situ tracking of entire dynamic processes of fibrous matters. To address this shortcoming, an artificial intelligence‐based codebase, named the artificial intelligence‐based fiber motion tracking (AI‐FMT), is proposed for analyzing, studying, and predicting motion behaviors of fibrous matters. The proposed AI‐FMT can automatically extract morphology information of fibrous matters from a large number of pictures or video streams, which serve as an input for machine learning to predict the motion pattern of fibrous matters. Using a finite‐element concept in understanding the point−coordinate relationship, the AI‐FMT greatly simplifies the architecture of the neural network during motion prediction. For the case of 928 trainable parameters, an average accuracy of 97.8% is achieved in predicting variations in morphological parameters, such as mean square radius of gyration, end‐to‐end distance, and curvature in the movement process of animal hair. The presented results can help to understand the structure, assembly, performance, and function of fibrous matters.",

The width of the microrail can determine the dynamic assembly of nanowires in parallel to or in perpendicular to the direction of the microrail, which is validated by numerical simulations. In addition, trapping and transportation of nanowires on microrails are also achieved by adjusting the microfluidic direction from the microrail.

The approach involves an ML‐driven pipeline that extracts statistical and morphological features from an MS target region and feeds these features into ML algorithms to generate and assess predictive models. The findings demonstrate ML prediction models exhibit superior performance when trained on extracted features versus raw spectra intensity data and that random forest models exhibit robust classification performance in both internal and external validation datasets.

Leveraging a single fluidic pressure input, the soft gripper can grasp slippery and delicate objects while passively providing information on this physical interaction. Guided by analytical, numerical, and experimental tools, the novel grasping principle of this mechanics-based soft gripper is explored. First, the buckling behavior of a free hemisphere is characterized as a function of its geometric parameters. Inspired by the free hemisphere's two-lobe mode shape ideal for grasping purposes, it is demonstrated that the gripper can perform dexterous manipulation and gentle gripping of fragile objects in confined spaces and underwater environments. Last, the soft gripper's embedded capability of detecting contact, grasping, and release conditions during the interaction with an unknown object is proved. This simple buckling-based soft gripper opens new avenues for the design of adaptive gripper morphologies with tactile sensing capabilities for applications ranging from medical and agricultural robotics to space and underwater exploration.",

    "abstract": "Modular robots have unique advantages in handling faults and improving their robustness due to their self‐reconfiguration capacity and homogeneous interchangeability. When locked joint failure occurs in modular robots, the distribution of the failed modules will affect the manipulation capacity of the robot. In this article, a novel self‐reconfiguration method that utilizes only the remaining resources available to mitigate the damage caused by module joint failures is proposed. The key node configuration is searched by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and then the collision‐free reconfiguration path is planned by the rapidly exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm. The proposed method not only handles single‐module lockup failure but can also be expanded to multi‐module lockup failures, fully improving the fault tolerance of the modular robot. The method is deployed on the hardware, and the feasibility of the algorithm is verified by self‐reconfiguration experiments containing faulty modules.",

In pursuit of seamless cooperation with the user's hand, human finger proportions are replicated. Finite element analysis of all five fingers indicates that the thumb‐mimicking configuration offers the largest workspace and bending angle. The FBSF, featuring a polycarbonate paired crossed flexural hinge structure and high impact polystyrene links, closely mirrors the human thumb. Weighing 59 g (main body) and 170 g (control box), the FBSF enables user‐driven control and decoupled actuation based on user intent, utilizing the electromyographic signal of the extensor carpi ulnaris via isometric contractions. An experimental protocol, including task blocks (releasing, clenching), confirms the FBSF's responsiveness to user intentions. When utilizing FBSF, it has been verified using a motion capture camera system that it is possible to extend the existing hand workspace by approximately 29.72%. Performance tests demonstrate the FBSF's capability to grasp various objects and assist in tasks, with a maximum load‐bearing capacity of 2.6 kg experimentally verified. This study demonstrates the potential of the developed FBSF to augment hand functionality in diverse applications.",

The adversarial attack technology makes both these models face severe challenges. Prior research is focused solely on attacking single object detection models, without considering the impact of the preprocessing models (multifocus image fusion) on adversarial perturbations within the object detection system. Multifocus image fusion models work in conjunction with the object detection models to enhance the quality of the images and improve the capability of object detection system. Herein, the problem of attacking object detection system that utilizes multifocus image fusion as its preprocessing models is addressed. To retain the attack capabilities of adversarial samples against as many perturbations as possible, new attack method called adaptive retention attack (ARA) is proposed. Additionally, adversarial perturbations concentration mechanism and image selection mechanism, which, respectively, enhance the transferability and attack capability of ARA‐generated adversarial samples. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of the ARA. The results confirm that the ARA method can successfully bypass multifocus image fusion models to attack the object detection model.",

To address this issue, a deep learning‐based algorithm is developed for suppressing the image noise, grounded in self‐supervised learning principles. In contrast to traditional image denoising methods, this approach successfully enhances the visibility of fine details while significantly reducing the noise in the X‐ray images. Through this advancement, the potential of the approach for improving the accuracy and interpretability of the TXM‐XANES data is demonstrated, thereby enabling more precise detection of nanoscale phenomena such as inhomogeneous cation redox and metal segregation in battery cathode materials.

To date, RC has evolved into several innovative variants. The next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) variant, founded on nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) distinguishes itself due to its fewer hyperparameters and independence from physical random connection matrices, while yielding comparable results. However, NGRC networks struggle with massive Kronecker product calculations and matrix‐vector multiplications within the read out layer, leading to substantial efficiency challenges for traditional von Neumann architectures. In this work, a hybrid digital‐analog hardware system tailored for NGRC is developed. The digital part is a Kronecker product calculation unit with data filtering, which realizes transformation of nonlinear vector of the input linear vector. For matrix‐vector multiplication, a computing‐in‐memory architecture based on resistive random access memory array offers an energy‐efficient hardware solution, which markedly reduces data transfer and greatly improve computational parallelism and energy efficiency. The predictive capabilities of this hybrid NGRC system are validated through the Lorenz63 model, achieving a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.00098 and an energy efficiency of 19.42TOPS W −1 .",

However, the supervised contrastive learning model trained on the natural language inference (NLI) dataset is insufficient to elucidate the semantics of sentences since it is prone to make a prediction based on heuristics. Herein, by using the ParsEVAL and the word overlap metric, it is shown that sentence pairs in the NLI dataset have strong syntactic similarity and propose a framework to compensate for this problem in two aspects. 1) Apply simple syntactic transformations to the hypothesis and 2) expand the objective to SupCon Loss to leverage variants of sentences. The method is evaluated on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks and transfer tasks. The proposed methods improve the performance of the BERT‐based baseline in STS Benchmark and SICK Relatedness by 1.48% and 2.2%. Furthermore, the model achieves 82.65% on the HANS benchmark dataset, to the best of our knowledge, which is a state‐of‐the‐art performance demonstrating that our approach is effective in grasping semantics without heuristics in the NLI dataset at supervised contrastive learning.

In the game, the target aims to bait and escape from the evader, and the pursuer aims to capture the evader. Due to imperfect observations, the TP coalition has uncertain information of the evader's state, while the evader is assumed to have perfect observation. The game model is constructed by formulating the optimization problems for each player in a receding horizon fashion. Then, to counter the evader effectively, the TP coalition constructs a virtual evader using the belief information from a Kalman filter. And a chance constraint optimization problem is constructed to predict the virtual evader's trajectory under uncertainties. The TP coalition can capture the actual evader by generating a robust counter‐strategy against the virtual evader with a chance constraint feasible set. Next, to compute the Nash equilibrium of the TP coalition's subjective game, an iterative algorithm is designed that combines the iterative best response and the distributed alternating direction method of multiplier algorithms. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is validated through simulations and experiments.",

Remarkably, even insects with limited neural systems adeptly respond to looming stimuli while in motion at high speeds. Existing insect‐inspired looming detection models typically rely on either motion‐pathway or feature‐pathway signals, yet both are susceptible to dynamic visual scene interference. Coordinating interneuron signals from both pathways can enhance the looming detection performance under dynamic conditions. An artificial neural network is employed to construct a combined‐pathway model based on Drosophila anatomy. The model outperforms state‐of‐the‐art bio‐inspired looming‐detection models in tasks involving dynamic backgrounds, simulated by animated 2D‐moving natural scenes or recorded in reality when an unmanned aerial vehicle performs obstacle collision avoidance tasks. Notably, by combining neural anatomy architecture and appropriate multiobjective tasks, the model exhibits convergent neural dynamics with biological counterparts post‐training, offering network explanations and mechanistic insights. Specifically, a multiplicative interneuron operation enhances looming signal patterns and reduces background interferences, generalizing to more complex scenarios, such as AirSim 3D environments and real‐world situations.

Unlike clinicians who rank embryos from the same IVF cycle cohort based on the embryos visual quality and determine how many embryos to transfer based on clinical factors, machine learning solutions usually combine these steps by optimizing for implantation prediction and using the same model for ranking the embryos within a cohort. Herein, it is established that this strategy can lead to suboptimal selection of embryos. It is revealed that despite enhancing implantation prediction, inclusion of clinical properties hampers ranking. Moreover, it is found that ambiguous labels of failed implantations, due to either low‐quality embryos or poor clinical factors, confound both the optimal ranking and even implantation prediction. To overcome these limitations, conceptual and practical steps are proposed to enhance machine learning‐driven IVF solutions. These consist of separating the optimizing of implantation from ranking by focusing on visual properties for ranking and reducing label ambiguity.",

Applying this amalgamated predictive schema to 8Cr4Mo4V steel, a groundbreaking departure from conventional paradigms that exclusively depend on thermodynamic calculation‐based diffusion models is effectuated.

    "abstract": "Soft tactile sensors outputting fluidic signals have many potential applications in soft microfluidic devices and soft robots. However, existing systems have been limited to a single or a few sensors in parallel, so they are not comparable to the state‐of‐the‐art electrical resistive and capacitive touchpads, which can detect rich tactile information, including touch location, pressure, area, and even multiple touches simultaneously. This work reports a soft micropneumatic touchpad. The touchpad consists of 32 pneumatic channels inside soft elastomer, with 16 channels aligned row‐wise and 16 column‐wise. The flow resistance of each channel is measured using a pressure divider. When the pad is touched, the cross‐sectional area of the channels close to the contact location deforms, which changes the flow resistance of those channels. With 32 sensing channels, the location, depth, area of the contact, and even two simultaneous touches can be detected. Letters hand‐written on the touchpad can be reconstructed from the measured data. With the assumption of sparsity, a tactile pressure map, with a value at each 16 × 16 grid point, can also be reconstructed. This work opens a path to replace electronic tactile sensors in soft devices with all‐fluidic alternatives.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of information systems in all areas of society demands more powerful, efficient, and low‐energy consumption computing systems. Neuromorphic engineering has emerged as a solution that attempts to mimic the brain to incorporate its capabilities to solve complex problems in a computationally and energy‐efficient way in real time. Within neuromorphic computing, building systems to efficiently store the information is still a challenge. Among all the brain regions, the hippocampus stands out as a short‐term memory capable of learning and recalling large amounts of information quickly and efficiently. Herein, a spike‐based bio‐inspired hippocampus sequential memory model is proposed that makes use of the benefits of analog computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs): noise robustness, improved real‐time operation, and energy efficiency. This model is applied to robotic navigation to learn and recall trajectories that lead to a goal position within a known grid environment. The model is implemented on the special‐purpose SNNs mixed‐signal DYNAP‐SE hardware platform. Through extensive experimentation together with an extensive analysis of the model's behavior in the presence of external noise sources, its correct functioning is demonstrated, proving the robustness and consistency of the proposed neuromorphic sequential memory system.",

In human–robot interaction (HRI), robots have to communicate using human skills so that they can seem natural and assist effectively. Most research uses predefined gestures to equip robots with social abilities. However, researchers scarcely consider generating bioinspired involuntary behavior to improve a robot's expressiveness and communication. Human studies revealed that involuntary behavior affects how others perceive communicative intentions. Therefore, mimicking human involuntary behavior may positively affect HRI. This article extends our previous work on equipping robots with involuntary behavior with a user study that evaluates the use of bioinspiration for complementing gestures. A preliminary test is conducted with 15 participants to determine if they can perceive the intensities of the involuntary processes heart rate, pupil size, blink rate, breathing rate, and motor activity. 63 new participants interacted with a robot with bioinspired behaviors or a robot only showing predefined gestures to evaluate the robots’ warmth, competence, and discomfort. The results show that the preliminary test participants differentiated the intensities of the involuntary processes. Participants in the second study find the robot with bioinspired behaviors significantly warmer and more competent than the robot with predefined gestures, with no discomfort difference.",

    "abstract": "Flexible tactile sensors have the ability to provide unparalleled levels of tactile sensation, including information regarding roughness, contact force, and contact location. However, it remains a challenge to achieve precise contact location sensing that is decoupled from sensor strain and touching forces. This paper proposes a novel data‐driven approach for force contact location sensing (FCLS) with the influence of sensor strain and forces based on scatter signals (SS) of the ultrasonic waveguide. First, the envelope of the force contact scatter signal (FCSS) is extracted via the Hilbert transform, which retrieves the global features of SS. The time‐frequency spectrogram is obtained via continuous wavelet transform, which extracts the local features of SS. Second, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to extract these features separately and concentrate them together. Third, based on the outputs of the CNN, a multilayer perception regression model is applied to acquire the force contact location. The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed FCLS method has a mean absolute error of 0.627 mm and a mean relative error of 3.19%. This research provides a foundation for further multimodal sensing using ultrasonic waveguides and its application in robotic sensing.",

Their functionalities span from cell sorting to microscale fiber assembly through periodic acoustic pressure fields. Conventional methods usually require parallel acoustic emitters and reflective surfaces, producing constrained standing wave patterns. In this paper, an effective approach for creating versatile acoustic standing wave fields using an acoustic metasurface deflector and retroreflector is introduced. The deflector manipulates the direction of incoming acoustic waves coupled with the retroreflector to reflect these waves back to the source. The proposed design allows the creation of standing waves that are not constrained by the relative angles of the two surfaces involved and allows for customizable wave patterns beyond the standard limits with enhanced adaptability. The system's effectiveness is evaluated through computational simulations using finite element analysis and experimental validation based on a 3D‐printed prototype. Results suggest that versatile standing waves between arbitrarily oriented surfaces can be produced through the careful design of the metasurface deflector and retroreflector. This approach can improve the performance of standing wave applications in particle manipulation, thus broadening the range of practical implementations for ultrasound and acoustofluidic technologies.",

Current methods address the problem primarily from a 2D perspective, which limits the efficient utilization of 3D information. Herein, a novel approach, called pose orientation‐aware network (POANet), which leverages normal maps for orientation information embedding, providing abundant and robust head pose information, is introduced. POANet incorporates the axial signal perception module and the rotation matrix perception module, these lightweight modules make the approach achieve state‐of‐the‐art (SOTA) performance with few computational costs. This method can directly analyze various topological 3D data without extensive preprocessing. For depth images, POANet outperforms existing methods on the Biwi Kinect head pose dataset, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) by ≈30% compared to the SOTA methods. POANet is the first method to perform rigid head registration in a landmark‐free manner. It also incorporates few‐shot learning capabilities and achieves an MAE of about on the Headspace dataset. These features make POANet a superior alternative to traditional generalized Procrustes analysis for mesh data processing, offering enhanced convenience for human phenotype studies.",

    "abstract": "The lack of a sufficient and efficient way to simultaneously perceive general underwater mechanical stimuli, physical contact, and fluidic flow has been a bottleneck for many aquatic applications. To address this challenge, dynamics‐oriented underwater mechanoreceptor interface (DOUMI), a bioinspired mechanoreception system that realizes simultaneous contact and flow perception using a single receptor, is introduced. This receptor, response‐elevated‐and‐expanded hair‐like tactile mechanoreceptor (REEM), is inspired by the mechanoreceptive mechanism of aquatic arthropods. REEM combines structural features from different mechanoreceptive sensilla, enabling it to capture a wide range of stimulus dynamics. Under different stimuli, REEM encodes stimuli dynamics as its oscillations with distinct spectral attributes. Those oscillations are efficiently transferred through mechanical processes and imaging, enabling vision‐based extraction and further analysis. Therefore, by evaluating the oscillation dynamics with tailored wavelet‐based indices, DOUMI can distinguish between contact‐ and flow‐induced oscillations at each receptor unit with 90.5% accuracy. Furthermore, DOUMI provides comprehensive 2D mechanoreception with a scalable array of REEMs, delivering capabilities like stimuli spatiotemporal visualization, flow trend detection, and scenario classification with an accuracy of 99.5%. With its robustness and operational efficiency in underwater environments, DOUMI can be easily adapted to existing applications using common materials and hardware, establishing a new, streamlined paradigm for underwater general mechanoreception.",

Although adhesion‐based wall‐climbing robots demonstrate stable climbing on smooth surfaces in outer space, there is scarce research on their stable adhesion on rough surfaces within a microgravity environment. A novel adhesive material is developed inspired by the adhesion mechanism and locomotion of the Gekko gecko. This material exhibits exceptional adhesion across various materials and surface roughness. A variable‐stiffness gecko‐inspired paw is engineered, generating substantial adhesion forces while minimizing detachment forces. Impressively, this paw generates up to 180 N of adhesion force on smooth surfaces and achieves detachment without external forces. By integrating such variable‐stiffness paws with a wall‐climbing robot, a gecko‐inspired robot effectively operating in a microgravity environment is created. The robotic satellite surface climbing experiments and robotic satellite capture experiments are conducted using a simulated microgravity environment and a satellite model. The results unequivocally demonstrate the gecko‐inspired robot's proficiency in executing various functions, including stable motion and capture on both smooth and rough spacecraft surfaces within a microgravity environment. These experiments underscore the potential of adhesion‐based gecko‐inspired robots for in‐orbit services and spacecraft capture and recovery.",

By integrating a Berkeley short‐channel Insulated‐Gate Field‐Effect Transistor (IGFET) model‐common multigate (BSIM) model with an error‐correction neural network, the proposed approach refines predictions for critical electrical behaviors such as drain current and gate capacitance. Extraction networks dynamically optimize parameter sets for both models, eliminating manual tuning and reducing the need for separate training for each device.

Compared with the BSIM model alone, error reductions of 75, 70, 39, 85, and 81%, respectively, were achieved. This approach showed significant error reductions compared to the BSIM model alone and demonstrated robust performance across devices with variations, proving its effectiveness for large‐scale applications.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic sampling is performed to reduce hardware energy consumption and prevent overfitting by reducing parameters, because not all data are required for learning. In this study, a new approach, pseudo‐synaptic sampling (PS2) method, which approximates the conventional synaptic sampling machine (S2M) method through a hardware‐friendly implementation while demonstrating superior efficiency, is introduced. By sampling in front of neurons rather than at each synapse, the PS2 method improves hardware energy efficiency and ensures scalability. Furthermore, it improves energy and area efficiency by eliminating the additional circuit required by other techniques, such as the random walk (RW) method previously used which requires an additional circuit to frequently charge/discharge the membrane potential. Herein, the average firing rate equation for the S2M method is modified to suit the experimental conditions of this study. Through this numerical simulations, it is confirmed that the activation function of the PS2 method aligns with that of the S2M method and verified that the PS2 method can implement stochasticity for restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) neurons. Experimental validation of the PS2 method, compared to the RW method, for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST) training and inference on field‐programmable‐gate‐array‐implemented spiking RBM chips reveals promising results. In an MNIST 100‐handwritten digit experiment, the PS2 method exhibits on‐chip training accuracy (92%) comparable to that of the RW method (93%). Furthermore, in the energy consumption analysis, it is shown that the PS2 method reduces power consumption by 94.94% compared to the RW method, highlighting its enhanced power efficiency due to a reduced number of circuit elements. In the investigation into the impact of increasing the frequency at which random bits are generated, it is shown that the RW method experiences accuracy degradation even with slight increases, whereas the PS2 method maintains accuracy over significantly longer periods. This enables further power reduction by allowing for a longer period during random bit generation. In this study, a foundation is laid for maximizing the energy efficiency of spiking neural network processors by optimizing internal noise generation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The presence of microplastics in the environment is of significant concern, yet the exact extent of this pollution remains largely unknown. The ocean is of particular interest as the monitoring of microplastics presents a challenge in that in situ fluid stream solutions are not readily available and traditional sampling methods are labor‐intensive and costly. This study introduces an imaging‐based lensless polarization‐sensitive fluid stream analyzer (FSA) for automated, label‐free, and cost‐effective detection and classification of microplastics. The FSA incorporates digital in‐line holography and birefringence computation, enabling quantitative polarization‐sensitive imaging and machine‐learning‐based activities including sample classification. Birefringent textures of synthetic polymers are investigated owing to their optical anisotropy. A microplastic classifier is developed for the FSA and integrated to form an end‐to‐end workflow capable of sampling fluid streams and determining marine and microplastic particle presence. Cultures of two phytoplankton species form a simplified marine environment for FSA evaluation. The device is tested in a two‐class configuration for marine microorganisms and microplastics, as well as a five‐class configuration for marine microorganisms and four individual microplastic types (polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, and polystyrene). The results demonstrate high classification accuracy, supported by experiments in the simulated marine environment that validate the proposed implementation's efficacy.",

Challenges arise due to the simultaneous presence of high‐frequency tactile signals, such as surface textures, and low‐frequency tactile signals, like shape or hardness, when interacting with real objects. This complexity is evident when trying to transmit various signals in existing studies such as single‐actuator, multimodal, and hybrid haptic devices. This article introduces a novel hybrid haptic device that is soft and wearable, integrating pneumatic and electromagnetic actuators to improve the accuracy of tactile signal transmission. The pneumatic actuator handles low‐frequency components, while the electromagnetic actuator is responsible for high‐frequency components, each aligning with their specific mechanical properties. A series of experiments validate the mechanical properties of our proposed device, demonstrating its significant potential in enhancing the accuracy and realism of tactile signal transmission.",

    "abstract": "Accurately identifying user needs in terms of assist timing and magnitude presents challenges for wearable power‐assist limb devices. Traditional approaches to gait perception—such as estimating joint angles and walking conditions—often rely on electronic sensors and neural networks, which can compromise wearability and impose high computational demands. Physical reservoir computing (PRC), which utilizes the inherent nonlinearity of physical systems for data processing, offers a promising alternative. This study proposes a novel self‐estimated physical reservoir computing (SEPRC) model that improves traditional PRC models for gait perception using a wearable pneumatic physical reservoir. A core feature of the new model is the self‐estimation structure, wherein the outputs of the physical reservoir are mutually estimated. Experimental evaluations indicate that the SEPRC model outperforms traditional PRC in clustering time‐series reservoir output sequences with the same dimensionality. This enhanced clustering performance is subsequently leveraged in gait perception by incorporating Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy logic for joint angle estimation and a softmax activation function for walking condition recognition. The newly proposed time‐sequence processing approach facilitates the traditional PRC model to achieve higher accuracy in gait perception and greater robustness against the user's walking pattern variations while preserving PRC's hardware simplicity.",

The soft actuator is realized by rolling a mat of two active layers, interleaved with two electrodes. The active layers are mats of P(VDF‐TrFE‐CTFE)‐based nanofibers, embedded in an elastomeric matrix of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The electrodes are made of a mixture of carbon black and PDMS, bonded to the active layers by electrostatic adhesion force. The effects of the nanofibers in the soft actuators are investigated. Specimens of the soft actuator are realized that differ in the thickness of the nanofibrous mats used for the active layers, that is, 60 and 120 μm. An electromechanical characterization is performed to analyze and measure the axial force and axial displacements of the soft actuators when different electric fields are applied to the specimens in the transversal direction. The experimental results show that the presence of P(VDF‐TrFE‐CTFE)‐based nanofibers enhances the force‐to‐weight ratio of the soft actuators by up to 43.5%, and the energy density by up to 12.9%, compared to a control specimen with the active layer made of PDMS only.",

In this work, we develop a wristband that integrates an array of 10 skin‐conformal strain sensors based on laser‐induced graphene, which is optimized for continuous measurement of skin strain. The device is characterized to identify several hand gestures and tasks while simultaneously using an optical camera‐based hand‐tracking system to estimate the joint locations for ground truth generation. Machine learning models are developed to predict gestures as well as specific hand joint angles with high accuracy of &gt;90% and &gt;95%, respectively. The findings show that the sensors placed closer to actuation‐specific anatomical features contribute more toward the high accuracy. The sensor array is also integrated with a wearable readout system that wirelessly transmits the data in real time in order to control a robotic arm as a proof of concept for human–robot interaction applications. The developed skin‐conformal device is expected to find wide applications in rehabilitation, sports sciences, and human–computer interaction, paving the way for low‐profile prosthetic and orthotic control systems.",

Nevertheless, the automated navigation of multiple optical microrobots in intricate, dynamic environments over extended distances remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce a versatile control strategy aimed at navigating optical microrobotic swarms to distant targets under obstacles of varying sizes, shapes, and velocities. By confining all microrobots within a manipulation domain, we ensure swarm integrity while mitigating the effects of Brownian motion. Obstacle's elliptical approximation is developed to facilitate efficient obstacle avoidance for microrobotic swarms. Additionally, we integrate several supplementary functions to enhance swarm robustness and intelligence, addressing uncertainties such as swarm collapse, particle immobilization, and anomalous laser-obstacle interactions in real microscopic environments. We further demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our proposed strategy by achieving autonomous long-distance navigation to a series of targets. This strategy is compatible with both optical trapping- and nudging-based microrobotic swarms, representing a significant advancement in enabling optical microrobots to undertake complex tasks such as drug delivery and nanosurgery and understanding collective motions.",

The deformation of smart materials directly affects the behavior of the actuator, which needs to be accurately controlled. However, existing control methods for light‐driven LCE actuators often rely on empirical data or simplistic feedback systems, which can be imprecise and susceptible to interference. Developing an accurate and anti‐interference control method for photoresponsive LCE actuators remains a significant challenge. Herein, a computer vision‐assisted light‐driven LCE for accurate control of bending actions of the LCE actuator is proposed. The control system effectively mitigates instability in the bending angle caused by environmental factors such as light, wind, and changes in the surrounding medium. Furthermore, a “lift bridge” for ants moving between two platforms and an oscillator with modulable angular interval and frequency are demonstrated. The proposed system provides a general strategy for accurate and anti‐interference control for photoresponsive LCE actuators, which can be extended to complex actions, multifunctions, and multistimuli actuators, showing wide application potential in soft actuators and soft robots.",

The system is composed of chained reaction modules. Within the individual reaction module, side reactions are suppressed by creating an extremely high concentration bias between the reagents via selective reagent diffusion through the porous channel wall. The reaction sequence is commanded by transporting reagents from one module to the following ones, obtaining quinazolimine derivatives with high yield and purity. The system is low cost, easy to compose, program commanded, and requires minimal human intervention once the reaction modules are assembled and reagents are loaded.",

This study systematically investigates a typical ionic skin in the aspects of variations in capacitance and conductance with respect to stretch ratio. The ionic skin exhibits a sensitive response to the stretch ratio and input frequency. The capacitance can increase by 145% with increasing stretch ratio, whereas the ratio of capacitance variation to stretch ratio can exceed ≈0.25. The capacitance decreases with increasing frequency, whereas conductance increases. Capacitance or conductance with respect to stretch ratio exhibits an inflection point when the input frequency is fixed. Herein, an ionic domain model is proposed in which the ionic domains deform adaptively with global strain and released active ions. A portion of movable ions strengthens dielectric coupling, thereby significantly enhancing capacitance, and some of them act as free ion channels to increase conductance. The dielectric coupling is weakened when the active ions arriving at the electrode are depleted by either a significantly high frequency or large strain. This study will be useful for signal handling in ionic skin with high flux and high sensitivity and may also assist in understanding computing and memory principles of biological bodies.",

The millibots are designed through a rational chemical design for controlling its multi‐functions by external light and magnetic field, which act as fuels. The millibots can be effectively loaded with CO 2 gas and remotely controlled by photothermal energy for the release of CO 2 molecules from the laser‐induced millibots to anesthetize fruit flies as a potential foreign enemy.

    "abstract": "Soft Robotics has emerged as a new and rapidly evolving interdisciplinary research area. This technology can provide a wide range of opportunities to create machines with unprecedented mechanical functionalities, as well as robots that are intrinsically safe to interact with human beings. However, the potential of this technology has not been fully realized as it is still a significant challenge to design, model and control such robots. This special issue, building on a workshop co-organized by the guest editors at the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Montreal, Canada, focuses on recent advancements in soft robotics. The set of accepted papers highlights the opportunities and critical challenges of this field. Successfully realized soft robotics technologies could have a major impact on numerous industries and human activities (1900166, 1900171). Indeed, soft robotics offers the potential to be much more conformable and adaptable through novel sensing (1900080, 1900171, 1900178, 2000002; see Figure 1 A,B) and actuation mechanisms (1900177, 1900163; see Figure 1 C,D). As a result, these robots will be able to demonstrate significantly higher dexterity and manipulation capabilities than their traditional rigid counterparts. For example, grippers/gloves with embedded soft sensors that can empower service robots to manipulate a broad range of objects (1900080; see Figure 1 A) or enable computational proprioception and task identification (2000002; see Figure 1 B). Bio-inspired soft robots can also significantly benefit search and rescue and exploratory operations as they can potentially negotiate across much more complicated terrestrial and aquatic terrains with soft bodies (1900183, 1900154, 1900186; see Figure 1 E,F). Furthermore, soft robotic technologies could be used to create highly functional magnetically controlled devices, which can potentially change minimally-invasive surgeries and targeted drug delivery (1900086; see Figure 1 G). This special issue of Advanced Intelligent Systems is aimed at both roboticists and material scientists. Based on a rigorous peer-review process, we have selected a set of papers that illustrate the inherent interdisciplinary nature of, and the diverse approaches being adopted within current soft robotics research. We hope that the Special Issue will stimulate researchers currently working in soft robotics, and also encourage other researchers to engage this emerging and challenging area.

    "abstract": "In the execution of repetitive tasks, humans can capitalize on experience to improve their motor performance. Prominent examples of this ability can be recognized in our capacity of grasping and manipulating in uncertain conditions. With the aim of providing a mathematical description for such behavior, experiments are considered where participants are required to lift an object with an unexpected mass distribution. By repeating multiple times the same lifting action, participants can learn the correct motor command for task accomplishment. Three models are proposed that combine reactive terms and a learned anticipatory action to explain experimental data. The models feature intratrial and intertrial memory, and the effect of slowly and fast adaptive sensory receptors. The architectures’ effectiveness in explaining experimental data is compared with a general‐purpose state of the art model. The proposed algorithms conspicuously outperform the state of the art in all the considered validation routines. Global and within‐trial human behavior is predicted with 88% of accuracy in nominal conditions. When the object's center of mass is moved, the accuracy is maintained up to 83%. Finally, convergence properties of proposed algorithms are analytically discussed, and their stability and robustness against measurement noise are evaluated in simulation.",

A machine learning (ML) algorithm named time‐series generative adversarial network (TSGAN) is developed to overcome the difficulties, by incorporating a long short‐term memory (LSTM) kernel for recognizing multirange temporal patterns beyond the Markovian approximation and an adversarial training mechanism for efficient optimization. A variety of time series are examined by temperature‐control experiments, and the results demonstrate an exceptional accuracy (&gt;95%, 35% higher than prevalent ML methods) as well as strong transferability and stability of the TSGAN algorithm. The dependence of generation performance on underlying statistical mechanisms associated with different ML algorithms, including the deep neural network (DNN), hidden Markov model (HMM), LSTM, and TSGAN, is elucidated by analyzing the generation quality of characteristic temporal patterns.

Herein, a soft sensor that can detect the presence of blood at the bleeding site during colonoscopies is presented. The sensor consists of optical waveguides that interface with a microfluidic channel. Blood flow causes absorption and scattering of incident light that can be picked up by the optical sensing apparatus via light transmission through the waveguide. The surgeon can be alerted when bleeding occurs through a graphical user interface. The device is compact and measures only 1 mm thick. This allows the sensor to be circumferentially mounted onto a colonoscope at different locations. The sensor is able to record the presence of blood as an optical loss, rapidly detect the presence of blood under 100 ms as it enters the microchannel, and differentiate between gastric fluid and blood through changes in measured optical loss.",

Ideally, artificial intelligent control systems incorporate an incremental learning capability, without having the need to be retrained offline. Moreover, some hardware‐based neural networks (HNNs) rely on complementary software simulators during training. Such approaches decrease their potential to implement real‐time adaption, in a similar manner to their biologic counterparts. Herein, an independent, bioinspired robotic vision system with an incremental learning ability is presented. The system is trained and operated by associating instructions with hieroglyphic symbols and used to maneuver a robotic vehicle. A neural processor, capable of incremental online learning, forms the basis for the decision‐making flow. The entire range of functionality, starting from training, data storage, and up to controlling, is demonstrated herein.",

    "abstract": "“AI &amp; Drug Discovery” mode has significantly promoted drug development and achieved excellent performance, especially with the rapid development of deep learning, making remarkable contributions to protecting human physiological health. However, due to the “black‐box” characteristic of the deep learning model, the decision route and predicted results in different research stages assisted by deep models are usually unexplainable, limiting their application in practice and more in‐depth research of drug discovery. Focusing on the drug molecules, an explainable fragment‐based molecular property attribution technique is proposed for analyzing the influence of particular molecule fragments on properties and the relationship between the molecular properties herein. Quantitative experiments on 42 benchmark property tasks demonstrate that 325 attribution fragments, which account for 90% of the overall attribution results obtained by the proposed method, have positive relevance to the corresponding property tasks. More impressively, most of the attribution results randomly selected are consistent with the existing mechanism explanations. The discovery mentioned above provides a reference standard for assisting researchers in developing more specific and practical drug molecule studies, such as synthesizing molecule with the targeted property using a fragment obtained from the attribution method.

Miniaturized and wireless implants with real‐time data transfer capability can alleviate the surgical complexities of cardiac pressure monitoring. Despite recent developments of mm‐size implants with complex circuitries and self‐powering units, a simple, passive, and effective implant design for the real‐time pressure reading is missing. Here, the piezo capsule, a simple, cost‐effective, and miniaturized passive ultrasound pressure sensing system, is introduced. The capsule design consists of a 1 mm‐cube‐sized lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducer and a T‐shaped mechanical pin. The impedance changes of an interrogating ultrasound probe, which is ultrasonically coupled to the receiver implant, correlate to the electrical/mechanical loading of the piezo capsule. The ultrasonic sensing properties of the proposed device are characterized across a hard‐solid medium (e.g., plexiglass) and soft tissue‐like media (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and chicken breast tissue) and verified the impedance changes using finite element simulations. Last, dynamic wireless pressure readings of an artificial vessel for varying fluid flow pulse‐frequency and volumetric rate are demonstrated. The sensitivity of 0.375 Ω kPa −1 is achieved as the pressure changed from 14 to 86 kPa and pulse frequency from 0 to 100 bpm with a fixed flow rate of 8 mL min −1 .",

However, to undertake these missions, they need to overcome the challenges of power requirements for takeoff and the difficulty of transitioning reliably between the air and water media. The use of superhydrophobic surfaces offers solutions to these challenges by reducing the wetted surface area of such robotic vehicles. In this article, a range of superhydrophobic surfaces is analyzed for wettability and robustness performance to ascertain their benefits as a design feature for drag reduction in aerial–aquatic robotic vehicles. The silicon dioxide nanoparticle spray coating show the most superhydrophobicity measuring a static water contact angle of 174.8°. The coating's robustness tests yield a similar performance to that of laser‐engraved brass with 200 μm groove separation, displaying a contact angle of 133.0° after ten finger strokes. The silicon dioxide nanoparticle spray is then used for drag reduction testing due to its ease of coating complex 3D geometries among the techniques explored in this study. The spray is applied to the hull of a sailing–flying robot, which resulted in the robot's drag reduction averaging 40% in the hydroplaning regime.",

    "abstract": "In nature, wind can transport objects of diverse shapes and materials over long distances spanning meters or beyond. In contrast, most noncontact manipulation methods are effective only over centimeter‐scale distances and require the manipulated objects to have specific magnetic, electrical, or other material properties and shapes. Herein, a meter‐scale distance manipulation method is presented for controlling the motion of objects of diverse shapes and materials on a plane surface using a jet‐induced airflow field. The airflow field is varied by controlling the direction of a single air jet projected onto a surface based on the positions of objects to steer the objects to follow desired trajectories up to 2.7 m away. A wide variety of objects can be automatically manipulated, from regularly shaped polystyrene hemispheres and sticks to irregularly shaped cotton wads and face masks as well as deformable tissue papers and plastic bags. The method is also robust, effectively manipulating objects under challenging conditions, e.g., external airflow disturbances, surface obstacles, and air–water interface. Finally, three application cases are demonstrated: collecting diverse objects into a target receptacle, hooking and retrieving heavy objects with a tethered mobile agent, and closing an electrical circuit with an untethered soft agent.",

Targeting the piping problem in hyper‐actuated soft robots, two fluid‐driven membrane valve designs that can admit flows of up to while weighing less than are introduced. A mathematical model to predict fluid flow by representing the displacement of the membrane as a scalar quantity influenced by the balance of pressures applied across the valve's ports is established. The model incorporates six parameters with direct physical relevance, enhancing its usefulness in valve design and system integration. In an experimental validation, flow rates with deviations within 4% are predicted and the onset of flow is correctly identified with an error rate of less than 1%. In addition, applications of these valves for flow amplification and for the creation of a fluid‐driven oscillator are experimentally demonstrated. This research contributes to the advancement of soft robotics by providing a tool for designing, optimizing, and controlling fluid‐driven systems and it lays the groundwork for the future development of embedded, fluid‐controlled valve networks that can be used to realize hyper‐actuated soft robotic systems.",

Gaussian barebone, random selection and chaotic game mechanisms are introduced into the GWO algorithm to enhance the global search ability. The GWO enhanced by three mechanisms is called CBRGWO. To verify the performance of CBRGWO, using IEEE CEC 2017 as a test function, CBRGWO is compared to five GWO variants, five basic algorithms, six advanced algorithms, and four champion algorithms. CBRGWO is evaluated using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed‐rank test. Then, the stability of CBRGWO is analyzed. To verify that CBRGWO is still effective in practical application, CBRGWO is applied to five engineering problems and a water quality prediction problem. The experimental findings indicate that CBRGWO maintains excellent optimization ability in practical engineering problems.",

In contrast to preparing permanent sections for histopathology, a time‐consuming process, preparing frozen sections is significantly faster and can be performed during surgery, where the sample scanning time should be optimized. Super‐resolution techniques allow imaging of histopathalogical samples in lower magnification, thus sparing scanning time. Herein, a new approach is presented to super‐resolution of histopathological frozen sections, with focus on achieving better distortion measures, rather than pursuing photorealistic images that may compromise critical diagnostic information. Our deep‐learning architecture focuses on learning the error between interpolated images and real images; thereby generating high‐resolution images while preserving critical image details, which reduces the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation. This is done by leveraging the loss functions in the frequency domain and assigning higher weights to the reconstruction of complex, high‐frequency components. In comparison with existing methods, significant improvements are obtained in terms of distortion metrics, improving the pathologist's clinical decisions. This approach has a great potential to provide faster frozen‐section imaging, with less scanning, speeding up intraoperative decisions, while preserving the high‐resolution details in the imaged sample.",

    "abstract": "As the third‐generation network succeeding artificial neural networks (ANNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer high robustness and low energy consumption. Inspired by biological systems, the limitations of low robustness and high‐power consumption in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are addressed by introducing SNNs. The Brain Q‐network (BrainQN) is proposed, which replaces the neurons in the classic Deep Q‐learning (DQN) algorithm with SNN neurons. BrainQN is trained using surrogate gradient learning (SGL) and ANN‐to‐SNN conversion methods. Robustness tests with input noise reveal BrainQN's superior performance, achieving an 82.14% increase in rewards under low noise and 71.74% under high noise compared to DQN. These findings highlight BrainQN's robustness and superior performance in noisy environments, supporting its application in complex scenarios. SGL‐trained BrainQN is more robust than ANN‐to‐SNN conversion under high noise. The differences in network output correlations between noisy and original inputs, along with training algorithm distinctions, explain this phenomenon. BrainQN successfully transitioned from a simulated Pong environment to a ball‐catching robot with dynamic vision sensors (DVS). On the neuromorphic chip PAICORE, it shows significant advantages in latency and power consumption compared to Jetson Xavier NX.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to solve multi‐objective problems and reduce the turnaround times of semiconductor processes. However, only brief AI explanations are available for process/device/circuit engineers to provide holistic feedback on the manufactured results. Herein, linear/nonlinear variation decomposition (LVD/NLVD) of neural networks is demonstrated to quantitatively evaluate the influence of unit processes on the figure of merit (FoM) and co‐analyze the unit process influences with device characteristic behaviors. The NLVD can evaluate the output variation from each input of neural networks in an individual sample, although neural networks are not available in an analytic form. The NLVD is successfully verified by confirming that a) the output and summation of all decomposed output variations perfectly coincide and b) the process influences on the FoM are decomposed to 6.01–54.86% more accurately compared with those of LVD in 1Y nm node dynamic random‐access memory test vehicles with a baseline and split tests introducing high‐k metal gates with a minimum gate length of 1 A nm node for further node scaling. The approaches identify defective processes and defect mechanisms in each sample and wafer, which enhance causal analyses for individual cases in diverse fields based on regression artificial neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Recently, specialized training algorithms for analog cross‐point array‐based neural network accelerators have been introduced to counteract device non‐idealities such as update asymmetry and cycle‐to‐cycle variation, achieving software‐level performance in neural network training. However, a quantitative analysis of how these algorithms affect the relaxation of device specifications is yet to be conducted. This study provides a detailed analysis by elucidating the device prerequisites for training with the Tiki‐Taka algorithm versions 1 (TTv1) and 2 (TTv2), which leverage the dynamics between multiple arrays to compensate for device non‐idealities. A multiparameter simulation is conducted to assess the impact of device non‐idealities, including asymmetry, retention, number of pulses, and cycle‐to‐cycle variation, on neural network training. Using pattern‐recognition accuracy as a performance metric, the required device specifications for each algorithm are revealed. The results demonstrate that the standard stochastic gradient descent algorithm requires stringent device specifications. Conversely, TTv2 permits more lenient device specifications than the TTv1 across all examined non‐idealities. The analysis provides guidelines for the development, optimization, and utilization of devices for high‐performance neural network training using Tiki‐Taka algorithms.",

In this article, a bimodal reconfigurable robot capable of operating in both regular quadcopter flight mode and a unique revolving flight mode is presented, which allows independent control of the vehicle's position and roll‐pitch attitude. This design incorporates passive revolute joints that enable seamless mid‐air transitions between the two modes, facilitated by centrifugal forces, without the need for additional actuators. In the regular mode, the robot operates with four vertical propellers, similar to conventional designs. In the revolving mode, the configuration shifts to two horizontal and two vertical propellers, achieving five degrees of freedom control with four actuators. This underactuated flight capability is made possible by exploiting the robot's fast revolving motion and the resulting cycle‐averaged forces and torques. Experimental validations confirm the feasibility and enhance the maneuverability of this design. The revolving flight mode provides significant advantages in applications such as mapping and confined space navigation.",

The magnetic elastomer is produced by combining NdFeB powders with a diameter of 5 μm into silicone, following a weight ratio of 50%, and then magnetized using 2D Halbach‐array magnets. Simulation results reveal the capability to adjust magnetic field strength and distribution by altering the magnet's orientation. The sensor's efficacy in 3‐axis sensing is validated through calibration with a linear model, achieving a good root‐mean‐square error below 0.7 N in force measurement. The H‐PME sensor, with a thickness of merely 4.5 mm, can detect forces up to 50 N. It's simple 3‐layer design allows the thickness to be reduced to as low as 2 mm, while also offering ease of replacement. Crucially, crosstalk evaluation experiments show that the proposed H‐PME sensor can dramatically mitigate crosstalk interference.",

This article answers the question “Where is the best place to apply compliance in a multirotor MAV to make it more collision‐resilient?” by analyzing the output data of more than 1200 drone collision tests through two sets of accelerated and nonaccelerated collision experiments for four main configurations of micro‐quadcopters each possessing a unique softness layout of physical frame. It is shown that while applying compliance to the protective propeller guards (bumpers) of a micro‐quadcopter provides a more elastic collision, it does not improve its energy‐dissipation (impact damping) characteristics. On the other hand, enhancing the inner frame of the micro‐quadcopter with a softer structure results in higher rates of impact energy damping during the collisions and an increase in the impact time, which results in lower impact accelerations the MAV experiences during the crush. A mathematical model is developed representing the contact/collision interactions as nonlinear viscoelastic forces. Comparing the results of the simulations to the experiments suggests that this model can effectively mimic the impact behavior of contacting/colliding MAVs with different structural stiffness and damping.",

Herein, an electrical tissue adhesive featuring an entangled adhesive polymer network interpenetrated with a sacrificial dissipative polymer network is developed, which can rapidly and robustly adhere electrochemical biosensors with biological tissues, enabling strain‐insensitive physiological monitoring. The electrical tissue adhesive achieves a high fracture toughness of up to 3000 J m −2 , a low Young's modulus of around 20 kPa, superior stretchability up to 15 times its initial length, and an overall biosensor‐tissue interfacial toughness of up to 500 J m −2 . Using an electrochemical glucose sensor as one example, it is demonstrated that the electrical tissue adhesive can maintain resilient glucose sensing under various stress states and stretch levels.

However, most existing research in this area focuses on shape control for a provided explicit goal and does not consider physical constraints, which limits its applicability in many real‐world scenarios. In this study, a self‐supervised planning and control approach are proposed to address the challenge of rearranging deformable linear objects for implicit goals. Specifically, the context of making both ends of the object reachable (inside the robotic access range) and graspable (outside potential collision regions) by dual‐arm robots is considered. Firstly, the object is described with sequential keypoints and the correspondence‐based action is parameterized. Secondly, a generator capable of producing multiple explicit targets is developed, which adhere to implicit conditions. Thirdly, value models are learnt to assign the most promising explicit target as guidance and determine the goal‐conditioned action. All models within the policy are trained in a self‐supervised manner based on data collected from simulations. Importantly, the learned policy can be directly applied to real‐world settings since we do not rely on accurate dynamic models. The performance of the new method is validated with simulations and real‐world experiments.",

    "abstract": "Online learning aims to solve a sequence of consecutive prediction tasks by leveraging the knowledge gained from previous tasks. Linearized confidence‐weighted (LCW) learning is the first online learning algorithm introducing the concept of weight confidence into the prediction model through distributions over weights. It provides the flexibility for weights to update their values at different scales. The kernel trick in machine learning can be applied to LCW for a better prediction performance. However, the kernel‐based LCW algorithm is subject to the curse of kernelization which makes it vulnerable to the unlimited growth of the prediction model in runtime and memory consumption. In this study, we present the budgeted LCW (BLCW) algorithm which puts a limit on the growth by a predefined budget with optimization. Consequently, BLCW performs the LCW update and then reduces the information loss by projection. Based on the resource perspective that reinterprets LCW in terms of resources and utilization degrees, we demonstrated that BLCW approximates the kernel‐based LCW algorithm. We evaluate four budget maintenance strategies and suggest that the mean removal is the most stable. By various numerical experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate that BLCW performs competitively and effectively when compared to leading budgeted online algorithms.",

This study presents a 3D shape and color‐based descriptor, TOPS2, for point clouds generated from red green blue‐depth (RGB‐D) images and an accompanying recognition framework, THOR2. The TOPS2 descriptor embodies object unity, a human cognition mechanism, by retaining the slicing‐based topological representation of 3D shape from the TOPS descriptor (IEEE Trans. Robot. 2024, 40 , 886) while capturing object color information through slicing‐based color embeddings computed using a network of coarse color regions. These color regions, analogous to the MacAdam ellipses identified in human color perception, are obtained using the Mapper algorithm, a topological soft‐clustering technique. THOR2, trained using synthetic data, demonstrates markedly improved recognition accuracy compared to THOR, its 3D shape‐based predecessor, on two benchmark real‐world datasets: the OCID dataset capturing cluttered scenes from different viewpoints and the UW‐IS Occluded dataset reflecting different environmental conditions and degrees of object occlusion recorded using commodity hardware. THOR2 also outperforms baseline deep learning networks and a widely used Vision Transformer adapted for RGB‐D inputs trained using synthetic and limited real‐world data on both the datasets. Therefore, THOR2 is a promising step toward achieving robust recognition in low‐cost robots.",

However, most modeling techniques face computational efficiency and complexity of parameter identification issues. To alleviate this, a paradigm coupling an analytical modeling approach based on pseudo‐rigid body modeling and the logarithmic decrement method (PRBM + LDM) for parameter estimation is proposed. Using a soft robot hand test bed, the PRBM + LDM model for a closed‐loop position controller is applied and is compared with a simple proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) static shape control of soft continuum robots using deep visual inverse kinematic models. Furthermore, the PRBM + LDM model‐based force controller is compared with simple constant pressure grasping control by pinching tasks on low‐weight, small objects—a screwdriver, a potato chip, and a brass coin. The PRBM + LDM‐based position controller outperforms the simple PID position controller, and the PRBM + LDM‐based force controller achieves a higher success rate than the constant pressure grasping control in the pinching tasks. In conclusion, the PRBM + LDM modeling technique proves to be a convenient and efficient way to model the dynamic behavior of soft actuators closely and can be applied to build high‐precision position and force controllers.",

Innovative OLED light sources, fulfilling multiple purposes additional to lighting, are likely to be touched and consciously observed far more frequently than conventional illuminants. Herein, a polymer coating used to customize tactile and visual perceptions of OLED substrate surfaces is demonstrated. Tetrapodal zinc oxide particles and color pigments are incorporated in a poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix to modify surface roughness and color impression of the coating. Variation of the particle content and composition yields different combinations of roughness characteristics, thus altering tactile surface perception and light scattering. Utilization of color pigments exhibiting low transmission dispersion allows for changes of the coating color while maintaining the original OLED emission color. The presented coating concept is expected to be a promising approach to adjust haptic and optical device properties to specific application requirements while maintaining spectral OLED emission characteristics.",

The concept of a rideshare‐like distributed network of consumer‐type 3D printers is proposed to address the limited ability of the industrial base to quickly respond to abrupt changes in critical product demand or to disruptions in manufacturing and supply‐chain capacity. The technical challenges that prevent the implementation of such a network are discussed, including 1) remote qualification of 3D printers, 2) dynamic routing algorithms with reactive and predictive components, which take advantage of real‐time information about current events that may affect the network, and 3) performance evaluation of the network. Furthermore, a cyber‐infrastructure that enables autonomous operation and reconfiguration of the network to render it “crisis‐proof” by minimizing human involvement is introduced. The concept of a distributed network of consumer‐type 3D printers allows anyone with a 3D printer and access to the internet to manufacture critical supplies, triggered by actual and predicted customer demand. Beyond crisis relief, distributed networks of manufacturing assets have broad relevance, and they can establish a virtual marketplace to exchange manufacturing capacity.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks are applied to quantify the properties of organic molecules by introducing a new descriptor, a core‐loss spectrum, which is typically observed experimentally using electron or X‐ray spectroscopy. Using the calculated C K‐edge core‐loss spectra of organic molecules as the descriptor, the neural network models quantitatively predict both intensive and extensive properties, such as the gap between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (HOMO–LUMO gap) and internal energy. The prediction accuracy estimated by the mean absolute errors for the HOMO–LUMO gap and internal energy is 0.205 and 97.3 eV, respectively, which are comparable with those of previously reported chemical descriptors. This study indicates that the neural network approach using the core‐loss spectra as the descriptor has the potential to deconvolute the abundant information available in core‐loss spectra for both prediction and experimental characterization of many physical properties. The study shows the practical potential of machine‐learning‐based material property measurements taking advantage of experimental core‐loss spectra, which can be measured with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and high temporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "Electrostatic actuators, which are characterized by low weight, power consumption, noise, and remaining heat, have been studied widely and are expected to find use in wearable devices. However, they require high‐voltage control and safety circuits, which may increase their bulk. Herein, a soft electrostatic generator is proposed for use in wearable devices. Specifically, streaming electrification is used, wherein electric charge is generated through the interactions between a fluid and a solid material (the developed system is named a “streaming electrification generator”). The contact area with the insulating fluid is increased by using a porous material, and the amount of charge generated is increased to the level needed to drive electrostatic actuators using materials with different dielectric characteristics. Moreover, the generator is made of soft materials and therefore can adapt to the shape of the human body and not interfere with its movement. Finally, it is ideal for wearables because it does not use materials that are harmful to the human body. Thus, the developed system, which is made of soft materials, is a novel power generator and should be suitable for electrostatic actuators used in wearable devices.",

    "abstract": "A novel methodology in the manner of vector‐matrix multiplication (VMM) architecture is suggested for intelligently determining traffic signal changes to enhance the flow of urban traffic. Unlike the conventional prediction‐based traffic model, a real‐time decision model considering the traffic density at each transport section is established, which simplifies the traffic signal decision process as a convolutional transformation. Compared with a periodically repetitive signal changing system, the suggested VMM system actively optimizes the signal configuration in an irregular shape according to the traffic density distribution, resulting in reduction in the time cost with highly improved decision efficiency. With this system based on particle dynamics, the travel time is reduced by ≈10% at the same pass ratio for different road structures (one‐way, bidirectional, and intersectional transport). The pass ratio and resulting flow dynamics can be controllable using the different transformation matrix selections according to the traffic conditions. In addition, the analog conductance of the memristor device to the transformation matrix elements is applied, maintaining its reduction rate with a deviation tolerance of the VMM process up to ≈50%. It is believed that VMM‐based signal decision platform can lead to great progress for fast and efficient transport in complex urban traffic networks.",

Herein, open‐source software package GeoV for the 3D reconstruction and analysis of GUV shapes from confocal microscopy z‐stacks is presented. The accuracy of the reconstruction by comparing the output for the Hausdorff distance of the surface, the curvature, and the bending energy to ground truth data for simulated shapes of different complexities is quantified. Next, GeoV on a variety of confocal microscopy datasets, including z‐stacks from spherical GUVs and GUVs deformed with DNA origami, adherent GUVs, DNA droplets, and cells, is tested. Additionally, the effect of membrane‐binding DNA origami on the vesicle shape, volume, and bending energy is quantified. It is found that osmotic deflation and attachment of DNA origami can increase the bending energy of GUVs by a factor of 10. All in all, GeoV as an open‐source software package for the quantitative analysis of confocal microscopy data for bottom‐up synthetic biology is provided.",

Significant bottlenecks exist in the field of multiview facial expression recognition (MFER) including a lack of high‐quality MFER datasets, and the limited model robustness in real‐world MFER scenarios. Therefore, this article first introduces a metahuman‐based MFER dataset (MMED), which effectively addresses the issues of insufficient quantity and quality in existing datasets. Second, a conditional cascade VGG (ccVGG) model is proposed, which can adaptively adjust expression feature extraction based on the input image's pose information. Finally, a hybrid training and few‐shot learning strategy are proposed that integrates our MMED dataset with a real‐world dataset and quickly deploys it in real‐world application scenarios using the proposed Meta‐Dist few‐shot learning method. Experiments on the Karolinska Directed Emotional Face (KDEF) dataset demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits improved robustness in multiview application scenarios and achieves a recognition accuracy improvement of 28.68% relative to the baseline. It demonstrates that the proposed MMED dataset can effectively improve the training efficiency of MFER models and facilitate easy deployment in real‐world applications. This work provides a reliable dataset for the MFER studies and paves the way for robust FER in any view for real‐world deployment.",

In contrast with exoskeletons, SRLs are kinematically independent of human limbs, allowing the wearer to overcome the limitations of human physiological ability, such as realizing the expansion of space in the human body, rather than enhancing existing limbs. In this study, a lightweight and compact hexagonal reconfigurable lower‐limb SRL system is proposed to assist human locomotion in daily activities, including walking, crouching, and stair climbing. To adapt to multiple scenarios, the hexagonal mechanism can be adjusted to different configurations including convex hexagonal configuration, pentagonal configuration, and concave hexagonal configuration. To achieve more optimized performance of different configurations, the optimization for identifying the optimal dimensions of each link was carried out. Subsequently, the detailed design methodology and specifics are presented. Finally, the load and wearing performance experiments were evaluated. The experiment results demonstrated that the tested maximum load in different configurations exceeded 90% of the simulated value and the entire equipment has a good wearing adaptability. This study may inspire the design of other lower‐limb SRLs and provide efficient solutions for stable support assistance in various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In this article, an innovative offline deep imitation learning algorithm for optimal trajectory planning is proposed. While many state‐of‐the‐art works achieved optimal trajectory planning, their systems were stable or quasistable, and their approaches rarely optimized the system's initial conditions (ICs). Here, a new unstable dynamic system task called “internal sliding object stabilization control” is proposed, modeled, and solved by deep imitation learning. Given the system's ICs, the neural networks (NNs) can imitate the iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR), generate optimal trajectories, and compute faster. A proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller is used to track the unstable trajectories. Leveraging on the gradients of NNs, it can optimize the system's ICs, avoid obstacles stepwise, and ensure the worst bounds of NNs for safety. Subsequently, thorough simulations are conducted, including comparing the iLQR and PID controllers in the task, optimizing the system's different ICs by gradient descent, and finding the worst bound of the performance by gradient ascent. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves considerably improved performance. Finally, experiments are conducted with a real manipulator to compare the proposed structure with the original iLQR. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm resembles the iLQR well.

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer‐related deaths globally, demands innovative therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes. Drug repurposing, identifying new uses for existing drugs, provides a cost‐effective solution. To this end, this study constructs the first drug‐target affinity dataset specifically for two novel therapeutic targets for CRC, P2X4 and mTOR, and designs a new deep learning‐based multilevel feature aggregation enhanced (MFAE) model. The model implements hierarchical feature extraction and multilevel feature aggregation and enhancement to simulate complex drug‐target interactions. Evaluations using fivefold cross‐validation on the collected CRC dataset showcase MFAE's superior predictive accuracy. Fine‐tuning of the model on external experimental data further enhances its performance, with a concordance index of 0.930, a determination coefficient of 0.782, and a mean squared error of 0.191. Ablation studies further highlight the key role of the group‐wise feature enhancement mechanism and ensemble learning strategy in enhancing the model's performance. Virtual screening of the Food and Drug Administration‐approved drugs identifies Ponatinib and Talazoparib as potential repurposing candidates. Despite limitations in experimental validation, this study establishes an innovative computational framework designed for CRC drug discovery. Overall, this research offers a valuable perspective on leveraging computational approaches for precision oncology.",

    "abstract": "Welcome to the 6th volume of Advanced Intelligent Systems! Our premium journal had a great year in 2023, firmly establishing itself in the community as a platform to publish and read the best research on topics ranging from robotics to artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning to neuromorphic engineering. Thanks to our board members, authors, reviewers, and readers, Advanced Intelligent Systems has built an extremely solid reputation, which is reﬂected in its bibliometric indicators. The 2022 impact factor of the journal, released in June by Clarivate Analytics, was 7.4, which places AISY among Q1 journals in two JCR categories: Computer Science - Artiﬁcial Intelligence (34/145), and Automation & Control (9/65). Highly cited papers have contributed the most to these successful results. The highest-cited articles published in 2021 and 2022 are included in Table 1 . Recent Progress in Transistor-Based Optoelectronic Synapses: From Neuromorphic Computing to Artificial Sensory System (Review) However, impact factor is no longer the primary metric reported by Wiley journals anymore. As an advocate for responsible research assessment, Wiley signed the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) in May 2022 to formally commit to diverse measurement of impact and contribution. We now include additional metrics to our journals’ homepages and promotional materials aiming to provide a well-rounded view of the value and impact of any author's contribution to the ﬁeld. Advanced Intelligent Systems covers timely topics that are not only of interest to scientists and engineers but are also closely followed by the general public. Since the launch of the journal, several papers published in the journal have been highlighted by social media platforms and news outlets. This trend continued in 2023 and is reﬂected in the Altmetric scores of several of our articles (Table 2 ). Advanced Intelligent Systems promotes an inclusive open communication platform for connecting readers, authors, reviewers, editors, and board members with the content and tools they need, which has led Advanced Intelligent Systems to be an excellent home for articles with publication based on scientific novelty and interest. The open access publication model undoubtedly increases the visibility of the published articles. More details about open access advantages can be found here. Moreover, your open access article publication charge (APC) may be covered by your institution, you can check the eligibility for funding here, visit the Ensure Funder Compliance and Funder Agreements for more information. Our promotional activities to enhance the visibility of the journal and its papers continued in 2023. Articles published in Advanced Intelligent Systemsare regularly picked up by the editors of our partner news platform, Advanced Science News, and highlighted on their website and Twitter account. Additionally, highlights of the journal shared via our own Twitter account have received noticeable attention from the community. The most out- standing papers published in Advanced Intelligent Systems are identiﬁed by the journal's editors and collected in the Editors' Choice virtual issue on Wiley Online Library. In addition the regular issue, a video featuring a selection of the best content is released, providing additional visibility to the articles and their authors (see the full gallery HERE). Advanced Intelligent Systems was active in the community last year as the organiser and sponsor of several events: the Best Poster prize at SOMMeRS: Southern Ontario Medical MicroRobotics Symposium, the Best Robot Demonstration Award/Best Poster Prize at Bio-inspired Soft Aerial Robotics Workshop at IEEE Robosoft 2023. Additionally, the journal organised the second edition of the online symposium “Photonics & Advanced Intelligent Systems Workshop” in conjunction with the Institute of Photonic Chips at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, China (see the recording HERE). Several topics that fall within the multi-disciplinary scope of Advanced Intelligent Systems were highlighted in 2023 through special issues and special sections on (Figure 1 ): 1) “Recent Advances in Space Robotics” guest-edited by Hamid Marvi (Arizona State University), and 2) “Energy Storage and Delivery in Robotics” guest-edited by Mihai Duduta (University of Toronto) Special issues on Soft Robotics Across Scales, Soft Aerial Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis and Optimisation for Complex Systems will be published this year. Advanced Intelligent Systems has continued to publish interactive content in its Smart Supporting Information or Interactive Preprints collections on the Authorea platform. These projects enable our authors to publish interactive and data-driven ﬁgures, executable and responsive codes, and 3D structures alongside their papers. Further, the interactive preprints are online just a couple of days after submission, which brings greater visibility to the papers. The project has received increasing attention in the last couple of years. We are going to streamline the process even further this year, giving our authors the opportunity to submit interactive content in a faster and easier way. To help standardise data reporting, our editorial teams continue to develop submission checklists that become part of our submission process for new Research Articles. Each checklist indicates what we consider the most essential parameters that should be reported in manuscripts for a particular ﬁeld of research. These checklists not only help authors understand data reporting expectations and guide their manuscript preparation, but also aid reviewers during manuscript evaluation. Ultimately, we might also publish them as part of the online supporting information, such that they can beneﬁt our readers. We are very happy to announce that Advanced Intelligent Systems and some other Advanced journals are continuing with our “Machine Learning Data Reporting Checklist”. For more information, please refer to the journal's Author Guidelines. We are conﬁdent that Advanced Intelligent Systems will continue to grow and solidify its position as a reputed journal in 2024. For this, we would like to extend a special thank you to our authors, reviewers, and our Editorial Advisory Board for their support. We wish you all the best for the new year, and we are looking forward to your continued trust in Advanced Intelligent Systems as your journal of choice!

In article number 1900017, Prof. Jing Liu and co-workers conceived a generalized principle, termed as Intelligent Liquid Integrated Functional Entity (I-LIFE), to innovate future biomimetic soft robots. This is based on considering that liquid is a most essential component for creatures to generate profound functions. The potentials of liquids to revolutionize robots from motion, energy, material tuning, sensing to intelligence aspects were expounded. This I-LIFE sowed seeds for designing future ever-advanced unconventional robots.",

    "abstract": "Advanced Intelligent Systems: Keeping Up with Intelligent Systems in an Era of Rapid TransformationWe are currently in an inflexion point in the history of technology referred to by some as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. [1]This rapid change to the way we live, work, and communicate is driven by the exponential increase in data fueled by the rapid adoption of internetenabled devices.Many of these technologies have, in turn, undergone a rapid evolution due to the progress in artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.As the world-wide-web celebrates its 30th anniversary, [2] AI now pervades nearly every aspect of our lives.[7] The potential of intelligent systems as well as the concerns and the fears they engender are widely discussed both within academia and in the wider media, [8] and scientific journals play a crucial role in facilitating this conversation.The Advanced journals have published developments in science and technology for over 30 years with titles covering topics such as robotics, sensing, and neuromorphic computing.The growth in these areas of research has led us to launch new journals to cover these topics in more depth.In 2016, we successfully launched Advanced Materials Technologies to encompass technology-related research in materials science.At the end of 2018, we started a special series within that journal to showcase advances in the field of intelligent systems.The popularity of the series underlines the pressing need for a journal dedicated to interdisciplinary, holistic research on hard and soft intelligence.Advanced Intelligent Systems is an open access journal focused on various aspects of intelligent systems that combine hard intelligence (including robotics and self-assembly) with soft intelligence (such as artificial intelligence and machine learning).Crucially, the journal also welcomes essays on the ethical and legal aspects of intelligent systems.To cater to this rapidly evolving area of research, accepted articles are published online in advance of the final edited and typeset version of record, as part of the journal launch phase.These articles are citable via the digital object identifier (DOI) and appear online within a few days of acceptance.The article processing charge (APC) is waived in 2019 making articles in Advanced Intelligent Systems both free to read and free to publish.Advanced Intelligent Systems is supported by a topically and geographically diverse advisory board of leading scientists who reflect the active nature of this vibrant community.",

    "abstract": "Herein, regularization‐based fault detection technique for stochastic discrete time systems in state space form is discussed. Compared with the deterministic nature of a fault which usually causes an abrupt change, the state of a system smoothly evolves in most cases and the disturbance in the process and the sensor measurement has a stochastic characteristic. The modeling uncertainty in the state space of a system can induce a bias in deterministic way and it can be combined to a fault. In the fault detection community, the modeling uncertainty is called a multiplicative fault and the abruptly‐changing fault is called an additive fault. Inspired by the fact that norm is useful for estimating smoothly evolving states and reducing a bias and norm for detecting abrupt change with spare structure, this research develops the technique for detecting fault which changes abruptly under stochastic disturbance and modeling uncertainty. The norm for bias compensation (due to modeling uncertainty and/or additive fault) is combined with norm for fault detection (especially abruptly changing fault) and the two norms are set up as a regularization problem. The regularization problem is convex thus, global solution can be found in efficient way.",

    "abstract": "Welcome to the 4th volume of Advanced Intelligent Systems! 2021 was an excellent year for our premium journal, thanks to the feedback and guidance from our esteemed board members and readers, and the outstanding contributions of our authors. Last June, Advanced Intelligent Systems was accepted by Web of Science to be indexed in its Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) database. A few months later, in December, the journal was promoted to the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) database in the subject categories of “Automation & Control Systems”, “Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence”, and “Robotics”. The inclusion in the SCIE database shows that Advanced Intelligent Systems meets the selection criteria of quality and impact set by Web of Science. As a result, the journal will receive a Journal Impact Factor this year upon the 2022 JCR release. The expected Impact Factor will likely place Advanced Intelligent Systems in the top tier of journals in relevant topical fields, confirming its status as a premium journal able to provide authors with an optimal publishing platform to disseminate their research results. The scope of Advanced Intelligent Systems covers timely topics that are not only of interest to scientists and engineers but are also closely followed by the general public. Since the launch of the journal, several papers published in the journal have been highlighted by social media platforms and news outlets. This trend has continued in 2021 and is reflected in the Altmetric Scores of several of our articles (Table 1 ). Our promotional activities to enhance the visibility of the journal and its papers continued in 2021. Articles published in Advanced Intelligent Systems are regularly picked up by the editors of our partner news platform, Advanced Science News, and highlighted on their website and Twitter account. Additionally, highlights of the journal shared via our own Twitter account have received noticeable attention from the community. The most outstanding papers published in Advanced Intelligent Systems are identified by the journal's editors and collected in the Editors' Choice virtual issue on Wiley Online Library. Every month, along with the regular issue, a video featuring a selection of the best content is released, providing additional visibility to the articles and their authors (see the full gallery HERE). Advanced Intelligent Systems was active in the community last year as the organizer and sponsor of several events: It sponsored poster and/or oral prizes at 8 different workshops in two prestigious robotics conferences (IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation and IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems). In December 2021, Advanced Intelligent Systems, in collaboration with the Institute of Photonic Chips at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, organized the “Photonics & Advanced Intelligent Systems International Conference”, co-chaired by Prof. Min Gu (USST) and Dr. Hakim Meskine. Fifteen renowned speakers presented their research, and more than 2200 attendees joined this one-day online event. Several topics that fall within the multi-disciplinary scope of Advanced Intelligent Systems were spotlighted in 2021 (Figure 1 ) through special issues on: 1) “Soft Bionic Sensors and Actuators” guest-edited by Woo Soo Kim (Simon Fraser University) and Jamie Paik (EPFL), 2) “Intelligent Soft Actuators and Flexible Devices” guest-edited by Li Zhang (The Chinese University of Hong Kong), Shaoxing Qu (Zhejiang University), and Xuemin Du (Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology), and 3) “Smarter Additive Manufacturing Through Artificial Intelligence and Data-Driven Approaches” guest-edited by Grace X. Gu (UC Berkeley) and Keith Brown (Boston University). Special issues on neuromorphic engineering and space robotics will be published this year. The Advisory Board members of Advanced Intelligent Systems play a vital role in maintaining the quality and visibility of the journal by constantly giving feedback and tips to the editors and introducing the journal to their communities. We are very proud of our diverse and knowledgeable Advisory Board. To reflect/represent our diverse and evolving audience, from time to time we update the journal's board and are happy to announce the recent appointment of five new members to the International Advisory Board of Advanced Intelligent Systems (Figure 2 ): -Prof. Xiaonan Wang, Tsinghua University, China -Prof. Ravinder Dahiya, University of Glasgow, UK -Prof. Jamie Paik, EPFL, Switzerland -Dr. Katherine J. Kuchenbecker, Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Germany -Prof. Grace X. Gu, University of California Berkeley, USA Open Research has recently become more important for our authors and readers. To cater to the community's needs, Advanced Intelligent Systems has started a collaboration with Authorea (a Wiley company), enabling authors to share data-driven and interactive content alongside their papers. The project encompasses publication of Smart Supporting Information or Interactive Preprints on the Authorea platform. All documents have their own independent DOI and are linked to the Version of Record upon its publication on Wiley Online Library. These projects enable our authors to publish interactive and data-driven figures, executable and responsive codes, and 3D structures alongside their papers. Further, the interactive preprints are online just a couple of days after submission, which brings greater visibility to the papers. Several interactive papers have been published since the start of the project a few months ago, and we have received very positive feedback from our authors and readers. With the valuable support of our authors, reviewers and readers, we are confident that the journal will continue on its successful path in 2022. We wish you the best for the new year, and we are looking forward to receiving your comments, feedback, and papers!",

    "abstract": "Haptics, which involve human touch sensing and tactile feedback, play a crucial role in the physical interactions of humans with their environment. Touch sensing constitutes the most intuitive and natural way for humans to interact with the digital world, and human–machine interfaces (HMIs) are at the core of these interactions. Over the past decade, the advances in HMIs have revolutionised areas such as robotics, healthcare, assistive technologies, autonomous vehicles, and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). More so, the remarkable progress in related underpinning technologies such as 5G/6G communication, internet of things, tactile internet, neurocomputing and machine learning provides a clear prospect towards the realisation of the envisioned smart society. As efforts towards these technologies continue to rise, more intelligent systems and various methods of human interaction with these systems will also continue to evolve. Apart from the conventional physical touch interaction, humans are now able to interact with 2D objects which are displayed as 3D objects via mid-air displays. In addition to different perception modalities in humans, tactile feedback plays a significant role for an efficient bidirectional interaction with the environment and enriches the user experience. Today, HMIs which can provide both tactile sensing and feedback have also been explored. Overall, the quality of the user experience while interacting with these systems, largely depends on the intuitive nature of the HMI in use, and their ability to provide easy to understand information. Over the years, both wearable and non-wearable HMIs have significantly evolved and effectively adapted for use in various intelligent systems such as those for human-robot interaction, human-in vehicle interaction, assistive technology, and VR/AR. One of the several challenges in HMIs technologies are issues such as bulky size, lack of intuitiveness, and high control precision, especially for monitoring the human motions or transmitting complex commands. However, novel wearable technologies are gradually revolutionizing our life by integrating the flexible sensors onto our body for a more intuitive and accurate detection of physical command through our body. More so, the burgeoning field of material sciences has increasingly enabled the fabrication of novel stretchable and even implantable devices to sense or stimulate the human activities during various interactions scenarios. With this, future intelligent systems are envisioned to be more intuitive and interactive. To develop a highly intuitive and intelligent interactive system, it is highly advantageous and encouraged to consider existing HMI technologies, tactile sensors, materials, computational techniques, soft actuators as well as advances in haptic interfaces suitable for the realization of such systems. To showcase the recent advances in this rapidly growing field, we have organised this special issue of Advanced Intelligent Systems focusing on “Interactive Intelligent Systems and Haptic Interfaces”. It covers various existing intelligent systems, HMIs, sensors, soft actuators, materials, and computational techniques, for applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and smart flexible/wearable electronics. The following paragraphs, summarizes the key contributions to this special issue. Christou et al. (article number 2000126) realised an interactive 3D touch surface using frustrated total internal reflection and four-sided pyramidal pseudo-holographic projection. This pseudo-holographic display allows gesture-based control and smooth touch interaction through facile and inexpensive hardware and open-source software tools. In another related work, Christou et al. (article number 2100090) also presented an air-based haptic feedback device, named “Aerohaptics”, which has the capability to deliver mid-air tactile feedback while the user is interacting within a custom-made pseudo-holographic display. The haptic feedback provided by this device has a controllable intensity and is capable of being directed on to specific location of the user hand during interaction with a virtual object. The reported device is quite simple and cost-effective as it does not require any wearable peripheral. Buhl et al. (article number 2100037), presented a technique for customising the tactile and visual perception of organic light emitting diodes. This provides opportunities for the realization of transparent and flexible devices for application in various objects such as clothing, windows etc. for tactile and visual interaction. To achieve this, the authors utilized a polymer coating to customize the tactile and visual perception capabilities of an OLED substrate. This has the potential to enable the adjustment of haptic and optical characteristic of devices without altering their OLED spectral emission characteristics. Shuo et al. (2100074), presented a comprehensive review on tactile and visual perception which provides the fundamentals, insights, and working mechanisms of tactile and visual sensing, as well as their various applications. Recently, hand gesture recognition has attracted huge interest, as an approach for human-machine interaction, and flexible strain sensor is rapidly being explored as a means of measuring the finger motion for accurate hand gesture recognition. Si et al. (article number 2100046) presented a review on flexible strain sensor for hand gesture applications. This review is timely and provides detailed progress on the materials, structures, and operation mechanisms of various flexible strain sensor for hand gesture recognition. While this work focuses specifically on the in-depth review of strain sensors for hand recognition, Ozioko et al. (article number 2100091) presented another review on smart tactile gloves for haptic interaction, communication and rehabilitation, including smart gloves where strain sensors have been utilized for hand gesture recognition. This is also a timely review considering that wearable devices are rapidly finding their way into our lives, and glove-based HMIs have attracted considerable interest in recent years. These gloves are worn on the hand, and hand gesture is one of the most intuitive ways for human to interact. The paper also discussed the possibility and prospects of tapping into the multi-functional capabilities of electronic skin (e-skin) for the realisation of glove-based HMIs for a more intuitive and richer user interaction experience. Further, the huge potential of integrating sensing and actuation for bidirectional haptic interaction for applications such as robotics, healthcare, sensorial augmentation for non-disabled and tactile internet etc. were also discussed. Marius et al., in their work (2100045), provided a framework for designing and evaluating gesture interaction in the low-dimensional space. Further, soft actuators are increasing becoming attractive for application in interactive human machine interfaces due to their soft and conformal nature. Karipoth et al. (article number 2100092), presented a bio-inspired inchworm and earthworm like soft robot with intrinsic strain sensing capability. Apart from the huge advantage of adding sensing to soft robots for realization of a more intelligent system, the strain sensor presented in this work, (with a high stretchability of up to 900%), could also be adopted for use in hand gesture recognition where it will measure hand movements during interactions. Additionally, Chen et al. (article number 2100075) presented a comprehensive review on low-voltage soft actuators for interactive human interfaces. Low-voltage soft electrical actuators presents advantages such as good safety, low power consumption, small system size. To provide the progress in this field, this review covers three typical classes of electrical actuators, namely electrochemical, electrothermal, and other electrical characteristics. Additionally, the advantages, working principle, device configuration/design, materials selection, including the challenges and solutions were presented. Another review by Ankit et al. (article number 2100061) covers soft actuator materials for electrically driven haptic interfaces. This review summarises the advancement in material for electrically driven soft actuators. It further provided a detailed analysis of the different strategies for improving the electromechanical performance of existing material, and approaches for synthesizing novel materials for such actuators. The paper concluded by reflecting on the challenges in the field and the prospects of this material for future applications Armleder et al. (article number 2100047), presented a control architecture that can support the deployment of large-scale robot skin in a human–robot collaboration scenario. The authors showed how whole-body tactile feedback can extend the capabilities of robots during dynamic interactions by providing information about multiple contacts across the robot's surface. From the obtained results, this paper concludes that multi-modal tactile information enables robust force control while still simultaneously responding to user's interactions. Taisuke et al. in his work (2100038), provided a potential solution to the tradeoff during physical human-robot interaction using bipedal walking control. In addition to the advances in human–computer interaction, there has been a recent interest in human–vehicle interaction (HVI) which takes place inside the vehicle. This is owing to the rapidly growing interest in autonomous vehicles. To present the recent progress in this field, Murali et al. (article number 2100122) presented a review on intelligent in-vehicle interaction technologies. This timely article systematically summarized the technologies that are being used or developed to perceive user's intentions for natural and intuitive in-vehicle interaction. Further, it discussed the inherent challenges, potential solutions, and future research direction in this area. We hope that this special issue focusing on Interactive Intelligent Systems and Haptic Interfaces will bring knowledge, insight, and inspiration to readers. We look forward to the rapid growth of the massive developmental efforts in this field which will lead us right into the envisioned smart society. Finally, we appreciate all the authors for their valuable contributions, and very thankful to the editorial team of Advanced Intelligent Systems for their support and the opportunity to organize this special issue.

    "abstract": "Herein, the problem of state and unknown terrain estimation is considered, where the unknown planetary terrain parameters, e.g., terrain stiffness and ground height, are inferred from how it affects rover motion through vehicle‐terrain interaction. In particular, an alternative framework for terrain estimation based on set‐valued or set‐membership estimation is proposed, where the goal is to find set‐valued estimates (in the form of hyper‐rectangles or intervals) of the states and unknown terrain parameters. For this purpose, a state and model interval observer is designed for partially unknown nonlinear systems with bounded noise. By leveraging a combination of nonlinear bounding/decomposition functions, affine abstractions, and a data‐driven function abstraction method (to overestimate the unknown dynamics model from noisy input–output data), the proposed observer is capable of simultaneously estimating the states and learning the unknown dynamics. Further, a tractable sufficient condition is derived for guaranteeing the stability of the designed observer, i.e., such that the sequence of interval estimate widths are uniformly bounded. When applied to the state and unknown terrain estimation problem, the simulation results indicate that our approach can more reliably find the range of possible terrain parameters when compared with the cubature Kalman filter.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence in its decisions is a trait that people have grown to expect from a cyber−physical system, in particular that it makes the right choices at runtime, that is, those that allow it to fulfill its tasks, even in case of faults or unexpected interactions with its environment. Analyzing how to continuously achieve the currently desired (and possibly continuously changing) goals and adapting its behavior to reach these goals is undoubtedly a serious challenge. This becomes even more challenging if the atomic actions a system can implement become unreliable due to faulty components or some exogenous event out of its control. Herein, a solution for the presented challenge is proposed. In particular, it is shown how to adopt a lightweight diagnosis concept to cope with such situations. The approach is based on rules coupled with means for rule selection that is based on previous information regarding success or failure of rule executions. Furthermore, Java‐based framework of the lightweight diagnosis concept is presented, and the results obtained from an experimental evaluation considering several application scenarios are discussed. At the end, a qualitative comparison with other related approaches that should help the readers decide which approach works best for them is presented.

Herein, an approach for synthesizing vowel sounds straightforwardly from scalp‐recorded electroencephalography (EEG), a noninvasive neurophysiological recording method is demonstrated. Given cortical current signals derived from the EEG acquired while human participants listen to and recall (i.e., imagined) two vowels, /a/ and /i/, sound parameters are estimated by a convolutional neural network (CNN). The speech synthesized from the estimated parameters is sufficiently natural to achieve recognition rates &gt;85% during a subsequent sound discrimination task. Notably, the CNN identifies the involvement of the brain areas mediating the “what” auditory stream, namely the superior, middle temporal, and Heschl's gyri, demonstrating the efficacy of the computational method in extracting auditory‐related information from neuroelectrical activity. Differences in cortical sound representation between listening versus recalling are further revealed, such that the fusiform, calcarine, and anterior cingulate gyri contributes during listening, whereas the inferior occipital gyrus is engaged during recollection. The proposed approach can expand the scope of EEG in decoding auditory perception that requires high spatial and temporal resolution.",
