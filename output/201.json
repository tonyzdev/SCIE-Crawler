    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the effect of different plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains on growth and quality of cauliflower transplants under greenhouse conditions. The strains of Bacillus megaterium TV-3D, B. megaterium TV-91C, Pantoea agglomerans RK-92, B. subtilis TV-17C, B. megaterium TV-87A, B. megaterium KBA-10 were used in this study. The results of this study showed that dif- ferent bacterial inoculations increased plant growth parameters such as fresh shoot weight, dry shoot weight, root diameter, root length, fresh root weight, dry root weight, plant height, stem diameter, leaf area and chlorophyll contents of cauliflower transplant respec- tively. Except for abscisic acid (ABA), the values of gibberellic acid (GA), salicylic acid (SA), indole acetic acid (IAA) was increased by ratio of 23.64, 89.54 and 25.63%, respec- tively in compared to the control by application of B. megaterium KBA-10 and P. ag- glomerans RK-92. The amount of organic acids with B. subtilis TV-17C PGPR applica- tions have increased at a ranging ratio from 9.63 to 186.02%. Also, PGPR inoculations in- creased the macro and micro nutrient content of cauliflower transplants. As a result, the use of bacteria treatments may provide a means of improving transplant growth and qual- ity in cauliflower.",

This is the most numerous group of medicinal raw materials, which has a big tradition and still a wide application in therapeutics. Oil raw materials are obtained from natural stands and from crops. Cultivation method, fertilization, irrigation, date of harvest of plant material can significantly modify both the content and composition of essential oil. Nutri- ents applied in the form of mineral and organic fertilization are supplied to plants by root and foliar application. Foliar nitrogen application increases essential oil content in some plants and affects essential oil composition. Moreover, essential oil content and yield are modified by the rate of applied nitrogen. Higher nitrogen application increases methyl chavicol concentration and decreases the percentage of linalool in the volatile oil of some aromatic plant species. In the cultivation of some aromatic plants, a higher amount of po- tassium contributes to an increase in essential oil content and in the percentage of 1,8-cineole, linalool, eugenol, and �� -cadinene in the oil. Other nutrients available in the nutritional environment of plants are also capable of changing essential oil yield and composition. Likewise biofertilization, balanced mineral fertilization of aromatic plants is an important cultivation factor determining essential oil quantity and quality.",

The work is based on practical experi- ments with 12 strawberry cultivars and on analysis of published papers. We used follow- ing molar absorption coefficients (�0 values): 26900 and 29600 M -1 cm -1 for cyanidin 3 glycoside (C3g) and 15600, 22400, 27300 and 36000 M -1 cm -1 for pelargonidin 3 glyco- side (P3g). In order to show how the calculated value of total anthocyanins depends on the predominant anthocyanin used for the calculations, we compared the results of spectro- scopic and chromatographic analysis. Present research demonstrated that different �0 val- ues may influence the results of total anthocyanins even more than cultivar properties. The most frequently used �0 values 26900 M -1 cm -1 and 29600 M -1 cm -1 gave underesti- mated values. C3g was present in minor amounts in all cultivars. Conclusively, P3g with the �0 = 15600 M -1 cm -1 should be used for ensuring most precise estimation of total antho- cyanin content in strawberries.",

Two EC5 and EC8 dS/m of Hoagland nutrient solution were prepared using various salt combinations, namely; KCl + CaCl2, KNO3 + CaNO3, and KNO3 + CaNO3 + NaCl. Hoagland nutrient solution with EC 1.8 dS/m was served as control. Higher conductivity treatments had different effects on pepper plant growth. The most significant reduction in growth parameters of plant height, shoot fresh weight, fruit yield and nutrients uptake were in plants treated with KCl + CaCl2 particularly at EC8. Application of KNO3 + CaNO3 particularly at EC5 showed no difference with control regarding many growth parameters. Application of KNO3 + CaNO3 at EC5 resulted in higher shoot fresh weight compared to control. All salinity treatments except KNO3 + CaNO3 at EC5 reduced fruit yield compared to control. Treatments of KCl + CaCl2 and KNO3 + CaNO3 + NaCl particularly at EC8 of nutrient solution resulted in higher leaf proline concentration, catalase and peroxidase enzymes activity compared to control. Other conductivity treatments showed no difference in catalase or peroxidase enzymes activity. The significant lowest amount of leaf N, K, Mg and Ca was in KCl + CaCl2 at EC8. On the other hand, the highest leaf macronutrient concentrations were in KNO3 + CaNO3 at EC5 and/or EC8 that showed only higher leaf N and Ca values compared to control. Leaf micronutrient concentrations were highest in KNO3 + CaNO3 at EC5 that generally showed no difference with control plants. However, application of KCl + CaCl2 particularly at EC8 and to less extent KNO3 + CaNO3 + NaCl at EC8 reduced leaf micronutrient concentrations. Application of KNO3 + CaNO3 at EC5 increased and KCl + CaCl2 or KNO3 + CaNO3 + NaCl at EC8 decreased the leaf Fe concentration compared to control plants.",

    "abstract": "Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni) is an essential herbal plant used as a sweetener. The demand for stevia is growing due to its low caloric and medicinal value, hence the need for a more thorough investigation of its nutritional and biological properties. Nanoparticles of metal oxides have been found to have broad applications in agriculture for the stimulation of plant growth and development. The study aimed to assess the effect of various zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) concentrations on stevia plants’ quantitative and qualitative traits obtained in in vitro cultures. Micropropagation of two stevia varieties, Candy and Morita, was carried out using explants of shoot tips placed on MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg dm–3 BA and 0.1 mg dm–3 IBA and with ZnONPs at concentrations of 0 (control), 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg dm–3. The obtained results indicated that high concentrations of ZnONPs stimulated the propagation of shoots. On the other hand, they negatively influenced shoot length, root number and length, and the fresh weight of the plantlets. The presence of zinc oxide nanoparticles in the medium increased the potassium, calcium, magnesium, and zinc content while decreasing the sodium and iron content in the regenerated stevia plantlets. The total phenolic content in the Candy variety was higher in the treatments with ZnONPs than in the control plants, while it was varied in the Morita variety. In both varieties, total antioxidant content measured by the ABTS method showed significantly higher in the treatments with 20–30 mg dm–3 ZnONPs than in the control. The content of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and chlorophyll a + b in the Morita variety was higher in the treatments with 10 and 20 mg dm–3 ZnONPs than in the control. On the other hand, high concentrations of ZnONPs negatively affected the content of carotenoids in both varieties. The study showed that stevia plants obtained in in vitro cultures on control media and media containing ZnONPs had a high content of valuable minerals, phytocompounds with antioxidant properties, and photosynthetic pigments.",

The positive action of the above-mentioned nutrients on plant growth and yield is associated, among others, with their rate and form as well as with interrelationships between individ- ual nutrients. The present experiment was conducted in a greenhouse during the period from March to May in the years 2010 and 2011. Garden rocket plants were seeded indi- vidually in 2dm 3 pots, with peat as the growing medium. The experimental design in- cluded three rates (g dm -3 of medium) of potassium in the form of K2SO4: 0.3 K (and 0.34 S); 0.6 K (and 0.47 S); 0.9 K (and 0.6 S), in the form of KCl: 0.3 K (and 0.27 Cl); 0.6 K (and 0.54 Cl); 0.9 K (and 0.81 Cl), as well as two rates of nitrogen in the form of Ca (NO3)2: 0.3 N (and 0.37 Ca); 0.6 N (and 0.74 Ca). The following traits were deter- mined: plant height (cm), number of leaves per rosette (pcs), plant weight (g), and fresh weight yield of leaf rosettes (g . pot -1 ). The content of N, P, K, Ca and of Mg, S-SO4, Cl was determined in dried plant material. The increase in the rate of nitrogen in the nutri- tional environment of rocket did not affect plant height and the number of leaves per ro- sette, but it caused a significant increase in fresh weight yield of leaf rosettes, as well as it resulted in an increase in calcium content and a decrease in chlorine concentration in the plants. The increased amount of potassium in the medium contributed to an increase in rocket yield as well as an increase in the concentration of potassium and chlorine. Potas- sium chloride proved to be a better source of K than sulphur due to the amount of fresh weight and yield of the plants studied. The plants fed with KCl were also characterized by a higher content of nitrogen, chlorine, calcium, and magnesium than after the application of K2SO4.",

    "abstract": "There has been growing interest for less utilized fruit species lately. Cornelian cherry is one of these species with significant antioxidant characteristics. In this study, several chemical properties and antioxidant characteristics of cornelian cherry fruits at four ripeness stages were evaluated. The stages were light yellow, blush, light red and dark red. Several fruit characteristics (fruit width, length, weight), total soluble solids (TSS), total titratable acidity (TA), sugar/acid ratio (TSS/TA), pH, fruit external color, to- tal phenolic compounds (TPC), total antioxidant capacity (AOC) by trolox equivalent an- tioxidant capacity (TEAC), total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA) and tannins were evaluated. The stages were found to be significantly different for all factors evaluated. There was an overall increase in fruit width, length, weight, TSS, and SSC/TA over time, while TA averages decreased as the fruit matured. Fruit color progressively turned to dark red as anthocyanin accumulates. TPC and TEAC averages were similar at light yellow (8033 μg gallic acid equivalent GAE �� g -1 fresh weight (fw) and 55.0 μmol trolox equiva- lent (TE) �� g -1 fw) and reduced at the dark red stages (4162 μg GAE �� g -1 fw and 7.8 μmol TE �� g -1 fw). Tannin content decreased from 0.45 to 0.19% from light yellow to dark red stages.",

To inves- tigate the specific contribution of potassium to yield and quality of tomato, a field ex- periment was conducted on two tomato cultivars, Nagina and Roma. Foliar application with varying levels (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0%) of potassium solu- tions was applied to the plants and compared with control (without K). Exogenous appli- cation of 0.6% K significantly improved plant height, lycopene content, potassium, fruit weight and diameter. Exogenous application of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7% K maximally improved ascorbic acid contents of both tomato cultivars whereas 0.4 and 0.8% did not improve ascorbic acid contents. Due to positive correlation between K nutrition and fruit quality attributes, exogenous application of an appropriate K level can contribute to higher yield and better quality of tomato fruits. Among all potassium levels, 0.5-0.7% K maximally improved performance of tomato plants of both cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Landscape plantations are significantly water demanding in many parts of the world, particularly in dry regions. Adequate water supply is the main limiting factor behind landscape development, maintenance and beauty in such environments. On the other hand, monitoring the growth response of ornamental and landscape plants to irrigation water containing heavy metals can be useful in management and application of municipal wastewaters to these plantations instead of application in edible vegetable crops production, which is common in many urban areas. In the present study, one year old seedlings of Judas tree (Cercis siliquastrum) were irrigated for two years with water containing 0, 15 or 30 mg L–1 of lead (Pb) in absence or presence of cadmium (0 or 5 mg L–1) in a factorial design, and under greenhouse conditions. Heavy metal treatments had no significant effect on leaf SPAD value; however, plants treated with Pb15Cd0 combination had significantly higher SPAD value than Pb30Cd5 combination that showed the lowest leaf SPAD value. Increasing the lead and cadmium levels of irrigation water increased the number of chlorotic and necrotic leaves of plant than control, whereas it reduced the average leaf area and new shoot growth. The control plants or plants treated with lower level of heavy metals showed the highest leaf area and new shoot growth. Leaf photosynthesis rate was significantly reduced in all heavy metal treated plants than control plants, as the lowest amount was in Pb30Cd5 combination treatment. All heavy metal treatments showed higher leaf soluble carbohydrates and proline content than in control plants. Leaf soluble carbohydrates were highest in Pb30Cd0 and Pb30Cd5 treatments, and leaf proline was highest in Pb30Cd5 and Pb15Cd5 treatments. The results indicate that Judas tree is a relatively tolerant species to high concentrations of Pb and Cd in root medium added through the irrigation water, and long term dual application of these heavy metals can have additive harmful effects on plant growth.",

    "abstract": "Crossbreeding is a multi-stage process with inherent challenges and risks in developing new varieties. Success hinges on selecting highly fertile parents. In species like lisianthus, uncertainty persists regarding the optimal methods for assessing pollen quality, which is crucial for evaluating pollen parent fertility. This study seeks to identify the most reliable techniques for this purpose. Fresh and dead pollen from four lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum) varieties was used. The dead pollen was obtained by thermal inactivation. Five chemical staining methods (iodine-potassium iodide, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride – TTC, lactophenol cotton blue, safranin, acetocarmine) were employed to assess pollen viability, and two biological methods (Petri dishes, hanging drops) were used to determine the germination rate. Four solid medium cultures were employed in Petri dishes, while the hanging drop utilised four liquid medium cultures. Thirteen tests were conducted for each variety, evaluating fresh and dead pollen. The study found significant variations in pollen quality among lisianthus varieties and methods. Fresh pollen showed viability rates ranging from 56.87% to 99.41% and germination rates from 0.20% to 45.11%. TTC exhibited the lowest viability rate across all varieties, while the highest germination rate was observed in the liquid culture medium with only boric acid and PEG1500. Notably, TTC was the sole viability method that did not stain dead pollen, and no germination occurred in any method for dead pollen. TTC is the most reliable staining method, and a liquid culture medium with boric acid and PEG1500 effectively determines lisianthus pollen quality. Varying boric acid and PEG1500 concentrations are advisable.",

Therefore the aim of this work was the assessment of the stimulatory effect of Asahi SL on Arabi- dopsis thaliana L. and ornamental amaranth plants grown under optimal conditions. Plants treated with Asahi SL were higher and more advanced in development, particularly generative. Biomass accumulation was greater after biostimulator application mainly due to better photosynthetic apparatus efficiency, which was manifested by (i) greater leaf area, (ii) higher total chlorophyll content and (iii) increased intensity of photosynthesis. Effect of Asahi SL on chlorophyll a fluorescence was marginal. Despite of higher transpi- ration and lowered stomatal resistance the RWC was almost unchanged in biostimulator treated plants what was attributed to increased water uptake. Obtained results clearly showed that Asahi SL applied on plants can also be effective and beneficial when they are grown under optimal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Within the Ocimum genus there occur about 200 species in different varieties and forms. They differ in the essential oil content and quality, as well as in many morpho- logical features. The studies conducted in the years 2008-2009 were aimed at defining the effect of basil cultivar ('Kasia' and 'Wala'), as well as of the differentiated doses of CaCO3 (6 or 12 g·dm -3 of substratum) upon the biological value and chemical composition of the oil in the examined plants, grown in pots filled with transitory peat. A significant interaction was reported between the examined cultivar and CaCO3 dose upon the yield of fresh basil plant weight. The highest yield (172.3 g·plant -1 ) was obtained from plants of �Kasia' cultivar, when a higher dose of CaCO 3 was applied (12 g·dm -3 substratum). Lack of significant effect of calcium carbonate dose was reported upon the yield of fresh basil plant weight. In the examined objects similar fresh weight yield values were obtained. At a higher dose of calcium carbonate the unit plant weight equaled 165.9 g·plant -1 , and at a lower dose of CaCO3 it was 160.2 g·plant -1 . The percentage of dry matter significantly depended on the cultivar. Basil of 'Wala' cultivar had higher dry matter content, (32.0%) compared to 'Kasia' (25.6%). Both the cultivar and calcium carbonate dose significantly affected the vitamin C contents in fresh basil herb. Increasing the CaCO3 dose from 6 g·dm -3 to 12 g·dm -3 caused the increase of vitamin C concentration by 12.6%. Higher essential oil contents was characteristic of the herb of 'Kasia' plants - 1.33% compared to 'Wala' cultivar, in whose herb 1.03% of oil was determined. The qualitative composition of isolated oil depended on the examined factors. The predominating compounds were: li- nalool, 1.8-cineole, geranyl, D germacrene, �-cadinene, Epi-�-cadinole. A certain differ- entiation was found in the contents of particular compounds in the essential oils of 'Kasia' and 'Wala' plants, as the effect of calcium nutrition.",

    "abstract": "Different aspects of living mulches application in vegetable crops production is discussed in the paper. They compete with vegetables for light, moisture and nutrients and for this reason in most cases cause the yield reduction of cash crops. However, at the end of vegetation period, after ploughing down as green manure they enhance the organic matter content in the soil, improve its physical and chemical properties, which are benefi- cial for the subsequent species in crop rotation. Undersowing is best suited in perennial crops like rhubarb or the species with relatively long vegetation period, grown from trans- plants (leek, cabbage, sweet corn, stake tomato, pepper). The most important attributes required for species used as living mulches are quick emergence and soil covering, short height, low water and nutrients demands. In most cases the legume crops (white clover Trifolium repens L., red clover Trifolium pratense L., hairy vetch Vicia villosa Roth., se- radella Ornithopus sativus Brot.), grasses (perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne L.) or cere- als, especially rye Secale cereale L. are used for this purpose. Their competitiveness to the cash crops may be diminished by the delayed term of undersowing the only in strips between plant rows, mowing the biomass or the use of sublethal doses of herbicides. The beneficial effects of living mulches include the suppression of weed infestation, reduced insect pests and diseases pressure, and prevention from soil degradation. They suppress soil compaction, wind and water erosion, improve soil structure, reduce the surface water runoff and nutrients leaching. Living mulch cover is favourable for biological activity of the soil and the amounts of available nutrients after decomposition. Further intensive stud- ies will be needed to introduce such intercropping, friendly to the environment system to the wide practice, especially in the terms of possible decrease of competitiveness to the cash crops.",

Silicon is the only ele- ment that does not harm plants when taken up in excessive amounts and its use in plant fertilization improves the yielding ability of plants and their resistance to various stress factors. The effectiveness of silicon application in growing plants is strictly dependent on both the source of this element, plant species and cultivars. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of root application of colloidal silicon as well as of three types of growing media of different silica content and varying ability to release orthosilicate monomers (rockwool, sand, straw) on yield and chemical composition of greenhouse to- mato. The research was conducted in greenhouse in the period 2008-2009. Tomato was grown in an extended growth cycle (22 clusters) using a drip irrigation and fertilization system with closed nutrient solution circulation. Tomato plants fertigated with the nutrient solution enriched with silicon showed significantly higher total fruit yield (15.98 kg�� plant -1 ) compare to plant grown in control treatments. In the studies not found significant differ- ences in total and marketable yield as well as in mean fruit weight between plants grown in rockwool and straw mediums. The total fruit yield of tomato plants grown in sand was lower compared to rockwool-grown plants. The fruit of tomato grown in sand was shown to have more dry matter (5.52%), total sugars (2.58% FR.W.) and potassium (4.19% DW) compared to rockwool culture as well as significantly the highest amount of silicon. The leaves of tomato fertilized with the silicon-enriched nutrient solution contained more sili- con as well as less manganese and zinc compared to control plants.",

    "abstract": "Initiation of tissue culture of many plant species is a very difficult stage due to appearance of many contaminations. The other problem might be a choice of media for regeneration. Initiation of grass species tissue cultures are thought to be very difficult. Therefore, a research was undertaken to evaluate the use of nano-silver particles for plant material disinfection and to estimate a medium Pennisetum alopecuroides. The plant material were buds and nodal explants that were disinfected in 2% NaOCl for 30 min or 0.1% HgCl2 for 1 min. Half of the explants disinfected with NaOCl were soaked in 50, 100 or 250 mg·dm Ag–3 NPs for 1 hour. Explants not soaked in nano-silver were placed on media with Ag NPs at concentrations of 4, 8 or 16 mg·dm–3. An influence of growth regulators on Pennisetum alopecuroides was evaluated in vitro. Regenerated shoots were placed on MS media with: 3 mg·dm–3 BA + 0.3 mg·dm–3 IBA, 3 mg·dm–3 KIN + 0.3 mg·dm–3 IAA, 1 mg·dm–3 BA + 0.1 mg·dm–3 IBA. It was observed that the use of nano-silver particles lowered the level of contamination. The best results were obtained when Ag NPs was used at concentration of 100–250 mg·dm–3 alone or as a supplementation of the media, at concentration of 4 mg·dm–3 for nodes and 16 mg·dm–3 for adventitious buds. The use of nodal explants allowed to obtain less contamination. Regeneration depended on a media content. The most regenerated shoots were obtained on the MS media supplemented with 1 mg·dm–3 BA and 0.1 mg·dm–3 IBA.",

    "abstract": "A trial assessing the suitability of multifunctional living mulch to maintain the soil and reduce weed infestation was carried out in an organic apple orchard in the years of 2019-2020. Perennial plants (Alchemilla vulgaris, Fragaria vesca, Mentha piperita) and annual crops (Tropaeolum majus and Cucurbita maxima) were grown in the in the rows of the apple trees. The weeds number and soil weeds coverage in tree rows were assessed. Regardless of the living mulch species utilized, the soil resulted to be mostly covered by perennial weed species such as: Equisetum arvense and Taraxacum officinale and annual species such as: Lamium purpureum, Stellaria media, Galinsoga parviflora, Capsella bursa-pastoris and Poa annua, which were the most common species also for the natural cover used as control. However, all living mulch species limited weed infestation and M. piperita, F. vesca and T. majus most strongly limited weeds growth. It is concluded that living mulch species can be a feasible practice to manage the soil on the tree rows in organic orchards.",

    "abstract": "The consumption of organic food has been growing all over the world. Clean soil environment and extensive methods of production make Poland particularly suitable for developing organic forms of farming. The nutritional quality of food grown by organic and conventional methods is the subject of much controversy. The nutritious quality of organic products is the subject of numerous scientific research. The study conducted in 2009 presents comparison of some nutritional values of juices made from organic and conventionally grown vegetables (carrot, red beet, celery). For the experiment 39 vegeta- ble fields located in the south and east of Poland were chosen. All organic farms were cer- tified according to UE Council Regulation no. 2092/91 and obtained valid certificates. Unclarified juices were obtained with cold press juicer. After microwave mineralization in HNO3 the following nutrient elements were measured: P, K, Mg, Ca, S, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, B as well as Na, Cd, Pb, and Ni. Moreover, ammonium N and nitrates content were evaluated using FIA method. Celery juices were the richest in P, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, Zn, B and heavy metals Cd, and Pb, while carrot juices were having the highest level of S and Na. Cultivation methods significantly differentiated Ca, Mg and Na content. Generally, the conventional farming method favored higher accumulation of N-NO3 (only in carrot), Mg and Na, whereas the higher Ca amounts were measured for bio juices. Significantly higher N-NH4 amounts were observed for all conventionally vegetable juices than for organic. Higher levels of Cd were found for conventional juices made from carrot and beet, how- ever in the celery juice the values differences were not significant.",

In the years 2008-2010 (February - May) studies were con- ducted on the relationship between cultivar, nitrogen dose (NH4NO3), potassium dose (K2SO4), and some components of chemical composition of basil herb. The study subject were basil plants of two Polish cultivars: Kasia and Wala, as well as the green-leaved form, popular on the domestic fresh herb market. Basil was grown in the greenhouse, in pots of the capacity of 4 dm 3 . Four doses of nitrogen and two doses potassium were ap- plied. In the herb collected during full flowering dry matter, N-NH4 and N-NO3, nitrogen total, potassium and protein contents were determined. It was demonstrated that average dry matter contents in the herb of examined basil plants was 13.20% and significantly de- pended on the cultivar and dose of applied nitrogen. The most (15.47%) dry matter was found in the herb of Wala cultivar plants. The increasing nitrogen doses caused the in- crease of protein contents in basil herb. The most (26.13% d.m.) of protein was found in the herb of plants fed with the highest dose of nitrogen. Plants receiving the most potas- sium had more (23.24% d.m.) protein in the herb than plants receiving less of that nutrient (22.31% d.m.). Mean content of nitrate nitrogen in the examined herbal material was 0.78% d.m. Plants of Wala cultivar had significantly lower (0.66% d.m.) amount of nitrate nitrogen than the remaining ones. Additionally increased contents were demonstrated of nitrogen (total, ammonium, nitrate) and potassium in basil herb as an effect of increased nitrogen dose.",

This peel, and especially the cuticle and epicuticular wax formed on the fruit surface, plays a crucial role in preserving the fruit life by preventing water evaporation and the penetration of pathogen, as well as maintaining fruit firmness. The protective function of these two layers is particularly important after harvest during storage. Using light and scanning electron microscopy, the present study examined the structure of the fruit peel in two apple cultivars, 'Lobo' and 'Boskoop'; their fruits had been stored for 2 months in a controlled-atmosphere storehouse. The fruit epidermis in cv. 'Lobo', with a smooth and slick surface, was characterized by the occurrence of unidirec- tional microcracks that were less numerous and had a smaller depth than in cv. 'Boskoop'. The fruit surface in 'Boskoop' was coarse and dry, its numerous microcracks ran in dif- ferent directions along the walls of the epidermal cells. Mycelium hyphae were observed in these microcracks and inside the lenticels of the fruits of 'Boskoop', whereas no myce- lium hyphae were found on the surface of the fruits in 'Lobo'. The apple cultivars differed in the thickness of the cuticle layer, the height of the epidermal cells as well as in the thickness and number of hypodermis layers.",

The lavender-pink globular flower heads of chive not only beautify the garden or dried bouquets, but they can also be used to prepare chive vinegar, salads or soups. The aim of this work was to determine the nutritional value of flowers of the chive cultivated at the Horticultural Experiment Station in Douje (north-western Poland) in the years 2009 and 2010. In the raw plant material, the content of dry matter, total ash, total protein, titratable acidity, vitamin C as L-ascorbic acid, total and reducing sugars, fat, crude fibre, polyphenols, total carotenoids, chloro- phylls, pungency, free radical scavenging activity and energy value were measured. The Allium schoenoprasum L. dried flowers were extracted by ethanol at 50C and at room temperature (maceration). The obtained extracts were analyzed by GC-MS method. The analysis revealed that the flowers contained much important fatty acids with palmitic acid (7.94-16.94%), linoleic acid (7.63-13.45%) and stearic acid (3.13-31.16%), the most abundant saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, as well as �-sitosterol (3.41-6.42%), campesterol (0.34-0.66%), fucosterol (0.29-0.51%) and vitamin E (0.16-0.49%).

    "abstract": "Iron chlorosis is a wide-spread limiting factor of production in agriculture. Fe deficiencies is done mainly by foliar sprays because soil application generally are ineffec- tive, especially for annual crops. A pot experiment, conducted in a phytotron, investigated the effectiveness of foliar fertilization of French bean with 3 inorganic iron salts (FeSO4 · 7H2O, FeCl3 · 6H2O, Fe(NO3)3 · 9H2O) and 2 organic iron salts (Fe-Citr., Fe-EDTA), applied with and without the addition of 0.5% CO(NH2)2. Iron was applied 3 times only on simple leaves in the form of aqueous solutions containing 0.2 mg Fe in 1 cm 3 , compared to water as the control treatment. The obtained results show that the ap- plication of iron salt solutions resulted in a distinct increase of Fe content in simple leaves and in the next trifoliate leaves. Foliar fertilization of the plants with Fe(NO3)3 was the most effective, while feeding with Fe-EDTA was the least effective. Iron given in the form of chelates showed greater mobility in the plants than that applied in the form of in- organic salts. Foliar fertilization of the plants with inorganic iron salts significantly in- creased chlorophyll a+b and carotenoid content in the leaves as well as their stomatal conductance and the photosynthesis and transpiration rates. But the impact of Fe chelates, in particular Fe-EDTA, on the abovementioned plant traits was not clear. The leaves of the plants treated with Fe(NO3)3 showed the highest content of photosynthetic pigments and the most intense gas exchange. The application of inorganic iron salts and Fe-Citr. re- sulted in a significant increase in the number of nodules formed on the bean roots and their weight. The plants treated with Fe-Citr. produced the largest number of nodules, while those treated with Fe(NO3)3 developed nodules with the highest weight. The addi- tion of urea to the iron solutions had an effect on the increase in the value of the iron transport rate and on the decrease in iron and carotenoid content, the leaf gas exchange rate as well as the number of root nodules and their weight.",

To reduce its concentration in air, plants could be used as biological filters, adsorbing PM on the foliage (SPM) or stabilizing in waxes (WPM). PM has also negative impact on the photosynthetic apparatus, but not much is known in regard to comparison of species re- sponses to PM. In this work, an attempt was made to define the amount of PM and waxes on foliage and to evaluate the efficiency of photosynthetic apparatus in five species grown in two sites differing in level of PM in the air. Obtained results showed, that quantities of PM and waxes on foliage were greater in plants grown in the City centre. These plants had lowered efficiency of photosynthetic apparatus, usually manifested by lower: (1) chlorophyll content, (2) values of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and (3) photo- synthesis rate, which coincides with an (4) increased stomatal resistance. Among tested species Sorbaria sorbifolia was the best acclimated to conditions of urban areas with si- multaneous highest PM accumulation. Therefore S. sorbifolia is best suited for phytore- mediation of PM from air in urban areas.",

Seeds were sown in three periods. After four weeks plants were transplanted into the field. Min- eral-organic fertilizers were applied in accordance to the producer's recommendation: the Goemar Goteo preparation was used twice for seedlings watering while the Aminoplant preparation was used for plants spraying in the second and third week after transplanting them into the field. Mineral-organic fertilizers did not affect the yield of the investigated cultivars. The highest commercial yield of endive and the highest mean weight of leaf ro- sette was obtained for the first term of cultivation. Plants in the third term of cultivation characterized with the highest dry matter content. The least amount of nitrates was cumu- lated in curly endive leaves. The highest content of calcium was observed in the first term of cultivation. The content of potassium and phosphorus was on similar level during the first and the second term of cultivation. The significant effect on the macroelement con- tent due to applied preparations was not observed. The effect of mineral-organic fertilizers on the content of flavonoids was examined. Leaves of endive rosettes treated with mineral-organic fertilizers synthesized rutoside and higher amount of astragalin (3-O- -kaempferol glucoside) in comparison with control combination.",

Growth and yielding of basil plants depends, among others, upon the cultivar and fertilization. The experiment was conducted in a glasshouse, in the period from February to May 2009-2010. Plants were grown in pots of the capacity of 4 dm 3 , filled with peat substrate. Nitrogen (administered in the form of ammonium saltpeter) concentration in the substrate was differentiated: 0,2; 0,4; 0,6; 0,9 g N. dm 3 , as well as that of potassium: 0,4; 0,8 g K. dm 3 , given in the form of a sulfate. The plants of three examined basil cultivars (Kasia, Wala, green leaved form) differed in average height, number of branchings, size of leaves, as well as the weight of fresh and air-dry herb. The application of nitrogen fertilization significantly differentiated the mean height and length and width of leaf blades in basil plants that decreased as the dose of this nutrient increased. Plants fed with the lowest and medium dose of nitrogen had significantly higher weight of fresh and air-dry herb, compared to the plants obtaining the highest dose. The amount of fresh herb of the examined plants remained under signifi- cant influence of the co-operation. The fresh herb weight of the examined plants remained under significant effect of cooperation between the cultivar and nitrogen dose. No signifi- cant effect of potassium dose was found upon the examined biometric features of basil plants. The interaction between nitrogen and potassium in the formation of basil growth and development was only demonstrated with reference to the height of plants and width of the leaf blade.",

    "abstract": "The concentration of non-enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbate and glu- tathione in tissues is one of the major plant responses to biotic and many abiotic stresses, including metals. Therefore, it is crucial to develop the most effective methods for simul- taneous quantitative analysis of these antioxidants. Capillary zone electrophoresis allows relatively fast and effective analysis. The aim of the paper was to apply and optimise the capillary electrophoresis conditions for simultaneous determination of glutathione, glu- tathione disulphide, ascorbate, and dehydroascorbate in small plant tissue samples ex- posed to copper and cadmium. The method ensures good linearity and reproducibility, with correlation coefficients 0.988 for ascorbate and 0.999 for glutathione and glutathione disulphide, and with detection limits approximately 2.50, 0.65 and 0.50 ppm, respectively. Cu stress was found to increase the ascorbate concentration and glutathione content in leaves, while Cd increased glutathione in the oldest leaf segments and root.",

In this study, eight E. spectabilis from different growing areas have been analyzed for its nutrition value and antioxidant properties. The results showed that there were significant differences among samples in terms of all above parameters. The mean values of the parameters investigated were 86.62-91.35% for water content, 4.78-5.15 for pH; 0.42-0.70% for acidity, and 0.61-1.11% for ash content. The antioxidant activity tests evaluated by using 2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and �� -carotene/linoleic acid assays indicated that the extracts of E. spectabilis samples had high antioxidant capacity. In the DPPH and �� -carotene/linoleic acid systems, average val- ues were 73.69 �� g extract . ml -1 and 94.56%, respectively. The average amount of total phenolics in samples was 223 mg GAE . 100 g -1 FW. Protein, K, Ca, Mg, Fe and Cu con- tents of E. spectabilis species were found higher than in some other commonly used vege- tables. The results suggest that E. spectabilis could be a valuable source of antioxidants, phenolics and minerals.",

    "abstract": "The oil bearing rose (Rosa damascena) is the most important rose species in terms of fragrances and flavourings. Due to the very short blooming period and excessive amount of flowers, considerable amount of the rose flowers wait for a long time until dis- tillation. There are losses of essential oil yield and quality use of before waited petals. The cold storage and drying applications may be alternative method for evaluate of excessive amount of flowers. Therefore in this study it was aimed to determine the effects of storage on cold (4°C) and room condition (25°C) and convective drying with different tempera- tures (40, 50 and 60°C) in terms of changes in volatile compositions of oil rose flowers based on direct hexane extraction. Totally 20 volatile compounds were identified in fresh, stored and dried rose petals. The detected compounds varied according to the various storage and drying conditions. It was determined that phenylethyl alcohol, citronellol, geranyl acetate, nonadecane were predominant compounds on all treatments. In the study, storing treatments led to increase on the percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes (OM) while drying treatments led to decrease on OM. It was determined that storing and drying treatments led to increase on the percentage of benzenoid compounds (BC) and aliphatic hydrocarbons (AH).",

The first attempts at rooting and acclimatization of tetraploid shoots failed. The aim of the study was to develop an effective method for rooting microcuttings of apple neo-tetraploids. In the first stage of the study, in vitro rooting method was optimized for the shoots of diploid donor cultivars. Shoots were rooted on Murashige and Skoog [1962] (MS) medium with a reduced content of nitrogen, in the presence of auxins alone or in combination (indole-3-butyric acid – IBA, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid – NAA and indole--3-acetic acid – IAA) with addition of putrescine, arginine or ornithine. The compounds were applied continuously for 25 days (one-step rooting system) or for seven days with subsequent transplanting shoots onto a medium without these compounds (two-step rooting method). Tetraploid microcuttings of the cultivars 'Free Redstar', 'Gala Must', 'Pinova' and 'Redchief' were evaluated for rooting on the selected medium considered optimal for their diploid counterparts. The shoots of all diploid apple scion cultivars had low rooting capacity. IBA alone poorly stimulated root formation. Significant improvement of rooting to 60–80% was achieved through the application of auxins, 2.5 µM IBA or 1.3 µM NAA combined with 5 µM IAA and 50 µM putrescine in the two-step rooting system with darkness and increased temperature of 26°C during seven-day induction phase. The replacement of benzyladenine (BA) by meta-Topolin (m-T) in the last multiplication subculture influenced positively shoot acclimatization. Tetraploids had comparable or slightly lower rooting and acclimatization ability compared to their diploid counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Root-knot nematodes have become a grave menace to the lucrative production of cucumber throughout the world. These nematodes are mainly controlled by applying nematicides, but their use is often associated with hazards. Alternatively, the use of nematode resistant cultivars is considered to be innocuous and economically feasible. For their fitness as nematode-suppressive crops, the reduction in growth and yield parameters of these cultivars must be assessed. As there is little documented data about the effects of Meloidogyne incognita on the damage of cucumber, therefore, in the present study, the effects of M. incognita were evaluated on growth and yield parameters of fifteen cucumber cultivars. M. incognita significantly negatively affected the growth and yield parameters of all the cucumber cultivars. Shoot and root lengths and shoot weights of all the cultivars were significantly reduced as a result of nematode infection. Maximum reductions in these parameters were recorded in highly susceptible cultivars followed by susceptible ones, while the reductions were minimal in resistant followed by moderately resistant cultivars. On the contrary, the infection by M. incognita resulted in an increase in root weights of all the cultivars. The increase was found to be the maximum in highly susceptible cultivars followed by susceptible and moderately susceptible cultivars. Likewise, the minimum increase was observed in the resistant cultivars followed by moderately resistant cultivars. Similarly, significant variations in yield parameters among fifteen cucumber cultivars were also recorded as a result of M. incognita infection. In the case of highly susceptible cultivars, the reductions in yield parameters were maximum, whereas the reductions in resistant and moderately resistant cultivars were found to be minimum. As cultivars Long Green, Marketmore, Pioneer-II, Dynasty and Summer Green experienced no significant damage compared to susceptible cucumber cultivars and therefore, they are approved for cultivation in nematode infested soils.",

Fruits from the old- est plants contained 16-18% less anthocyanins and 8% less vitamin C, but 2.7 percentage points more dry matter than the fruits from younger plants. On the 29 August-1 Septem- ber fruits achieved the maximum content of reducing sugars, vitamin C and anthocyanins, 13.7, 8.2 and 715.5 mg 100 g -1 , respectively. The content of reducing sugars and antho- cyanins stayed unchanged until the end of October, and the content of vitamin C de- creased considerably. Antioxidative potential (DPPH) ranged from 77.0 to 85.2% inhibi- tion and it did not depend on the age of harvest time of fruits.

Such clones of woody plants could be valuable material applicable to soil remediation. In in vitro culture conditions shoots of Daphne jasminea Sibth. & Sm. and Daphne tangutica Maxim. (Thymelaeaceae) were grown on media supplemented with 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mM lead nitrate. Level of lead bioaccumulation, growth parameters, con- tent of photosynthetic pigments, and mineral status of cultured shoots were investigated. D. jasminea has grown vigorously on Pb 2+ -containing media, with growth tolerance index reaching 73-89%, depending on concentration applied, and the highest growth value was obtained in the presence of 1.0 mM lead nitrate. In vitro propagation of D. tangutica shoots was slightly inhibited by lead ions, however the growth tolerance index has in- creased up to 152% on medium with 1.0 mM Pb(NO3)2. In both studied species the high- est content of accumulated lead, as well as the value of bioconcentration factor, were found in shoots grown on 0.1 mM lead nitrate. D. tangutica accumulated over two times as much lead in comparison with D. jasminea. Chlorophyll content in D. jasminea was not affected by applied lead nitrate doses, while in D. tangutica stimulation of chloro- phyll, as well as carotenoid, synthesis occurred. In tested concentrations lead nitrate had no toxic effect on the level of shoot nutrition. Detected levels of essential and trace ele- ments were still high enough to maintain undisturbed growth and development of cultured shoots. This is first report confirming the suitability of in vitro selection for obtaining of vigorous, proliferative, tolerant to elevated lead concentration shoots of ornamental Daphne species.",

At around 10:30, the gs for Italia, Crimson Seedless and Alphonse Lavallee were at the highest levels with their valus 287.7, 262.1 and 242.0 mmol H2O m -2 s -1 , respectively. The last measurements on gs at around 16:10 varied from to 96.7 (Italia) to 112.0 mmol H2O m -2 s -1 (Alphonse Lavallee). During the daily time course, the gs depended mainly on irradiance.

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to perform micromorphological analyses of the secretory structures of leaves and stems of oil-bearing industrial plants from the Lamiaceae family such as lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.), peppermint (Mentha × piperita L.), sage (Salvia officinalis L.), marjoram (Origanum majorana L., syn. Origanum dubium Boiss.), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) and common thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) using light microscope and scanning electron microscope. In addition, an estimation of the content of volatile substances in the plant species under study was performed using GC-MS, as well as the qualitative and quantitative analysis of essential oil, that is an important component in terms of the estimation of raw material applicability for use in the industry. In the epidermal cells of studied plants, 2 types of Lamiaceae-type glandular trichomes were identified: short- and long-stalked capitate glandular trichomes with single- and bicellular secretory capitulum, and peltate glandular trichomes with eight- and over a dozen-cell secretory capitulum. Capitate trichomes were densely distributed on the surface of the epidermis, while peltate trichomes were sparse, though regular, and were situated in depressions. Glandular trichomes were found more frequently on leaves than on stems. The cuticle of the abaxial of leaf was characterized in most cases by the occurrence of larger average diameter peltate trichomes compared to the cuticle of the adaxial side of leaf. Peppermint produced the largest structures accumulating essential oil on the leaves (average diameter of peltate trichomes – 78.48 µm on the adaxial side of leaf, up to 96.43 µm), while on the stem, the highest average diameter of the peltate trichomes was observed in sage (an average of 75.53 µm, up to 85.99 µm). The lemon balm was characterized by the presence of capitate and peltate trichomes with the smallest diameter (an average of 44.26 µm). Lemon balm was characterized by the greatest density of glandular trichomes compared to other plant species. Among the plants studied, the highest content of oil was noted in the case of thyme and peppermint (2.22% and 2.20% v/w, respectively), and the lowest in green parts of lemon balm (0.17% v/w). The isolated essential oils contained predominantly components from the groups of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and it is the presence of those substances that determines the possibility of utilizing the plants studied for a variety of purposes.",

    "abstract": "Burdock (Arctium lappa L.) roots are traditionally used in folk medicine as diuretic and curing rheumatism, gastritis, gout, throat pain, arthritis and rashes. These pharmacological properties are due to many bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and fructooligosaccharides. Nowadays, the the application of “green” methods for extraction of natural compounds gains more and more attention. The object of the current research was to determine inulin and sugars content, phenolic content and antioxidant potential in 70% ethanol and water extracts obtained by two “green“ extraction methods, namely pressure-liquid extraction and ultrasound-assisted techniques. The content of total fructans, as well as inulin and sugars were analyzed by spectrophotometric resorcinol-thiourea method and high-performance liquid chromatography with refractive index detection. Total phenols and flavonoids were determined by Folin-Chiocalteu and Al(NO3)3 reagents. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by four reliable methods (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and CUPRAC). The established inulin content varied from 0.27 to 4.0 g/100 g dw in prevalence of the ultrasound-assisted extract obtained with water. Additionally, the established phenolic compounds content (from 10.35 to 18.16 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dw) and antioxidant activities demonstrated the burdock roots as potential source phytonutrients with health beneficial properties.",

Different concentrations of plant growth regulators (PGRs) and different pre-treatments of cold preservation and cryopreservation are the prerequisites of these three approaches. Apical bud as explant and Murashige and Skoog (MS) as the culture medium for all three sections of the research, kinetin (Kin) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) as PGRs for the micropropagation section, and encapsulation-dehydration as pre-treatment for the sections of cold preservation and cryopreservation were used. The results of the micropropagation section indicated that the highest number of shoots (5.40 per explant) and roots (5.98 per explant) were obtained from the culture of the explants on the media containing 1 mg L–1 IBA together with 1 and 2 mg L–1 Kin, respectively. The results of the cold preservation section revealed that the highest percentage of survival of germplasms (100%) after storage in the refrigerator was observed in the apical buds pre-treated by dehydration of encapsulated explants with 0.75 M sucrose for two hours, followed by dehydration under a laminar airflow cabinet for two hours. The results of the cryopreservation section demonstrated that the highest percentage of survival of germplasms (100%) after storage in liquid nitrogen was obtained in the apical buds pre-treated by encapsulation-dehydration under a laminar airflow cabinet for two hours.

Flowers with long-styled pistol are the major- ity among all flowers on a plant (60%). Number of flowers with medium and short style is lower (10-15% and 22-30%, respectively). Eggplants set fruits from flowers with long style in 49-100% and with medium style in 46-85%. These flower's stigmata have well - developed nodules and well - permissible tissues rich in polysaccharides, proteins styled flowers have small stigmata with underdeveloped nodules and, due to worse absorption, they are not pollinated and do not set fruits. Taking into account the complexity of many factors that make difficult or impossible to self-pollinate the eggplant's flowers, the effi- ciency of three procedures intensifying the fruit budding has been presented: bunch vi- brating, flower harmonization, and natural pollinating by bumblebees. Many authors' studies confirm that flower bunch vibrating has not caused sufficient pollen setting on stomata and has not been sufficient for good eggplant flower pollination. Applying growth regulators appears to be more efficient and significantly affects the improvement of eggplant's yielding. The highest efficiency has been achieved when applying insects as natural pollinators at cultivating the eggplant under covers.",

The experiment was carried out at the Wilanow Research Farm, situated in the postglacial val- ley of the Vistula River, on a fertile silty loam alluvial soil. The soil of the field assigned for the experiment was at the depth of 0-20 cm, slightly acid (pHKCl = 6.0), showed high available Mg (16.6 mg%) and P (6.6 mg%) contents, medium available K (19.6 mg%) and a low K/Mg ratio (1.2). Considering a low ratio of K to the other kations as well as occa- sionally appearing K deficiency symptoms in the neighbouring orchard, before tree plant- ing potassium salts were applied at the rate of 200 kg K2O ha -1 . Throughout all the years of studies potassium, magnesium and phosphorus fertilizers as well as liming soil were not ap- plied. 'Jonagored' apple trees on M.9 rootstock were planted in spring 2000, spaced 3.5 × 1.5 m. From spring 2000, five fertiliser treatments were applied: (1) N-0 (check); (2) N-50 (50 kg N ha -1 ), over the whole orchard area in early spring); (3) N-100 (100 kg N ha -1 , over the whole area, in early spring); (4) N-100delayed (100 kg N ha -1 , in early spring, starting from the fourth year after planting 2004); (5) N-100sward (100 kg N ha -1 , in early spring, starting from the fourth year after planting, in sward alleyways only). Nitrogen was applied as ammonium ni- trate, before the start of vegetative growth. After 10 years, the higher dose, i.e. 100 kg N ha -1 applied from the first year after planting resulted in the smallest trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA), during when the same dose starting from the fourth year after planting resulted in the highest TCSA. N fertilization did not significance effect on growth of the trees as com- pared with not fertilized control. The first yield was harvested in the 3 rd year after planting (2002), but in any year neither dose or mode of N fertilisation had any significant effect of yield. The cumulative yield for the years 2002-2009 and fruit size did not depend on N fer- tilization either. No significant response to nitrogen fertilization was noted on cropping effi- ciency coefficient for eight years of bearing in relation to the final trunk cross-sectional area.",

The effect of three-year monocultures of my- corrhizal (Hypericum perforatum, Levisticum officinale, Mentha × citrata subsp. citrata and Thymus vulgaris) and non-mycorrhizal (Chelidonium majus) medicinal plant species on AMF propagule abundance, species richness and composition was therefore examined. The AMF non-host plant species C. majus decreased the abundance of AMF propagules in the soil, whereas the mycorrhizal plants maintained the AMF propagule potential at the same level, however, they changed the composition of AMF species. The results showed that the choice of medicinal plant species, grown even for a relatively short period of time in a monoculture, can substantially alter the AMF potential of soils which in turn can in- fluence the performance of other medicinal plants cultivated subsequently.",

    "abstract": "The CIELab colour system is used to evaluate food colours. Its advantage is that the base skin colour of bicoloured apples can be measured on the same fruit before and on the optimum harvest date. Additionally, it makes it possible to take many meas- urements within a short time. The changes of skin colour (yellowing) are caused by chlo- rophyll degradation. During fruit development and maturation chlorophyll breakdown is observed, which results in decreasing intensity of green coloration. The aim of the five- year study was to evaluate a fast and non-destructive method of determining the optimum harvest date of apples intended for long storage based on changes observed in the base skin colour. Apples of 'Ligol' and 'Jonagored' cultivars were collected every 4-5 days starting some weeks before the estimated OHD. On the last four or five sampling dates in all years of the study, apples were collected for cold storage. The storability of apples was evaluated after the same number of days of storage respectively to their harvest date. Storage efficiency was evaluated based on judgment that involved sensoric tests and checking of the incidence of diseases and disorders in apples, as well as on measurement of fruit mass loss and internal qualities (firmness, TSS, TA). From among the evaluated colour indicators L*, a*, b*, Hueab angle and chroma, changes in the base colour were best illustrated by the a* coordinate value and the Hueab angle value. Based on the evalua- tion of the quality of apples after storage, it can be stated that the apples had the best qual- ity when the a* coordinate during harvest ranged between -13.5 and -15.5 for 'Ligol' and between -4.9 and -5.7 for 'Jonagored'. The Hueab angle assumed a value between 107 and 109 for 'Ligol' and between 98 and 99 for 'Jonagored' during the optimum harvest date. Therefore, the a* coordinate and the Hueab angle can be used as indicators of harvest ma- turity.",

    "abstract": "Growth and yield of herbal plants are closely connected with meteorological conditions and agrotechnical procedures. We undertook studies on determining the effect of tarragon planting density upon fresh and dry herb yield, as well as the contents of nutri- tious and physiologically active substances: L-ascorbic acids, chlorophylls, carotenoids, tannins and flavonoids, as well as the contents, yield and chemical composition of essen- tial oil. Significant effect of estragon planting density was demonstrated upon fresh and air-dry herb yield, grated herb yield and essential oil yield. Tarragon plants growing in higher density (40 × 40 cm) had higher yield of fresh, dry and de-stalked herb, as well as higher oil yield than the plants growing less densely (50 × 50 cm). The biological value of analyzed plant material was high and depended upon planting density to a really insignifi- cant extent. Plants growing more densely had significantly higher concentration of carote- noids and significantly lower contents of essential oil compared to the remaining ones. The essential oil of Artemisia dracunculus L. was characterized by the presence of 46 compounds of the share >0.05% and 23 compounds occurring in trace amounts. The predominant compound in the examined tarragon oil was methyl eugenol, which occurred in larger quantity in the year 2012 (37.56%), than in 2011 (34.33%). Other main com- pounds were: elemicin, determined in the amount of 21.95 and 26.22%; sabinene, in the amount of 14.16 and 16.37%, as well as E-asarone, in the concentrations of 8.68 and 3.49% (respectively: in 2011 and 2012). A. dracunculus presented in the foregoing studies can be defined as a methyl eugenol-elemicin/sabinene chemotype (respectively: 36, 24 and 15%).",

During conversion to organic orchard trees’ growth, fruit yield, their quality indices as well as nutritional status of leaf and fruit was ascertained. Fruit polyphenol content and their free radical scavenging activity were assessed. Moreover, the mycorrhizal root parameters (mycorrhizal and arbuscules frequency) were also presented. The most vigorous trees were inoculated with liquid inocula MicoPlant M and MicoPlant S. The plants treated with MicoPlant S gave the highest total yield (12.12 kg/tree) and revealed the best productivity (> 1 kg cm) as well as the average fruit weight. The liquid suspended inocula were more effective than granular one in terms of mycorrhizal root colonisation. Investigated biofertilizers increased P, K and Cu content of leaf. Organic soil extract (HumiPlant) decreased P and K content of fruit, while seaweed extracts (AlgaminoPlant) increased Ca amount of fruit. These treatments had the lowest K:Ca ratio. Used biofertilizers influenced apples polyphenol content as well as their antioxidant status.",

The LEDs emitting white (12W), red (12R) and red-blue (R/B) radiation from lamps of different ratio of red diodes (R) towards the blue ones (B) (9R+3B; 10R+2B; 11R+1B) was used. The results showed that the lowest yield was found in plants grown under LED (12W), and the highest one under FL (W) light. The mass and leaf area of plants illuminated by FL (W) and LED (12R) were similar. The increase of radiation R and decrease of B caused an increase in biomass, leaf area (LA), and specific leaf area (SLA) decrease of chlorophyll concentrations in leaves. Leaves of plants cultivated under LED (R/B) had the higher stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration parameters than under other treatments. The lowest value of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (Fo, Fm, Fv/Fm) were noted under the LED (12R) lighting. However, taking into account the energy consumption by the using light sources, the plant yielding, and other determined parameters, the most beneficial for lettuce production seems to be LED (11R + 1B) light.

    "abstract": "Amaranth is one of the oldest arable crop in the world. It was brought to Europe around the 17th century, but as an ornamental plant. It was not until the 1970s, after thorough examination of the chemical composition of amaranth seeds, that in effect of which the nutritional value of this plant was rediscovered and recognized. Since then, there has been increased interest in amaranth as a ‘plant with a future’. A great deal of scientific research has been carried out, leading to recognition of its nutritional, ecological, agricultural and health-promoting values (especially for the prevention and treatment of diseases of the cardiovascular, nervous and digestive systems). Among cultivated amaranths species Amaranthus caudatus, Amaranthus cruentus and Amaranthus hypochondriacus have the highest nutritional value. However, differences in the nutrient content are also noticeable between these species. One of the attributes of this plant is the high content of highly digestible complete protein and the presence of all essential amino acids in the seeds. The seeds also contain large amounts of gluten-free starch with a small grain diameter, fibre, vitamins and minerals. Furthermore, they have a high fat content compared to cereal grains. Amaranth oil consists mainly of unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and linolenic). Some of the unsaturated fatty acids, such as linolenic acid, are exogenous fatty acids, essential for the human body. Valuable components of the fatty acid fraction include squalene, tocopherols and tocotrienols. These compounds are particularly valuable due to their antioxidant properties.",

    "abstract": "Silicon (Si) is one of the best plant defense elements against the biotic and abiotic stresses. Camelina plants accumulate Si which serves in protection against drought stress. The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of different doses of foliage applied Si (0, 3, 6 and 9 mM) under water stress (40% field capacity, FC) and non-stress conditions (100% FC) on camelina genotypes (Canadian and Australian). The imposed drought drastically decreased the growth parameters like root-shoot length and plant fresh and dry weight and also had negative impact on the chlorophyll content along with water relation attributes (water potential, osmotic potential and turgor pressure). In contrast, total free amino acids, total soluble proteins, proline and antioxidants such as ascorbic peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) were enhanced especially in water stressed Canadian genotype, while osmoprotectants (flavonoids, anthocyanins and glycinebetaine) and phenolics contents were decreased. On the other hand, the foliar application of Si was instrumental in enhancing the growth of camelina by increasing the chlorophyll contents and water relation of stressed and non-stressed plants. Similarly, the biochemical, osmoprotectants and antioxidant metabolism was also improved in camelina stressed plants through the application of foliar Si. In conclusion, foliar application of 6 mM Si at vegetative growth stage played a vital role in alleviating the drastic impact of water stress on camelina growth by improving the water status, chlorophyll content, accumulation of phenolics and osmoprotectants and activating antioxidants. Therefore, the foliar application of Si could be developed as an important biologically viable strategy for boosting the tolerance in camelina plants to water stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "The examinations were aimed at determining the dependence between form and rate of applied nitrogen fertilizer vs. yield and chemical composition of leaves of Swiss chard cultivated in greenhouse in spring. Nitrogen was applied in a form of urea, potas- sium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate at three amounts: 0.2; 0.4; 0.6 g N·dm -3 of substrate. Following items were assessed: yield, nutrients contents, as well as chemical analyses of substrate after plant harvest were made. Increase of nitrogen rate in objects with potas- sium nitrate and ammonium nitrate resulted in the decrease of fresh matter yield, while in objects with urea, the yield remained at constant level. The highest yield of above ground parts (356 g·plant -1 ) was achieved by fertilizing the plants with the lowest nitrogen rate (as ammonium nitrate). Contents of nitrates in leaf dry matter was within the range of 0.59-1.27% depending on nitrogen rate and form. The highest nitrate levels were found when potassium nitrate was applied as fertilizer, whereas the lowest - when applying ammonium nitrate; however, regardless the fertilizer type, higher rates caused the increase of nitrate contents. Studies revealed that at increasing nitrogen concentration in a sub- strate, level of vitamin C also increased. Contents of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg in Swiss chard's leaves depended on nitrogen fertilizer type. Comparison of studied factors influence on potassium concentration in plants indicated that increasing nitrogen rates in objects with urea and ammonium nitrate was accompanied by the decrease of this element content. An inverse dependence was recorded in objects with potassium nitrate, where content of po- tassium in Swiss chard's leaves increased along with the nitrogen level increase. Applica- tion of 0.2 g N· dm -3 substrate appeared to be the most profitable in spring cultivation of Swiss chard, because the largest yields of fresh matter and the lowest share of nitrates in dry matter of studied plant were found.",

The lowest density favored the plant tillering, which apparently affected the herb yield. Plants growing at the lowest density (40 × 40 cm spacing) had the largest fresh and air-dried herb yields (0.71 and 0.18 kg m -2 , respectively). Herb of plants grown at denser spacing contained more total nitrogen and nitrates (V) as well as less po- tassium, than that of plants grown at lower density. The herb harvest at full flowering stage turned out to be favourable because of significantly lover nitrates concentration as compared to other stages. The contents of essential oil was significantly higher in the full flowering stage than in those harvested in the bud formation stage. Plants growing at denser spacing produced more oil.

    "abstract": "Effects of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) treatments on chlorophyll (Chl) degradation and postharvest quality of two lime ('Persian lime' and 'Tahiti') cultivars during chilling-induced storage were studied in this work. EBR at 0, 2.5, 5 and 10 µM were applied to fruit by vacuum infiltration at 30.63 kPa for 7 min and afterward stored at 4°C for 60 days. Postharvest EBR application effectively maintained greater fruit firmness and lessened weight loss during cold storage. The results displayed that EBR treatments efficiently delayed the reduction of the Chl a contents and hue values. EBR treatments significantly increased ascorbic acid content, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity, and titratable acidity (TA). On the other hand, the treatments reduced soluble solids concentration (SSC), pH, and SSC/TA ratios during cold storage. Overall, EBR application by vacuum infiltration could be an effective and simple method for maintaining postharvest quality of limes during cold storage.",

    "abstract": "The type of the applied nitrogen fertiliser plays a significant role in plant nutri- tion. Supplying plants with potassium in the form of chloride, sulphate or salpetre signifi- cantly modifies the chemical composition of plants, as anions accompanying potassium serve different functions. The vegetation experiment on the cultivation of red pepper cv. 'Cyklon' was conducted in 2005 and 2006 in a plastic tunnel in rings (V = 5 dm 3 ) filled with mineral soil and highmoor peat (3:2). The response of plants to three potassium salts KCl, K2SO4 and KNO3 was determined at two levels of nitrogen-potassium fertilization of 250 mg N and NH4NO3 and 300 mg K, as well as 350 mg N and 400 mg K·dm -3 substrate, at constant levels of the other macro- and microelements. Biometric measurements of plants were taken and the volume of fruit yield was determined. It was found that the type of potassium fertilizer at the two levels of nitrogen and potassium fertilization did not have a significant effect on total and marketable yields of fruits in red pepper cv. 'Cyk- lon', plant height, total and marketable fruit numbers as well as fresh weight of a single fruit. It was shown that a higher level of nitrogen and potassium fertilization (350 N and 400 K mg dm -3 substrate) had a positive effect on the analyzed biometric parameters of fruits, except for fresh weight of a single fruit. Results of these investigations, confirmed by other authors, critically refer to the division of vegetable crops developed by Th. Geissler and Buchner into chloride- and sulfate-loving vegetable crops.",

    "abstract": "Roseroot, Rhodiola rosea L. has been used in the traditional Asian, Scandina- vian and Eastern European medicine for centuries as remedies for improvement of physi- cal condition, treatment of anemia, depression, asthenia, impotence, gastro-intestinal and nervous system disorders and also as a immunostimulant and anti-inflammatory agent. This valuable plant grows naturally in Himalayas, Altai, Alps and the Carpatian moun- tains. Roseroot raw material contains phenylethanoids (salidroside and p-tyrosol) and cin- namic glycosides known as phenylpropanoids (rosin, rosavin and rosarin), that are considered the most important active substances identified in raw material. The objective of this experiment was to compare the content of phenolic compounds (salidroside, p-tyrosol) and cinnamic glycosides (rosarin, rosavin and rosin) determined by HPLC method, from particular morphological parts (roots, rhizomes, and for the first time - tips and above ground parts) of the raw material of R. rosea cultivated in Poland through seven following vegetation periods. In this study we found that significantly yearly in- creases in total phenylethanoids and phenylpropanoids concentrations occur with R. rosea grown in Poland. Rhizomes were characterized by highest amount of phenylpropanoids and phenylethanoids studied, in comparison to the other morphological parts of plants at the same age, whereas a certain amount of active substances were also found in the stems and leaves of Rhodiola rosea (on an average as twice as lower than in the under ground parts of plants). Thus, above ground parts of roseroot could be a potential source of phenylethanoids and phenylpropanoids for pharmacy. Roseroot harvested after only 3 year of vegetation contained significantly lower amounts of phenylethanoids and phenylpropanoids in under ground parts of plants than harvested after 4, 5 or 6 year. Since these phenolics and glycosides are the major active constituents of Rhodiola rosea, this change to an earlier harvest (before fourth or in appropriate cases in third year) may have an effect on the quality of the harvested raw material.",

This study presents antioxidant activities of water and methanol extracts of in vitro propagated C. demersum. Shoot tip explants of C. demersum for in vitro plant regeneration were cultured on liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.25–1.25 mg/L 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 0.10 mg/L Thidiazuron (TDZ) combinations for eight weeks. Maximum number of plantlets per explant (110.67) was obtained on MS medium supplemented with 0.75 mg/L BAP + 0.10 mg/L TDZ. In order to determine antioxidant activities of C. demersum, antioxidant contents (β-carotene, flavonoid, lycopene and total phenols), metal chelating and reducing power capacities of methanol and water extracts obtained from C. demersum were investigated. It was detected that water extract was more effective in all activities. Total phenols (76.55 μg/mg) in water extract were measured as the highest antioxidant component. Based on the water extracts data, as IC50 value for chelating on ferrous ions was 9.24 mg/mL, EC50 value for reducing power activity was 8.23 mg/mL. It was also determined that the metal chelating and reducing power activities of the both extracts are increased depending on the concentration. Therefore, all these data suggest that both tested extracts of in vitro propagated C. demersum would exert beneficial effects by virtue of their antioxidant properties and may be utilized as a promising source of therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Blue honeysuckle due to the high health benefits of its fruit, early ripening (be- fore the first strawberries cultivars) and high frost resistance of both plants and flowers has gained the great popularity both in cultivation and breeding. The implementation of the breeding program of new cultivars requires the knowledge of the characteristics that determine its direction in the selected material. Therefore, in this study the evaluation of the phenological phases, yield, fruit weight, number of seeds per fruit and pollen viability in the cultivars and breeding clones of this species was made. The tested cultivars and clones had different levels of the analysed qualities except the pollen viability which was high but did not differ significantly within the genotypes. The evaluation of such charac- teristics as yield potential and fruit weight indicates that cultivars 'Warszawa', 'Wojtek' and T2 clone which had higher values of these characteristics as compared to other geno- types are possible to be used in breeding programme. Obtainment of the forms with early fruit ripening can be realised through the use of the selected Russian cultivars. The objec- tive of this study was also to characterise the blue honeysuckle germplasms using RAPD markers and to assess their genetic similarity. The analysed primers produced 61 frag- ments out of which 57 (93.44%) were polymorphic. The genetic similarity matrix was made on the basis of RAPD markers. The mean genetic similarity was calculated at 0.56. The presented study confirms that the use of RAPD markers is a practical and effective method to evaluate the genetic similarity of blue honeysuckle genotypes and to establish genetic relationships between these genotypes.",

Genetic diversity of 139 different Ficus carica L. genotypes collected from Italy and Croatia, and divided into two subgroups: uniferous (only main crop) and biferous (breba and main crop), was investigated using 49 microsatellite markers. A total of 70 alleles were generated, of which 64 (91.4%) showed a polymorphic pattern indicating high level of genetic diversity within the studied collection. The mean heterozygosity over the 64 single locus microsatellites was 0.33 and the expected and observed averaged variance were 16.50 and 184.08, respectively. The 139 fig genotypes formed two clusters in the PCoA analysis, suggesting a division between Italian and Croatian genotypes. Moreover, the fig accessions could be divided into two main clusters based on the STRUCTURE analysis according to the biological type, uniferous or biferous, with partly overlapping varieties. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that molecular markers were able to discriminate among genotypes and useful for the authentication of fig tree varieties (homonymies and synonymies).",

    "abstract": "Tuberose (Polianthes tuberosa L.) is an ornamental bulbous plant and a famous cut flower in tropical and subtropical regions. Post-harvest senescence of the cut flowers is the main factor limiting the marketability of most of these species including tuberose. From the perspective of metabolic changes, senescence happens as the result of oxidative processes induced by active oxygen species production. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and salicylic acid (SA) are compounds with some functions in the post-harvest physiology of some plants. The present study focused on the effect of GABA and SA on vase life and some post-harvest traits of cut tuberose flowers. The plants were sprayed with GABA (5, 10, or 15 mg L–1) and SA (50, 100, or 150 mg L–1) at three stages during growth and before harvest in a greenhouse (30, 45, and 60 days after the planting of the bulbs) and were observed after harvest until senescence. Results showed that GABA and SA positively affected the vase life, water uptake, fresh weight, ion leakage, total dissolved solids, chlorophyll, protein, and catalase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase enzymatic activity. They postponed senescence. The highest and lowest vase lives were observed in plants treated with 10 mg L–1 GABA (11 days) and control (distilled water) (7 days), respectively. It was found that the treatment of tuberose with GABA and SA during growth can improve its post-harvest quality. However, it is recommended to conduct further studies on them.",

The mycelium growth of the selected fungi was significantly inhibited by peppermint EO. Light and electron microscopy studies showed that mycelium morphology was seriously changed after treatment with peppermint essential oil. The level of malondialdehyde illustrated that peppermint EO led to lipid peroxidation in the fungal pathogens.

However, Tytanit treatment increased soluble solids content in fruits and reduced in Polka cv. nitrates concentration. Among tested cul- tivars, cv. Polka was characterized by the highest yield, that was of c. a. 50% greater that of cv. Pokusa, which was characterized by the gratest fruits sizes. The 'Poranna Rosa' shawed the least soluble solids and vitamin C content and had the highest acidity.",

At time of full fruiting, leaves of toma- toes grown on plots covered with mulch contained more nitrogen, phosphorus and potas- sium and content of calcium and magnesium did not depend of cultivation method. Method of cultivation did not affect root-taking of potted tomato transplants but then to- matoes grown on plots covered with living mulch were dominated by hairy vetch and grew much slower till third decade of July when majority of vetch plants decayed. Growth of tomatoes in vetch mulch was much more differentiated during whole vegetation period. Living and then dry vetch mulch covered soil surface almost entirely and suppressed an- nual weeds well. Average decade temperature at 5 cm and 10 cm depth of conventionally cultivated soil was usually higher and soil moisture in 0-40 cm layer was significantly lower than those of soil covered with mulch. Cultivation method did not affect soil total porosity nor bulk density. At time of tomato planting, fresh and air-dry weight of hairy vetch was 39.7 t·ha -1 and 6.5 t·ha -1 on an average respectively and it contained 180 kg N, 43 kg P, 209 kg K, 51 kg Ca and 12 kg Mg.

The structure of fungal communities colonizing the stems of milk thistle was analyzed at the laboratory. Achene yield was determined after harvest. The composition of fungal communities colonizing the stems of milk thistle was affected by weather conditions, and macronutrient and B fertilization. Potential pathogens had a 50-80% share of the fungal community. The predominant species was Alternaria alternata, fungi of the genus Fusarium were identified less frequently (six species), while Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea and Phoma spp. were encountered only sporadically. The abundance of A. alternata was lower in treatments without N fertilization and with N fertilization at 40 kg P · ha -1 . In contrast to A. alternata, fungi of the genus Fusarium were less abundant in treatments with Mg and Mg+B fertilization. The yield of milk thistle achenes increased in response to increasing rates of nitrogen fertilization.",

The raw material of this species is herb characterised by diuretic, detoxifying, anti-inflammatory, and bile se- cretion enhancing properties. Pharmacological activity of European goldenrod results from the presence of many biologically active compounds, among which phenolic com- pounds are considered to be most valuable. In this work differences in accumulation of flavonoids and polyphenolic acids in the herb of European goldenrod from natural sites in central and eastern Poland were determined. Flavonoid content ranged from 600 to 1850 mg�� 100 g -1 , and polyphenolic acids from 440 to 1200 mg�� 100 g -1 . High content of these compounds was characteristic for the herb collected at the vegetative stage of plant development (in June). Chromatographic analysis (HPLC) showed the presence of three flavonoid compounds (hyperoside, rutin, and astragalin) and two polyphenolic acids (rosmarinic and chlorogenic) in all studied populations. Rutin was the main compound in the flavonoid fraction. Its content ranged from 87.78 to 387.87 mg�� 100 g -1 . The content of rosmarinic acid was higher than the content of chlorogenic acid (mean value: 577.52 and 267.03 mg�� 100 g -1 , respectively).",

In the period 2009-2011, a field experiment was conducted on the effect of growth stimu- lators and cover crops on the structure of carrot root yield (in the cultivar 'Laguna F1') and accumulation of chemical components in the storage root. The study included three growth stimulators: Asahi SL, Bio-algeen S 90, and Tytanit. Plots without foliar applica- tion of these biological agents were the control treatment. The other factor investigated in the experiment was the stubble crops to be ploughed under: tansy phacelia as well as a mixture of spring vetch and field pea. Stubble crops were grown after spring barley. To- tal carrot root yield and its fractions (marketable yield, yield of small roots, unmarketable yield) as well as some components determining root quality (the content of dry matter, ca- rotenoids, L-ascorbic acid, and total sugars) were all determined. The present study has proved that all growth stimulators had a positive effect on the quantitative and qualitative parameters of carrot roots. The absence of application of growth stimulators was mini- mally more beneficial only in the case of total carotenoid content in carrot roots. Stubble crops, in particular the mixture of legumes, also positively affected productivity and qual- ity of carrot roots.",

The aim of the study was to estimate the potential for the production of larger numbers of uniform, well-rooted sweet potato plants by means of in vitro culturing. The study covered two cultivars - ' Carmen Rubin' and 'White Triumph'. The node ex- plants were placed on two growth media containing the basic components of the MS me- dium as well as growth regulators. The first medium was supplemented with 1 mg dm -3 gib- berellin and 0.1 mg dm -3 kinetin, while the second one - with 0.5 mg dm -3 IAA. The in- duction of organogenesis and regeneration of the plants took place on the same medium, with no passage. Within 9 weeks, 4 plants were produced from each primary explants in two multiplication cycles. The properties of the plantlets depended on the cultivar, weight of the explants and composition of the medium. The average weight of the 'Carmen Rubin' plants was higher than that of the 'White Triumph' ones. Moreover, the 'Carmen Rubin' plants produced longer shoots and more developed root systems. The sweet potato micro-plants displayed an ability to acclimatize quickly.",

Morphometric observations and analysis of pollen grains were performed using light and electron scanning microscopy. In terms of size, the pollen grains studied were classified as medium sized and large. Their shape was determined to be prolate, subprolate, or prolate spheroidal. The striae in the exine of P. armeniaca run parallel and can be branched or curved. The sculpture of P. persica grains shows elongated extending paralel regular and irregular striae, dichotomously branched. Regularly arranged, or at places branched, striae are found in the exine of P. avium pollen grains. The ornamentation of P. cerasus grains is composed of elongated striae, sometimes slightly curved or with a tendency to intertwine. The exine of P. domestica grains is characterized by forked, arched striae. The stria thickness differs significantly between cultivars within the species, while the groove width differs only between some species and cultivars. The obtained results on the exine sculpture of pollen grains can be used in the taxonomy of species of the genus Prunus.",

For all cultivars tested, the best regrowth of cryopreserved shot tips was recorded with 0.25 M sucrose concentration and 10 µM ABA during a two-week preculture, followed by a 4- or 7-day osmotic dehydration. The survival rate ranged from 56.8–58.0% (the Lady group) to 63.6% ('Richmond'). However, the ability to grow was smaller and reached 18.2–50.7%. It was found that higher sucrose concentration during the preculture slowed the growth of chrysanthemum shoot tips and led to an increased formation of multiple shoots (by activating axillary buds) or deformed adventitious shoots (incapable of further growth). The frequency of tissue hyperhydricity also increased, while the rhizogenesis efficiency decreased when higher sucrose concentration in the preculture medium was applied. The influence of osmotic dehydration duration on the explants morphogenetic response was cultivar-dependent",

The present study examined the role of two seed priming molecules, salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), to enhance the salt tolerance in lentil seeds at germination stage. Salt stress caused significant decrease in germination percentage and primary root elongation. This decrease was associated with significant increase in lipid peroxidation and total lipid (TL) contents in embryonic axis. The catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxydase (GPOX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities remained unchanged or decreased significantly under the influence of salt stress, in both embryonic axis and cotyledons. Starch mobilization was not affected by salt stress. The two priming treatments effectively alleviated the negative effects of salt stress. SA and H2O2 applications after dose optimization resulted in significant enhancement of germination percentage and primary root elongation. No significant changes in starch, soluble sugars contents and SOD activity were detected following SA and H2O2 treatments. Seed priming treatments triggered the activities of GPOX and CAT and caused the reduction of lipid peroxidation especially in embryonic axis. TL content and especially the fatty acid C18:3 increased after SA applications. The better performance under salt stress of primed lentil seeds was associated with lower lipid peroxidation, and activation of enzymatic antioxidative defense system. Obtained results confirm the potential for using SA and H2O2 to improve germination and plant growth under salt stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "Chamomile is a valued medicinal plant of high economic importance and there- fore agronomic practices in growing this plant are continually improved. One of methods to improve the quantitative and qualitative parameters of herbal raw material can be the application of foliar sprays (growth stimulators, foliar fertilizers, Effective Microorgan- isms). Row spacing, which has an effect on the use of fertilizers by the plant and natural habitat conditions, is of great importance in chamomile growing practices. During the pe- riod 2011-2013, a field experiment was conducted, the aim of which was to determine the effects of selected foliar-applied sprays and different row spacings on the yield and qual- ity of chamomile cv. 'Z· oty ‡ an' raw material. The study included three formulations: Asahi SL, Ekolist P, and EM Farming. Plots without the application of these foliar sprays were the control treatment. The other factor included in the experiment was row spacing, which was as follows: 25, 35, and 45 cm. Plant height and number of inflorescences per stem, total yield of raw material and the content of essential oil and flavonoids in raw ma- terial were determined. The growth stimulator Asahi SL was proven to positively affect the yield and quality of chamomile raw material. Ekolist P had a lower effect on the im- provement in the parameters analyzed. The reports of some authors that Effective Micro- organisms (EM Farming) had no effect whatsoever on plant productivity were confirmed in this study. It was shown that growing chamomile in rows 45 cm apart, or at a row spac- ing of 35 cm, was most beneficial for the yield and quality of chamomile raw material. A narrow row spacing (25 cm) contributed to a decrease in yield and deterioration in its quality.",

Salt-stressed plants given a foliar application of SA showed alleviation of the negative effects of salinity, resulting in higher growth performance (increases of 6%–198%). The positive impacts of SA were especially noticeable as an increase in the content of photosynthetic pigments, such as total chlorophyll (31–72%) and total carotenoids (49–141%). Application of SA also helped to reduce membrane damage, as seen by significantly lower levels of MDA (31–70%) in the leaves of salt-stressed lettuce plants. Moreover, the use of SA enhanced overall flavonoid and phenolic content, as well as nutrient absorption. SA treatment also increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase, resulting in a considerable reduction in salt-induced oxidative damage. The most efficient SA application concentration was 0.50 mM. Overall, the use of SA as a foliar spray could be recommended as a long-term strategy for improving the defense systems of salt-stressed lettuce.",

Moreover, the relationship between CWSI, physiological parameters, and seed yield of the pumpkin was investigated. The mean CWSI values in the I70 (0.40) and I35 (0.56) treatments were 42% and 100% higher, respectively than those in the full irrigation (I100) treatment (0.28). While the I70 treatment showed manageable water stress with minimal impact, the I35 treatment experienced severe stress, significantly reducing crop growth and yield. The mean seed yield (SY) in the I70 treatment increased to 1245.2 kg ha–1 compared to I35 (903.3 kg ha–1) but remained lower than I100 (1339.3 kg ha–1). The CWSI had negative correlations (p ≤ 0.01) with seed yield, chlorophyll content, and leaf area index, while it had positive correlations with water use efficiency and irrigation water use efficiency (p ≤ 0.01). This study showed that pumpkins could be grown successfully at 30% water deficit conditions, and a water deficit higher than 30% may cause a significant seed yield loss in semi-arid climate conditions. In addition, the results highlight the importance of optimal irrigation and CWSI monitoring for informed irrigation decisions and sustainable agricultural practices. Therefore, moderate water deficit (I70) can be adopted in pumpkin cultivation as an alternative to full irrigation.",

    "abstract": "Plants of the genus Kalanchoe are the most frequently purchased potted plants because of their decorative qualities and easy cultivation. Modern commercial plants have unique shapes that are usually not genetically determined; hence, in vitro cultures are used to propagate such specimens. The efficiency of regeneration is significantly affected by the type of explant used when that explant was previously located on one of several parts of a complex plant organ. The study aimed to investigate the influence of the topophysical location of collected explants on the regeneration efficiency of adventitious shoots. Various regeneration pathways were observed in the in vitro micropropagation of Kalanchoe daigremontiana leaf fragments, i.e., direct and indirect organogenesis from the callus stage. The results show a dependent relationship between the location of the collected explant and its regenerative potential. The most remarkable regenerative capacity of K. daigremontiana was found in leaf blade fragments taken from the middle and proximal zones. In addition, the explants collected from the marginal zone of the leaf blade were notably more valuable than those from the part located near the midrib. The research results indicate that the growth and development of new seedlings propagated vegetatively with the in vitro method depends on their location on the mother plant.",

Field ex- periment conducted in the years 2007-2009 in Department of Horticulture at Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences involved research on the effect of different nitrogen doses on yield, chemical composition and antioxidant activity of red cabbage. Nitrogen, in the form of ammonium saltpeter, was introduced in the following doses: 50 kg N·ha -1 ; 150 kg N·ha -1 and 250 (150+100) kg N·ha -1 . In the third decade of April red cabbage seeds of 'Langendijker' cv. were sown into multipots. The seedlings were planted on 5 m 2 - area plots at the end of May. Harvesting took place in the second week of September, when there was assessed marketable and total yield. In samples of red cab- bage heads there were estimated the content of nitrates, vitamin C, total and reducing sug- ars, polyphenols, anthocyanins, as well as dry matter and soluble solids. In order to inves- tigate antioxidant activity there were applied DPPH and ABTS tests. In experiment opti- mum nitrogen dose for red cabbage was 150 kg N·ha -1 . The highest amount of antho- cyanins were determined in the leaves of red cabbage fertilized with moderate N dose up 150 kg N·ha -1 . The highest antioxidant activity proved to characterize edible parts of red cabbage fertilized with nitrogen in the dose of 50 kg N·ha -1 , while the level of total poly- phenols featured the lowest values in the conditions of intensive nitrogen fertilization amounting 250 kg N·ha -1 .",

    "abstract": "Astrophytum asterias (Zucc.) Lem. is a cactus which is among those most desired by producers and collectors all across the world and, at the same time, a species threatened with extinction in the natural environment. Micropropagation techniques can be helpful both in terms of its ex situ protection and its popularisation on the market, thus satisfying the needs of cacti breeders and collectors. Somatic embryogenesis is the most effective method of multiplication and it involves the formation of somatic embryos from vegetative cells. The medium, light conditions and type of explant demonstrate the key effect on its efficiency. Auxin 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is most frequently applied to embryogenesis induction. In the present study we determined the effect of its concentration and light conditions on the efficiency of Astrophytum asterias somatic embryogenesis. Seeds were placed on the modified MS medium with a reduced content of macronutrients and sucrose 1⁄2MS (pH 5.7 – before autoclaving). All the in vitro cultures were incubated in the growth room (24 ± 2°C, 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod, the intensity of quantum irradiation: 24.3 μmol·m·s). After 14 days 70% of the seeds were produced of seedlings. To regenerate somatic embryos, halves of green seedlings were placed on the modified MS medium with auxin 2,4-D added at different concentrations: 5; 7 and 10 mg·dm, the MS0 medium without growth regulators was our control. To verify the effect of light conditions, half of explants were incubated in the light, and half in the dark. After 10 weeks of culture, the regenerated embryos were isolated, counted and measured. They were produced on all the media types, in both light conditions. The present research confirmed a positive effect of 2,4-D and light on the number of explants forming embryoid structures and on the number of regenerating embryos. The most number of embryos per 1 explant (1.8) were obtained on the MS7 medium (7 mg·dm 2,4-D) in the light conditions.",

It is moderately cold climate plant, well yielding in climatic conditions of our country, with proper selection of varieties and soil. A pot experiment carried out in two one-year series (2001 and 2002 year) examined the effect of various concentrations of Tytanit applied once and twice against NPK fertilization, in comparison to the control object and with mineral fertilization applied (NPK), on the yield of the total biomass, petioles and blades of celery, as well as the content of titanium, iron, manganese and copper. Those elements fulfil a primary role in the process of photosynthesis and (according to literature data) titanium also plays an important function in this process. It was found that foliar fertilization with Tytanit had a favourable effect on increasing the test plant yield. The highest yield of celery biomass was obtained after applying the highest dose of Tytanit. The frequency of spraying resulted in slight changes in the yielding of the test plant. A higher average bioaccumulation of titanium, iron and manganese was observed in blades than in petioles, in series I and II of the study. The highest concentration of Tytanit applied once and twice resulted in a decreasing bioaccumulation of Fe and Mn in the examined parts of celery, in series I and II of the study. The highest amounts of Cu were observed on the control object fertilized with NPK and under the influence of Tytanit application in the lowest concentrations. The average uptake of Ti and Mn with the yield of blades was twice as high as the yield of petioles, while in the case of Fe and Cu, it was higher with the yield of petioles than of blades.",

The isolates, which are prepared by procedures involving the use of elevated temperature and/or organic solvents or other chemicals are expected to have considerably less or no such potentially harmful burden. Four sweet marjoram (Ori- ganum majorana L.) fractions obtained by steam distillation, Soxhlet n-hexane extraction, extraction with aqueous ethanol, and with ethanolic ammonia solution were evaluated in vitro for activity against twenty Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial strains, six Candida sp. yeast strains and a single protozoan species Pentatrichomonas hominis. The n-hexane extract showed the highest antibacterial activity and inhibited growth of eight out of nine Staphylococcus aureus strains used. The other bacteria showed no substantial susceptibility to the extracts, except that Acinetobacter baumannii showed some inhibi- tion by the aqueous ethanol extract. The isolates were also active against three out of six Candida sp. strains used, and the ethanolic ammonia extract reduced the number of viable P. hominis trophozoites by 50% at 160 µg·ml -1 concentration in 24 h cultures; the remain- ing extracts were considerably less or but marginally effective. These data warrant further study on identifying the components of the extracts with the highest activities.",

Mineral N content in the soil before seeds sowing was raised up to the level of: 50, 100 and 150 mg N·dm -3 by using: ammonium nitrate 34% N - (NH4NO3), calcium nitrate 15.5% N - (Ca(NO3)2·H2O), ammonium sulphate 20.0% N - ((NH4)2SO4), and ENTEC 26% N - (NH4NO3+(NH4)2SO4 + 0.8% DNPP). The highest marketable yield of radish Treto F1 cv. was achieved in the case of ammonium nitrate use. In the case of Wernar F1 cv. kind of fertilizer didn't affect the yield. Irrespective of the kind of fertilizer, increment of nitrogen content in the soil from 50 to 100 mg N·dm -3 caused the significant enhancement of radish yield. The similar yielding was recorded at nitrogen concentration equal to 150 mg N·dm -3 and 100 mg N·dm -3 . Increasing mineral nitrogen concentration in the soil resulted in in- crement of nitrates content in radish roots, however their amounts not exceed permissible level. Plants fertilized with ammonium sulphate and ENTEC 26 contained lower amount of nitrates in edible parts in comparison to those supplied with ammonium nitrate and cal- cium nitrate.",

The essential oil content changes during the period of plant growth. The aim of this study was to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative composition of hyssop oil depending on plant growth stage. Studies were conducted in the period 2007–2008 at the Experimental Farm of the Department of Vegetable Crops and Medicinal Plants, University of Life Sciences in Lublin. The hyssop herb was collected from plants at the following growth stages: vegetative stage (the middle of June), beginning of flowering (the middle of July), and full flowering (the middle of August). The herb was dried at a temperature of 30C and then ground through 4–5 mm mesh sieves. Essential oil was obtained from the ground herb by steam distillation. The main components of hyssop oil were as follows: cis-pinocamphone, trans-pinocamphone (monoterpene ketones), -pinene (monoterpene hydrocarbon), germacrene D (sesquiterpene hydrocarbon), and elemol (sesquiterpene alcohol). Transpinocamphone was predominant in the oil extracted from hyssop collected at the vegetative stage, but its content decreased with plant growth, while the content of cispinocamphone increased. The content of -pinene was the highest in the oil extracted from hyssop cut at the vegetative stage and more than twice lower in the oil obtained from plants harvested at the beginning of flowering and at full flowering.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the three-year study was to determine the influence of post- harvest storage on essential and nonessential amino acids content in tubers of different cultivars of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) - 'Rubik', 'Albik' and 'Sauliai'. The experiment was performed in 2007-2009. The plants were grown in the ex- perimental field of Lithuanian University of Agriculture in Kaunas (from 2011 August - Aleksandras Stulginskis university). The Jerusalem artichoke tubers were stored for 20 weeks at the temperature of 2°C (± 0.5°C) and RH 90-95 % in polypropylene (PP) perforated bags, capacity of 10 kg, in 4 replicates. Amino acids contents were determined immediately after harvest and during storage of the tubers in every 4 weeks by the method of ion-exchange chromatography and then detected photometrically. The data obtained were statistically analyzed with two-factor Anova (STATISTICA software). Standard de- viation and the least significant difference at the 95% probability level were calculated with Fisher's LSD test. Data presented in tables are mean values of the three years of the experiment. The results obtained showed that directly after harvest and during the storage the dominating amino acid in tubers of all cultivars was of essential amino acids - argin- ine, and of nonessential - asparagine, glutamine and alanine. Tubers of cv. 'Sauliai' after 20 week storage accumulated the highest amount of essential amino acids - treonine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine and nonessential - serine, glycine, alanine, tyro- sine. Significant correlations between contents of some amino acids in the tubers were found.",

To evaluate its ef- fectiveness relative to the current treatments routinely used in the nursery production, some cuttings were treated with a rooting powder containing a synthetic auxin IBA or sprayed with a water solution of IBA. The best results were obtained with the IBA solu- tion, however, biopreparation also positively affected rhizogenesis in ninebark. Bioprepa- ration also affected the chlorophyll a+b, reducing sugars, free amino acids and polypheno- lic acids contents in leaves of cuttings but its effects varied depending on a cultivar.",

The indigenous people of Iran use the leaves and bulbs of A. jesdianum for the treatment of colds and kidney problems. The bulbs and leaves of various populations of the plant were collected from the alpine regions in Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari province, southwestern Iran. The total phenolic content of ethanol extract was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method, the antioxidant activity was evaluated measuring 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and the antibacterial activity of the extracts against four bacteria was determined by serial dilution assay. Results indicated that the total phenolic content in ethanol extracts from leaves and bulbs of A. jesdianum ranged between 27.83 to 98.23 mg GAE/g extract. A comparison of all plant extracts in the DPPH assay indicated that ethanol extracts from the populations of A. jesdianum leaves were the most effective free radical scavenging agents. The extracts indicated moderate-to-good inhibitory activities against four bacteria, especially against B. cereus. This finding suggests that the bulbs and leaves of A. jesdianum may be considered a natural source of antioxidants and antimicrobial agents.",

Significantly lower weight loss and decay ratios were observed in all treatments throughout the cold storage period as compared to the control. A similar case was also observed referring to the shelf life. MAP treatments were found to be more effective in retarding the weight loss and decay ratio. Higher hue angle values were measured from AVG-treated fruit at harvest. Similarly, hue angle of AVG and MAP-treated fruit were also higher than for the control in all periods of cold storage and on the 7th and 21st day of shelf life. AVG-treated fruit had higher firmness values than the control at harvest. However, higher firmness values were measured from MAP-treated fruit during the cold storage and shelf life. At the end of cold storage, lower SSC and higher titratable acidity values were observed in AVG and MAP-treated fruit than in the control. AVG + MAP treatments yielded significantly higher vitamin C, total phenolics and antioxidant activity values than the control. Contrarily, the control fruit had significantly higher total monomeric anthocyanin than the other treatments. Based on current findings, it was concluded that combined AVG + MAP treatments could be used as a beneficial tool to maintain the quality of sweet cherry fruit throughout the cold storage and shelf life.",

Thus, finding an effective way of ameliorating salinity damage is important for sustainable fruit production. Silicon (Si) treatment effectively counteracts the effects of many abiotic stress factors such as salinity, drought, cold, iron deficiency. To probe into the potential alleviating salinity malignant effects, we investigated the protective roles of Si. An apple plant (Malus domestica Borkh.) cv. ‘Fuji’ grafted on M9 clonal rootstock was chosen for the experiment and imposed to salinity stress for 4 months with 35 mM NaCl. Si with different three doses (0.5, 1 ve 2 mM) was applied to the roots of the salt-stressed apple plants except control. Si treatments inhibited apple plants growth depression through increasing stomatal conductivity, chlorophyll and decreasing electrolyte leakage. 0.5 mM Si improved root:shoot dry weight under salinity condition. The lowest values of membrane permeability were found in 0.5 and 2 mM Si treatments (21.45 and 21.55%, respectively) while salt had the highest value (48.43%). Salt exhibited a rapid decrease in stomatal conductivity by 49% compared to the control. We hypothesis that Si treatment contributed to cell walls, involving membrane stabilizing and fortification. Our findings showed that Si increased apple plant tolerance against salinity.",

One strategy that farmers can use to maintain or increase their yields in the face of a changing climate is to adjust of farm climate by using shade net on the trees. Such, the use of shade netting on Washington navel orange planted on the sandy soil in Al-Nubaria region, Egypt were studied during two successive seasons, either using a permanent shade throughout all the season or using a moveable shade for certain period from the first of March until the end of June for every season. Growth (No. of shoots/one meter branch, No. of leaves/shoot, shoot length and chlorophyll content of the leaves, leaf area and tree canopy), macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Na) content in the leaves, fruit characteristics (number, weight, diameter, peel thickness, total soluble solids, total acidity and ascorbic acid), yield and crop efficiency, were determined. It can be concluded that covering Washington navel orange trees grown on sandy soil with shade net especial covering the trees for certain period was very effective at protecting orange trees and led to improve the growth, increase the yield and maintain fruit quality.",

The aim of the study was to evalu- ate the impact of increasing plant population combined with differentiated dose of nitro- gen on yield of cabbage, its structure and plant composition. White head cabbage 'Kalo- rama F1' cv. was planted in rows 45 cm apart and 50, 40, 35 or 30 cm within rows, which assured 44 000, 55 000, 63 000 and 74 000 plants per 1 ha, respectively. Nitrogen at the rates of 150 or 300 kg ha -1 was used in 3 equal doses supplied as preplant and top dressing fertilization. Data obtained in the trial indicate that the dose of 150 kg N ha -1 was a limit- ing factor for the increment of crop yield in higher than 44 000 plant population per 1 ha. In the case of application the dose of 300 kg N ha -1 plants grown in population 63 000 and 74 000 per hectare produced significantly higher yield of heads if compared to the treat- ment with 44 000 plants. Taking into account the yield size and its structure it can be as- sumed that spacing 45 cm between plant rows and 40 cm distance in the row, which as- sure 55 000 plants per 1 ha is the optimum for production of cabbage heads weighted 1.0-2.0 kg, that meet the consumers expectation in the fresh market. Close plant spacing appeared to be beneficial for dry matter, vitamin C and total sugars contents and for de- crease of nitrates accumulation. The enhancement of N dose to 300 kg N ha -1 was benefi- cial for total yield of heads as well those weighted > 1.0 kg. The only change in plant composition under influence of heavy N fertilization was the increment of nitrates accu- mulation and decrease of Ca content in cabbage heads.",

    "abstract": "Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is a globally important crop, often affected by the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner, ECB), a significant pest causing substantial yield losses. Chemical insecticides, such as chlorantraniliprole and indoxacarb, are commonly used to control this pest; however, their environmental and health risks and potential for resistance development highlight the need for alternative pest management strategies. Biological control methods offer promising alternatives, including natural enemies and plant-derived compounds. This study evaluated the efficacy of neem oil, garlic extract, and chili pepper extracts against ECB larvae on pepper plants, comparing them to the chemical insecticides indoxacarb and chlorantraniliprole. Results from a two-year field experiment indicated that chlorantraniliprole exhibited the highest efficacy in reducing pepper fruit damage and larval survival, with the lowest damage severity and the lowest number of larvae per fruit. In the first year, neem oil and garlic extract showed promising results, effectively reducing fruit damage and performing comparably to indoxacarb. However, in the second year, only chlorantraniliprole showed consistent efficacy, likely due to unfavorable weather conditions that reduced the persistence of other treatments. Compared to the control, plant extracts showed higher efficacy in the first year of the trial, while indoxacarb was equally effective as the plant extracts. These findings suggest that plant-derived products like neem oil and garlic extract may be viable alternatives to chemical insecticides; however, further investigation is needed to optimize their application and efficacy in pest control.",

The occurrence of the disease in the cultivation results in the appearance of ginger discolouration on the mushroom caps. Currently, there is no effective method of protecting the mushroom from bacterial infection. Therefore, the selection of appropriate substrates for mushroom cultivation and environmental cultivation conditions, such as relative humidity, are of high importance in controlling the disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect, on the development of ginger blotch, of two types of peat-based casing soil, with different water holding capacity, and two different air relative humidities inside the mushroom growing chamber. The cultivation trials were artificially infected with two P. ‘gingeri’ isolates, at two different inoculation doses. The blotch disease incidence on the heavy casing soil, which characterised lower water holding capacity, was significantly higher than on the medium one, regardless of the number of bacterial cells and bacterial isolate. The results also demonstrated a significant correlation between higher levels of air humidity (90% in the cultivation chamber) and the ginger blotch prevalence. It was determined that the type of casing soil and the level of air humidity in the mushroom growing room are of crucial importance for efficient mushroom cultivation. These factors can also play a significant role in preventing against bacterial disease development.",

The thinning treatments increased the weight and size of apples, as well as their soluble solids content. Most apples were of a favourable marketable size in the range of 7.0–7.5 cm. The combined thinning treatments (M+H, M+C, C+H) resulted in the production of too many overgrown apples, which are known to be more susceptible to bitter pit, which in turn may reduce their storage life. Most of the thinning treatments resulted in a higher soluble solids content in the fruit without a significant effect on their firmness.",

    "abstract": "The impact of acetamiprid-based insecticides on the survival and activity of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) was evaluated in laboratory, focusing on two species, Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. Despite variations in sensitivity, with S. feltiae showing greater susceptibility, both species maintained their ability to infect Galleria mellonella larvae after exposure. Exposure to Mospilan 20 SP® significantly decreased the reproductive capacity of S. feltiae (F = 443.215, p &lt; 0.001), while H. bacteriophora showed greater resilience, especially when exposed to and Kobe 20 SP®. The ED50 values for H. bacteriophora increased over time with Kobe 20 SP® (0.46 ±0.04 at 24 h to 0.60 ±0.01 at 96 h), while Mospilan 20 SP® decreased the ED50 for S. feltiae (0.55 ±0.02 at 24 h to 0.64 ±0.03 at 96 h). The study highlights that the effects of systemic insecticides extend beyond immediate mortality, influencing reproductive potential and long-term viability, particularly for more sensitive species like S. feltiae. These findings raise important considerations for integrating EPNs into pest management strategies, especially in systems reliant on chemical pesticides. Further research is recommended to explore the broader ecological impacts of neonicotinoids on beneficial nematodes and their potential interactions with other biocontrol agents, aiming to enhance the sustainability of integrated pest management systems.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) nutrition is a major means of controlling growth and fruiting of trees. In EU Countries, society's expectations and political decisions have pushed for the adoption of sustainable ways to manage orchards. Guidelines for N management aim to limit fertiliser applications under threshold limits, in order to reduce N losses. Increasing the effectiveness of the recycling of the N present in the orchard is a basic step to reduce external N inputs. The availability of the stable isotope 15 N as experimental tool has made possible significant advances in the knowledge of the fluxes of N at tree and orchard level. This paper discusses the N fluxes occurring within the tree both between the years and within the year (root-shoot-root N recycle) and their role in the vegetative and repro- ductive cycle of fruit trees.",

The substrate was artificially con- taminated with increasing doses of metals: Cd - 0 (control); 1; 5; 10 mg dm -3 ; Pb: 0 (con- trol); 100; 500; 1000 mg dm -3 . The objective of studies was to investigate which organs of Tagetes erecta L. cumulated the greatest amounts of cadmium and lead, what amounts of Cd and Pb move from the substrate to the organs of the studied cultivars and whether the studied cultivars of Marigold are suitable for the remediation of soils polluted with cad- mium and lead. The metals contained in the particular plant organs, after dry mineraliza- tion, were identified by the method of atomic spectrophotometer AAS-3 of Zeiss Com- pany. In all studied cultivars, the highest contents of cadmium were found in leaves, smaller amounts were shown in stalks, while inflorescences contained the smallest Cd amounts. The highest amounts of lead in all studied cultivars were found in the stalks, smaller amounts in the leaves and the least amount was shown in the inflorescences The greatest contents of cadmium and lead were found in the organs of 'Hawaii' cultivar, both in the leaves, stalks and inflorescences. The studied cultivars of Tagetes erecta can be utilized for the remediation of soils polluted by heavy metals.",

The aim of the study was to define the longevity and fecundity of imagines, larvae development of the species and the level of parasitizing the eggs of the privet sawfly by parasitoids of the Chalcidoidea superfamily. The sawfly occurred in the last ten days of May. The females lived from 4 to 36 days, most often quite short (73.3%), from 7 to 14 days. After reaching the stage of sexual maturity, which lasted mostly 8-9 days, they started laying eggs. The fecundity of females fluctuated between 1 and 122 eggs. The mean female fecundity was 52 eggs. It was found that the larvae of sawfly went through 5 instar stages. The parasitoids of the Chalcidoidea superfamily decreased the abundance of the sawfly at the egg stage from 0.47% to 8.65%. Those were Anaphes cultripennis Debauche (Mymaridae) and Trichogramma sp. (Trichogrammatidae).",

In the field experiment with fennel growing the influence of soil mulching and flat plant shielding, as well as sowing term upon the nutritional values of two fennel cultivars, was examined. The studies covered 3 kinds of covers (covering the soil with black polyethylene film PE, covering the soil with black polypropylene unwoven PP 50 g m -2 and flat covering of plants with white unwoven PP 17 g m -2 (the controls were plots without covers), 3 sowing terms directly in the field, 2 cultivars (Rudy F1 and Zefa Fino). The applied covers did not significantly af- fect the nutritional value of fennel bulbs. The bulbs of plants from June sowings contained the most protein, total nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, as compared to earlier sowing terms. The most dry matter, vitamin C, sugars,0 phosphorus and potassium were determined in fennel bulbs from May sowings. The least protein, sugars and potassium was contained in plant bulbs from April sowings. The bulbs of Rudy F1 cultivar were more abundant in protein, phosphorus and calcium than those of Zefa Fino cultivar. The cultivars did not differ in dry matter, nitrate, vitamin C, total sugars, fibre and potassium contents in the bulbs.",

    "abstract": "Weed infestation depends on soil diaspore bank, the habitat conditions and the applied agricultural practices. Tillage constitutes one of the agrotechnical factors which significantly influence the condition and the level of weed infestation. In the conducted research, ploughless tillage practice and the application of herbicides considerably increased the number and the air-dry matter of weed populations per 1 m of pea crop compared to plough tillage. It was also established that the number of weeds per 1 m in the first term of weed infestation evaluation (in the phase of third true leaf) exceeded the number of weeds in the second term (ripening of pods and seeds). On the other hand, the air-dry matter of weeds was higher in the second term of evaluation. In addition, analyses revealed a higher number of weed species under the conditions of ploughless tillage (20–22 species) and herbicide application (20 species) than in the conventional tillage system (14–16 species). The predominant species under the conditions of conventional tillage were: Amaranthus retroflexus L. and Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P.B. (in the first term of evaluation), and Avena fatua L. and Chenopodium album L. (in the second term). The predominant species in the ploughless tillage were: Echinochloa crus-galli (L.)

The study was carried out in 2004-2007 on three years old plants growing in clay-loam soil. Bormax ap- plied twice during blooming period and one after fruit harvest in concentration 0.2%. Cal- cium nitrate Ca(NO3)2 applied to the soil around plants in April at the rate of 50 kg·ha -1 . Betokson Super 050 SL applied twice during blooming period in concentration 0.1%. Fi- nally combination of calcium nitrate + Bormax and calcium nitrate + Betokson were used. Untreated by chemicals plants served as a control. Boron fertilization enhanced signifi- cantly amount of anthocyanins and ascorbic acid in fruit. Blue honeysuckle fruits are plenty of anthocyanins and ascorbic acid and as a first ripening fruit in our climate could be a good its source for human consumption. Soil application of calcium nitrate resulted in significantly lower levels of phosphorus in leaves of blue honeysuckle. However plants did not showed the symptoms of P deficiency. According to results of present study, in order to reach high yield and high fruit quality, blue honeysuckle plants could be fertilized by calcium nitrate and Bormax, as well as treated by Betokson Super. Clear differences in yielding and leaf characteristic of both studied cultivars indicate that they are genetically distant.",

The paper pre- sents studies on the species composition of soil-borne fungi infecting the roots of Tragopogon porrifolius var. sativus cultivated with the use of oats, tansy phacelia and spring vetch as cover crops. In a field experiment the cover crops formed abundant green mass before winter and it constituted a natural mulch on the surface of the plough land. It was managed in two ways: 1) mixed with the soil as a result of spring ploughing, or 2) mixed with the soil as a result of pre-winter ploughing. The conventional cultivation of salsify, i.e. without cover crops, constituted the control. The studies established the number and health status of four-week-old salsify seedlings and roots with necrotic signs. A laboratory mycological analysis made it possible to determine the quantitative and qualitative composition of fungi infecting the underground parts of Tragopogon porri- folius var. sativus. The emergences and the proportion of infected salsify seedlings varied and depended on the species of the mulching plant. The smallest number of infected seed- lings was obtained after the mulch with oats, slightly more after the application of spring vetch or tansy phacelia as cover crops, and the most in the control. Regardless of the spe- cies of the mulching plant, the following were frequently isolated from the diseased seed- lings and roots of salsify: Alternaria alternata, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium ox- ysporum, Penicillium spp., Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum proved to be the most harmful towards the roots of salsify. The system of cultivation, i.e. performing spring or pre-winter ploughing, had no significant effect on the total population of fungi.",

The aim of 3 experiments to evaluate the effect of topolin used in two forms: meta-methoxytopolin (MemT) and its ri- boside (MemTR) on postharvest longevity of 'Albomaculata' leaves. In the first experi- ment, the topolins were used in water solutions at concentrations of 25, 50 and 75 mg·dm - 3 for 4-hour conditioning of leaves, which were then placed in distilled water. In the sec- ond experiment, their solutions at concentrations of 25 and 50 mg·dm -3 were employed for 24-hour conditioning of leaves in a cold room at a temperature of 5°C and for a short, sec- onds-long immersion of leaf blades. In the third experiments, the scheme of the second experiment was employed again, except that here the solutions contained not only the to- polins but also gibberellic acid at the same concentrations. In the experiments the control was leaves placed in distilled water after cutting. MemT and MemTR affect the posthar- vest longevity and quality of conditioned leaves of the cultivar Albomaculata. At concen- trations of 25-75 mg·dm -3 they extend their longevity and inhibit protein degradation, but have no effect on their greenness index. Applied at concentrations of 25-50 mg·dm -3 to soak leaf blades for a few seconds, both growth regulators improve the longevity of the leaves more effectively than their 24-hour conditioning. The combination of MemT with GA3 at concentrations of 25 + 25 and 50 + 50 mg·dm -3 to soak leaf blades for a few sec- onds extends the postharvest longevity of the leaves by an average of 14-24 days and in- hibits protein degradation, but has unfavourable effect on their greenness index.",

    "abstract": "A number of research studies investigating melon production technologies in various macroregions of Poland characterized by different climate conditions have been initiated to investigate the effect of perforated PE film and non-woven PP fabric covers as well as soil mulching with organic and mineral material on the melon growing process. A two-factorial field experiment was conducted in the years 2004-2008, in the Garden of the Research and Experimental Station of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn. The first experimental factor were four Polish melon cultivars, Malaga F1, Melba, Oliwin and Seledyn F1, recommended for open ground and forced cultivation. The second factor were types of soil cover and plant cover. Apart from the control treatment (without protective cover), the effect of the following types of cover on the growth rate and yield of melon plants was determined in a five-year cycle: perforated PE film with 100 holes per m 2 , non-woven PP fabric with surface density of 17 g·m -2 , black PE film for soil mulching; black PE film for soil mulching + perforated PE film with 100 holes per m 2 , black PE film for soil mulching + non-woven PP fabric. An analysis of the chemical composition of melon fruit showed that the concentrations of dry matter, L-ascorbic acid and total carbohydrates were higher in the edible parts of heterotic cultivars. The type of plant cover and soil cover had a significant effect on the dry matter content of the edible parts of melon, but it caused no considerable changes in the levels of the remaining or- ganic compounds. In the majority of cases, the nitrate content of melon fruit was below the allowable standards. The lowest quantities of nitrates were accumulated by melon fruit of cv. Oliwin in the control treatment.",

    "abstract": "The quality of cut lily flowers during its postharvest life is important both for growers and customers. It is determined by two factors: longevity of flowers and a general appearance of the entire cut stem during its vase life. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of growth regulators (gibberellic acid and benzyladenine) and the preservative (200 mg·dm -3 8HQC+2%S) on quality of cut oriental lily 'Helvetia,' a white blooming cultivar very popular on the Polish market. After cutting the flowers were treated for 20 h with growth regulators (GA3 or BA, 500 mg·dm -3 ) and then placed into distilled water. Non pulsed flowers were kept in a preservative solution composed of 200 mg·dm -3 8HQC and 2% sucrose. Untreated flowers held in distilled water served as a control. During the senescence of cut lily flowers the soluble protein and free proline contents were deter- mined. As the major problem in the postharvest handling of lilies is leaf yellowing, the ef- fects of postharvest treatments on quality of leaves and their chlorophyll contents were also studied. The preservative increased vase life of cut lily flowers while gibberellic acid improved the quality of leaves. In leaves treated with GA3 the chlorophyll level was 25% higher than in leaves on stems placed into distilled water directly after harvest. The level of soluble protein in petals dropped while free proline accumulated during flower senes- cence. Flowers treated with GA3 and those placed into 8HQC + 2%S solution showed a delayed protein degradation: the concentrations of soluble proteins after 12 day of vase life was over 3-fold higher than in control flowers. Also the proline accumulation was de- layed in flowers on stems placed in the preservative solution, however, no effect of GA3 on the proline level was observed. The soluble protein level correlated with a flower posi- tion on the stem being lower in lower flowers as compared to the upper ones.",

In separate samples of leaf blades and petioles there was evaluated the content of dry matter, vitamin C, sugars, total N, nitrates, P, K, Ca, and Mg. Results of the study indicate that the increment of N dose from 50 to 100 kg·ha -1 had positive effects on Swiss chard yield but the efficiency of higher nitrogen doses was rather small and not significant. Heavy nitrogen fertilization caused the increment of total N and nitrates in both edible parts and magnesium in leaf petioles, while reduction the sugar content in leaf blades. On the average blades contained higher amounts of dry matter, sugars, total N and Mg, while petioles - calcium and nitrates.",

In the years 2009-2010, in Re- search - Horticulture Station belonging to Department of Horticulture at Wroc· aw Uni- versity of Environmental and Life Sciences there was conducted two-factorial experiment with the use of synthetic mulches (polyethylene black and white foil, black polypropylene agrotextile), as well as flat covers (polypropylene agrotextile, perforated foil) in cultiva- tion of Astra cultivar of zucchini. The experiment was established according to random- ized split plot design, in three replications. Zucchini was planted on 12th May. There was not recorded any influence of mulches type on total and early yield of zucchini fruits. Ad- ditional application of flat covers made of PP agrotextile and perforated foil resulted in increase in total fruit yield in relation to control treatment by 26.7% and 44%, respectively and to the yield from plots which were only mulched - average by 47.3%. When using covers, early yield was average by 40.7% and by 47.9% higher. The highest total fruit yield (99.85 t ha -1 ) was obtained in cultivation on PP agrotextile mulch with a perforated foil used as cover the plants. Fruits of 8-15 cm length accumulated the most considerable quantities of vitamin C, as well as phosphorus and potassium, while in fruits > 22 cm long there was recorded the highest amount of nitrates and carotenes.",

Studies conducted in the glasshouse in the years 2005-2007 were aimed at determining the effect of the substratum of rockwool, perlite and expanded clay, as well as two kinds of nutritreint solution of differentiated macroelement concentrations (EC I - 2.4 mSo cm -1 and EC II - 3.6 mSo cm -1 ) upon yielding and chemical composition of leaves and fruits of tomato cv. 'Cunero F1', grown in ex- tended cycle (22 clusters). Cultivation was conducted with the use of dripping fertigation system, with closed nutrient solution circuit, without recirculation. In the conducted stud- ies no significant differences were found in the total and marketable yield of tomato grown in the examined substrata. Kind of substratum did not also have any significant ef- fect upon the mean weight of one fruit and number of fruits from a plant. In objects culti- vated with a solution with higher macroelement concentration (EC II) significantly higher marketable yield was reported, as well as higher fruit unit weight and less non-marketable fruits compared to the basic nutrient solution (EC I). In the leaves of plants fertilized with solution containing 25% more macroelements (EC II) significantly more total nitrogen, potassium, calcium and magnesium was reported. The fruits of plants fertilized with solu- tion of higher macronutrients concentration (EC II) contained significantly more dry mat- ter (5.71%), nitrogen (2.41% d.m.), phosphorus (0.32% d.m.), potassium (4.23% d.m.), calcium (1096 mg·kg -1 d.w.) and less vitamin C (17.2 mg·100 -1 g fr.w.) compared to fruit from plants fertilized with basic nutrient solution of EC 2.4 mSo cm -1 .

The growth and yield of these plants can be effectively improved by growing valuable cultivars and appropriate agrotechnical procedures. One of the latter is foliar feeding of plants with nitrogen, which is a fast-acting and extremely ef- fective procedure. The conducted studies were aimed at comparing growth dynamics in four basil cultivars, including the Polish ones: Kasia and Wala, as well as determining the effect of foliar plant feeding with nitrogen upon their growth and development. The plants were grown from March till July 2008 and 2009 in an unheated foil tunnel. During the experiment the thermal conditions were generally favorable for basil development. Foliar feeding of basil was conducted with the use of hand spraying machine, dosing 0.5% urea solution. The examined basil cultivars were characterized by various growth dynamics, which was also related to temperature distribution in the growing period. The highest ac- cretion was that of the Polish cultivar Kasia plants. The examined basil plants responded well to foliar nitrogen feeding. The application of urea contributed to a significant in- crease of the height of basil plants, as well as of the length and width of their leaf blades. However, this procedure did not simultaneously affect the plant diameter and number of sprout branchings.",

In two factorial field experiment, calcium nitrate, ammonium nitrate and Entec 26 - nitrogen mineral fertilizer containing DMPP nitrification inhibitor used as the source of N and ap- plied at the rates of 75, 150 and 225 kg·ha -1 were compared.

Results of the study proved that all tested fertil- izers were equally valuable sources of nitrogen for Japanese bunching onion. The use of Entec 26 was associated with higher amounts of total chlorophyll and carotenoids in edi- ble part of plants if compared to commonly recommended ammonium nitrate and similar to calcium nitrate. The other important advantage of this fertilizer was a substantial de- cline of nitrates content.

The objective was to assess the impact of the work and the kind of sulphur content of Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe in the dry mass and uptake these ele- ments by yield of dry mass of potato tuber. Experience in the field of potato head was in the years 2004-2006 by applying different kinds of sulphur (elemental and K2SO4) and dose (0, 25 and 50 kg·ha -1 ). Sulphur indeed affected the application to increase the yield of tubers. However, there has been an independent impact dose and kind of sulphur of tested characteristics. Only in the case of interaction of dose and kind of sulphur fertiliza- tion it was found that the highest yield was found when using 25 kg·ha -1 in the sulphate kind and 50 kg·ha -1 S in sulphate and elemental kind. The yield of dry mass was greatest when applied 25 kg·ha -1 in the sulphate kind. The content of Cu, Zn, Mn (except Fe) in the dry mass and uptake these elements by yield of dry mass of potato tuber was signifi- cantly determined by S fertilization. The highest content of Cu and Zn in the dry mass and uptake these elements by yield of dry mass of tuber was after applying 50 kg S·ha -1 in elemental kind and on the control plots (without sulphur). Content and uptake of Mn by tuber was reduced by sulphur fertilization, and the contents and uptake of the Fe by tuber increased as a result of increasing doses of sulphur (although not confirmed that statisti- cally). Elemental sulphur in dose 50 kg·ha -1 substantially reduced the pH value of the soil. It was a significant correlation between the pH value of the soil and the contents of Cu (negative), Zn (positive) and Mn (different values depending on years of research) in the dry mass and uptake these elements by yield of dry mass of potato tuber.",

The study aim of the present work was to evaluate yield and quality of three cultivars of leafy parsley: 'Amphia', 'Festival' and 'Verta'- a leaf cultivar. In the experiment conducted in 2009-2010 the yield of leaves for unit of area and an influence of conservation method (freezing, drying) for content of active compounds were determined. The raw material was harvested in two terms: in the second ten days of August and second ten days of Sep- tember. The content of essential oils, flavonoids, polyphenolic acids, vitamin C, carote- noids, and chlorophyll were determined in all kinds of raw material. The yield of leaves per 1 m 2 was on average from 0.55 kg to 3.57 kg. Higher mass of leaves was obtained at the second term of harvest for all investigated varieties. Among the compared cultivars 'Amphia' produced higher yields than others (2.61 kg·m -2 ). The content of biologically active compounds in the leaves of parsley significantly depended on the variety, date of harvest and method of conservation. The content of assimilate pigments and vitamin C in leaves of parsley clearly decreased under the influence of freezing and drying (in the case of vitamin C drying completely degraded the vitamin). Freezing reduced the essential oil content and polyphenolic acids in the leaves of parsley, drying increased the content of these components.",

Seeds cv Wolska were osmoprimed in polyethylene glycol (-1.5 MPa, 15°C, 7 days, darkness) or hydroprimed by addition of water to the seeds (500 μl of distilled water per 1 g of seeds, 20°C, 48 h, darkness). After priming seeds were dried back at 20°C and 45% RH for 48 h. The primed and non-primed onion seeds were stored in air-tight plastic containers for 6 and 12 months at 4 and 20°C. The seed germination, vigour and health tests were performed before and after storage for untreated and treated seeds at 10 and 20°C. The results showed that for maximal seed vi- ability and germination rate after 6 and 12 months storage, both hydro- and osmoprimed seeds should to be stored at 4°C rather than 20°C. Osmopriming significantly increased seed infestation with Penicillium spp., which remained stable up to 12 months storage. The number of seeds infested with Botrytis spp. significantly decreased after priming and storage, especially at 20°C.",

The experiment was conducted in a commercial family orchard in a year characterized by a warm and wet spring and also by a very hot and dry summer. Fruit yields harvested from well fertilized 19-years old 'Kelleris 16', 'Nefris' and 'Łutówka' trees grafted on Mahaleb cherry and protected against pests using integrated plant protection system were medium high and of good quality, however productivity index of a tree was low. The fruits attained high weight and diameter and contained big amounts of sugars, vit. C, anthocyanins and flavonoids and medium amount of phenolic acids. Among anthocyanins the most important were cyanidin 3-glucosyl-rutinoside and cyanidin 3-rutinoside. Antioxidant activity of fruits measured as percent of DPPH inhibition was high and similar among compared cultivars. Łutówka was the most productive cultivar of medium leaf and fruit size and with fruits of highest vit. C and flavonoids content and lowest total sugars and monosaccharides content. The least productive cultivar was Nefris, though its fruits were the biggest and contained dry matter, soluble solids, anthocyanins and phenolic acids in the highest amounts of all and vit. C at the lowest level of all. Kelleris 16 was the medium productive cultivar characterized by widest leaf blades and smallest fruits. Content of total sugars and monosaccharides in its fruits was the highest and content of anthocyanins and phenolic acids was the lowest. Residues of dodine and thiacloprid determined in the fruits immediately after harvest were much lower than the permissible residue maximum level.",

The fruits are suitable for fresh consumption, however they can be used for processing: juice, jams, jellies, syrups, tinctures. Fruits are abundant in mineral elements, vitamin C, organic acids, iridoids, anthocyanins and due to that they have health-promoting significance. In this experiment, the fruit quality of several 16-year-old ecotypes in the Lublin region was compared. They were compared in terms of the beginning of fruit ripening and fruit size (length, diameter, mass), fruit shape index, share of stone in the fruit, SSC, TA, SSC/TA, reducing sugar, dry matter content and anthocyanins content. The color of fruit was evaluated in two dates, visually and using HanterLab spectrophotometer. Cornelian cherry fruits began to mature at the beginning of August and at the latest at the end of August. With the increase of the maturity degree, the SSC, reducing sugars, TA, dry matter and anthocyanins increased significantly. There was no difference in the taste of light red fruits and dark red fruits, which were characterized by similar ratio of SSC/TA.

As well as ecotypes No. 4 and 5, ripening in mid-August, and having a high ratio of SSC/TA, providing a good taste. Studied ecotypes could be used in breeding programs to incorporate a wide range of quality and agronomic characteristics into a final cornelian cherry cultivar.",

Plums were treated with 2% alginate coating with or without salicylic (1.0 mM) and oxalic acid (1.0 mM), and then stored at 0−1°C and 90 ±5% relative humidity for 40 days. The quality of plums was assessed at 10-day intervals by evaluating the following quality parameters: weight loss, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, firmness, respiration rate, ascorbic acid content, total anthocyanin content, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The respiration rate, weight loss and changes in quality parameters were much lower in coated plums as compared with the control. Alginate coating resulted in a significant reduction in weight loss of fruits. Alginate treatments with or without salicylic and oxalic acid were effective on delaying the evolution of parameters related to postharvest ripening, such as soluble solids content, softening and reducing respiration rate. At the end of the storage period, the edible coatings showed a positive effect on maintaining higher concentration of total phenolics, total anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity, which decreased in control plums as a result of over-ripening and senescence processes. The results suggested that the use of alginate enriched with salicylic acid could maintain considerably higher quality of fruits and level of bioactive compounds than other coating treatments during 40 days of storage at 0−1°C.",

In the current study, the spatial distribution of tomato early blight disease was ascertained in District Gilgit, GilgitBaltistan, Pakistan. The comprehensive field survey was carried in two growing seasons (2014–2015), whereas in each growing season, 62 tomato fields were surveyed. Based on the distribution of disease, the respective thematic maps (incidence and severity) were prepared using Arc Map 10.1 with spatial analyst function of Arc GIS software by means of the inverse distance weight (IDW) interpolation method. Results indicate that early blight of tomato is spatially distributed in both growing seasons. However, in the first growing season, the disease incidence ranged from 10.22% to 44.16% and during later season 14.03–49.16%, whereas 5.37–16.40% and 6.52–26.94% severity was recorded. Furthermore, this information indicates that higher disease infestation occurred in 2015 in relation to 2014. This information linked to metrological data (temperature, precipitation and relative humidity), seemingly favored the early blight development during the growing period. Seven botanical extracts were tested against pathogen Alternaria solani at different concentrations (4, 6 and 8%). Results revealed that all tested plant extracts showed antifungal activities. However, at 8% concentration of plant extract, Datura starmonium, Berberis orthobotry, Podophyllum emodi and Uretica dioica exhibited &gt;60%, while Peganum harmala, Artemisia maritima and Capparis spinosa &lt;60% antifungal properties. The information generated due to this study could help the tomato growers regarding disease management and selection of resistant cultivars, improving profitability and food security in the Gilgit region.",

    "abstract": "Almond mushroom - Agaricus brasiliensis (Wasser et al.) was discovered and popularised as late as the 20th century. However, it has been known for its exceptional properties in the places of its origin for a long time. Studies have been conducted world- wide for several decades, aiming at the precise determination of these properties and their applicability in medicine. To date it has been proven that almond mushroom extracts ex- hibit anticancer and antibacterial action, and reduce blood cholesterol level. They are also useful in the treatment of AIDS, diabetes, hypertension and viral hepatitis. Almond mush- room is a very tasty mushroom with an almond aroma. This species is also characterised by high protein content and low fat content. For appropriate growth and development al- mond mushroom requires relatively high temperatures and air humidity as well as access of light. However, world literature sources contain limited data concerning the cultivation technology of almond mushroom. In Poland almond mushroom is practically unknown, while its considerable therapeutic properties should be an incentive to initiate more exten- sive studies.",

    "abstract": "Up-to-date production of shallots for commercial purposes was limited due to low supply of the seeding material as well as no breeding cultivars that would produce seeds. Local populations commonly grown in various countries are reproduced mainly in vegetative way, because they usually do not produce generative shoots nor seeds, or they are formed, but in a very reduced number. The aim of this study, conducted in the period 2009-2012, was to evaluate generative growth and seed production in shallot grown from seedlings planted in summer at different dates, without producing mother bulbs. The study included 4 shallot cultivars - 'Toto', 'Ambition F1', 'Bonilla F1', and 'Matador F`1'. Seed- lings (4 weeks old) were planted in the field on three dates - 3 rd decade of July, 1 st decade of August, and 3 rd decade of August. In the second year of cultivation, after the plants had overwintered in the ground, losses in plants, the percentage of plants producing seed stalks and some traits of these stalks as well as seed yield in the true breeding cultivar 'Toto' were determined. Plants of the other cultivars were not allowed to produce seeds (inflorescence umbels were topped before flower opening), since these were hybrids and undesired cross-breeding could occur. The study showed that overwintering losses in plants were on average 26.3%, but they were the lowest in cv. 'Toto', in particular among plants obtained from the first date of planting seedlings. Irrespective of the cultivar, the largest amount of plants with developed seed stalks and with their highest number per plant were recorded in the treatments where the first planting date was used. A delay in planting seedlings in the first year of cultivation by 2-4 weeks had a significant effect on reducing the percentage of plants developing seed stalks in the second year, while in cv. 'Toto it resulted in a very high decrease in seed yield.",

Germination tests were conducted using four replicates of 50 seeds from each species at low, optimum and high-temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 30, 35 and 40°C). Ger- mination percentage of pepper, eggplant, radish and cabbage in last count ranged from 1.28 to 72.10, from 1.28 to 74.88, from 22.51 to 88.72 and from 1.28 to 74.94, respec- tively. Palmitic (C16:0), oleic (C18:1n-9) and linoleic (C18:2n-6), acids were sequentially the highest in concentration followed by stearic acid (C18:0) at less than 5% and miristic, palmitoleic, margaric, arachidic, erucic, behenic and nervonic acids at an even lower con- tent (<1%) in pepper and eggplant. Erucic acid (C22:1n-9) was the principal fatty acid fol- lowed by oleic, linoleic, gadoleic and behenic acids and miristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, arachidonic and stearic acids at a lower content between <1% and 5% in radish and cab- bage seeds. The simple correlation coefficients and stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the low or high amount of fatty acids in tested species such as palmitic (C16:0), palmitoleic (C16:1n-7), margaric (C17:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1n-9), li- noleic (C18:2n-6), arachidic (C20:0), gadoleic (C20:1n-9), arachidonic (C20:4n-6), be- henic (C22:0), MUFA, n-6 PUFA and total oil might play a major role in seed germina- tion under low and high temperatures.",

The following temperatures were used: 25/20°C (control), 25/0°C, 10/0°C (day/night). Both experiments tested the response of 6 domestic soybean cultivars ('Aldana', 'Jutro', 'Progres', 'Ma- zowia', 'Nawiko', and 'Augusta') and 2 Canadian cultivars ('OAC Vision', 'Dorothea') to chilling. The obtained results showed that a temperature of 10°C used during germina- tion (28/10°C), and even to a larger extent during imbibition and germination (10/10°C), clearly reduced the speed of germination, percentage of germinated seeds, and radicle length relative to the control, but it increased catalase activity in sprouts. A chilling tem- perature of 25/0°C and 10/0°C (day/night) significantly increased leaf electrolyte leakage, free proline content and catalase activity relative to the control, but it decreased the photo- synthetic rate and total plant leaf area.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of sucrose, nitrogen salts and cytokinin concentrations on the phenolics content in relation to shoot formation in Magnolia × sou- langiana 'Coates' in vitro. The results showed that the concentration and ratios of ben- zylaminopurine (BAP), sucrose and nitrogen salts in the Murashige and Skoog (MS) me- dium had a significant effect on the leaf and axillary shoot formation as well as on the phenolics content. The highest multiplication rate (4.8 shoots/explant) and shoots of good quality were obtained on medium containing 0.2 mg·dm -3 BAP, 100% nitrogen salts in re- lation to the MS medium and 20 g·dm -3 sucrose. At this sucrose level, increasing BAP concentration from 0.2 to 1.0 mg·dm -3 resulted in the inhibition or slight stimulation of shoot formation depending on the nitrogen levels (100 and 75/50%, respectively). At low sucrose-to-nitrogen ratio in the medium, increased BAP levels induced the leaf browning. The highest inhibition of M. × soulangiana 'Coates' shoot formation has been observed on medium containing 30 g·dm -3 sucrose, reduced nitrogen salts levels and BAP at con- centration 1.0 mg·dm -3 . A medium with a high sucrose-to-nitrogen ratio stimulated also phenolics production in magnolia shoots. The addition of BAP lowered phenolics produc- tion compared with the control medium. At high sucrose-to-nitrogen ratio, increasing BAP levels significantly stimulated phenolics production. The results of the study showed that not in all the treatments did the enhanced phenolics levels in the shoots of M. × sou- langiana 'Coates' coincide with decreased shoot formation.",

In intercropping plots, onion sets were planted between broccoli rows. Broccoli and onion plants were also grown as monocrops. Nitrogen was applied at three different rates (160, 200 and 240 kg ha–1) in both mono and intercrop plots of broccoli. The overall efficiency of intercropping was evaluated by employing land equivalent ratios (LERs). Cropping systems significantly did not affect chlorophyll reading value, yield and other parameters observed. However, nitrogen application rate had significant effect on these parameters. The highest values of these parameters were generally observed in 240 kg ha–1 nitrogen application. Macro and microelement content of broccoli leaves was affected neither by cropping systems nor by nitrogen fertilization except for N, Mn, Zn and NO3. Intercropping increased plant height but decreased the plant diameter of onion. There wasn’t significant decrease in plant weight of intercropped onion at 240 kg ha–1 nitrogen treatment when compared to monocropping. Broccoli intercropped with onion at 240 kg ha–1 nitrogen had the highest LER values, showing that intercropping practice could be more productive than monocropping especially in case of 240 kg ha–1 nitrogen application.",

Total virus infection of Istrian ecotypes was lower than infection of Dalmatian ones. Total incidence of viruses in Croatian garlic material ranged from 40.6% to 100.0%, depending on ecotype. In imported cultivar ‘Rose de Lautrec’ we found no infection with SLV. A high percentage of mixed infections in garlic cloves was also found and for double infections it ranged from 69% to 88%. Infection with all tested viruses was observed in 78% cloves. The most infected combination was double infections with potyviruses LYSV+OYDV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of SLV infection in garlic in Croatia.",

The purpose of the present studies was to determine the effect of oats, common vetch and tansy phacelia as intercrop cover plants on the formation of microorganisms communities in the soil under the cultivation of root chicory and salsify. Before winter, cover plants formed an abundant green mass, which constituted the natural mulch on the surface of the land managed in two ways: 1) pre-winter ploughing, or 2) spring ploughing. The control was the conventional cultivation of these vegetables, i.e. without any cover plants. The microbiological analysis of the soil showed that regardless of the species of the studied vegetable, the total population of bacteria and the population of bacteria Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. were the highest when the soil was mulched with oats. A little fewer of those microorganisms occurred after using the mulch of common vetch or phacelia. On the other hand, the fewest bacteria were obtained as a result of the traditional cultivation of those vegetables. The total population of fungi in the soil mulched with oats was the lowest, whereas the most of fungi occurred in the control. The cultivation system, i.e. performing the spring or pre-winter ploughing, rather had no significant effect on the population of the studied microorganisms in the soil. Among the studied vegetables, the following were most frequently isolated: Alternaria alternata, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium oxysporum, Pythium irregulare, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Gliocladium spp., Penicillium spp. and Trichoderma spp. Laboratory tests showed that both the cultivation of root chicory and salsify which included cover crops promoted the development of antagonistic bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp.) and fungi (GlioCorresponding author: El bieta Patkowska, Department of Phytopathology and Mycology, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, ul.

The decrease in its natural resources induces to under- take research on the introduction of this species into cultivation. The aim of the present work was to determine the effect of organic and mineral fertilization on increasing the biomass of underground parts of Rh. rosea and the level of biologically active com- pounds. Throughout the study period, the highest raw material yield was obtained after the application of the following doses of mineral fertilization: N - 60.0 kg·ha -1 , P - 35.2 kg·ha -1 , K - 83.0 kg·ha -1 , without manure. The use of manure caused a decrease in the average rhizome and root weight by more than 20%. Mineral fertilization applica- tion increased the average raw material yield by about 30-40% and allowed obtaining the highest weight of underground organs of the species in question already in the fourth year of cultivation. Furthermore, the present study demonstrates that mineral fertilization does not affect substantially the level of the individual groups of compounds in the raw mate- rial, but the use of manure may significantly reduce the content of phenylpropanoids. The level of active compounds is also influenced by crop age. Two-year-old plants were char- acterized by the highest content of phenylpropanoids as well as by the lowest content of phenylethanoids and phenolic acids. In the following years of cultivation, no statistically significant changes were observed in the level of the analysed groups of compounds.",

The control flower received distilled water without blue light exposure. The longest vase life (22.66 days) was related to 10 mg l−1 SNP, not differing from 12 h of blue light exposure (22.00 days) and 20 mg l−1 SNP (21.66 days), significantly. The highest water uptake and total chlorophyll and the lowest ethylene were obtained from the flowers treated with 10 mg l−1 SNP or exposed to 12 h of blue light. These two treatments outperformed the control in reducing MDA accumulation too. APX activity was significantly higher in the flowers treated with 12 h of blue light exposure, 18 h of blue light exposure, or 15 mg l−1 SNP. Except for the blue light exposure for 6 h, all treatments reduced stem-end bacteria versus the control. The lowest bacterial population (57.3 Log10 CFU ml−1) belonged to the flowers treated with 15 mg l−1 SNP. Blue light outperformed SNP in stopping the growth of Gram-positive bacteria and yeast. Based on the results, blue light is introduced as a physical factor to improve the quantitative and qualitative traits of cut Alstroemeria ‘Napoli’ flowers.",

Consequently, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) and plant growth-stimulating bacteria (Bacillus subtilis) have been proposed as a method to enhance the growth parameters. The effect of ZnONPs at a concentration range of 0.2–1.4 mg cm–3 on the planktonic growth of B. subtilis bacteria, production of the hormone indole-3-acetic acid, biofilm formation, the ability to biodegrade complex compounds such as Evans Blue, and an increase in oxidative stress was assessed. Concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 mg cm−3 ZnONPs were used to further test the simultaneous effects of ZnONPs and B. subtilis on red cabbage growth. Moreover, the influence of the simultaneous use of ZnONPs and B. subtilis on seed germination, physiological characteristics, and the content of minerals in red cabbage seedlings grown in the soil was examined. The simultaneous use of ZnONPs and B. subtilis bacteria improves the number of germinated seeds, the length of red cabbage seedlings, and the content of photosynthetic pigments and antioxidants compared with the control or single treatment of seeds with only B. subtilis or ZnONPs. The simultaneous use of B. subtilis and zinc oxide nanoparticles resulted in a higher content of zinc and sodium in red cabbage seedlings, while the content of macronutrients such as Mg and K, and micronutrients such as Fe, Mn, and Co was lower or close to the control value. The combination of B. subtilis + 0.2 mg ZnONPs turned out to be better than B. subtilis + 0.4 mg ZnONPs, as it produced the highest number of germinated seeds, greater plant and root length, and a higher content of chlorophylls, phenolic compounds, and antioxidants. The results indicate that ZnONPs enhance the role of B. subtilis as plant growth-promoting bacteria.",

However, synergistic effects of lowering N and increasing S application on tomato yield and quality have not been documented. The effect of four N/S balances: 50.00, 9.20, 4.66 and 2.92, prepared by varying the concentration of N and S, were evaluated in tomatoes grown in soilless medium (peat + perlite). The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replicates. The results of the study showed that the optimal N/S balance in the nutrient solution differed depending on the properties investigated. The N/S balance of 9.20 resulted in the highest overall fruit yield, average fruit weight, fruit size and diameter. Moreover, the N/S balances required in the nutrient solution for the highest lycopene content (7.69 mg 100 g−1 fresh weight) and vitamin C content (20.63 mg 100 g−1 fresh weight) in tomato fruits were 50.00 and 9.20, respectively. It was found that the N/S balance above or below 9.20 had negative effects on yield and yield components as well as on some biophysical quality characteristics of the fruit. However, the N/S balance had no influence on the number of fruits, the firmness and shape index and the pH value of the fruits. Therefore, lowering N and increasing S application to the balance of 9.20 would have great potential to enhance the synergistic effect on the productivity and quality of tomato cultivation.",

Of particular importance for environmental reasons is the reduction of nitrogen fertilisation rates. UAN is a highly concentrated nitrogen fertiliser in an aqueous solution of nitrate and urea ammonium nitrate. This study evaluated the effectiveness of fertilisation in pepper and tomato cultivation using UAN mixtures with potassi um thiosulphate in proportions selected based on a model pot experiment. The field experiment was conducted from 2019 to 2020 at the Felin Experimental Farm of the University of Life Sciences in Lublin. The test plants were sweet peppers of the Balta F1 cultivar (Capsicum annuum L.) and tomatoes of the Mirsini cultivar (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). The experiment included the following variable factors: nitrogen dose (2 levels: N1 – optimum nitrogen rate and N2 – nitrogen rate reduced by 25% from the optimum dose) and fertiliser composition (2 levels: pure UAN – N : K0 : S0, UAN with potassium thiosulphate – N : K1: S1). Taking into account the pepper yield and the accumulation of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulphur in the fruit, the most favourable fertilisation combination was the combination of an optimal nitrogen dose (170 kg N ha‒1) with potassium thiosulphate. The reduction of the nitrogen dose and the treatment of fertilisation with a dose of 128 kg N ha‒1 with potassium thiosulphate favoured an increase in the vitamin C content of the pepper fruit. The effect of nitrogen dose on tomato fruit yield was modified by the year of the study. Thus, in tomatoes, it is possible to reduce the nitrogen dose depending on weather conditions. At the same time, the addition of potassium thiosulphate is recommended, which has a beneficial effect on the fruit’s potassium, phosphorus and sulphur and vitamin C content. There was no significant effect of varying nitrogen and potassium fertilisation on the dry matter content of pepper and tomato fruit, while the effect on calcium, magnesium and extract content was inconclusive.",

    "abstract": "Although the diurnal fluctuations of melatonin (Mel) content in plants and its role in abiotic and biotic stress tolerance are well-documented, little is known about its changes within seeds and its potential effects on seed viability or the aging process. This study aimed to determine how artificial aging, induced by a controlled deterioration test, affects the Mel and tryptophan (Trp) content and seed viability. Furthermore, the study evaluated the effects of Mel and Trp applications on mitigating the impacts of aging in artificially aged seeds. Tomato seeds treated with 250 µM Mel and Trp were artificially aged for up to 8 days through controlled deterioration test after which Mel and Trp changes during ageing and the effect of treatments on seed viability and germination performance was determined. Seeds were also treated with Mel and Trp following artificial ageing in order to determine the effects of Mel and Trp on aged seeds. The positive effects of Mel and Trp applications on seed viability and vigor were particularly evident during and after artificial aging, compared to control seeds. It was observed that in control seeds subjected to controlled deterioration test, Mel and Trp contents exhibited an opposite trend. Applications of Mel and its precursor Trp, before and after artificial aging, significantly slowed down the aging process or alleviated the adverse effects of aging by protecting membrane structures against peroxidation and the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2. Moreover, indicators of seed deterioration such as electrical conductivity, MDA, and H2O2 contents were significantly reduced compared to untreated seeds, while the activities of antioxidant enzymes were boosted. In conclusion, the importance of Mel and Trp applications in preserving seed viability, minimizing storage losses, and slowing seed aging has been demonstrated, suggesting practical applications, particularly in preserving seeds of endangered species or valuable breeding materials.",

Due to differences in the quality of raw materials and final products depending on the strawberry clone/cultivar, correct distinguishing clones and cultivars is important for growers, consumers and processors. This study was aimed at distinguishing advanced clones and cultivars of strawberry using an innovative approach involving image processing and artificial intelligence. The raw material included the advanced clones and cultivars of strawberry, such as clone with the breeding code T-201457-16 (Grandarosa × Elsanta), clone T-201536-06 (Clery × Grandarosa), clone T-201567-01 (Patty × Panvik), as well as the cultivars Fibion, Grandarosa, and Markat. The fruit image acquisition was performed using a digital camera. As many as 2172 image parameters were extracted from the image of each fruit converted to different color channels R, G, B, L, a, b, X, Y, Z, U, V, and S and textures with the highest discriminative power were selected to develop models using various machine learning algorithms, such as Multilayer Perceptron, MultiClass Classifier, IBk, and LMT, Linear Discriminant, Quadratic SVM, Subspace Discriminant, and Wide Neural Network. The most accurate classifications were obtained for a model built using Subspace Discriminant (96.30%) and Multilayer Perceptron (95.83%). For the model developed using Subspace Discriminant, clone T-201567-01 and cultivar Markat were completely correctly classified with the highest accuracy of 100%. Whereas in the case of the model built using Multilayer Perceptron clone T-201567-01 was characterized by the highest classification metrics, such as Precision and F-measure equal to 0.983, MCC of 0.980, PRC Area and ROC Area of 1.000.

    "abstract": "Along with roses, carnations, and chrysanthemums, Gladiolus hybridus Hort. is an important ornamental plant species cultivated worldwide for cut flowers with long vase life. The study was conducted outdoors, in uncovered soil, in the years 2022–2023. The plant material consisted of daughter corms of five Gladiolus hybridus Hort. cultivars: Frizzled Coral Lace, Limoncello, Mon Amour, Nova Lux, and Peter Pears. The study used chitosan with a molecular weight of 6000 g ∙ mol–1 at a concentration of 0.4%. The compound was applied by soaking the corms before planting and spraying or watering the plants. The corms were planted into the ground in the third decade of May. During the vegetation period, the course of the development phases was assessed, vegetative and generative traits were measured, and the corm yield was evaluated at the end of cultivation. Chitosan determined the course of the development phases, but this depended on the cultivar traits and the application method. The plants treated with chitosan grew taller and produced more leaves, but they did not differ in the number and diameter of the developed flowers from those not exposed to the biostimulant. Other vegetative and generative traits largely depended on the method of chitosan application. Watering and spraying demonstrated the most beneficial effect of the methods evaluated. Regardless of the method of delivering chitosan to the gladioli, it resulted in a higher weight growth index in the daughter corms.",

This study aimed to identify optimal cultivation strategies for improving yield by evaluating the combined effects of sowing time, plant density, and fertiliser dose across three dry bean varieties under field conditions in Nyíregyháza (Hungary) from 2015 to 2017. The results revealed that all three agronomic factors significantly influenced yield and its components, with varietal differences in response patterns. Sowing time and plant density consistently affected pod number, thousand-seed weight, and yield per plant. Fertiliser application had a more variable impact, depending on the variety and year.

    "abstract": "Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) pose a significant challenge to citrus farming worldwide, but their distribution and impact in the Al-Ahsa Oasis, Saudi Arabia (KSA), remain poorly understood. This study investigates the prevalence, diversity, and ecological dynamics of PPNs associated with Hasawi Lumi (Citrus aurantiifolia) trees, a key crop in the region. During the summer of 2024, a survey was performed in ten major Hasawi Lumi-growing areas, with 250 soil and root samples collected. Four genera of PPNs were identified, with Tylenchulus semipenetrans (52%), Helicotylenchus (44.8%), Pratylenchus (42.8%), and Xiphinema (22%) being the most prevalent. The physicochemical properties of the soil (e.g., texture, pH, and minerals) were determined to assess their impact on nematode populations. Our results revealed that soil characteristics significantly affect the distribution of PPNs, with sandy soils and moderate organic matter favoring nematode diversity, while high salinity suppresses it. The current research constitutes the initial attempt to assess PPNs in Hasawi Lumi orchards and offers important recommendations that can be implemented to improve citrus fruit yield in Al-Ahsa Oasis. These results indicate that soil factors must be considered in any attempt to manage nematode infection, reflecting the necessity for adopting strategies to improve the productivity of citrus crops in the concerned area.",

Of the eight genotypes, 58.3% planted ovules regenerated embryo-like structures in breeding line 411, 2.1% in RA-10, RA-11, RA-12 breeding lines and 0.9% embryo-like structures in Opolski. For the gynogenesis induction, B5 medium containing 0.1 mg L–1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid was the most effective from all tested media. On this medium, the highest number of gynogenetic embryo-like structures was obtained. Most of the plants were regenerated on MS medium supplemented with 30 g L–1 sucrose, 0.2 mg L–1 6-benzylaminopurine and 1 mg L–1 indole-3-acetic acid. Thirty nine percent of regenerated plants acclimatized. Cytometric evaluation of gynogenetic plants of four tested genotypes revealed that in three genotypes, 100% of tested plants were haploid. Plants showed diploid ploidy level in one genotype. Isoenzymatic analysis of gynogenetic plants demonstrated that 95% and 70% of examined populations were homozygotic for the phosphohexose isomerase isoenzyme and the aspartato aminotransferase isoenzyme, respectively. During the next generation sequencing, 93% of reads were successfully mapped, from which 83% to 85% were mapped in pairs. For 15% of pairs it was clear that obtained sequence was fully homozygous, the rest of the readings were not unambiguous, but similar to the sequence of a homozygous base pair system.",

As a result of a number of experiments, it was found that increased NaCl concentrations resulted in inhibition of plant growth – even more than 90% shorter growth, as in the case of ivy. In addition, the analyses made it possible to conclude that NaCl influences biochemical changes in plant tissues, in particular chlorophyll, soluble proteins or stress parameters such as MDA or free proline.

    "abstract": "Strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa) are a globally significant fruit crop with high nutritional and economic value. However, their shallow roots and high water demands make them vulnerable to water stress. The effects of microbial inoculants and irrigation regimes on the yield, root colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and photosynthetic efficiency of strawberry cultivars Rumba and Honeoye were investigated. Field and pot experiments were conducted, where plants were subjected to 100% and 50% water supply conditions. The application of Inoculum 1 (C09EX – Pseudomonas sp., Ps150AB Pseudomonas sp.) and Inoculum 2 (JAFGU – Lysobacter sp.) were applied to evaluate their potential to enhance plant growth and resilience under these conditions.A full irrigation regime (100% water supply) significantly increased fruit yield per plant in both cultivars compared to a reduced irrigation regime (50% water supply). Both inoculants positively affected yield, with Inoculum 1 showing the best results under full irrigation and Inoculum 2 under reduced irrigation. Mycorrhizal colonisation of roots was significantly improved by both inoculants, with the highest colonisation levels observed in plants treated with Inoculum 2. Photosynthetic efficiency parameters, such as the maximum quantum yield of PSII (FV/FM) and quantum efficiency of photochemical reaction in PSII (ΦPSII), declined under reduced irrigation, particularly in Honeoye, but microbial inocula mitigated these effects and enhanced performance under both regimes.These findings suggest that microbial inoculants can alleviate the adverse effects of water stress on strawberry plants, enhancing yield and physiological performance. Future research should explore the underlying mechanisms of these interactions and evaluate the long-term benefits of microbial inocula in different environmental conditions.",

The analysis of variance showed that the interaction of year and genotypes was significant for all studied traits, as plant height, leaf length and width, fruit yield, and content of minerals (P, Ca, K, Fe, Zn, Mg), protein, vitamin C, dry matter, crude fat, crude fiber, and total carbohydrates in the fruit. The comparison of means revealed that genotype 13511 had the tallest plants. Aretussa was the best genotype in terms of yield, vitamin C, crude fiber, and protein, and genotypes 51311 and 11121 were the best in P and K. The variation range of the genotype was not wide in qualitative traits, but as a summary of the two years, the three genotypes of 13421, 51311, and Aretussa can be recommended as the best genotypes in terms of fruit yield per ha, while there were close to one another in fruit quality.",

The experiment was differentiated re- garding nickel content (NiSO4·7H2O) introducing: 0 (control); 10; 40 and 60 mg Ni·kg -1 sand, at the same time considering various nutritive requirements of the plant species studied. The obtained results indicate that even the lowest nickel dose applied (10 mg Ni·kg -1 substrate) has caused a significant decrease of yield of the usable parts of lettuce, spinach, zucchini and bean. Further increase of nickel content in the substrate (40-60 mg Ni·kg -1 ) resulted in more intensive yield drop of lettuce and spinach leaves. Under such conditions due to improper generative development, no generative yield of zucchini and bean was obtained. Nickel at amount 10 mg Ni·kg -1 substrate affected the sig- nificant growth of potassium concentration in the leaves of lettuce, phosphorus in spinach leaves, while it decreased phosphorus and potassium concentration in the zucchini and bean fruits causing at the same time significant fall in magnesium content in zucchini fruits and increase in Mg concentration in bean pods. Nickel dose growth in the substrate has differentiated changes in the plant mineral composition to a greater extent. Nickel at amount 10 mg Ni·kg -1 substrate influenced a significant iron growth in spinach leaves, zucchini fruits and bean pods, whereas it decreased Fe content in lettuce biomass. Increased nickel doses have reduced Fe concentration significantly in the usable organs of the vegetable species ex- amined. Generally the growing nickel quantity in substrate affected the successive increase of this metal content in the usable organs of the vegetable species investigated.",

Nitrogen was used in three forms, i.e. lime saltpeter, urea and ammonium sul- phate, and in three doses: 0.2; 0.4; 0.6 Ndm -3 (2001) and 0.25; 0.50; 0.75 g Ndm -3 (2002). The plants' growth, yield and content of nutrients were evaluated and an chemical analysis of the substrate after the harvest was conducted. The studies pointed out a possi- bility of cultivating garden rocket in autumn in an unheated greenhouse. A higher yield of fresh weight was obtained in the treatments with lime saltpetre and urea as compared with ammonium sulphate. Increased doses of nitrogen, independently of the kind of the applied fertilizer, caused a decrease of the yield of rocket fresh weight. The studied plants of gar- den rocket were characterized by a high content of dry matter, vitamin C, protein, potas- sium and calcium. The content of nitrates in the dry matter of leaves was within the range 0.02-0.98%, depending on nitrogen dose and the year of studies. The application of 0.2-0.25 g Ndm -3 of the substrate in the autumn cultivation of rocket proved to be the most advantageous in view of the highest yield of fresh weight, the highest content of vi- tamin C and the lowest proportion of nitrates in the leaf dry weight.",

There are a lot of pot marigold cultivars which differ in colour and in size of inflorescen- ces as well as participation of ligulate flowers. In the field experiment there were five cul- tivars of pot marigold compared: 'Orange King', 'Persimmom Beauty' 'Promyk', 'Radio' and 'Santana'. As far as morphological features are concerned 'Orange King' turned out to be the best. It produced the most numerous and shapeliest inflorescences, with the big- gest number of ligulate flowers. Raw material yield of compared cultivars oscillated from 849 to 1661 kg·ha -1 of flower heads, and the ligulate flowers themselves from 449 to 1141 kg·ha -1 . In both cases the highest yield was obtained by 'Orange King', and the low- est by 'Promyk.' The content of biologically active compounds in inflorescences of par- ticular cultivars also varied: flower heads of 'Persimmom Beauty' contained the highest amount of essential oil (0.41 ml·100 g -1 ), whereas 'Promyk' contained the highest amount of flavonoids (0.56% - expressed in hyperoside). In all cultivars inflorescence receptacle gathered the highest amount of essential oil and ligulate flowers gathered the least. The opposite tendency appeared in the case of flavonoids.",

For main source of this pollution was considered the industrial activity of man, burning mineral fuels, motorization, metallurgy, and different technological processes. On the pollution of heavy metals be subject particularly strongly the terrains industrialized and large municipal centres. Methods were sought cheap cleaning environment from heavy metals. The phytoremediation can be one of such methods using, the plants to phytoextraction these metals. Phytoextraction of nickel by Poa pratensis L., cv. ‘Evora’, Festuca arundinacea Schleb., cv. ‘Asterix’ and Festuca rubra L. sensu lato cv. ‘Jasper’ was investigated in the conducted experiment. Selected species of lawn grasses are used in lawn-seed mixtures. Plants were grown in substrates artificially contaminated with heavy metals. The aim of the conducted studies was to determine which of the applied lawn grass species when growing in a substrate contaminated with heavy metals will accumulate the highest amounts of nickel and whether increasing doses of heavy metals introduced to the substrate will have an effect on the growth and fresh matter of the aboveground parts in the analysed species of lawn grasses. Increasing doses of heavy metals, irrespective of harvest date, did not have a significant effect on fresh matter of the aboveground parts of analysed grasses. Among the investigated grass species, growing in substrates contaminated with heavy metals, Poa pratensis L. ‘Evora’ and Festuca arundinacea Schleb. ‘Asterix’ turned out to be species exhibiting the highest capacity to accumulate nickel. The smallest mean content of nickel was found in Festuca rubra L. sensu lato ‘Jasper’. Analysed lawn grasses species, particularly Poa pratensis L. ‘Evora’ and Festuca arundinacea Schleb. ‘Asterix’, may be used in the management of soils contaminated with nickel.",

    "abstract": "An artichoke is a commonly cultivated vegetable in the Mediterranean region. It is cultivated for an immature flower head. In Poland the artichoke is cultivated as an annual plant because of its high temperature demands. It is difficult to determine the most optimal harvest stage and the most often it is based on expensive chemical analysis. In the years 2007-2009 there was a research undertaken to specify the most optimal harvest stage of flower heads. In order to determine a development stage of head the height of flower bud in the middle part of the receptacle was measured directly after harvest. The unit weight of each head, the level of bracts deflection, content of dry weight, L-ascorbic acid, raw protein, raw fibre and total sugars in whole heads and their fractions: receptacle and bracts were determined. On the basis of obtained results it was stated that the size of flower buds on an inflorescence axis is a sign of full synchronization of head development and changing environmental conditions during artichoke vegetation. The edible part of ar- tichoke, a receptacle, had more dry weight, total sugars, L-ascorbic acid and raw protein and less raw fibre in comparison to inner bracts. The increase of flower buds height on re- ceptacle was accompanied with the increase of dry weight, raw fibre and total sugars con- tent in heads and its fractions. The longer flower buds in the middle part of inflorescence the lower content of total protein in whole heads and bracts and the higher content of this component in receptacle. It was stated that the size of flower buds was negatively corre- lated with content of L-ascorbic acid as with the increase of flower buds height in recep- tacle the content of L-ascorbic acid in whole heads and it's fractions decreased. The ob- tained results show that the level of bracts deflection may the selection indicator to deter- mine harvest maturity. This feature of artichoke head allows to visually determine its har- vest usability. Receptacles of Symphony content more dry matter, total protein and less total sugars than those of Madrigal. Intermediate values were found in Symphony and Madrigal for L-ascorbic acid and crude fibre.",

An experimet was established to evaluate an effect of soil mulching with synthetic materials (black polyeth- ylene film, black polypropylene nonwoven 50 g·m, black fabric 94 g·m -2 ) on the fruit quality and nutritive value of two melon cultivars ('Seledyn', 'Yupi') cultivated in the field under the climatic conditions of central-eastern Poland. The greatest numbers of fruit per 1 m 2 and marketable fruit were harvested in the year 2007 which was most favourable for melon growing compared with the remaining study years. The number of the fruits which were either unripe or showed symptoms of decay did not differ significantly in in- dividual study years. 'Yupi' was characterised by a significantly higher total number of fruit and number of marketable fruit than 'Seledyn'. 'Yupi' fruits were less affected by decay than 'Seledyn' which, however, produced significant less unripe fruit. 'Yupi' fruits had significantly more dry matter, total sugars, monosaccharides and vitamin C as com- pared to 'Seledyn'. In both the cultivars examined, higher nutrient contents were deter- mined in the fruit grown using black film mulching.",

These compounds are useful to human health due to their high antioxidant activity. However, most blackberries destined for fresh markets become unmarketable in 2 to 3 days due to decay and leakage, because they have thin and fragile skin. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of salicylic acid (SA) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) on extending the postharvest quality and bioactive compounds of blackberry during refrigerated storage. Blackberry fruits cv. ‘Jumbo’ were dipped in 2% CaCl2, or in 2.0 mM salicylic acid (SA) for 10 min. Total soluble solids contents, titratable acidity, pH, ascorbic acid contents, total phenolics contents, and total antioxidant activity were investigated initially on 4th, 7th, or 10th day (d) of storage. Changes in fresh weight, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid and total phenol contents were markedly delayed by both treatments. Berries treated with 2 mM SA or 2% CaCl2 exhibited markedly better visual quality during the storage period. Considering the overall findings, this study revealed that postharvest SA or CaCl2 applications maintained the storage-life and conserved the valuable marketing features of blackberries over 10 d in cold storage, presumably due to their inhibitory effects on fruit senescence.",

In the analysis of the effect of plant spacing upon hyssop yielding, it was revealed that the highest fresh herb yield (on average 1.47 kgm) was from plants grown in the spacing of 40 × 40 cm, similarly to yield of the dry herb and yield of herb without stems. No significant effect of plant spacing was found on the contents of dry matter, L-ascorbic acid, chlorophyll, carotenoids, oil, tannins and flavonoids. It was demonstrated, however, that the harvest term significantly effects the contents of L-ascorbic acid, chlorophyll, carotenoids and essential oil in hyssop herb.",

The mainly sucrose (10–50 g dm), glucose and fructose (15.8 and 30 g dm) were tested in three subsequent passages. Then the usefulness of saccharides in different applications of in vitro cultures was assessed. The basic MS medium supplemented with BA (1 mg dm), NAA (0.1 mg dm), and GA3 (0.1 mg dm) was used. Saccharides in tested concentrations influenced development of in vitro cultures. Proliferation of axillary shoots remained comparable whereas the development of adventitious shoots significantly and the frequency of vitrification decreased while the concentration of sucrose increased from 20 to 40 g dm. Glucose (15.8 g dm) stimulated both proliferation and elongation of axillary shoots. Sucrose (10 g dm), and fructose (15.8 g dm) favoured development of adventitious shoots and vitrification of cultures. The media supplemented with sucrose (30–40 g dm) or glucose (15.8 g dm) may be recommended for micropropagation of true-to-type plants, whereas sucrose (50 g dm), and fructose (15.8 g dm) for long term storage, and plant breeding, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Intercropping of vegetables is experiencing a renaissance with the uptake of or- ganic farming. Cultivation of several plant species simultaneously eliminates negative traits of homogenous cultivation, supports bio-diversity and remains compliant with the rule of balanced agriculture. Carrot and root parsley are two vegetables that have very high requirements towards the conditions of growth. Their cultivation together with other species is a conscious introduction of competitive plants, therefore it was interesting to observe their reaction to intercropping. Among various combinations of compared culti- vation types, intercropping with onion turned out to be most beneficial to both carrot and parsley. The ones cultivated together with onion created the highest yield of marketable roots, total yield and yield of leaves. Onion growing next to them had positive effect on the structure of root yield, especially in case of carrot, increasing commercial root share. Intercropping of carrot and parsley with marigold had unfavorable effect on yielding and growth of these vegetables. Intercropping did not affect the number of carrot and parsley emergence, nor yield of fine roots. Total marketable yield of root vegetables obtained from intercropping with onion was greater than that from homogenous cultivation. The ef- fect of intercropping of carrot with parsley was modified by a year of research.",

Its raw material - rhizomes and roots are collected from nature, however due to the intensive collecting, natural populations are highly threatened. Therefore, this is important to understanding the biology and variability of roseroot and introduction of this species to the culture is very important. The objective of this study was to acquaint the biology and morphology of Rhodiola rosea L. plants during seven following years of cultivation in south-eastern part of Poland. Results of our experiment indicate that the rate of growth and development of roseroot in a south-eastern Poland did not differ from that observed in other parts of Europe, but was faster than observed wild growth in the Altai Mountains. The life cycle of plants from bud to fruit production takes place within one growing season. Starting from the second year of vegetation throughout next following vegetation periods plants produced shoots of second or from the third vegetation period - of third generation, so the period of accumulation of biologically active substances extended to five months, causing a rapid increase in weight of rhizomes. Weight and dimensions of the aerial and under ground parts of plants have changed in subsequent years of vegetation. In the first year of cultivation plants produced one to three stems and under ground parts with average air dry matter of 2.38 g plant -1 . In the next following vegetation periods weight of rhizomes and roots systematically increased, reaching the highest value from fourth to sixth year of vegetation.",

We analysed fungistatic activity of this isolates. From the endosphere of tested plant Alcaligenes faecalis and Bacillus licheniformis were isolated. The most numerous epiphytes were the copiotrophs and a bit less numerous were oligotrophs, bacteria cultivated on Bunt and Rovir's medium and fungi. The least numer- ous bacteria were Azotobacter sp. Among all the molds dominant were: Cladosporium herbarum, C. cladosporioides and Alternaria consortialis, A. alternata, Clonostachys ro- sea f. catenulata (Gliocladium catenulatum), Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Penicillium terrestre.

Each dose was dissolved in acetone and 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg of the plant extracts found in 1 ml solution were sprayed on the 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th instar larvae of T. pityocampa in the Petri dishes, corresponding to 2.08, 4.16 and 8.33 mg�� l -1 air concentrations. Petri dishes were covered with a lid. All tests carried out at 26oC (±2), 60% (±5) relative humidity and 14/10 h light/dark photoperiod in laboratory conditions. When exposure, mortality of the larvae was after the determined at 24, 48 and 96 h. Petri dish applied with sterile water and acetone were used as control group. All the tests were made in triplicate. The results showed that six plant exracts have a larvicidal ef- fect on the 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th instar larvae of T. pityocampa in comparison with controls. Therefore, these naturally occurring plant extracts could be useful for managing the larvae populations of T. pityocampa.",

Strawberry is a plant of large demand for water along with a high susceptibility to drought. In the present study, the response of three strawberry cul- tivars ('Elsanta', 'Honeoye', 'Grandarosa') grown under greenhouse conditions to water deficiency was examined by evaluating the yield and morphological (leaf and root develop- ment) and physiological (leaf gas exchange, leaf water potential) parameters. Plants were subjected to two different water regimes: optimal irrigation (control, water potential in the growing medium was maintained at the level of -10 kPa), and reduced irrigation (stress treatment, water potential in the growing medium was maintained at the level of -30 kPa). Genotypes differed in their response to water deficiency. Cultivar 'Elsanta' presented high rates of net photosynthesis with high value of water use efficiency (a ratio of photosyn- thetic rate to transpiration rate) under water shortage conditions. Water stress affected plant vigor. The weight and total leaf area of the stressed 'Honeoye' plants were considerably reduced as compared to these of the control. No significant differences in weight and root length were observed between the well-irrigated and stressed 'Elsanta' plants, while the root development in two other cultivars was retarded. Under water deficiency conditions 'Elsanta' gave the highest yield whereas 'Honeoye' the lowest. Among examined culti- vars, 'Elsanta' appeared to be more drought tolerant which was reflected by both growth and yield parameters.",

The effect of multi-nutrient complex fertilizers (HydroComplex, Ni- trophoska Blue Special and Viking 13 representing the nitrophoska group, and Polimag S from the amophoska group), and single-nutrient fertilizers (ammonium nitrate, single su- perphosphate and potassium sulphate) on tuber quality of very early potato cultivars ('As- ter', 'Fresco', 'Gloria') was compared in a three-year field experiment. It was found that the single-nutrient and multi-nutrient complex fertilizers did not affected the dry matter, starch and L-ascorbic acid content in tubers of very early potato cultivars, but they in- creased nitrate (V) content. Of the multi-nutrient complex fertilizers, only HydroComplex containing most of magnesium and sulphur of all with the nitrophoska group significantly increased nitrate (V) content in tubers, on average by 4.0 mg N-NO3 kg -1 of fresh weight and, as result, reduced the ascorbate-nitrate index, compared with the single-nutrient fer- tilizers. The fertilizers applied in the study had no effect on the content of mineral com- pounds in potato tubers, except of potassium.

    "abstract": "Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) is known as a herbal plant all over the world. The yield of coriander fruit is influenced by weather conditions, agronomic and genetic factors. This paper discusses the impact of the year of research and date of sowing and their mutual interactions on yield and yield components of coriander and on the con- tent and chemical profile of essential oil in coriander fruit. It has been demonstrated that air temperature and precipitation during each season had a determining effect on coriander fruit yields and yield their component. The weather conditions in 2007 were most favour- able for the growth and development of coriander, which then produced the highest fruit yield (1.54 to ha -1 ). The date of sowing did not differentiate yields of coriander. However, yields of coriander were determined by interaction of sowing date with years of research. In north-eastern Poland, a date of sowing which falls between April 10 and 20 seems to ensure best coriander yields (1.40 to ha -1 ). When coriander was sown later, the yield tended to be lower. Coriander yielding was positively correlated with the weight of fruit per plant. The content of essential oil in coriander fruits was distinctly different between the years of the experiment. The content of oil in coriander fruits was slightly raised by a later sowing date. The main component of coriander essential oil was linalool, which made up 65-67% of its chemical composition. The year of the experiment rather than the date of sowing differentiated the composition of coriander oil.",

Nursery tree quality is influenced by many factors, among which the method of tree propagation plays an important role. In these experi- ments, the knip-boom (KB) trees produced in the 3-year cycle, from either sleeping buds (B) or bench-grafts (G), were compared in terms of tree quality parameters. B-trees out- performed G-trees in trunk diameter, total shoot extension, and in the number of shoots > 10 cm. No significant differences were found in such features as tree height, apical domi- nance and the percent of the number of shoots suitable for tree training. Studies on spatial configuration of lateral shoots and their length did not show any essential differences in the shape of canopy between both tree types. However, lateral shoots of B-trees were sig- nificantly longer than those of G-trees. Linear correlations between different quality char- acteristics in both types of trees demonstrated greater strength of either positive or nega- tive correlations in G-compared with B-trees. We have not found any essential differences between B- and G-trees in nursery tree performance; therefore for a full evaluation of the trees produced by either method of propagation should be based on the analysis of nursery production economics and orchard performance of the trees (B and G) used.",

Two tomato cultivars: typical cherry ones as 'Dasher' with red skin and 'Organza' with yellow skin were grown in the years 2008-2009. Half of the plants were grafted on the stock of 'Maxifort '.Tomatoes were cultivated on organic media such as coconut fiber slabs, wood fiber slabs and rockwool slabs. Grafting increased yielding of cherry tomato in particular cultivated on coconut fiber and wood fiber slabs. The grafting plants of 'Dasher' cultivar produced much more fruit than not grafted ones. The increase of fruit weight as a result of grafting was observed in 'Organza' cultivar. Grafted plants of 'Organza' had significantly less fruit with BER than not grafted ones. 'Dasher' yielded considerably less than 'Or- ganza'. 'Dasher' produced the highest yield at the begining of harvest time. The yielding of 'Organza' was at the same level during the entire harvest time. Early yield of both cul- tivars was the highest on the wood fibre slabs with grafted plants.

    "abstract": "Cornelian cherry is a little-known plant that can be grown in Poland both on a commercial and amateur scale. The commercial cornelian cherry plantations should be established using selected cultivars or vegetatively propagated valuable ecotypes, as only this guarantees a uniform yield, maturation and standardization of fruit quality. The experiment was carried out in 2014 and 2015 in the private plantation of cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) located in Dąbrowica, near Lublin (22.454 N; 51.270 E). The subject of the research were ecotypes No.: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15 obtained as seedlings in 1998. Cornelian cherry plants obtained from seeds differed very much in the yield and quality of fruit. The fruit characteristics for the examined ecotypes ranged to 1.63–2.21 g for fruit weight, 1.30–1.61 for fruit shape index, 10.13–15.32% for content of stone, 17.85–22.68% for soluble solids content (SSC), 2.32–3.0% for titratable acidity (TA), 6.59–8.36 for SSC/TA, 54.9–75.97 for vitamin C content. Among the ecotypes studied in terms of external fruit features, ecotypes No. 3 and 4 were distinguished due to the largest fruits (mass and diameter) and relatively small share of the stone in the whole mass of the fruit. However, due to the chemical composition, the fruits of ecotype No. 5 were distinguished by the content of extract, extract to acids ratio, sugar, dry matter, anthocyanins and vitamin C content. These fruits enjoyed 55% strong acceptability among adults. The indicated ecotypes can be used in breeding as well as in nursery for obtaining valuable varieties of cornelian cherry for production in Poland.",

In the present research, four sweet cherry cultivars (Summit, Kordia, Lapins and Regina) grafted on Colt and Gisela 5 rootstocks were assessed for morphological traits and productivity. The parameters investigated were: vegetative growth, bearing potential, fruit set, precocity, productivity, fruit growth habit and quality attributes. Compared to Colt, the trees on Gisela 5 had smaller TCSA and the length of two-year-old branches, in the fifth season after planting. Trees on Gisela 5 had a higher number of flower buds per may bouquet compared to Colt, which confirms that bearing potential is highly affected by the rootstock. Growing the sweet cherries on Gisela 5 induced a higher fruit setting in all cultivars except in Kordia. Fruit physical attributes were affected by the cultivar, growing system and experimental year. For all tested cultivars, the yield per tree was significantly lower on Colt compared to Gisela 5. Gisela 5 performed better than Colt, which suggests that Gisela 5 should be used as a rootstock in high density sweet cherry production systems.",

On the basis of the size of the trunk diameter and weight of maiden sweet cherry tree fresh mass as well as on the basis of dry mass of leaves, the strongest vigor of growth was observed on Colt rootstock, contrary to the vigor on GiSeLa 5 rootstock, in which it was the weakest. Maidens produced on Colt rootstock formed more lateral shoots in comparison to other rootstocks. After foliar fertilization, maiden sweet cherry trees growing on Colt rootstock did not show better parameters of growth, except for Maxi Grow Excel preparation that caused better results of growth.

Marigold is a multipurpose plant and rich source of lu- tein and gallic acid, to be explored as an organic priming agent. The purpose of this study was to identify an organic priming agent for organic growing and to develop appropriate methods by using two different species of marigold (Tagetes patula L. and T. erecta L.). Herbal tea obtained from the dried flower of marigold was used as a priming agent for eggplant (Solanum melongena L) cv. Pala seeds. Hydropriming and control seeds were compared with organic priming (T. patula and T. erecta) for germination percentage, mean germination time, germination rate, two different emergence tests, seedling height, seedling fresh and seedling dry weights. Data obtained from the application of organic priming (T. patula and T. erecta) showed a difference in both the germination (82 and 80%), and the emergence (73 and 76%) from Controls and Hydropriming. Seeds emerged in, which unprimed in 52 and 39% respectively, when primed with T. patula, emerged in 73 and 56% respectively. The mean germination time and the mean emergence time were shortened compared with Controls and Hydropriming. MET decreased in 1 cm and 2.5 cm depth sowing from 14.0 and 16.1 days than 10.3 and 11.9 days in Emergence-1 and 10.4 and 10.2 days in Emergence 2, respectively. Seedling quality characteristics were exam- ined in the seedling height, the seedling fresh and dry weights of T. patula and T. erecta applications were also statistically significant.

There are few studies on the effect of tillage systems used for soybean which are carried out in the climatic con- ditions of our country. This proves the need to continue such research. The present study investigated the effect of plough tillage and direct seeding on seed yield and some yield components of two soybean cultivars (Augusta and Aldana) in the climatic conditions of central-eastern Poland. A three-year field experiment was established on lessive soil using a split-block design in four replications. The study showed that cv. Aldana produced higher seed yield by 10.6% compared to the other cultivar; this cultivar was also charac- terized by higher plant density after emergence and before harvest, a higher number of seeds per pod, and higher 1000 seed weight. Seed yield significantly varied depending on the tillage system used. Under conventional tillage, soybean produced 14.7% higher yield than in the case of direct seeding. Compared to plough tillage, no-tillage significantly re- duced plant height and first pod height as well as plant density after emergence and before harvest.",

This is especially important in soilless cultures, in which the amount of nutrients supplied to the rhizosphere has to be strictly controlled. The effect of AMF and two nutrient solution concentrations: standard (S) with average EC 2.6 mS·cm and reduced (R) with average EC 1.9 mS·cm, on the yielding and chemical composition of fruit and leaves of tomato, was investigated. Tomato plants cultivar ‘Admiro F1’ were cultivated in greenhouse with fertigation system in rockwool and straw medium in 2012–2013 years. In the research, no effect of AMF on the total and marketable yield as well as on number of fruit per plant, was detected. A significant lower marketable yield in treatments fertigated with standard nutrient solution (S), compared to reduced solution (R) was detected, which was the effect of smaller number of fruits. Fruits of tomato inoculated with AMF contained significantly more sugars as compared to plants growing without mycorrhization. Significant higher dry matter content was detected in fruit of tomato fertigated with standard nutrient solution (S), compared to reduced solution (R). More total nitrogen was recorded in leaves of plants mycorrhized with AMF, although this increase was not statistically confirmed in every treatments. More calcium was determined in fruits of tomato inoculated with AMF as compared to those harvested from non-mycorrhized plants.",

    "abstract": "Gardens emerge as powerful catalysts for enhancing the well-being of the older generation. The design of a garden plays a significant role in engagement with such an environment. The investigation aimed to determine features integral to the garden for older adults to be applied as design guidelines for therapeutic gardens serving the elderly. A mixed quantitative-qualitative approach was used with a questionnaire focused on eliciting insights into the garden experiences. The respondents comprised individuals from Care Homes and Senior Activity Centres. The results revealed the importance of childhood gardens and associated memories of the elderly. Consequently, the conceptualisation of a garden tailored to the needs of older adults highlights relaxation. A garden should facilitate passive engagement with nature and active involvement in the nurturing of plant life. Botanical preferences encompass a diverse array of flora: roses, tulips, and peonies in the floral domain; tomatoes, onions, and carrots within the vegetables; and apples, pears, and plums within the realm of fruits.",

    "abstract": "Nanoencapsulation of essential oils is a promising strategy for extending their antifungal activity and addressing evaporation and decomposition in unfavorable environmental conditions. This research aimed to synthesize and compare the physical properties of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) containing peppermint essential oil (PE) during 12 months of storage at various temperatures (4°C, 25°C, 27°C with 60% relative humidity, 37°C, and 40°C with 75% relative humidity), and to investigate their antifungal activity compared to free PE. The SLN formulations were prepared using high-shear homogenization and ultrasound techniques and were analyzed using a particle size analyzer, differential scanning calorimetry, transmission electron microscopy, and microscopic images of fungal mycelium to assess encapsulation efficacy. The results showed that the PE-SLNs had a size of 164.2 ±5.8 nm, a PDI value of 0.176 ±0.01, a zeta potential value of –11.3 mV, and an encapsulation percentage of approximately 75 ±0.5%. Overall, the physical properties of the formulations showed a slight and acceptable increase over the 12-month storage period at all investigated temperatures. Furthermore, the in vitro inhibition percentage of free PE at a concentration of 2000 μL L–1 against Penicillium italicum and P. digitatum was 66.7% ±2.6 and 66.8% ±0.8, respectively, while for PE-SLNs it was 88.8% ±0.9 and 89.9% ±1.4. These results demonstrate the potential of SLNs as an effective carrier for sustained delivery of PE with improved antifungal activity during storage.",

Łutówka were tested for Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV), Prune dwarf virus (PDV), Little cherry virus 1 (LChV-1), Little cherry virus 2 (LChV-2), Cherry virus A (CVA), Cherry green ring mottle virus (CGRMV), Cherry necrotic rusty mottle virus (CNRMV), Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV) and Cherry mottle leaf virus (CMLV) using the RT-PCR technique. The results indicated that PNRSV and PNRSV+CVA infected the samples. PDV, LChV-1, LChV-2, CGRMV, CNRMV, CRLV, and CMLV were not detected in any of the tested sour cherry trees. The effect of virus infection on the chemical composition of sour cherry fruits was investigated. The anthocyanin, total phenolic and vitamin C contents, and antioxidant activity were evaluated. The total phenolic compound, vitamin C contents, and antioxidant activity were significantly higher in PNRSV- and PNRSV+CVA-infected than in virus-free sour cherry fruits. The total anthocyanin content in PNRSV- or PNRSV+CVA-infected fruits was lower than in control trees. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the world about the effect of PNRSV or PNRSV+CVA infection on the anthocyanin compounds, total polyphenolic compounds, vitamin C contents, and the antioxidant activity of sour cherry fruits.",

In plants from three passages of three-week-old cultures grown on different nutrient media, the following parameters were evaluated: multiplication coefficient, fresh (FW) and dry (DW) weight (mg), average length of shoots (mm), average number of leaves, leaf length and width (mm). At the rooting stage, data on the rooting frequency, number of roots per rooted micro-cutting and the length of roots were recorded 18 days after the start of the experiment. In the acclimatized plants, leaf area, FW and DW, and the content of photosynthetic pigments were determined 40 days after the transfer to ex vitro conditions. Gas exchange rate and chlorophyll fluorescence were also evaluated for the control and the variants with 6 and 9 μM mTR and memTR. The plantlets grown on cytokinin-supplemented media showed a higher number of leaves than the control. Plantlets grown on nutrient media with 6 and 12 μM mTR were distinguished by the highest FW and DW. In these variants, the shoots were of the greatest length. The plants grown on medium with 6 μM mTR had the highest number of leaves. Control plants had larger leaves. Тhe highest rooting percentage (70%) was achieved in plantlets grown with 9 μM mTR. A higher ex vitro acclimatization survival rate (76–100%) was found in all plants cultured with mTR or memTR compared to control plants (65%).",

This study aimed to compare the effects of growing conditions, such as the use of diffusion glass and LED supplementary light (LED+D), with diffusion and standard glass and HPS lamps (HPS+D; HPS) on the quality and post-harvest shelf life of pink tomato fruit cv. ‘Tomimaru Muchoo F1’ in relation to fruit maturity stage and storage temperature. Fruits were harvested at three ripening stages – mature green (MG), breaker (B) and fully ripe (FR). Fruits of each maturity stage were stored under controlled conditions in a cold store at 12 °C for MG and B fruits and at 6 °C for FR fruits (at 85% relative humidity), and 20 °C for all ripening stages (at about 50% relative humidity). Physiological weight loss, dry weight, hardness of fruit, fruit color ( L*, a*, b*, a*/b*), total soluble solids, total sugars, ascorbic acid, titratable acidity, pH, lutein, lycopene, a-carotene, b-carotene were determined. Pink tomato fruits harvested from LED-lighted plants in combination with diffusion glass showed the highest shelf life and post-harvest quality compared to fruits from HPS-lighted plants and HPS-lighted crops in combination with diffusion glass. Stored pink tomato fruits from the LED+D combination were characterized by significantly higher total sugars, vitamin C and β-carotene content than fruits from the combination HPS and HPS+D. Tomato fruits, regardless of the maturity stage, at 20 °C had higher fresh weight loss and lower fruit firmness during storage compared to those stored at lower temperatures. Pink tomato fruits stored in higher temperature colored faster and contained a higher concentration of components such as total soluble solids or ascorbic acid and carotenoids.",

Plants for phenolic acids contents analyses were achieved from setting the small bulbs (common onion, shallot) or annual plants from the seedling setting in the case of Welsh onion. In the field cultivation, plants were grown under short-term covers made of perforated PE film and non-woven PP, while forcing was realized in heated and unheated greenhouse. Free phenolic acids contents were determined after plant harvest, when plants reached the size useful for trad- ing in bunches. Phenolic acids contents were determined in shoots and pseudostem by means of spectrometric Arnova method with recalculation onto caffeic acid. Performed study revealed that shoots contained significantly more free phenolic acids as compared to the pseudostem. Referring to the field cultivation, the component concentration in shoots was 0.23 mg100 g -1 FW, whereas due to forcing 0.135 mg100 g -1 FW, on average. Con- tents of phenolic acids at pseudostems of studied plants from the field cultivation were 0.05 mg100 g -1 FW, while at forced plants 0.04 mg100 g -1 FW. No significant differ- ences related to the level of phenolic acids between common onion and shallot were found, both in shoots and pseudostem. However, shoots of Welsh onion contained signifi- cantly less phenolic acids, regardless the cultivation place and cover application. The ac- celerated field cultivation resulted in shoots of Welsh onion was 0.19 mg100 g -1 FW phe- nolic acids in FW, whereas the greenhouse forcing 0.11 mg100 g -1 FW.

    "abstract": "In the world of plants frost is a particularly dangerous phenomenon. Destruc- tive effect of frost on plants is both direct and secondary. The amount of damage done by frost depends on its intensity, frequency, a season of its occurrence and a plant species. The aim of the work was to find spatial and temporal distribution of ground frost in Po- land and to determine effect of minimum air temperature at the ground level on the dates of phenological phases and harvesting and duration of development stages and also on the quantity of cucumber yield of pickling cultivars at the turn of the 20 th and 21 st centuries. Source materials used in the present study were collected from 28 experimental stations of COBORU and from 51 meteorological stations of IMGW in the years 1966-2005. Ground frost was characterised, e.g., by means of average dates of last spring and first au- tumn frost, duration of the period without frost and also intensity and frequency of its oc- currence and a linear trend. Effect of minimum air temperature at the ground level on the growth, development and crop productivity of cucumber was determined with the use of linear and curvilinear regression analysis and the linear trend of occurrence of last spring and first autumn frost and duration of the period without frost with the use of linear re- gression analysis. Ground frost poses high potential risk for field cultivation of cucumber in Poland not only because of the fact that it significantly determines the rate of growth, development and yield quantity of the plant but also because of its high spatial and tempo- ral variability; the highest cultivation risk occurs in north-eastern Poland where significant shortening, year by year, of the period without frost was proved and where the highest frequency of frost occurrence both at the beginning and at the end of the cucumber grow- ing season is recorded.",

More and more frequent use of wal- nut in the city landscape induced a more thorough analysis of the factor causing a signifi- cant decrease in the decorative values of this plant. The aim of this paper was to trace the numerical strength dynamics of Ch. juglandicola occupying the Juglans regia L. trees, re- ferring to the weather conditions system and to determine the harmfulness degree of the above- mentioned plant louse species. Studies were conducted on walnut trees (Juglans regia L.) in Lublin in the years 2006-2008. Three stands in housing estate areas were se- lected for observation: (A) - a park estate of single-family houses (B) - in the University Campus area, and near the street (C) - at the crossroads of busy streets near the petrol sta- tion. The terms of occurrence of this plant louse, as well as the dynamics of its numerical strength were determined against the background of weather conditions. It was established that Chromaphis juglandicola (Kalt.) occurs on the Juglans regia L. trees growing in Lublin town plantings. It was reported that these plant lice occurred most numerously in the year 2007 on the housing estate post. Ch. juglandicola were observed at the bottom side of the leaf blade in dispersion. The terms of spring appearance and autumn disap- pearance of plant lice were significantly affected by the course of weather conditions. Their development was enhanced by warm spring with not very intense precipitation. However the air temperature above 30oC and storm-like down pouring rain in summer limited the numerical strength of Ch. juglandicola.",

The purpose of the study has been to examine cultivar identities based on absorption spectra of plant pigments and to confirm a genetic stability with SCoT and RAPD molecular markers in new Polish lines of Chenopodium quinoa Willd. Spectral analysis of pigments extracted from plant inflorescences in quinoa gives an opportunity to confirm the cultivar identity and identification of 'Faro' and 'Titicaca' cultivars and their new lines. Spectral analysis is an effective method of confirming cultivar identity and it should be used in practice for the identification of cultivars or cultivars lines in Chenopodium quinoa Willd. Analysis of molecular markers indicated by RAPD as well as SCoT technique revealed a high genetic stability of the derivative lines of 'Faro' and 'Titicaca', while variation was detected in plants representing original cultivars: banding pattern different than predominant was present in three plants of 'Titicaca' (genetic distnaces from 7.5% to 55.9%) and in a single plant of 'Faro'(genetic distance 61.2% as indicated by SCoT technique).",

All essential oils screened exhibited a higher level of antibacterial activity against A. tumefaciens and X. arboricola pv. corylina than streptomycin used as a standard in all tests. The antimicrobial effect of streptomycin and five mint oils was at the same level for P. syringae pv. syringae. There were no significant differences in the influence of the chocolate mint oil on the growth inhibition of all bacteria tested. Plant essential oils from pineapple mint, apple mint, spearmint and strawberry mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity against P. syringae pv. syringae and the strongest towards A. tumefaciens and X. arboricola pv. corylina. The essential oils from strawberry mint, pineapple mint, spearmint and apple mint had the strongest effect on A. tumefaciens, and the lowest inhibitory activity was exhibited by the chocolate mint and orange mint essential oils. X. arboricola pv. corylina was the most sensitive to the strawberry mint, pineapple mint and spearmint oils. The chocolate mint oil showed the greatest activity against P. syringae pv. syringae.",

The studies were conducted in the years 2004-2005. The sweet marjoram plantation was established from seedlings produced in a glasshouse. The marjoram herb was collected in two harvest time: in mid July (beginning of flowering) and in early September. The yields of fresh, air dry and grated herb were assessed. The contents of essential oil in grated herb, as well as the min- eral composition of the herb were determined. The significant effect of harvest time upon the yield of fresh, air-dried and grated herb was demonstrated: the greater yield was achieved in the second harvest time (early September). The herb collected at the begin- ning of September contained more essential oil than that cut in mid July. Total nitrogen content was significantly greater in marjoram herb from the first harvest than in that from the second harvest.",

In the modern breeding of chicory important feature is the ability to clonal propagation in vitro culture. The aim of our study was to assess capacity of natural population of wild chicory for plant regeneration from leaf explants. In the first was examined the effect of 16 combinations of various concentrations of IAA and 2iP on the regeneration of shoots from leaf explants (0.5 cm 2 ). After that, 25 plants were propa- gated on the medium which was found as optimal. Then, their callus growth and shoots regeneration capacities were compared. Later on, was examined the effect of various IAA concentrations on the rooting of shoots. The majority of the shoots was regenerated from callus but direct organogenesis was also observed (8%). Shoot regeneration was found to be the most efficient on MS medium containing 0.5 mg dm -3 IAA and 4 mg dm -3 2iP - 97% of the explants produced shoots, while the average number of shoots was 15.5. The amount of callus was found to be a highly heritable trait (h 2 = 0.83). Lower the heritability coefficients were obtained for the number of shoots per explant (0.55) and the average shoot weight (0.40). The wild chicory shoots rooted easily. The number and weight of roots increased with the increasing concentration of IAA.",

Increasing rates of nitrogen in the form of ammonium nitrate (34% N): 0.3; 0.6; 0.9; 1.2 g N·dm -3 of growing medium, were applied in all investigations, while the other macronutrients were the same for all plants. The obtained results revealed that the salt concentration in the growing medium depended both on the rate of nitrogen and the plant grown. Significantly lower crop yield was recorded when the highest nitrogen rate was applied (1.2 g N·dm -3 ), although this relationship was shown when there was high varia- tion in EC in particular types of medium. It was found that excessive salt concentration in the growing medium due to increasing nitrogen rates significantly reduced vitamin C con- tent in butterhead lettuce and leafy celery. An opposite relationship was observed for kale leaves. It was found that the protein levels in the tested plants increased with an increase in nitrogen rates. As compared to the lowest rate, the increase was 32.2% for butterhead lettuce, 30.6% for kale, and 41.2% for leafy celery.",

It can be used as a spice and component of numerous dishes. Due to an increase of needs for that material in cuisine, it is necessary to work out nutritional requirements of the species. Therefore, the aim of present study was to evaluate the influence of mulching using pine bark and various nitrogen nutrition rates (0; 75, and 150 kg N. ha -1 ) on bear garlic growth in the field cultivation. Mulching the soil with a bark had positive effects on bear garlic growth, which was expressed as the length and width of leaf blades, length of petioles, as well as weight of leaves and bulbs. The bear garlic leaves were of 263.1 mm length and 58.6 mm width in bark-mulched objects at the harvest time. The weight of foliage from a single plant ranged from 5.64 to 7.10 g, which was almost twice as high as in non- mulched cultivation. Nitrogen nutrition had no univocal influence on morphological traits of bear garlic, while some positive effects of that factor on weight and yield of leaves was recorded. The highest-weight bulbs were achieved in objects that were mulched with pine bark and fertilized with 75 kg N. ha -1 . It was found that optimum growth and yielding con- ditions for bear garlic were created by field cultivation using pine bark as a mulching and moderate nitrogen nutrition.",

Isabella (Vitis labrusca L.) grape cultivar were treated with four different boric acid (H3BO3) doses (control, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%) at two different periods (a week before and after full-bloom). The effects of foliar boron treatments on yield, quality and leaf nutrients were investigated. Boric acid treatments positively influenced cluster weight, width and volumes and increasing values were observed with increasing boron doses. Boric acid treatments also influenced berry homogeneity and yielded more homogeneous appearance. Chlorophyll contents increased with increasing boron treatments. The greatest yield, cluster length, cluster volume, cluster size, cluster width, berry width and leaf area were obtained from 0.3% boric acid treatments. In general, leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, zinc and copper concentrations increased, but potassium and iron concentrations decreased with increasing boron doses. As compared to control treatment, all treatments had broader leaf sizes and higher chlorophyll contents. Especially 0.3% boric acid treatments had quite positive influences on quality, size and color homogeneity. Considering the nutrients and pH level of experimental soils, it was concluded that foliar nutrient treatments may support plant growth and development and 0.3% boric acid treatments were recommended for high quality and quantity yields in Isabella grape cultivar.",

Two wild and one commercial strains were objects of the study. Despite some morphological differences among basidiocarps, all strains belong to G. lucidum sensu stricto, which was confirmed by analyses of ITS, tef1-a and rpb2 gene sequences. Wheat straw showed as a good substrate, namely the periods required for the complete colonisation of wheat straw by mycelium as well as the formation of primordia and basidiocarps were relatively short. The totally fresh and dry yield and biological efficiency were also significant. If it is taken into consideration that untreated wheat straw was used, validities of its introduction in industrial-scale G. lucidum cultivation can be demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of Pseudomonas strains and arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) in enhancing strawberry yield and phenolic and antioxidant capacity on a phosphorus (P) deficient calcareous soil. The experiments were conducted in three replicates with six treatments (four Pseudomonas strains, AMF and control) and three rates of P-fertilizer (0, 75, 150 kg P ha–1). Application of higher phosphate rates decreased total antioxidant capacity, total phenolic and flavonols content, whereas AMF and Pseudomonas strains increased quality and P concentration of fruit. The use of AMF and Pseudomonas strains resulted in better quality when used along with 75 kg P ha–1. These results demonstrated that the rhizospheric microorganisms improved the quality of fruit, especially when they applied in combination with lower rates of chemical fertilizers. Therefore, application of these microorganisms in sustainable agriculture is recommended.",

In this research, the possibility of chilling tolerance of cucumber seedlings was investigated through employing the drought and low-temperature pretreatments. The factorial experiment consisted of two factors including cucumber cultivars (i.e. ‘Super Dominos’ and ‘Super Star’) and hardening treatments (control, low temperatures at 10°C, and 15°C and drought simulated by 10% and 20% PEG) based on completely randomized design (CRD) in 3 replications. After applying treatments and providing them 48 h opportunity to be recovered, the seedlings were subjected to 3°C for a six-day period and 6 h for each day. All hardening treatments improved seedlings’ growth, chlorophyll content, total phenol (TP) and antioxidant enzyme activities, while reducing chilling injury index and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Comparing to temperature hardening, the drought pretreatment showed to have a better effect on inducing the chilling tolerance into cultivars. Overall, the results of this experiment showed that employing drought and low-temperature pretreatments enabled cucumber seedlings to mitigate the harmful effects of chilling.",

In this study, three additives: (i) supplemental Ca (5 mmol L–1) to nutrient solution, (ii) foliar application of micronutrients (Fe, Mn and Zn at 60, 160 and 110 mg L–1, respectively), and (iii) combination of both of them were evaluated aiming to reduce the negative impact of salt stress on tomato plants cultivated in a soilless culture and improve the internal quality of fruits. The obtained results show that salinity reduced vegetative growth and physiological parameters, fruit yield and its components, and even more lowered fruit market classification of tomatoes. Salinity treatment reduced most of essential macro- and micronutrients in tomato fruit, whilst Na content was increased. Tomato productivity and fruit quality were ameliorated under saline conditions by increasing Ca into nutrient solution and applying a foliar application of micronutrients. A com- bination of both additives ranked the first to alleviate the adverse effects of salinity on tomatoes, followed by solo supplemental Ca into saline nutrient solution. On the other hand, the internal fruit quality of antioxidant compounds, such as vitamin C, lycopene, α-carotene, β-carotene and lutein as well as acidity, total soluble solid and dry matter percent, were increased under saline conditions.",

It was observed that the concentration and peak intensity val- ues of Ca, Fe, Mn, P, Zn, Cl, K, Na, Mg and Si elements were higher in the haricot beans samples grown under organic farming regime. Likewise, Al and Sr levels were found in higher levels in the samples grown under conventional farming regime. Our findings clearly revealed that organic haricot beans are likely to have higher nutritional mineral content. And the haricot beans samples grown under conventional farming regime could contain harmful metals like Al and Sr that might damage the various systems and/or or- gans of humans and animals.",

Traditional methods of reproduction of this protected species are hardly efficient; hence, the method of in vitro culture provides the possibility of increasing the multiplication coefficient, which in turn would facilitate in- troduction of arnica into crop production. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of cytokinins and their concentration on multiplication of shoots and the effect of different concentrations of auxin on rooting of multiplied shoots of Arnica montana. The plants of mountain arnica were propagated from shoot tips placed on the MS agar (0.7%) medium supplemented with NAA (0.1 mg ·l -1 ). One of the four cytokinins, i.e. BAP, KIN, 2iP and Z, was applied at the concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg ·l -1 . After 5 weeks of the in vitro culture, the shoots obtained were transferred to the MS agar medium supplemented with 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg ·l -1 NAA for rooting. The greatest number of the explants re- generating shoots and the shoots number were found in the MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg·l -1 BAP. KIN at the concentrations of 1.5 and 2.0 mg·l -1 exerted the most sub- stantial impact on the shoot length. No change in shoot length and weight was found in the case of Z, and a bigger number of shoots was obtained at its concentrations ranging 1.0 to 2.0 mg·l -1 . The shoots of the mountain arnica were characterised by high rhizogenic capacity. The biggest numbers of rooted shoots were found in the medium containing 0.1 mg·l -1 NAA. Plants with the greatest number and weight of shoots were obtained in the same medium, while the longest roots were found at 0.05 mg·l -1 NAA.",

    "abstract": "Study on potential mechanisms influencing the growth of raspberry and strawberry plants showed that the most active was Bacillus sp. strain AF75BC producing IAA and siderophores, and having the ability to release phosphorus. The latter feature was also present in the strains Sp115AD (B. subtilis) and SP116AC (Paenibacillus polymyxa). Two of the tested strains: SP116AC and JaFGU (Lysobacter sp.) showed the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, while the AF75AB2 (Bacillus sp.) produced siderophores and IAA. All strains showed an antagonism toward the most important pathogens of strawberry and raspberry, i.e. Verticillium dahliae, Botrytis cinerea, Phytophthora cactorum and Colletotrichum acutatum, limiting their growth to a different extent on the PDA medium. Inoculation of raspberry roots with the tested bacteria resulted in an increase of some growth parameters of their above-ground part in cv. Poemat. In the case of cv. Polana, a significant increase was found only in the chlorophyll content in the leaves. All the inoculants caused an increase in dry mass of roots in cv. Polana, and in cv. Poemat similar effect was observed after applying Inoculants 1 and 3. The treatments of strawberry roots with any of the inoculants resulted in a significant increase in the total leaf surface area in cv. Rumba, but they had no effect on the chlorophyll content in the leaves of either cultivar. All the inoculants significantly increased the total length of roots and their total surface area in cv. Rumba. This parameter also increased in cv. Elsanta, and the number of root tips also significantly increased in this cultivar. Our study showed that the tested inocula is a promising alternative as a bio-fertilizer for small fruit production in sustainable and organic agricultural systems.",

    "abstract": "Vegetable crops produced in the field from transplants for early harvest are ex- posed to various stressful conditions. Standard treatment for transplants before planting out is hardening, through lowering the temperature or less-frequent watering. This process launches several plant defensive mechanisms against stress. However, chilling must be adjusted to specific crop species or even cultivars, because their response to low tempera- ture may be different. The aim of the present experiment was to determine the effect of transplant chilling on the morphology of broccoli inflorescences. The experiment was conducted in the years 2011-2012. Broccoli transplants were chilled for 1 week or 2 weeks at 6, 10 and 14°C. Control plants were exposed to 18°C. Bud diameter and bud stalk length of broccoli inflorescences were measured, as well as diameter and weight of mature heads. In response to longer transplant chilling period, in the following growing stages plants formed inflorescences with longer bud stalks compared to the non-chilled control. The same tendency was observed for bud diameter in inflorescences. The greatest diameter of buds was noted for plants exposed to 10°C in comparison to the control, with buds about 29% smaller in diameter. Mean diameter of mature heads was the lowest for control plants, while the widest was obtained from plants chilled at 6°C or 10°C for 2 weeks, depending on the year. Chilling of transplants positively influenced the weight of broccoli heads at harvest in most cases, and the heaviest heads were obtained as a result of transplant chilling at 6°C. Relationships between temperature and some parameters of broccoli heads were found and regression equations were created.",

The regeneration in vitro of adventi- tious shoots from ligulate florets can lead to the separation of chimera components, result- ing in producing a new cultivar. There was determined the effect of various factors on the number and length of shoots regenerating in vitro from ligulate florets of Chrysanthemum × grandiflorum (Ramat.) Kitam. 'Cool Time'. The ligulate florets were inoculated on the MS (1962) medium supplemented with cytokinin (0; 4.44; 8.88; 13.32; 22.20 μM·dm -3 BAP; 4.65; 23.23; 46.47; 69.70 μM·dm -3 KIN) and auxin (0; 0.54; 1.08; 1.61; 2.69 μM·dm -3 NAA). Most shoots regenerate when 8.88; 13.32 μM·dm -3 BAP or 69.70 μM·dm -3 KIN and 2.69 μM·dm -3 NAA or 8.88 μM·dm -3 BAP and 1.61 μM·dm -3 NAA are supplemented.

The changes in all the analyzed physiological parameters depended on the duration of the pest feeding. The outflow of electrolytes, TBARS content and catalase activity was the highest in the first period of the experiment (after 24-hour of mealybug feeding). Significant increase of peroxidase activ- ity and proline content was noted after 7 days of insects feeding. The values of all ana- lyzed parameters (except EL) demonstrated a decreasing tendency after 14 days of P. longispinus feeding.

The covering plant competes with the fruit tree, what can result in the reduced growth and yield. At the Fruit Experimental Station of the Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, in a young apple orchard mulched with blue fescue (Festuca ovina L.), the growth, cropping, and fruit quality were evaluated. In spring 2009, trees of the 'Ligol' cv. budded on the M.9, M.26, and P 60 rootstocks were planted, and in the following four years (2010-2013) blue fescue was being sown in the tree rows. Prior to the introduction of the living mulch, a herbicide fallow was maintained. The sowing of blue fescue as early as in the second year following the tree planting caused a significant decrease of the total yield per tree ob- tained in the first four years of the cropping. On the other hand, it contributed to an im- proved coloration of the fruits. Postponing of the cover plant sowing until the third and fourth year following the orchard establishment mitigated the negative influences of the living mulch on the tree growth and yielding, as well as on the fruit quality. As in addition blue fescue satisfactorily protects the soil from weed occurrence, its application in form of a late-sown living mulch could be considered as a promising alternative to the herbicide fallow.",

In the study, some growth and biochemical characteristics of two different types of dwarf and lantern beans were investigated. The study was carried out in an aeroponic environment in a fully controlled climate room with 6 repetitions according to a completely randomized experimental design. In the experiment where two bean types (dwarf and pole types) were used as material, four different salt doses (0, 25, 50, 100 mM NaCl) were used for the salt stress conditions desired to be created. In the study, root length, seedling length, seedling fresh and dry weight, root fresh and dry weights, and leaf area were measured as some growth parameters, while MDA, APX, CAT, SOD activities, and proline and chlorophyll content were observed as biochemical parameters.For both genotypes, salinity induced a marked reduction in growth parameters. In parallel with the aggravation of salinity stress conditions, an increase in MDA, SOD, and proline content occurred. In the other investigated biochemical enzyme activities (APX and CAT), there was an increase up to a certain dose compared to the control and a decrease in the subsequent doses. Additionally, it has been determined that chlorophyll content is stable until the third dose but a significant decrease started after the fourth salt application. These results show that there has been a significant increase in enzymatic defense systems to reduce the effects of salt-induced stress in beans, and it has been observed that dwarf and pole bean types show close responses to salt stress.",

    "abstract": "The propagation of Persian walnut (Juglans regia) using grafting or budding is often difficult due to envi­ronmental factors. Temperature fluctuation and plant water status affect root pressure (xylem sap exudation “bleeding”) during budding or grafting. An experiment was conducted to find the optimum irrigation regime for patch budding (in July) and tongue grafting (in March) of Persian walnut on Juglans regia rootstock un­der three environmental conditions (greenhouse, shade-house and outdoor). The grafted/budded plants were subjected to three irrigation regimes including 1-day, 3-day and 7-day for 4 weeks after grafting/budding. Callus formation and quality, and graft/bud-take were recorded after four weeks. The survival rate and growth of the scions were measured after three months. Based on the results, grafting success under greenhouse, shade-house and outdoor conditions were 66.7%, 42.6% and 17.6%, respectively. The highest graft/bud take (94.4%) was obtained under greenhouse conditions with patch budding. The lowest grafting success (0%) was observed under outdoor conditions with patch budding. Under the greenhouse conditions, irrigation of the grafted plants with 7-day interval resulted in the highest graft success and plant growth. Irrigation with 3-day intervals was the best regime under shade-house conditions, while daily irrigation regime was required to obtain the highest grafting success for the outdoor grown plants. In general, the present experiment re­vealed that modifying outdoor conditions by applying a shade-house equipped by a mist system in warmer area can improve bud-take and success especially in patch budding by 40.76 and 33.1%, respectively.",

It has many compounds such as phenolic, flavonoids, tannins, etc. In this study, green syntheses of Humulus lupulus L. based silver nanoparticles were performed. Accordingly, it was determined that HL-AgNPs gave maximum absorbance at approximately 450 nm and nanoparticle sizes ranged from 30.60 nm to 36.72 nm. The potential peaks of the prepared aqueous extract and HL-AgNPs were determined using FTIR-ATR. It was determined that the synthesized nanoparticles gave 2296.89 cm–1, 1161.05 cm–1, 1112.34 cm–1 peaks. Total phenolic content of HL-AgNPs was determined as 30.62 ±0.02 mg GAE/mL, and DPPH· radical scavenging activity IC50 value was determined as 4.4 ±0.01 mg/mL. Inhibitory effects of HL-AgNPs on α-amylase, α-glycosidase and urease enzymes were studied and IC50 values were determined as 3.10 ±0.01 mg/mL, 9.42 ±0.02 mg/mL and 0.76 ±0.01 mg/mL, respectively. The synthesizedHumulus lupulus L. based silver nanoparticles showed better biochemical activity than the prepared Humuluslupulus L. aqueous extract.

The experiment was established and conducted as a two-factor one, in accordance with a complete ran- domization system: A - pruning method (a = 7), B - topped and non-topped plants (b = 2). Each combination of the examined factors was represented by 20 plants (experimental units). A significant effect of pruning intensity on the quantity and earliness yielding was demonstrated. The highest marketable fruit yield was obtained from plants managed for two (3.82 kg . m -2 ), three (3.98 kg . m -2 ), and four (3.87 kg . m -2 ) guiding shoots. Managing for one guiding shoot significantly decreased the total and marketable fruit number. The highest early yield was collected from plants managed for one and two guiding shoots. A single topping cut performed after the first fruit harvest did not affect marketable yield and marketable fruit number.",

On the basis of cluster analysis three, significantly different, groups of observations in relation to the course of growth and development, determining different volumes of cucumber yields in Poland, were isolated. Cluster 2 included observations which were characterised by high yields (amounting to 37.7 tha -1 for the total yield and 20.1 tha -1 for the marketable yield), and cluster 3 by low yields (respectively 27.6 and 15.6 tha -1 ). The following calendar of agrotechnical dates and phenological phases was conducive to high yield of cucumber (cluster 2): sowing on 14 th May, the end of emer- gence 27 th May, the beginning of flowering 29 th June, the beginning of fruit setting 4 th July, the beginning of harvesting 13 th July, the end of harvesting 24 th August. The delay, in relation to the dates in cluster 2 (high yield), of the sowing date by 6 days, emergence by 16 days, flowering and fruit setting by 18 days, the beginning of harvesting by 19 days, and the end of harvesting by 22 days may contribute to a decrease in cucumber yields even by about 27% and 22%, respectively for the total yield and the marketable yield. Higher than average values of both sunshine duration and air temperature, which during the vegetation season amounted respectively to 7.9h and 17.5°C, were conducive to earlier agrotechnical and phenological dates, and, in consequence, high cucumber yields (cluster 2).",

Foliar-fertilized plants deliver high yields of good quality at lower rates of mineral fertilization. In horticultural practice foliar fertilization is also recom- mended as the most effective method of supplying plants with nutrients under deficiency conditions. An experiment was established to evaluate an effect of foliar application with Florovit and combination Ekolist-Warzywa+Urea on the yield quality of six large-fruit melon cultivars ('Pacstart', 'Yupi', 'Gattopardo', 'Polydor II', 'Seledyn', 'Legend') culti- vated in the climatic conditions of central-eastern Poland. The total yield was achieved from Florovit and Ekolist-fertilized plants did not differ significantly. A higher total yield was achieved from Florovit-fertilized plants compared with control object. 'Yupi' was characterised by higher total yields compared with the other cultivars. The greatest fruit number per 1 m 2 was set by 'Gattopardo'. On the basis of the results obtained it was found that, due to the highest share of marketable fruit, 'Yupi' is the cultivar recom- mended for cultivation under the growing conditions of central-eastern Poland. 'Seledyn' was gave at least unripe fruit whereas 'Pacstart' produced the lowest share of disease- affected fruit. An application of the foliar fertilizers reduced the total sugar and monosac- charides content in melon fruit. Regardless of the kind of foliar feeding, most dry matter in the fruit was produced by 'Pacstart', total sugar and monosaccharides by 'Yupi' and ascorbic acid by 'Legend'.",

Limiting the number of harvests and introducing mechanical harvest, express aiming at decreasing the harvest costs. During studies conducted in the years 2009–2010 the quantity and structure of fruit yield in several tomato cultivars recommended for processing industry. Fruit came from single harvest, conducted in the second half of September. The highest fruit yield and the best fruit yield were these of Dyno F1 and Benito F1 cultivars. The cultivars Asterix F1 and Tenorio F1 yielded at a similar level and the unfavourable feature in their yield structures was high share of small fruits (of the diameter from 4.0 to 3.5 cm) and very small ones (below 3.5 cm). The yield of tomato fruit in the subsequent years was significantly differentiated and depended upon weather conditions. It was demonstrated that in the case of cultivars with longer vegetation periods, including cultivars recommended for processing industry, the harvest of the whole yield is not always possible. In the first study year ripe fruits constituted 94.9%, in the second year – 80.7%. A large number of unripe fruits significantly hinders conducting mechanical tomato harvest.",

Fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose were tested at concentration ranging from 0-50 g dm -3 . The dry matter content, reducing sugars and sucrose in shoots were related to sugar concentrations in the medium and so was the rate of adventitious root formation. Sucrose did not stimulate shoot proliferation and glucose was completely ineffective in rooting induction. The highest number of shoots was produced on the fructose-containing medium. The concentration of 30 g dm -3 appeared to be optimal; the rate of proliferation at 30 and 40 g dm -3 were in fact similar, but the former produced a more favorable shoot length. The number of adventitious roots produced per shoot increased with increasing fructose concentration up to 30 g dm -3 .

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to identify the response of melon accessions and cultivars to salt stress in terms of ion exchange, enzyme activity, lipid peroxidation and photosynthetic pigment contents by mixture modelling. In mixture modeling, it is expected that the data set demonstrates a heterogeneous structure. This heterogeneity is characterized as unobservable heterogeneity. The data set's heterogeneity produces severe deviations in the parameter assessments and the standard deviations. Heterogeneity is overcome when the data set separates itself into homogeneous sub-populations. Mixture modeling was performed using the Mclust mixture cluster program of the statistical software package R 5.2.3. Sub-populations were constructed by evaluating genotypes according to studied traits and correlation analysis was performed using the SPSS software package. The seedlings of 13 melon genotypes were harvested two weeks after salt application (0 mM or 50 mM NaCl) when symptoms of salt stress were observed. Nutrient contents and ratios (K, Ca, Na, K : Na and Ca : Na); superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities malondialdehyde (MDA) chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were measured. Mixture modeling and correlation analysis were used in evaluating the experimental data sets. Differences in responses to salt application were observed among genotypes. While all genotypes exhibited negative responses in terms of K : Na ratio, which is an important parameter of salt tolerance, the smallest decreases in K : Na ratios were observed in the YYU-11 (–57.09%) and YYU-4 (–58.78%) genotypes, indicating them to be the most tolerant to salt stress. In general, enzyme activity decreased in response to salt application, although the responses varied among genotypes, especially with regard to CAT and APX activity. The YYU-29 genotype was notable as the genotype with the highest K : Na ratio (1.79) as well as the smallest change in MDA content under salt stress.",

However, the direction of these changes is usually insect species-dependent. Therefore, the objective of this research was to characterize the indirect effects of galls induced by asexual generation of Neuroterus numismalis (Fourc.) and N. quercusbaccarum L. on photosynthesis by comparing changes in photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments and chlorophyll a fluorescence in foliar tissue with and without galls in naturally growing pedunculate oak trees (Quercus robur L.). The presence of galls of both Cynipidae species caused a significant decrease of chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids contents. Moreover, photosynthetic parameters (F0, Fm, Fv/Fm, Y, qP, qN) were significantly decreased. These results provide valuable information for diagnosing the oak infections using a non-invasive method, such as chlorophyll a fluorescence and predicting the effect of infections on photosynthetic productivity.",

To assess the harvest quality for the plants grown in the two terms fruits were then examined for the chemical quality attributes of cucumber fruit, such as the content of total soluble solids (TSS), total sugars (TS), ascorbic acid and nitrate (NO3) P, K and Ca. Another part of fruits was subjected to sensory analysis performed with the scaling method. The cucumber grown in the autumn growing cycle gave higher yield and the quality of fruits produced appeared more balanced for the plants lighted with HPS+LED or 100% LED as compared to the traditional, overhead HPS lighting. The above, together with the results from the rate of buds' abortion assessment seem to legitimate the increase in the cucumber crop density when applying LED lighting.",

The three-year research period indicates that the vines on '125AA' tended to produce not only the highest yields but had positive influence on the number and weight of clusters and berry weight as well. Whereas the vines grafted onto '161-49C' gave the lowest yields and had the smallest number of clusters per vine. The fruit extract content in 'Regent' grapes on '101-14 Mgt' rootstock was found to be significantly lowest among those under study. The extract content and yield of grapevines evaluated in the own-rooted vines and those grafted to the rootstocks which formed one group, did not differ.",

To overcome the adverse impacts of salinity, the application of organic matter and plant nutrients in the growth media for improving of plant growth is essential. An experiment was conducted in order to determine the response of Salvia splendens to salinity levels and also the role of humic acid in the salt stress alleviation. In the current experiment five salinity (0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mM NaCl) and three humic acid (0, 100, 500 and 1000 mg l−1) treatments were prepared. The effects of these treatments were investigated on some growth parameters, physiological characteristics and also biochemical compounds. The results indicated that the growth parameters decreased in saline-treated plants than control plants. Different salinity levels significantly affected relative water content, evaporation rate and also electrolyte leakage. Salinity caused the increase in proline, malondialdehyde, sugar content, DPPH, total phenol content and decrease in chlorophyll, compare to the control plants. Application of humic acid on Salvia splendens, decrease leaf area and plant height compared to the control plants. Thus, regarding the growth parameters, it is probable that the effect of humic acid on the biochemical compounds is similar to salinity effect. The findings suggest that Sage is a sensitive ornamental plant to salinity and humic acid (in the studied levels) could not alleviate the negative effects of salt stress on this plant.",

The content of these compounds in hot pepper is primarily determined by the ge- netic traits of a cultivar and is modified by various factors: weather conditions during the growing season, fertilization, harvest time, and fruit maturity stage. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of fruit maturity stage: green fruits, fruits turning colour as well as physiologically mature fruits (red), and fruit harvest date: the first and third decade of September, on the content of capsaicinoids in four hot pepper cultivars: 'Cyk- lon', 'Orkan', 'Rokita', and 'Bronowicka Ostra'. In this study, which was carried out in 2005 and 2006, the content of capsaicinoids (capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin) was meas- ured by HPLC. The highest amount of capsaicinoids was obtained in the fruits of hot pep- per that were harvested at the initial stage of maturity - in green fruits (on average 309 mg·kg -1 ), compared to fruits turning red (258) and red fruits (250 mg·kg -1 ). Peppers selected in the third decade of September contained more capsaicinoids (on average 301 mg·kg -1 ) than those harvested in the first decade of this month (243 mg·kg -1 ). Fruits of the evaluated cultivars differed in capsaicinoids content; on average it ranged from 212 ('Cyklon') to 326 mg·kg -1 ('Bronowicka Ostra'). In fruits of all the quantitative ratio of capsaicin to dihydrocapsaicin was at a similar level, ranging between 11.9 and 12.9. The capsaicinoids content in fruits of the investigated cultivars differed between years 2005 (302) and 2006 (243 mg·kg -1 ).",

The studies concerned two cultivars of mountain pine (Pinus mugo) ‘Grześ’ and ‘Zundert’, which were grafted on four different rootstocks: Pinus contorta (Dougl. ex Loud.), Pinus nigra (Arn.), Pinus sylvestris (L.) and Pinus mugo subsp. uncinata (Ramond Domin) in two dates: 20 January and 15 March. The highest percentage of graft success was obtained for the two cultivars on Pinus uncinata and Pinus contorta rootstocks. A later term of grafting procedure affected bigger effectiveness of grafting of the two studied cultivars, except for the graft success on Pinus sylvestris rootstock. The highest increments of side shoots and lengths of main stems for ‘Grześ’ cultivar were obtained on Pinus nigra, and for ‘Zundert’ the influence of the rootstock on the above mentioned parameters was not evident. No significant differences in the number of increments in the first and second year of studies were observed. The highest level of chlorophyll A and B was found in the needles of ‘Grześ’ cultivar, independently from the rootstock used. Among tested rootstocks, only Pinus nigra had a significant impact on a higher content of chlorophyll B in the needles of the studied cultivars of mountain pine trees.",

Therefore, current study was aimed to examine the potential of foliar application of zinc oxide in tomato cultivar Tiny Tim Cherry in calcareous soil conditions. In the current study, all the studied traits i.e. plant height, stem diameter, number of branches per plant, number of leaves, number of flowers per plant, fruit weight and yield per plant were significantly higher after foliar application of zinc oxide (30 ppm) and significantly lower in controlled treatment as compared to other treatments of zinc oxide. The maximum total soluble solids (TSS), chlorophyll A, chlorophyll B, vitamin C, flavonoids, carotenoids and phenolics were recorded in plants treated with 30 ppm of zinc oxide as compared to other treatments. However, the highest acidity was calculated in 10 ppm, while the lowest acidity was measured in 0 ppm (control).

The results showed that seed melatonin content varied significantly during storage reaching its peaks in October-December and lowest levels in August while tryptophan levels displayed an opposite trend with a strong peak in August and low levels in October. Similar seasonal changes were observed in seeds stored under both temperature conditions suggesting that endogenous melatonin could play a crucial role in seasonal rhythms independent of environmental conditions. Lettuce seed quality deteriorated fast when stored at 25°C but pre-treatment with melatonin reduced seed deterioration significantly by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and restoring membrane properties indicating that melatonin could be used to slow the ageing process in seeds.",

    "abstract": "Potassium (K) levels are decreasing worldwide in agricultural soils, and K deficiency is becoming a major issue. Study on damask rose response to K application is scarce. Furthermore, despite its importance in the cell division, photosynthesis and protein synthesis, there is a lack of published reports on plant responses to zinc (Zn) application. Further research is required to understand the damask rose's response to both elements. This study investigated the effects of K and Zn foliar application on the vegetative growth, flower yield, and volatile oil content and composition of damask rose. K and Zn nutrition was applied either individually or combined as K2SO4 and ZnSO4 at 0.5 or 1.0%. Foliar application of K2SO4 and ZnSO4 was applied with a manual pump four times in each growing season, the first at the beginning of stem elongation and leaf formation, and then at two-weekly intervals. Results showed that K and/or Zn treatments significantly improved the growth characters, flower yield, relative water content (RWC), stomatal conductance, and essential oil content and composition such as linalool, nerol, citronellol, geraniol, and nonadecane. The chlorophyll content, total soluble sugars (TSS), and protein content also increased, but free amino acid content decreased, suggesting that the distribution of nitrogenous compounds (between amino acids and proteins) and their transformation were influenced by K and Zn supply. Individual applications of K or Zn increased the N, P, K, and Zn contents in damask rose leaves, relative to the control, which increased further with combined applications of K and Zn. Results suggest that foliar application of K and/or Zn could be part of the damask rose fertilization program to provide plants with the optimum level of nutrition for improving the quantity and quality of flowers and essential oil yields.",

    "abstract": "Bear garlic (Allium ursinum L.) has been well-known to popular medicine for ages and its pharmacological action is similar to that of common garlic. It is a typical geophyte; occupies wet habitats in ravines and near springs, mainly among beeches and riparian forests. Generative reproduction is the main way for population spreading. The present study aimed at evaluating the influence of mulching using pine bark and varied ni- trogen nutrition rates (0; 75 and 150 kg N. ha -1 ) on flowering traits of bear garlic under conditions of the field cultivation. Mulching using pine bark had positive effects on the length of inflorescence shoot, peduncle, inflorescence diameter, as well as number of flowers in the inflorescence and the plant. During a month, i.e. since April till May, sig- nificant increase of inflorescence shoot length at bear garlic has been recorded. In April, they length ranged from 9.0 up to 59.8 mm, while in May from 190.5 to 320.8 mm. Bear garlic inflorescences consisted of 13.4 to 24.0 flowers, with their diameters reaching 19.0 to 53.8 mm. The longest inflorescence shoots and inflorescences with the largest diameter and flower number were produced by bear garlic in the third year of vegetation. No re- markable influence of nitrogen nutrition on inflorescence shoot length and number of flowers per in an inflorescence was recorded.",

This study was undertaken to determine the antioxidant and chemical properties of selected caucasian whortleberry from the native region of Northeastern Turkey. Caucasian whortleberry (Vaccinium arctostaphylos L.), a close rela- tive to cultivated blueberries, were harvested from various sites of Black sea region of Turkey and were analyzed for their total phenolic (TP), anthocyanin (TA) contents, and their antioxidant capacity by FRAP and TEAC assays. Specific sugar and organic acid composition were also determined by the help of HPLC. ARC-1, and ARC-6 displayed the highest TP contents (5780 and 5754 μg GAE g -1 fw). The TA values were spectropho- tometrically estimated and they were varied between 74.7 (ARC-6) and 194.4 (ARC-4) μg del-3-glu g -1 fresh weight basis. ARC-1 had the highest amount (19.5 and 23.4 μmol TE g -1 fw) of antioxidant capacity for both TEAC and FRAP assays. Fructose and glucose were found to be predominant sugars in all genotypes analyzed. The concentrations of fructose and glucose were averaged at 45.1 and 41.2 g kg -1 fw respectively. The organic acid distribution of berries was dominated by citric acid (mean of 9.85 g kg -1 fw). These results may provide evidence that Caucasian whortleberry has strong antioxidant capacity. Also, results of this study may be used for utilization of selected genotypes in the breed- ing studies of close relative vaccinium plants.",

The secondary effect of winter catch crops (VV - hairy vetch, TR - white clover, SC - rye, LM - Italian ryegrass, BRT - turnip rape) and weed control methods on the yielding, biometric pa- rameters of ears and selected components of nutritive value in sweet corn were examined. The effects of an application of green manures were compared to the effect of farmyard manure (FYM ) - 30 t·ha -1 - and control treatment without organic manure (NOM). Two methods of weed control were used: hand weeding and a mixture of herbicides Mustang 306 SE (florasulam + 2.4 D) + Titus 25 WG (rimsulfuron). Cultivation of sweet corn after FYM and VV most beneficially affected the crop's yield performance, ear weight, kernel weight per ear and sugars content. Ears were the longest when harvested in FYM and VV plots and NOM whereas ear fulfillment was the best in FYM and TR plots. Ear diameter was the greatest for sweet corn cultivated after FYM, LM and BRT. The highest dry mat- ter content was determined in kernels of corn following LM and protein content after LM, VV and TR. Ascorbic acid content increased after all the catch crops compared with FYM and NOM. When weeds had been chemically controlled, corn produced larger ears which, however, had less kernel rows compared with hand weeded plants.",

However, fruits of these cultivars differ markedly in the type of the surface and the rate and volume of water transpiration, which is manifested in fruit quality after storage and the length of apple shelf life. A majority of factors responsible for fruit quality and storability are genetically conditioned traits that are mainly developed before fruits reach harvest maturity or still develop during the storage period. The micromor- phology, anatomy, and ultrastructure of 21-day-old fruit buds of the 'Jonagold' and 'Szampion' were examined using light microscopy as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The analyses were particularly focused on the traits that determine fruit firmness and storability, which contribute to long-term storage capacity. It was found that the fruit buds in both cultivars differed significantly in the number of trichome scars and stomata on the fruit surface, the thickness of the hypodermis layer and the hypoder- mis cell walls, and in the content of phenolic compound deposits. At the fruit bud stage, the following features related to increased or decreased fruit firmness and storability were observed: platelet crystalline wax, cuticle microcracks, stomata and trichome scars, and presence of phenolic compounds.",

Results from the field observations and mycological analyses showed that chitosan used in a mixed combination (for seed dressing + seedling spraying + plant spraying at anthesis) was the most effective in pro- tecting soybean from the infection of soil-borne pathogenic fungi. In those combinations the best density of soybean seedlings and plants at anthesis was obtained. The mycologi- cal analysis of infected parts of soybean seedlings and plants at anthesis showed that chi- tosan proved effective in inhibiting the infection of soybean plants from fungi from the genera of Fusarium, Pythium, Phomopsis and Botrytis cinerea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Rhizoctonia solani.",

Two types of multicomponent fer- tilizers with slowed down action from Osmocote Exact group were used: Osmocote Exact Hi-Start and Osmocote Exact Standard. Influence of these fertilizers was studied on growth and yielding of Clematis 'John Paul II'. The longest shoots of Clematis were ob- tained after the application to the substrate of Osmocote Exact Hi-Start and Osmocote Ex- act Standard fertilizers in the dose of 8 gdm -3 . Plants fetrilized with Osmocote Exact Hi- Start obtained the highest weight of their above ground plant parts at the dose of 8 gdm -3 of substrate, while plants fertilized with Osmocote Exact Standard obtained the highest weight of their aboveground plant parts at the dose of 6 gdm -3 of substrate. Plants in a 5-month period of growing with the application of the fertilizers Osmocote Exact Stan- dard did not show any signs of mineral malnutrition. The greatest number of flowers and the greatest weight of flowers was found in plants grown in the substrate with an addition of the fertilizer Osmocote Exact Standard in the dose of 6 gdm -3 . The best fertilizer for the growing of Clematis 'John Paul II' cv. has shown to be Osmocote Exact Standard in the dose of 6 gdm -3 .",

The aim of present research was to ana- lyze the influence of cultivar, plant spacing, and diverse NPK fertilization on yielding and Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn contents in seeds, leaves, and stems of amaranth (Amaranthus cruen- tus L.). The paper was based on three-year field experiment established by means of ran- domized sub-blocks (split-plot) in three replicates and included three variable factors: plant cultivar, spacing (two levels each), and NPK fertilization (four levels). Achieved re- sults indicated that applied experimental factors contributed to a substantial differentiation of Amaranthus cruentus yields. Amaranth reacted with a significant increase of yields due to NPK fertilization. The highest yields were produced when fertilizing was applied at the rate of 90 kg N·ha -1 , 60 kg P·ha -1 and 60 kg K·ha -1 . Use of the highest NPK fertilization (130 kg N·ha -1 , 70 kg P·ha -1 , 70 kg K·ha -1 ) was associated with the decrease of the test plant yielding, regardless of the cultivar or plant spacing. In most cases, the experimental factors exerted significant influence on the contents of analyzed microelements in leaves and seeds of amaranth plants. Analysis of partial eta-squared coefficients indicated that the plant cultivar explained the amaranth's yielding variability to the highest degree, while NPK fertilization - copper, zinc, and iron levels in leaves, and copper and manga- nese in seeds. Manganese in leaves and zinc in seeds was the best explained by the culti- var of the test plant.",

However protecting plants with row covers can prevent losses from untimely frosts and freezes and provide a means to modify the environment around the plant, fa- vorably resulting in more rapid growth, earlier maturity, and possibly increased yields. Experiments were carried out in 2008-2010 at the experimental field of the Agricultural University of Krakow (N 50o4', W 19o50') in order to determine the impact of flat covers made from biodegradable nonwovens produced by the Institute of Biopolymers and Chemical Fibres and CENARO in ‡ od�( .

A plot that remained uncovered throughout the winter served as the control. The covers were kept until spring and were removed one (2009) and two months (2010) before harvest. During harvest, measurements of plant height and marketable yield were taken. In the laboratory harvested onions were estimated for ascorbic acid, dry matter, soluble sugar and nitrates content. The investigations showed that covering onion with biodegradable nonwoven material had a positive impact on yield in the first year of the experiment. There were no significant differences in the yield quantity in the second year. Contents of the analysed organic compounds showed no regular patterns in both years of the experiment. In 2009, the vitamin C, dry matter and ni- trate contents were higher than in 2010. In the second year of the study, the control onions had the most soluble sugars.",

For the experi- ment 33 orchards located in the south and east of Poland were chosen. All organic farms were certified according to UE Council Regulation no. 2092/91 and obtained valid certifi- cates. Unclarified juices were obtained with cold press juicer. After microwave minerali- zation in HNO3 the following nutrient elements were measured: P, K, Mg, Ca, S, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, B as well as Na, Cd, Pb, and Ni. Moreover, ammonium N and nitrates content were evaluated using FIA method. Black currant juices contained the highest amounts of Ca, K, Mg, P, S, Fe, Mn and Na. In the case of Ca, Fe and Mn the measured levels were ten times higher than for other juices. The highest content of Cu was proved for pear, whereas apple juices revealed the highest B amount.

Cherry orchards were established in spring 1999, 2001 and 2002 with the applica- tion of 'Łutowka' cultivar, type IR2. In the orchards planted in 2001 and 2002, trees were spaced in 4 × 1.3 m density (1920 trees · ha -1 ). In the orchard planted in 1999, the tree density was 4 × 2 m (1250 trees · ha -1 ).

However, florist greens frequently first loses its ornamental value in flower ar- rangement, since it quickly wilts, fades, or browns. That is why it is important to develop agents for conditioning cut the florist greens that would extend its vase life effectively and inhibit senescence. Here we report on the effect of growth regulators and commercially available conditioning products on the post-harvest longevity of cut stems of Weigela flor- ida 'Variegata Nana' and certain processes associated with their senescence. Senescence of W. florida cut stems resulted in reduced post-harvest quality, decrease in relative water content (RWC) and an increase in electrolyte leakage (EL) in the leaf tissues. Chrysal Clear 2, applied in the form of 24-hour pre-treatment, was the most effective in extend- ing the longevity of cut stems of W. florida.

Conditioning of W. florida stems in solution of gibberellic acid at concentration of 0.25 mg · dm -3 had the most beneficial effect on the cytoplasmatic membranes.

    "abstract": "In Poland edible honeysuckle becomes more and more popular, especially in amateurish cultivation. There is a little information about cultivation technology. The aim of this study carried out in 2008-2009 was to examine the influence of Goemar ® BM 86 and calcium nitrate on yielding and fruiting quality of two cultivars of blue honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea var. kamtschatica): 'Atut' and 'Duet'. Using the fertilization with cal- cium nitrate, applied to the soil around plants, in April at the rate of 50 kg·ha -1 , alone or with Goemar ® BM 86 (applied three times during the bloom period at the dose of 3 l·ha -1 ) was compared to untreated plants. Fertilizers had no positive effect on the yield and the mass of 100 fruit. Fertilizers did not influence significantly on the dry matter, soluble sol- ids, reductive sugar and anthocyanins content. The influence of Goemar ® BM 86 and cal- cium nitrate on acidity of berries was inconsistent. Honeysuckle berries of cv. 'Atut', after using the mentioned combination of preparations, reacted by increasing in acid concentra- tions, however acid content of 'Duet' berries significantly decreased in comparison to the control. The quality features of honeysuckle berries were strongly dependent on the weather conditions during vegetation period.",

    "abstract": "The harvest date is crucial for the storability of autumn apple cultivars like ’Sampion’ and winter apples cultivars like ‘Ligol’ intended for long storage. Only apples picked at the optimum maturity stage are suitable for storage over 3 months because of better storage potential and organoleptic quality. The research was conducted in the cold storage facility and laboratory of the Department of Pomology of the Poznan University of Life Sciences between 1999 and 2006 and was designed to evaluate and determine the sum of accumulative temperatures for both cultivars. Fruits were collected every 4–5 days starting some weeks before the estimated OHD. Maturity at harvest was evaluated in terms of firmness, TSS, starch disintegration, ground colour and titrable acidity. There were 3–4 main harvests from which fruits were stored in a cold storage facility for 3 months. The storability of apples was evaluated after an equal number of days of storage respectively to their harvest date. The evaluation was based on subjective quality judgments and measurements made after storage. The air temperatures in the orchard were measured every 2 hours. The results obtained from the four loggers provided the basis for the calculation of (a) the average day temperature and (b) the cumulative temperature, for which the values of 0.0°C, 4.0°C, 5.0°C, 10.0°C, and 15.0°C were taken respectively as reference. After eight years of study the optimal value of the SAT for ’Sampion’ was determined at 2550 degrees and for ‘Ligol’ at 2600 degrees with 0°C as the base temperature.

The isolates differed in their host range and symp- toms induced by them on a series of plant species. In addition, the analysis of the genetic diversity of the coat protein (CP) gene revealed high level of nucleotide variability among the isolates. Comparison of the CP gene sequences of 70 isolates from different geo- graphical regions worldwide showed that the Polish isolates belong to different groups and they do not form a monophyletic cluster with European isolates. Interestingly, among the central European ZYMV isolates lower variability has been observed previously. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphic sites showed a dominant negative selection however codons which might undergo positive selection were also identified. Moreover, the evidences for recombination in analyzed sequences of the CP gene of the analyzed ZYMV isolates were provided.",

    "abstract": "With the uptake of organic farming the importance of green manures increases, and the cultivation of cover crops plays an ever important role both in agriculture and in horticulture. The fertilizer value of plants cultivated for green manures is largely depend- ent on the biomass produced, and also the nutrients that were accumulated within it. The aim of this work is to determine the influence of weather conditions in the second half of summer on the fertilizer value of catch crops intended for cultivation of vegetables. The research included: spring rye (Secale cereale), oats (Avena sativa), common vetch (Vicia sativa), white mustard (Sinapis alba), tancy phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), fodder sunflower (Helianthus annuus). The catch crop plants, cultivated as a pre-crop for the cultivation of vegetables proved to be a rich source of or- ganic matter and nutrients for the following crops. The course of weather had a major influ- ence on the volume of biomass, and the chemical composition and fertilizer value of cover crops. Shortage of water and high temperatures after rainfalls, causing the formation of crust on the soil did mostly limit the growth of catch crops. The biggest biomass among the inves- tigated catch crops was created by sunflowers, phacelia and rye, the lowest by common vetch. White mustard and sunflower provided the biggest amount of nitrogen in their role as catch crops. The sunflower proved to be a rich source of K, Ca and Mg. The most Ca was left in the field by tancy phacelia, which also proved to be a good source of K. The biomass of buckwheat provided large amounts of Mg, but it was poor in N, P and S. Rye and oats proved to be a rich sources of P, but they also contained small amount of Ca and Mg. The most sulphur was left over by the biomass of white mustard. The common vetch proved to be the most weather-sensitive of all plants. Its biomass left the least P, K, Mg and S in the field, the Ca content was also small, compared to other catch crops. Nitrogen content of dry matter of common vetch was high, but not the highest in the three year average.",

The state of aggregation determines the water-air relations in soil and influ- ences the thermal conductivity, porosity and density of soil, availability of nutrients, as well as biological processes, etc. In the field experiment with conservation tillage for on- ion we studied the influence of various methods of conventional tillage, no tillage, and disking as well as the biomass of the inter-harvest plants on the aggregation and structure of soil. Secale cereale and Vicia sativa cultivated as inter-crop cover plants favourably in- fluenced the soil aggregation. It was expressed by greater share of valuable soil aggre- gates (o 1-5 mm) and better soil structure index in comparison with conventional tillage (CT), without plant mulches. The leaving of mulches from cover plants on the surface of the soil from fall to spring and direct sowing on onion without tillage (NT) decreased soil cloddiness index. The positive influence of plant mulches on soil structure was mainly ob- served after wintering and in the initial period of onion vegetation. The changes in indicators of soil aggregation under the influence of mulching and simplifications of the soil tillage system for vegetables were predominantly recorded in the soil arable layer of 0-20 cm.",

The research conducted in the years 2006-2008 included valuation of poliphenolic compounds content in different parts of artichoke plants during vegetative and generative growth (roots, petioles, leaves, immature and flower at beginning of flowering). The total content of poliphenolic com- pounds in the reduction on caffeic acid was marked in dried herb with the spectropho- tometrical method with the Arnova reagent. The content of poliphenolic acids (caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic and cynarine) was marked with high performance liquid chromatog- raphy (HPLC). The undertaken studies show that there are significant differences with re- spect to the content of poliphenolic compounds in different parts of artichoke plants. Definitely more total phenolic acids were accumulated in leaves during the vegetative growth (3.167% on average) and in young, immature buds during generative growth (3.730% on average). The chlorogenic acid and cynarine were the main compounds among poliphenolic acids. The content of poliphenolic acids was decreasing with age of plants as young immature artichoke buds had more chlorogenic acid and cynarine than mature heads at the beginning of flowering. The content of caffeic and ferulic acids in the artichoke herb depended on the growth phase of plants. Plants accumulated more caffeic acid in leaves during vegetative growth and ferulic acid in buds during generative growth.",

Differences of potential taxonomic significance were found in the orna- mentation of the fruit and the pistil surface in the Hydrangea species. The examined seeds were characterized by reticulate primary sculpture with different size and shape of the testa cells. The protrusive secondary sculpture was observed on the Hydrangea seeds. The seeds of the Philadelphus species were characterized by the rugate secondary sculpture. The seeds of the Deutzia species had sunken secondary sculpture of different patterns and these differentiations are of systematic importance. The endosperm cell walls were very thin in the Hydrangea and Philadelphus seeds, while they were evenly thick in the Deut- zia seeds. That difference may be of systematic importance. The average thickness of the two-layered testa was 3.51-11.50 μm. Its inner and outer layers thickness varied from 2.27-9.25 μm and 1.24-4.05 μm, respectively.

Apple trees of Golden Delicious cv. on M.26 rootstock were planted in 3.5 × 1.2 m (2381 trees·ha -1 ) spacing. Research involved the effect of diversi- fied levels of potassium fertilization: 12, 16 and 20 mg K 100 g -1 d.m. of soil and three types of potassium fertilizers: potassium chloride (KCl), potassium sulfate (K2SO4) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) on trees yielding and nutrition, as well as nutrient contents in the soil. Potassium fertilization using potassium chloride, potassium sulfate and potassium nitrate resulted in increased content of available potassium both in arable (0-20 cm) and in subarable (20-40 cm) layers of an apple orchard. Increase of available potassium con- tent from 12 to 20 mg K·100 g -1 f. m of soil, due to fertilization with potassium chloride, potassium sulfate and potassium nitrate did increase soil pH (in H2O) in arable and su- barable layers as a result of higher contents of available calcium. Alkalizing effect of po- tassium sulfate and potassium nitrate, generally assumed as physiologically acidifying, occurred on neutral and alkaline soils (pH (in H2O) over 6.90). Fertilization with potas- sium chloride, potassium sulfate and potassium nitrate increased the content of sulfates in arable and subarable layers. The same result was observed in the case of chlorides in su- barable layer. Application of potassium fertilization with potassium nitrate brought about decreased values of available magnesium content only in subarable layer. Due to the use of high rates of potassium nitrate, on the level 20 mg K·100 g -1 of soil, there was observed increased soil salinity (EC) both in arable and subarable layers. Introduction of potassium fertilization and increasingly higher rates of potassium fertilizers did not influence on the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur and chlorine in apple tree leaves. Increasing potassium levels in the soil and potassium fertilizers did not af- fect the yield of Golden Delicious apple trees after coming them into full fruition period.",

Med., Lamium amplexicaule L., Galinsoga ciliata (Raf.) S.F. Blake and Urtica urens L. The numerical force of primary and secondary Spanish salsify weed infes- tation after pre-winter and spring ploughing was similar. Intercrop plants significantly limited the primary and secondary weed infestation of this plant. The smallest quantities of weeds grew in objects where oat was the intercrop plant, and the largest - in cultivation without intercrops. Intercrop plants limited the occurrence of Senecio vulgaris and Capsella bursa-pastoris in primary weed infestation, and oats intercrop also limited the occurrence of Lamium amplexicaule and Senecio vulgaris in secondary weed infestation of Spanish salsify.",

In this study, the effect of three different K+/Ca2+ ratios (5.5/7.0; 5.0/7.0; 6.0/6.0) on some morpho-physiological features (crown diameter, chlorophyll index, leaf temperature), fruit yield, fruit quality (fruit weight, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, firmness) and physiological disorder (tip burn) of ‘Albion’ and ‘Festival’ strawberries, were investigated. Results show that increasing K+/Ca2+ ratios significantly accelerated the tip burn incidence. On the other hand, the highest yield, firmness and the lowest tip burn were achieved at 5.5/7.0 ratio of K+/Ca2+ treatment.",

In this study, we extracted essential oil (EO) by hydro-distillation of the aerial parts of selected O. dubium chemotype with highest EO content, and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Carvacrol was the pri- mary component (85.9%) among 24 different compounds in the EO.

A 1-hour treatment of bean and tomato seeds in the volatile phase of the EO effectively sterilized the seeds from bacterial pathogens without inhibiting their germination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the potential for the use of O. dubium EO as a seed protectant against bean and tomato seed-borne bacterial pathogens.",

This study aimed to explain the role of vermicompost (VC) for reducing the effect of salt stress on lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. crispa) plant. The experiments were performed with different concentrations of VC (0, 2.5 and 5% VC on a weight per weight basis of soil-w/w) and salt stress treatments (4 and 8 dS m–1 NaCl levels). Under salt stress, shoot heigth, relative,water content (RWC), stomatal conductance (gs), chlorophyll a (Chla) content decreased while electrolyte leakage (EL), malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activitys significantly increased in parallel with the severity of stress. In this study, VC under salt stress significantly increased RWC, gs and Chla, Chlt and carotenoid contents in the leaf tissues; however, MDA and EL contents decreased and SOD and CAT activities increased compared to controls. In all levels of NaCl, the 5% ratio of VC significantly reduced the negative effects of salinity.",

The aim of the present study, conducted in the period 2007-2008, was to determine changes in the nutrient contents of the root environment and leaves of tomato grown in expanded clay being post-production waste in soilless tomato culture under extended cycle conditions. The study used new expanded clay (I) as the control and expanded clay being post-production waste from year-round tomato cultiva- tion with the following experimental design: chemically sterilized material (II); material washed in water with the remains of the old root system of plants removed and addition- ally chemically sterilized (III); and material without any modifying treatments (IV). Ex- panded clay was placed in 12 dm 3 poly sleeves and formed in the shape of growing slabs. Crops were grown using a drip irrigation and fertilization system with closed nutrient so- lution system, without recirculation. The nutrient solution was supplied to all plants in the same amount and with the same composition. The study did not find significant differ- ences in the content of mineral nitrogen, phosphates, potassium, calcium, manganese, iron, and zinc in the root environment of plants grown in new and reused expanded clay. Changes in total ion concentration (EC) in the root environment of plants during growth did not differ significantly between the investigated treatments. The adverse phenomenon of alkalization of the root environment, characteristic for new expanded clay, was not found in expanded clay being post-production waste reused as a growing medium. The study did not find significant differences in plant nutrition which might prove that ex- panded clay under study cannot be reused as a growing medium in plant cultivation.",

The results showed that waterlogging stress decreased the chlorophyll content in all peony cultivars leaves, but with SA treatment can inhibit the decrease of chlorophyll content. Relative conductivity increased as the extension of waterlogging time in two cultivars. SA treatment could effectively inhibit the increase of relative conductivity, and 0.5 mmol L–1 of SA was the most suitable concentration.

New biologically-based fruit production strategies, i.e. taking into account tree growth and water status, are required to optimize irrigation and fertilization under abiotic stress conditions. It was hypothesized that a moderate abiotic stress, here deficit irrigation with or without nitrogen deficit, in the preharvest period, could decrease postharvest losses due to diseases and pruning weights due to reduced vegetative growth, without sacrificing the yield and fruit quality. This study was conducted over two years using the same trees of ‘Moncante’ nectarine cultivar grown in a commercial orchard. Trees were assigned to three treatments: (1) full irrigation at 80% estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc), (2) deficit irrigation, i.e. at 75% of full irrigation, and (3) deficit irrigation and deficit nitrogen, i.e. at 75% of full irrigation and 75% of usual N-fertilization adopted by the grower in this commercial orchard. Deficit irrigation alone and in combination with deficit nitrogen reduced postharvest diseases and pruning weights without significant yield losses. Our results suggest that ETc-based approaches of reduced water irrigation may be a sustainable way to decrease phytosanitary inputs and workload in the orchard while maintaining the orchard performance.",

A cultivation unit was applied on all plots in the springtime. Pea seed yield was higher by 14.1% in the CT than in the RT system and by 50.5% than in the HT system. The CT system was increasing the plant number m–2, number of pods and seeds m–2, seed mass per plant, and 1000 seeds mass, compared to the other systems. Protein content of seeds was at a similar level in all analyzed tillage systems, but was affected by the study year. In turn, the mineral composition of seeds was determined by both tillage system and study year. The seeds harvested from CT plots contained more phosphorus and iron, those from RT plots – more calcium and zinc, whereas those from HT plots – more phytate-P, potassium, magnesium, and copper, compared to the seeds from the other plots.",

Plants were grown in pots filled with vermiculite in control or saline conditions [150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl)] with or without 2 mM Si from potassium silicate for 60 days after sowing. Better growth effects due to Si application were observed in the sensitive pepper Demre than in Karaisali, particularly, the root and fruit growth were remarkably enhanced in Demre. Furthermore, Si application reduced sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) concentrations and increased potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) concentrations in the leaves and roots. The reduction in Na concentration in the leaves due to Si application was 9% and 2% in Demre and Karaisali, respectively. Under saline conditions, the increase in K concentration due to Si application in the leaves was 11% and 14% in Demre and Karaisali, respectively. In addition, Si application resulted in an increase in K/Na ratios in the leaves by 22% and 17% in Demre and Karaisali, respectively, in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. The increase in Ca concentration in the roots due to Si application was 55% in Demre compared with only 9% in Karaisali. The addition of NaCl decreased the chlorophyll concentration in both the genotypes, but Si application increased it. This increase in chlorophyll concentration was higher in Demre than in Karaisali. Si application allowed both the genotypes to maintain higher osmotic potentials than those in untreated plants. As a result, it may be claimed that under salt stress, Si application has a more alleviative effect on the susceptible pepper genotypes (Demre) than on the tolerant one (Karaisali). This information could be useful for the practical application of Si under saline conditions.",

The aim in this study was to determine the effects of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on tomato plants under salt stress. With this aim, the Interland F1 cv. and bacterial isolates of Bacillus thuringiensis CA41/1, Pseudomonas putida 18/1K, Pseudomonas putida S5/4ep, and Pseudomonas putida 30 were used. Salt application was completed in two different doses of 25 and 50 mM NaCl when seedlings reached the stage of 3 true leaves. At the end of the study, in addition to seedling development criteria, some nutrient element contents and rates (K, Ca, Na, K/Na and Ca/Na), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) enzyme activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) and photosynthetic pigment contents were determined. In the stress environment, PGPR inoculation increased K content by up to 10%, while apart from isolate P. putida no.30, the other isolates lowered Na content by up to 18%. Additionally, 18/1K and S5/4ep isolates were identified to reduce membrane injury index by up to 97%. It was identified that CA41/1, 18/1K and S5/4ep isolates were more effective against salt stress, especially. In general, the plant tolerance levels induced by the bacteria were identified to increase with the increase in salt stress.",

The measurements were made in two separate experiments in 2015 between 6 June – 5 August (Experiment 1) and 2 July – 3 September (Experiment 2) under the field conditions. Butterhead form and heat tolerant summer cultivar ‘Luna’ was used as a plant material. Agrobacterium rubi RK-34, Pantoea agglomerans RK-79 and RK-92, Pseudomonas putida RK-142 and TV-42A, Bacillus megaterium TV-6D, TV-60D and TV-91C, Pseudomonas flourescens TV-11D and Paenibacillus polymyxa TV-12E were used as N2-fixing plant growth promoting rhizobacteria. The treatments were 150 kg N/ha (available dose of AS) as ammonium sulphate (AS) [(NH4)2SO4), (21% N)] and three different mixtures of PGPR. Further, combined uses of decreasing doses of AS (50%, 75 kg ha–1AS and 75%, 112.5 kg ha–1 AS) and PGPR mixtures (M) such as M-1 + 75 AS, M-1 + 112.5 AS, M-2 + 75 AS, M-2 + 112.5 AS, M-3 + 75 AS and M-3 + 112.5 AS were used as additional treatments. All treatments increased the yield and the growth of lettuce according to the control. While inoculation with PGPR mixtures decreased the accumulation of heavy metals such as Cd, Ni, and Pb in lettuce, increased nutrient uptake of lettuce. It was determined that the nitrate accumulation of lettuce (cv. ‘Luna’) in PGPR mixtures were lower than the available dose of AS but higher than control. The yield in M-3 + 112.5 AS (48431 kg ha–1) was similar and in the same statistical group with the available dose of AS (48225 kg ha–1) in both experiments. Furthermore, according to the results of cost analyses, using 25% less of AS (112.5 kg ha–1) with M-3 will supply the same income instead of using AS (150 kg ha–1). It can be clearly said that the mixtures with some N2-fixing plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), especially M-3 (P. putida RK-142 + P. flourescens TV-11D + B. megaterium TV-91C), have a great potential to decrease the nitrogen use (25%) for environmentally friendly crop production of lettuce.",

Aiming at improvement of soil fertility and structure, conservation tillage, limiting the processes of soil environment degradation, is introduced into garden crop production techniques. Field experiments were conducted in the years 2006–2008, on grey brown podzolic soil of impermanent structure. The experimental plant was scorzonera (Scorzonera hispanica L.) of ‘Duplex’ cultivar. Three intercrop plants were considered in the studies: common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia B.) and oats (Avena sativa L.). There were also two ways of pre-sowing soil tillage: a) complex of pre-sowing practices, sowing of intercrop plant (2 decade of August), pre-winter ploughing and putting green matter into soil, b) complex of pre-sowing practices, sowing of intercrop plant (2 decade of August), spring ploughing and putting plant matter into soil, as well as two plant growing methods: on ridges and on flat soil. Significantly advantageous effects of spring putting intercrops into soil, growing of scorzonera on ridges and ploughing the soil with oats upon the total root yield were demonstrated. The examined experiment factors, however, did not significantly affect inulin, protein and dry matter contents in scorzonera roots. The most favorable tillage combination, as to inulin productivity was growing of scorzonera on ridges after spring ploughing oats with soil.",

This metabolite has antioxidant activity and increases plant tolerance against stressors such as salinity, pathogens, ozone, UV rays, etc. The current study used the common cel- lular and histological methods to evaluate the effect of 0.05 to 2.5 mM ascorbic acid on vegetative meristems of Aloe barbadensis plants obtained from stem explants propagated in vitro culture conditions. Results showed that low concentrations of ascorbic acid (0.5 to 1 mM) increase mitotic index in apical meristem and root quiescent center (QC). More- over, treatment with ascorbic acid increases cellular dimensions in cell elongation region of root and mitotic divisions in this region. In some measurements, it was clear that in ad- dition to increase root length in plants treated with ascorbic acid, distance from root hairs zone to root cap increases compared to the control, which is a logical conclusion from in- creasing cell elongation and divisions in cell elongation zone. Also, ascorbic acid in- creased production of secondary roots through stimulating cells of pericycle and increas- ing divisions in this region. Apical meristem of stem treated with ascorbic acid had more convexity homogenous with more chromophilic level. Increasing stem length and number of leaves in plants treated with ascorbic acid could be related to the high cells' mitotic ac- tivity in stem apical meristem. Moreover, ascorbic acid could stimulate cell division, in- creasing area of meristem zone, and effective on severity of differentiation.",

The research conducted in the years 2009-2011 included valuation of total phenolic acids as equivalent to caffeic acid, fla- vonoids and tannins content in plants during their vegetative growth. The effect of the vegetation period length on cardoon plants yield was observed. The content of polypheno- lic acids (caffeic, chlorogenic and cynarine) was marked with a performance liquid chro- matography (HPLC).The contents of biologically active compounds depended on plants age - the most phenolic acids were noted in herb harvested from plants 120-days and 150-days old (1.86-2.58%). Herb obtained from plants of different age contained from 0.38 to 0.43% flavonoids. More tannins were accumulated in young cardoon plants after 90-120 days of cultivation (3.72-3.43%) in comparison to plants 150-days old (3.25%). The content of caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and cynarin in cardoon herb depended on length of vegetation period of plants. The content of phenolic acids in leaves increased with time. Values of correlation coefficients indicate significant correlation of total phe- nolic acids and tannins content in cardoon herb. The higher content of total phenolic acids the lower content of tannins (R = -0.88). Strong correlation was noted between the content of total phenolic acids and the content of chlorogenic acid (R = 0.67) and caffeic acid (R = 0.78). On the basis of the results of the presented work it could be stated that car- doon leaves are a valuable material for herb industry.",

Also shown are relationships among the aphid species inhabiting the studied tree. We have shown that aphids are abundant on Acer platanoides and the most numerous species was Periphyllus aceris. This species was clear superdominant in both of the studied sites (the housing estate site and the street site). Using ecological indices allows us to determine that housing estate site is predominantly characterised by a larger species diversity than the street site. We have also presented that weather conditions have a significant influence on the number of aphids on the Norway maple. The highest number of aphids was observed in 2008, which was characterised by a warm spring. This paper is an attempt to answer the question whether the changes in the number of aphids are a result, of weather and habitat conditions, or, perhaps, also of mu- tual relations among species.",

Results showed that the lipid fraction of fruits and leaves was characterized by the predominance of oleic acid. Erucic and linoleic acids were the most abundant in stems while linoleic and palmitic acids in flowers. F. communis essential oils were defined by four chemotypes, namely isoshyobunone/6-tert-butyl-4-methylcoumarin in stems; α-eudesmol/ caryophyllene oxide in leaves; caryophyllene/myrcene in flowers and α-gurjunene/hexadecanoic acid in fruits. So, oxygenated sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons represented the major classes of stem essential oil. Monoterpene hydrocarbons were the predominant classes of leaves and flowers. Fruit essential oil was predominated by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Resorcinol and ferulic acid were the main phenolic compounds in flowers but chlorogenic and ferulic acides in leaves. Stems were rich in ferulic acid and quercetin while leaves in coumarin and tannic acid. Besides to the high variability among F. communis parts, this plant contained high amounts of bioactive compounds with various health benefits attributed to their antioxidant potential.",

    "abstract": "Chamomile is one of the well-known herbs in the world, with numerous medicinal, cosmetic and health benefits. In this study, a factorial experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design technique to evaluate the three different dosses of nitrogen (N1 = 0, N2 = 50 and N3 = 100 kg·ha–1) from urea 46%, and three different vermicompost dosses (V1 = 0, V2 = 4 and V3 = 8 t.ha–1) and three different zeolite superabsorbent levels (S1 = 0, S2 = 50 and S3 = 100 kg·ha–1) on flower yield and essential oil of Chamomile in Kazeroon, Fars province in 2017. The results showed that increasing the amount of nitrogen and vermicompost increased the plant height, flower diameter, number of flowers, flower yield, essential oil content, biological yield and essential elements content of the Chamomile. In the interaction of N × V, the highest and lowest dry flower yields were observed in N3V3 (456 kg·ha–1) and N1V1 (316.9 kg·ha–1) treatments, respectively. The interaction showed that the highest and the lowest of essential oil content were observed in N3V3 (2.82 kg·ha–1) and N1V1 (1.56 kg·ha–1), respectively. The highest content of chamazulene compound were obtained in N2V3S3 treatments with 6.40% and the highest content of α-bisabolol oxide A related to N2V3 treatments with 53.50%. Based on the interaction results of N × V × S, the highest biological yield was observed in N3V2S3 with 2012 kg·ha–1. The reason for the results can be due to the high moisture storage capacity of the superabsorbent and vermicompost, which can increase the availability of water consumption. In general, it seems that with increasing nitrogen and vermicompost ratios of soil, not only the nutritional availability of the plant (especially nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) increased, but also the physical structure and vital processes of the soil by creating a suitable substrate for root growth- increased the production of chamomile flower yields.",

In the years 2008-2010 research concerning the detection and identification of viruses occurring on production plantations of the highbush blueberry located in the central and south- eastern Poland and the cranberry growing on the separate parts of the plantation in the central Poland using the serological ELISA test and PCR technique were performed. The results of the performed serological ELISA test showed the presence on the bushes of various cultivars of the Blueberry shoestring virus (BSSV) and Peach rosette mosaic vi- rus (PRMV) (central and south-eastern Poland) and the Blueberry scorch virus (BlScV) and Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) (central Poland). During the observations carried out on the plantings of the highbush blueberry only the symptoms characteristic for the infec- tion with the BlScV were noted (central Poland). This virus was also detected using DAS- ELISA test in the cranberry plants growing in the separate parts of plantations in the cen- tral region of Poland (Plantation A/W), which did not show any disease symptoms. In Eu- rope it is the first report on the occurrence of BlScV in the cranberry bushes. What is more, it was established that the viruses can be detected in the leaves, the flowers and the phloem + periderm + cortex parenchyma samples in which the investigations could be performed in various months in the year. In the bushes of the blueberry of the Darrow and Herbert cultivars from Plantation A/W (central Poland) showing the symptoms in the form of red spots on the leaves or red spots and rings on the stems the presence of the Blueberry red ringspot virus (BRRSV) was confirmed using the PCR technique.

The shoots used in the experiment were obtained from aseptically grown shoot clusters. Rooted shoots (except treatment with TDZ) after accli- matization were transplanted to pots into a peat substrate where they were grown for 4 weeks. Plants were then cultivated in the field for 8 months. During in vitro studies the cytokinins promoted the development of leaves as well as the formation of new shoots. The highest average number of axillary shoots was found on the medium with BA 11.1-22.2 μmol·dm -3 . The use of kinetin (4.7-11.6 μmol·dm -3 ) or 2iP 12.3 μmol·dm -3 stimulated strong growth of shoots expressed in their length and size of the leaf blade. All TDZ concentrations caused a significant inhibition of shoot elongation. BA and TDZ had a harmful effect on the rooting of multishoots. On the control medium (hormone-free) and on the media containing kinetin or 2iP, 100% of shoots produced roots. After a period of 8 months, following overwintering and start of vegetation growth, the plant survival rate was 80-100%. It was found that 2iP 12.3 μmol·dm -3 had the highest after effect on plant growth. The plants derived from this medium had uniform and compact growth and they developed more leaves in the rosette with significantly larger laminae as well as longer and thicker petioles, than plants obtained from others used media.",

Catch crops used as green manures can be an alternative source of organic matter. A field experiment was carried out in central-eastern Poland to investigate the effect of phacelia and amaranth catch crops used as green manures on sweet corn growth and yields. Catch crops were sown at three dates: 21 st July, 4 th and 18 th August, and incorporated in late October. Sweet corn was cultivated in the first year following manuring. The effect of the green manures was compared to farmyard manure applied at a rate of 40 t·ha -1 and a non- manured control. Of the catch crops examined, the highest yield of fresh and dry matter was obtained for phacelia sown on the 21 st of July (33.6 t·ha -1 f.m. and 6.3 t·ha -1 d.m.) and 4 th of August (33.7 t·ha -1 f.m. and 5.5 t·ha -1 d.m.). A delayed sowing date of phacelia seeds, from 21 st of July to the 18 th of August, caused a decrease in the quantity of fresh matter and dry matter by 26 and 37%. Amaranth sown on the 21 st of July produced 26.2 and 5.3 t·ha -1 fresh and dry matter. Delaying the sowing date of amaranth seeds by 14 and 28 days decreased the yield of fresh and dry matter by 18 and 55-58%. There were found similar effects on yield of farmyard manure, phacelia and amaranth catch crops sown on the 21 st of July. Delaying the sowing date of catch crops by 2 and 4 weeks decreased the marketable yields of corn cobs by, respectively, 16.2 and 28.9% for phacelia and by 12.8 and 24.4% for amaranth. The average weight of marketable corn cobs cultivated after farm- yard manure, phacelia and amaranth catch crops sown on the 21 st of July and phacelia sown on the 4 th of August were similar. Biological productivity of corn cobs following farmyard manure and the catch crops examined (except amaranth sown on the 18 th of August) was similar and ranged from 66.5 to 72%. 'Chalenger F1' produced marketable cobs with a higher average weight but with lower biological productivity than 'Sweet Wonder F1'.",

The present study investigated the effect of different light qualities (white, blue, yellow, red) on shoot and root development and growth of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis. Shoot tips were obtained from aseptic in vitro cultures and explants were cultured on modified Murashige and Skoog medium containing BA at 5 or 25 µM as well as on medium without growth regu- lators. The experiment lasted 6 weeks and was repeated twice. The promoting effect of yellow light on the length of the main shoot growing on control medium was noted. There was no significant effect of different light qualities on the number of axillary shoots ob- tained from tip shoots cultured on growth regulator-free medium. Yellow light increased the number of axillary shoots from explants cultivated on medium containing 25 µM BA and it promoted shoot elongation most strongly on medium with the addition of 5 µM BA. Red and yellow light increased the number of roots on control medium, whereas yellow light significantly promoted root elongation growth. However, yellow and white light had the most positive effect on the average fresh weight of roots.",

Exposure to seed priming is one of the strategies being used to accelerate the activation of plant growth, especially seed germination in many crops. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of different seed priming techniques on perform- ance of French marigold. For this purpose, different seed priming techniques: hydro- primng, 50 mM CaCl2, 100 mg L -1 salicylic acid and 100 mg L -1 ascorbic acid were as- sessed. Seeds without any treatment were considered as control. Priming with 50 mM CaCl2 was proved to be the most effective treatment in enhancing germination and seed- ling vigour among all other treatments including control as shown by higher final germi- nation/emergence, germination energy and lower mean germination/emergence time. Fur- thermore, positive correlation between reducing sugars and dry weight and α-amylase ac- tivity and the concentration of reducing sugars indicates that enhancement due to priming could be attributed to higher reducing and total sugars as well as higher α-amylase activity in primed seeds.",

    "abstract": "The three Bacillus species isolated from petroleum refinery waste were exam- ined for antifungal activity on brewery effluents and molasses for biotechnological appli- cations. Bacillus strains were identified by three different methods: 16S rRNA gene se- quences, BIOLOG system and fatty acid analysis (FAME). The results demonstrated the ability of all three Bacillus strains cultured on brewery effluents and molasses to inhibit mycelial growth of the 10 tested fungi to varying degrees measured by agar plate inhibi- tion assays. Fungi inhibited to the greatest degree as measured by the zones of inhibition were Botrytis cinerea A 258, Phomopsis viticola W 977, Septoria carvi K 2082, Colleto- trichum gloeosporioides A 259, Phoma complanata A 233 and Phoma exigua var. exigua A 175. It was also observed that the fungal mycelial growth was inhibited by the cell-free supernatants, indicating lipoprotein-like activity of antifungal agents (mainly biosurfac- tants). Tested fungi were most sensitive to the Bacilli supernatants obtained from the mo- lasses cultures including: B. cinerea A 258, R. solani W 70, S. sclerotiorum K 2291, Phomopsis diachenii K 657, C. dematium K 425, P. complanata A 233, P. exigua var. ex- igua A 175. In the previous study it was shown that Bacillus species produced biosurfac- tants. Application of natural products such as these Bacillus species or their byproducts may be a new approach to phytopathogen control therefore reducing the need for fungi- cides.",

The aim of the investigations was to compare mutual interaction between some isolates of Trichoderma sp. and single-spore heterokaryotic cultures of A. bisporus on agar media and in cultiva- tion conditions. The first stage of the study comprised assessment of growth for isolates of T. harzianum, T. agrressivum, T. atroviride and T. hamatum on PDA medium and growth of four heterokaryotic single-spore and strain Amycel 2600 A. bisporus cultures on peat- manure substrate. Moreover, the individual biotic effect (IEB) between isolates of Tricho- derma and the tested A. bisporus cultures was also analysed. The second stage consisted in the evaluation of the volume of A. bisporus yield on the substrate, to which mycelia isolates of Trichoderma sp. were introduced. It was found that the analysed cultures and the cultivar strain of A. bisporus responded differently to the presence of Trichoderma sp. isolates both in terms of mycelium growth and the yield volume.",

    "abstract": "Sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L. var. macrocarpum) is a valuable vegetable from the Solanaceae family. The increased interest in open field pepper cultivation results from higher demand for this vegetable of the processing industry. Preservation and freez- ing are the main directions of pepper processing. Due to a long growing period and high thermal requirements of this species, a based problem in open field pepper cultivation in Poland is to obtain the largest possible amount of fully red fruits. The present study, con- ducted during the period 2009-2010, evaluated quantity and quality yield of several sweet pepper cultivars that are currently most frequently grown in the Lublin region for the processing industry. Fruits were picked in a single harvest. The present study determined marketable yield and its structure, depending on the fruit colour stages, as well as basic technological traits of fruits such as fruit weight, pericarp thickness, share of placenta in fruit weight, and technological yield. 'Socrates F1', 'King Arthur F1', and 'Red Knight F1' were the most productive cultivars. The highest red fruit yield was obtained in the culti- vars 'King Arthur F1' and 'Red Knight F1', and they also produced the largest fruits. Red fruits accounted for 50.8% of marketable yield, on average, for the cultivars compared. Among the domestic cultivars, 'Caryca F1' was distinguished by a thick pericarp and a high share of placenta in fruit weight. Technological yield of fruits of the evaluated cul- tivars was in the range of 83.5-91.7%.",

The studies conducted in the years 2008-2009 were aimed at determining the re- lationship between the kind of nitrogen fertilizer, manner of its application, as well as the dose of calcium carbonate and the plant unit weight, as well as chemical composition of spinach beet, grown in glasshouse in the spring period. Nitrogen was applied in the form of ammonium sulphate and urea in a localized form (N-deposit) and in the form of solu- tion. Calcium was administered in the form of calcium carbonate in the doses of 5 and 15 g · dm -3 of substratum. The length of leaves, plant unit weight and selected parameters of beet leaf utility value were assessed. The substratum was also analyzed after plant har- vest. The highest unit weight of plants was obtained with the application of ammonium sulfate in the form of a solution with a lower calcium carbonate dose, compared to the remaining combinations. The examined spinach beet plants were distinguished by high contents of dry matter, protein, total nitrogen, potassium, calcium and magnesium The chemical composition of leaves was significantly differentiated, depending on the exam- ined factors. The contents of nitrates in the leaf dry matter ranged from 0.26 to 0.45%, de- pending on the kind of nitrogen fertilizer and manner of its application. The applied nitro- gen fertilization to a small extent influenced the concentration of nitrates in beet leaves. More nitrates were contained in plants fed by a higher dose of calcium carbonate, com- pared to the plants which were given a lower dose of CaCO3. The highest content of vita- min C and the lowest share of nitrates in leaf dry matter were obtained with the applica- tion of urea in the form of deposit with a lower dose of calcium carbonate.",

This situation is commonly observed in some walnut cultivars causes dramatic yield losses. '˘ ebin' is a popular walnut cultivar among farmers in Turkey due to the quality of its fruit, yield and ease of marketability. However, in some orchards, established with this cultivar, has a fruitlessness problem. In the present study, the effects of Aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG, the commercial brand name is ReTain) (0, 62.5 and 125 ppm doses) and AVG plus GA3 (45, 135 and 270 ppm doses) treatments to prevent abortion in cv. '˘ ebin' were in- vestigated. The experiments were conducted in two different ecologies. The treatments were carried out just before the receptivity period of female flowers of cv. '˘ ebin'. The results showed that, the female flower abortion ratio of '˘ ebin' walnut cultivar were 87.78% in Tokat ecology and 77.78% in Niksar ecology. The fruit set ratio by 125 ppm AVG treatment was determined to be 60.89% for Niksar and 57.56% for Tokat ecological conditions. The highest fruit set was obtained from 125 ppm AVG combined 270 ppm GA3 treatment and this ratio was determined to be 93.89% for Niksar ecological condi- tions whereas it was determined to be 83.33% for Tokat ecological conditions. As a result, it was found that AVG alone or in combination with GA3 is effective treatments in reduc- ing female flower abortion for '˘ ebin' walnut cultivar.",

Seaweed extracts are re- ported to possess, among others, biostimmulatory potential that improves yield growth and its quality as well as promotes plant resistance to adverse environmental agents. The marine alga processing technologies facilitate the extraction of active substances valuable for plant crops as stimulants for a number of plant physiological processes. The sub- stances can be incorporated into both, soil or foliar applied fertilizers. The present re- search objective was to assess the influence of N Pro technology and Seactiv complex based on marine algal extracts on apple tree 'Szampion' growth, yield quantity and qual- ity. The experimental material comprised 'Szampion' apple trees grafted on M.26 stock, the trees were aged 10 years at the experiment onset. The study aimed at evaluation of growth, yield quantity and quality of 'Szampion' apple trees fertilized according to two following programs. The measurements performed showed that introduction of the fertili- zation programs based on marine algal extracts had significant effect on total yield, one fruit weight, firmness and sugar extract content in apple tree 'Szampion' fruits. It was found that the N Pro technology and Seactiv complex had significantly beneficial influ- ence on the percentage of big fruits, i.e. above 7.5 cm diameter and marketable yield in each experimental year. Cropping efficiency coefficient (CEC) of 'Szampion' apple trees fertilized according to N Pro technology and Seactiv base was significantly higher com- pared to control solely in 2008, in the other research years the differences were insignifi- cant. The fertilization program based on marine algal extracts had positive influence on the 'Szampion' apple trees annual increments and each year the trees under N Pro and Seactive complex fertilization technology produced higher increments as against control; the differences in the last research year were significant. The N Pro technology and Seac- tiv base had positive impact on 'Szampion' apple tree leaf surface area, significant influ- ence was observed in the second and third research year.",

In the present study, bacterial pathogens in the species of Pseudomonas savas- tanoi pv. phaseolicola (Burkholder) Garden et al. and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. Phaseoli (Smith) Vauterin et al. causing economically important disease on bean plants growing in the commercial fields of Erzurum and Erzincan provinces located in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey has been isolated and identified. Totally thirty-six bean genotypes and two commercial cultivars commonly grown in the region have been screened for resistance to these pathogens both in greenhouse and field condition during 2001-2002. Disease severity in the field condition reduced seed quality and quantity of bean. Among the thirty-eight genotypes tested, only 36K was found to be resistant to both of the pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Ginkgo biloba preparations from leaves are widely used for the treatment of mild cognitive dysfunctions. This work compared thirteen commercial dietary supple- ments with fresh G. biloba leaves. Anticholinesterase activities and the levels of total phenolics were studied using corresponding spectrophotometric methods. Antioxidant ac- tivities were tested using ABTS and DPPH free radicals. Phenolic acids and quercetin contents were determined using HPLC-DAD. G. biloba preparations more effectively in- hibited the activity of butyrylcholinesterase than acetylcholinesterase with significant (p < 0.05) differences between preparations. Selected preparations had both the highest content of total phenolics and the antioxidant activity (with ABTS and/or DPPH) whereas in the case of other samples, adverse results were obtained. Significant (p < 0.05) differ- ences in the quercetin content were seen between individual preparations. Gallic, proto- catechuic, syringic, 4-OH-benzoic, chlorogenic, caffeic, sinapic, ferulic, 4-OH-cinnamic and o-coumaric acids were detected in studied samples. The preliminary characterization of acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors from G. biloba with Sep-Pak C18 and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone revealed that these compounds are phenolics, although non- phenolics exhibiting the inhibitory activity were present in the leaves. The study aiming the purification of cholinesterase inhibitors from G. biloba is in progress.",

    "abstract": "Shallot is one of the vegetables, which are especially abounding in flavonoids, phenolic acids and other compounds with antioxidative properties. Among Allium vegeta- bles it is also distinguished with good storage ability. The studies conducted in the years 2007-2009 included the assessment of dry matter, flavonoids and phenolic acid contents in shallot bulbs immediately after harvest and drying off, as well as after long-term stor- age (5 months in the temperature 0-1 o C and humidity of 86%). The studies concerned 3 cultivars of shallot: 'Ambition F1', 'Bonilla F1' and 'Matador F1'. The bulbs of these cultivars were obtained from seedlings planting. For chemical analyses bulb samples with the diameter of 25-30 mm were selected, as such constituted the greatest participation in the obtained yield. The contents of total and reducing sugars, flavonoids (converted into quercetin), as well as phenolic acids (converted into coffeic acid) were determined in fleshy scales, whereas in dry scales only the contents of flavonoids and phenolic acids were determined. The dry matter of fleshy scales in the examined shallot cultivars was on average 16.65%. From among three examined cultivars the bulbs of 'Bonilla F1'had sig- nificantly greater dry matter (18.03% on average). The contents of total sugars in shallot bulbs was on average 6.32% immediately after harvest and 5.71% after 5 months of stor- age. Similarly as in the case of dry matter, the bulbs of 'Bonilla F1' cultivar turned out to be the most abounding both in total and reducing sugars. The examined cultivars signifi- cantly differed in the contents of flavonoids and phenolic acids both in dry and fleshy scales. In all the cultivars the dry scales contained more than 50 times more flavonoids and more than 34 times more phenolic acids, as compared with fleshy scales. Long-term storage of shallot bulbs significantly affected the decrease of flavonoid contents, slight decrease of total sugars, but a significant increase of phenolic acids. From among the ex- amined cultivars 'Ambition F1' was characterized with the lowest contents of all the ana- lyzed components.",

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of cover crop biomass and the manner and time of mixing it with the soil on primary weed infestation of carrot compared with the conventional plough cultivation without the use of cover crops. The cover crop plants modified the state and reduced the degree of primary weed infesta- tion of carrot compared to cultivation without cover crops. White mustard was the most effective in reducing primary weed infestation of carrot in all variants of tillage. Phacelia, buckwheat and oat cover crops also limited largely the number of weeds in carrot. The largest number of weeds was recorded in no-cover crop cultivation in no-tillage objects and those cultivated using subsoiler before winter, and cultivating in spring with aggre- gate. The largest reduction of primary weed infestation compared to conventional tillage was achieved in cultivation on ridges, with white mustard, phacelia or oats cover crops and weakest after vetch cover crop. In no-ploughing flat tillage system, lack of cover crop significantly increased the degree of weed infestation compared to conventional tillage, while the use of cover crops contributed to the reduction of primary weed infestation of carrot compared to cultivation without cover crops.",

Experimental plants were grown in sphagnum peat supplemented with full-strength Hoagland's solution at the beginning of the experiment. 10 days after plants were pricked out, 4 experimental series were made which differed in the form of N supplied to the growing medium at a rate of 420 mg (2N): 1) Hoagland's solution (control); 2) Hoagl + 2N-NO3; 3) Hoagl + 2N-NH4; 4) Hoagl + 2N-NH4/NO3. The obtained results showed that the lettuce leaf yield under FRS light was distinctly higher than under LED light at a PPFD of 200, and in particular at 800 μmol·m -2 ·s -1 . Be- sides, the leaves grown under FRS light showed a significantly thinner leaf blade (SLA) and a lower content of photosynthetic pigments, total N and nitrates. The photosynthetic rate was higher under LED light relative to FRS light. Different nutrition of plants with N-NO3, N-NH4 and N-NH4/NO3 had a similar effect on the yield and analysed traits of lettuce leaves, regardless of the type of light and the level of irradiation with LED light. LED lamps seem to be a very promising light source for plants, but they require further research on how to adapt the spectral distribution of light to their requirements.",

    "abstract": "Seedlings of four vegetable species (maize, tomato, radish and onion) were treated for 7 days with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) vapors. MeJA accelerated senescence process of plant tissues and accumulation of anthocyanins. The only exception were hy- pocotyls of radish, which was found to decrease of the anthocyanin content under the in- fluence of MeJA. It has been shown that MeJA has a different impact on the content of free biogenic amines. In case of leaves and epicotyls of maize and tomato hypocotyls, MeJA had no effect on levels of putrescine (Put). The leaves of tomatoes have shown to increase the putrescine level as a result of the impact of MeJA vapors. However, in the tissues of radish and onion very large decline in putrescine and spermidine content under the influence of the phytohormone were observed. The presence of small amounts of spermine was found only in tissues of radish, and onion, which does not affect the use of MeJA. In tissues of maize the presence of a significant content of 2-phenylethylamine (PEA) were found. Use for 7 days of MeJA vapors resulted in 3-fold increase in the con- tent of the PEA in maize leaves. Small levels of the amine has also been found in tomato hypocotyls, where use of MeJA caused reduction its content. Obtained results show a lit- tle relationship between the activity of the studied enzymes (ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), lysine decarboxylase (LDC) and tyrosine decarboxylase (TYDC)) and the con- tents of the amines in seedlings of four vegetable species. No free cadaverine and tyramine were found, and therefore probably both polyamines might be present as conju- gates. Putrescine also may be present in bound form. Moreover, since putrescine can be synthesized directly from ornithine or indirectly from arginine via agmatine, the activity of ODC alone did not give a full picture of the impact of MeJA on Put accumulation.",

The present study, conducted in a commercial plantation of a specialized horticultural farm during the period 2009-2011, evaluated the amount and quality of yield of two strawberry cultivars ('Elsanta' and 'Albion') grown under different cropping systems. The study determined the amount and structure of marketable yield. The different production systems included the cultivation of strawberries from fresh waiting-bed plants and frigo plants (class A and A+). Plants were grown in the ground and on black plastic under the row cropping system and the double-row strip cropping system. The average fresh marketable yield for cv.

The purpose of this paper was to evaluate these promising genotypes in terms of their volatile com- pounds using Headspace-Solid Phase Micro Extraction Mass Spectrometry (HS- SPME/GC/MS) techniques. Volatile compounds, especially esters, are the main contribu- tors to fruity and floral notes and pleasant fruit flavours. Esters comprised the majority of volatile compounds in all four peach genotypes, however the composition of volatile compounds differed among genotypes. J-92 contained the most esters, while Ru-24 con- tained the least. Ru-24, however, contained the highest levels of lactones, aldehydes, and total acids of the four genotypes tested. The S-6 genotype contained the most total alco- hols. Thus, the volatile composition and contents depended largely upon the peach genetic background. In addition to the volatile compounds, the highest fruit weight were detected in genotype Ru-24 and total soluble solids (TSS) was greatest in genotype S-6.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the importance of silicon (Si) has been demonstrated for many plant physiological processes. The recognized function of Si is to help plants to overcome mul- tiple biotic and abiotic stresses, e.g. disease or pests, low temperature, water deficit, salin- ity or heavy metals. Silicon advantageously impact on plant development and may im- prove the quality of ornamental plants. Hosta is an ornamental perennial, that flowers can serve as a source of nectar and pollen for floral visitors. The effect of artificial silicon (Si) supply on flowering, nectar production and pollen traits in Hosta Tratt. 'Krossa Regal' was studied. A foliar spraying of 0, 120, 180 and 240 mg Si·dm -3 was applied with water solutions of Actisil Hydro Plus, containing silicon in the form of H4SiO4. Silicon supply in concentration of 180 and 240 mg Si·dm -3 affected the morphometric traits of the flower (perianth width and floral tube length), but not the number of flowers produced per inflo- rescence. The silicon supply in concentration of 180 and 240 mg Si·dm -3 resulted in the increase of nectar production and in sugars excess in floral nectar. Treatments in concen- tration of 180 and 240 mg Si·dm -3 positively influence both pollen production and pollen viability. Presumably, most of these results can be explained through the effect of the Si on metabolism enhancement, e.g. by water balance regulation and increase in photosyn- thetic efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The article presents the results of research on the morphology and anatomy of the leaves of 21 cultivars (including 10 Polish cultivars) and two clones of Ginkgo biloba. Leaves from long shoots were collected at the Department of Dendrology and Nursery, Poznan University of Life Sciences, Poland. A light microscope and scanning electron microscope were used for observations. Eight morphological traits were analysed in the leaves, including the lamina and petiole. The research revealed that there were significant differences between the leaves of individual cultivars and that they differed in the length, width of the lamina and the length of petioles to a much greater extent than publications had described it so far. There were significant differences between the adaxial and abaxial epidermis of all the taxa, i.e. in the cuticle ornamentation, in the protrusive secondary sculpture (absence of papillae), the position and presence of stomata (occasionally on the adaxial leaf surface), the absence of the peristomatal ring and the thickness of the epider- mis. Anatomical investigations revealed that the leaves of Ginkgo cultivars and clones under study were bifacial and the multi-layered mesophyll was diversified into spongy and palisade parenchyma. The research findings may be used for the identification of Ginkgo biloba cultivars, and the epicuticular traits may be useful for the identification and classification of fragments of fossil leaves. The article includes descriptions and illustra- tions of several new quantitative and qualitative characters of petiole and lamina which have not been published previously.",

    "abstract": "The quality of fresh herbs used mainly as food products, is dependent on a number of factors, including the agronomic and environmental ones. The pharmacopoe- ial material of summer savory is the whole or ground herb, which besides essential oil, contains many other biologically active compounds, such as tannins, carotenoids, flavon- oids, and minerals. The aim of the study was to evaluate the yielding of summer savory intended for bunches harvest and mineral composition of the raw material depending on the sowing time and harvesting time. The savory seeds were sown directly into the field on two dates: 23 April and 7 May 2010-2011. The raw material was collected twice: on 1 July and 16 August. Both the first sowing date and the first harvest date affected most preferably the yield of fresh savory herb. Biological value of the ground herb was high and depended on the time of plant harvest. Significantly the greatest content of L-ascorbic acid (39.60 mg 100 g -1 FW), chlorophyll a + b (88.25 mg 100 g -1 FW), carotenoids (26.15 mg 100 g -1 FW), and essential oil (1.79 ml 100 g -1 ) was found at plants from the first harvest. More nutrients were found at savory plants collected in the first date as com- pared to the second date. The results show the possibility of using the dry summer savory herb as a source of microelements in a human diet. Analyzing all test parameters affecting the quality of raw material, it is clear that the savory plants used for bunches should be collected at the beginning of July, regardless of the sowing date.",

'Royal Purple' and their influence on biochemical changes, respiration efficiency and photosynthetic rate during this process. Cuttings were sprayed with water solution of biostimulators once, twice or three times during the rooting period at week in- tervals. The effectiveness of biostimulators was compared with the formulations tradition- ally used in the nursery production, i.e. with a rooting powder Rhizopon AA containing a synthetic auxin IBA (2%) or a water solution of IBA (200 mg·dm -3 ) applied on leaves. Triple treatments of microcuttings with AlgaminoPlant and a single one with Route sig- nificantly increased a rooting degree relative to the untreated control. The highest photo- synthesis rate was observed in cuttings sprayed once with AlgaminoPlant and twice with Route. Respiration efficiency was the highest in cuttings treated once and thrice with Al- gaminoPlant. The significant increases in chlorophyll (a + b), total soluble and reducing sugars contents were observed in cuttings treated with both biostimulators in comparison to the control. The results suggest that biostimulators applied on cuttings may cause bio- chemical and physiological changes which increase the stem ability to regenerate roots therefore their application should be considered in nursery practice.",

    "abstract": "In mutation breeding of chrysanthemum the regeneration in vitro of adventi- tious shoots from ligulate florets can lead to the separation of chimera components and, as a result, to producing a new original cultivar. The success of that method considerably de- pends on the result being the number of the shoots formed. The more is produced, the greater the chances for an effective separation of chimera components and creating a new stable cultivar. The present research defines the effect of such factors as the inflorescence development stage, the type of the explant as well as the position of its inoculation on the increase in the efficiency of adventitious shoots regeneration. The ligulate florets of Chry- santhemum × grandiflorum (Ramat.) Kitam. 'Cool Time' were inoculated on the Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium supplemented with 2 mg·dm -3 BAP and 0.5 mg·dm -3 NAA. There was shown no significant effect of the inflorescence development stage (incompletely open with a partially visible disk or with the entire visible disk in which tubular florets do not produce pollen or completely open in which two or half of the whorls of tubular flo- rets produce pollen) on the shoot regeneration efficiency. Most shoots regenerate on transversely- or lengthwise-cut into half or on the entire pierced ligulate florets - horizon- tally inoculated, with the abaxial side on the medium.",

The nectar of ivy is located on top of the inferior ovary forming a distinct undulating disc between the base of petals and the style. The ivy nectary represents open and persistent nectaries. During consecutive days of anthesis, nectaries change their colour from green to brown. The secretory epidermis is covered with a thick, deeply striated cuticle, and nectar is released by nectarostomata. Epidermal cells exhibited plastids with plastoglobules and a few starch grains as well as vacuoles containing anthocyanins, the content of which increased during the successive days of anthesis and nectar secretion. Multi-layered glandular parenchyma and, under- neath, subglandular tissue are located under the epidermis. The nectary was supplied by vascular bundles with phloem and xylem. Numerous chloroplasts were visible in the cy- toplasm of the external layers of glandular parenchyma; they were either typical with small starch grains or untypical with circular arrangement of thylakoids. Amyloplasts con- taining storage starch grains and numerous small vacuoles were present in the cells of deeper layers of the nectar-bearing tissue. Druses, flocculent residue, myelin figures and spherical deposits of unknown origin were visible in the gland parenchyma vacuoles.",

Here, the effect of three different altitudes of 1800 m (Rineh region), 2300 m (Polur region) and 2800 m (Lar region) above sea level on growth traits, yield and compositions of essential oil of two medicinal plants (Ziziphora clinopodioides Lam and Sophora alopecuroides L.) during two successive years (2018 and 2019) was investigated. The results showed that increasing the altitude from 1800 to 2800 m above sea level increased the morphological traits such as height, side branch number, root length and root volume, however, decreased the dry and fresh weight of both Ziziphora and Sophora plants. In Sophora plant, increasing the altitude enhanced the yield of essential oil and the highest yield of essential oil was obtained in Lar region. However, in Ziziphora, elevating the altitude from 1800 to 2300 m decreased the yield of essential oil, but further increase to 2800 m significantly increased the yield of essential oil. In Ziziphora, the highest amount of sophoramine, sophoridane and sophocarpine compounds was obtained at 1800 m, while the highest rates of adenocarpine, vinylphenol and matridin was obtained at 2800 m. For Sophora, the highest amount of sophoramine and vinylphenol was obtained at 2300 m, while sophocarpine showed the highest rate at 2800 m. Therefore, altitude is one of the important parameters of natural ecosystems that effectively change the quantitative and qualitative parameters of medicinal plants.",

Applying SA and KL alleviated the harmful effect of water deficit on plants through enhancing their chlorophyll content and antioxidant activity, and accordingly improved their yield, as compared to the controls. On the contrary, low irrigation mounted some fatty acids such as palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, while reduced unsaturated/saturated fatty acids. Moreover, applying SA and KL simultaneously, as compared to the controls, increased unsaturated/saturated fatty acids and the quality of extracted olive oil. In general, the results showed that a simultaneous effect of SA and KL, in comparison to their separate application, had a better effect on yield and quality of olive under water deficit.",

The aims of this study were to identify the best rooting medium, determine the changes in endogenous hormone content in aseptic seedlings of ‘Zijingling’, and then analyze its role in the rooting process, to improve the rooting rate. Using a test tube seedling of ‘Zijingling’ as the experimental material, the tissue cells were observed via paraffin sectioning, and the changes in endogenous hormone content during the rooting process were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that 1/2 MS Medium had the most significant effect on rooting in the basic medium. The promoting effects of different auxins on rooting decreased in magnitude in the order 3-Indolebutyric acid (IBA) &gt; Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)&gt; Indole-3-aceticacid (IAA). The optimal rooting medium was 1/2 MS + 0.6 mg L-1 IBA+ 15 g L-1 sucrose + 5 g L-1 agar + 200 mg L-1 activated carbon , and the highest induction rate of adventitious roots was 92.5%. The rooting of ‘Zijingling’ is classified as a primordial type of induced rooting. Exogenous IBA content promoted an increase in endogenous IAA and Gibberellic acid (GA3) contents. High contents of IAA, GA3, and Abscisic acid (ABA) and low content of Zeatin riboside (ZR) promoted the growth of adventitious roots, whereas high contents of IAA and ZR, and low contents of GA3 and ABA were required for the induction of root primordia. High levels of IAA/ZR and low levels of IAA/ABA promoted the differentiation of root primordia. However, low levels of IAA/ZR and high levels of IAA/ABA promoted adventitious root elongation.",

Furthermore, N. cataria var. citriodora essential oil wastested to determine its antimicrobial, antioxidant, antihyperglycemic and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro.The antimicrobial activity was tested by broth microdilution method against 16 bacterial strains from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Four common tests for measuring in vitro antioxidant activity were used: 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay (DPPH), reducing power (RP), 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and β-carotene bleaching assay (BCB). Antihyperglycemic activity was examined by using α-glucosidase inhibitory potential (AHgA), while anti-inflammatory activity (AIA) was determined by protein denaturation bioassay, using egg albumin. In total, 36 compounds were isolated and detected by GC-MS technique in N. cataria var. citriodora EO. The EO is mainly comprised of oxygenated monoterpenes (93.1%), and the main compounds were two monoterpenoid alcohols, nerol (38.5%) and geraniol (24.9%), followed by two aliphatic aldehyde, geranial (14.6%) and neral (11.0%). Antimicrobial activity of this EO shows growth inhibition of all tested bacteria strains, and exhibited good antioxidant, antihyperglycemic and anti-inflammatory activities. The EO obtained from N. cataria var. citriodora grown in Serbia shows valuable biological activity, indicating its potential for use as a supplement in everyday diet and as a natural preservative in food industry.",

In this study, the production was carried out under in vitro conditions in order to protect and economically evaluate the species, which is in danger of extinction due to its distribution in a very narrow area open to anthropogenic effects. For this purpose, seed and shoot tip explants of G. pilulifera were cultured in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing different concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Explants were obtained from two different locations of the natural habitats of G. pilulifera and more plants were obtained in the tissue culture from both explant types taken from the 1st location. Propagation from seed gave better results, and 96.67% of the seeds cultured in hormone-free MS medium were germinated and rooted. The shoot tip showed lower regeneration in vitro than the seed explant. Especially the rooting percentage is quite low and the highest rooting and shoot formation was obtained in MS medium containing 2 mg/L BAP + 2 mg/L IAA. In this medium, 10.50 ±0.17 shoots were obtained per plant, and rooting (1.67 ±0.09 per plant) was also achieved only in this medium. Seedlings obtained in tissue culture continue to develop successfully in field conditions, and this method has been determined as a suitable method for ex-situ conservation and economically rapid production of the species.",

The use of agrochemicals is still the most effective method of plant protection against diseases and pests. However, the intensive use of pesticides in some EU countries makes it necessary to search for alternative methods that can be applied in plant protection for consumer and environmental safety. The aim of the study was the laboratory evaluation of the fungistatic effect of extracts of herbal plants occurring in natural state in Poland: horseradish (Armoracia rusticana L.), yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) and tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) on selected polyphagic phytopathogenic fungi (Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum coccodes and Fusarium oxysporum). In this study, 5%, 10% and 20% concentrations of herbal water-extract extracts were applied to evaluate their effects on linear growth of fungi and inhibition of their growth relative to control. Total content of polyphenols and flavonoids was assessed in the extracts using spectrophotometry, and their antioxidant activity by applying the synthetic DPPH radical. The plant extracts of tansy and yarrow leaves were characterized by a higher content of polyphenols and flavonoids compared to horseradish leaf extracts; they also had a higher antioxidant activity. Plant extracts inhibited the growth of fungi to a different extent, depending on the species of fungus, type of extract, its concentration and duration of action. The strongest fungistatic effect was recorded for tansy and yarrow extracts, while the weakest for the extract of horseradish leaves. Plant extracts showed the weakest effect against Botrytis cinerea, inhibiting the development of this fungus only during the first days of the experiment. The present research is a preliminary study that will be used in the further to develop a biological preparation for the protection of agricultural and horticultural plants against fungal pathogens.",

AMOVA revealed significant differences between populations of plants representing different mutagenic treatments (18% for RAPD-based and 22% for SCoT-based analysis). The incidence of genetic changes was strongly correlated with the applied type and dose of ionizing radiation. The highest genetic distances to reference plants were observed for plants regenerated from 15 Gy high-energy photon (5.8% with RAPD and 1.7% with SCoT) and 10 Gy high-energy electron-treated explants (6.0% with RAPD and 2.9% with SCoT). Considerable changes in the phenotype of mutants were not necessarily correlated with the extent of genetic alterations. Qualitative and quantitative methods of evaluating post-radiation genetic changes should be combined for reliable detection of variant plants at early developmental stages.",

    "abstract": "Wild garlic (Allium ursinum L.) is a typical spring geophyte whose natural habitat is beech forests. The research aimed to assess the possibility of cultivating wild garlic in field conditions significantly different from those required by this plant, using environmentally friendly and unconventional treatments. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of selected agricultural practices (catch crop, shading plant, biopreparations) on the growth of wild garlic leaves grown in the field. The results show that the biomass of catch crops and shade plants and biopreparations from marine algae are justified in cultivating wild garlic in field conditions regarding the leaf yield. Ploughing of phacelia biomass on a catchment soil with an unstable structure positively affected the growth of wild garlic, increasing the length of leaves, their number, and the length and width of the leaf blade. Winter turnip rape used as a shade plant caused an increase in the length of the leaves and the value of the FV/FM index (the quotient of the variable fluorescence to the maximum fluorescence), and also, depending on the year of the study, the length and width of the garlic leaf blade. Soaking the bulbs before planting in the ‘Kelpak SL’ solution increased the number of garlic leaves growing without turnip rape cover in the second and third years of cultivation. In the first year of vegetation, longer leaves with a larger leaf blade ensured the preparation was sprayed three times without pre-soaking the bulbs. Considering the biopreparations’ positive effect on the growth of garlic leaves and the FV/FM ratio values, their use is prospective regarding the increasing occurrence of dry years and is an alternative to plant irrigation.",

Brassica oleracea convar. acephala var. sabellica cv. Scarlet with purple leaf discolouration was used in the study. Four LED lighting treatments were applied: white light (control), monochromatic blue (430 nm), monochromatic red (660 nm) and purple, i.e., blue (30% in spectrum, 430 nm) mixed with red (70%, 620 nm and 660 nm in equal shares). Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was 100 µmol m–2 s–1, photoperiod – 16 h light. The purple light promoted the cotyledon growth but decreased the soluble sugars content. The blue light significantly enhanced the anthocyanins synthesis and the radical scavenging activity (RSA). While under white light, the highest concentration of free amino acids and the lowest RSA were observed. As regards the phenolic compounds and photosynthetic pigments content, the reaction of kale to white light was similar to those observed under the purple and red light conditions. The experiment discussed here is of great practical importance and reveals the need for more in-depth research.",

    "abstract": "The long-term influence of several living mulches on apple tree growth, nutrient status, yield, and fruit quality concerning the year of cover crop sowing in tree rows was evaluated in the Lower Silesia region in the southwestern part of Poland. The estimation was conducted in six apple tree ‘Ligol’ populations differentiated by the rootstock: M.26, M.9, P 60, P 2, P 16, and P 22. In experiment no. 1, one-year-old nursery stock was planted, and perennial living mulches were sown: colonial bent grass (Agrostis vulgaris With.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) in the same year and blue fescue (Festuca ovina L.) in the following year. In experiment no. 2, which involved two-year-old stock, the sowing of blue fescue was delayed until the second, third, fourth, and fifth years following orchard planting. The presence of the cover crop significantly affected young tree growth when one-year-old trees were planted. The sowing of the living mulch in the first or the second year after tree planting led to a significant reduction in the cumulative yield obtained from the young trees. The living mulch improved the red coloration of the fruit skin in the young orchard, but it caused a reduction in the mean fruit weight and size. However, it also contributed to decreased nitrogen concentration in the leaves of the apple trees, and the tree tolerance to living mulch increased as the orchard aged. A choice of semidwarf rootstock, postponed sowing of cover crop, and high-quality nursery stock were recognized as the most important factors for fostering apple tree tolerance to living mulches in tree rows.",

Germacrene D, p-cymene, β-caryophyllene, α-pinene, and β-bisabolene were detected as the main constituents. Deficit irrigation decreased the growth parameters of the plants; however, it improved the contents of the volatile oil and the major compounds of volatile oil. In addition, the maximum values of the volatile oil content and the main constituents of volatile oil were extracted from the plants under SA × water deficit treatment. In conclusion, the foliar spraying of SA under water deficit conditions was an applicable strategy to maintain and stabilize the growth and yield of E. purpurea.",

In this study, comparative in silico transcriptome analyses were conducted to examine the tissue-specificity of the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) biosynthetic genes and transcription factors (TFs) between morphine and noscapine cultivars. Analysis showed that BIA biosynthetic genes are expressed in a different pattern between two varieties. Results showed that some members of plant-specific secondary metabolites related to TF families, such as MYB, MADS-box, bHLH, NAC, and WRKY, are differentially expressed between tissues and varieties.",

In Poland exist a good climatical conditions and considerable acreage of acid soils for cranberry growing. Cranberries can be consumed solely after processing, mostly as juice and sauce. Cranberries are beneficial for the human organism because they are a good source of vitamin A, B1, B2 , B6 and C, flavonoides, organic acids and other substances. Experiments on investigation of 6 cultivars of the American large fruited cranberries were begun in 2004 at the research plantation of Department of Genetics and Horticultural Plant Breeding in Felin, near Lublin. Seedlings were planted out at spacings of 50×50 cm in specialy prepared beds filled with sphagnum peat. During the experiments the following indices were evaluated: growth rhythm, length of horizontal shoots, number of vertical shoots per 1 m, number of flowers and berries per 1 m in 4 – fold replications, weight of 100 berries and vitality of pollen. Over two years cultivars ‘Pilgrim’ and ‘Cropper’ had the highest yield (average 662 g and 611 g per 1 m, respectively). ‘Stankavich’ had the lowest yields of all 6 cultivars (average 95.5 g). ‘Pilgrim’ and ‘Cropper’ had the largest fruit size (average 1.55 g and 1.51 g, respectively), ‘Stankavich’ the smallest (av. 0.57 g), and ‘Le Munion’, Nr 20 and ‘Stevens’ were intermediate in fruit size. Interaction clone × year proved to be important in the case of such characteristics as: annual increment of shoots, number of flowers per 1 m, number of berries per 1 m and weight of berries. The number of grains with alieve cytoplasm was the greatest in ‘Cropper’ and ‘Pilgrim’ cultivars.",

It was concluded, that cultivation of Campanula persicifolia L. 'Alba' in an unheated plastic tunnel causes growth of fewer inflorescence stems but of better quality than in the field. Application of benzyladenine in the concentration of 400 mgdm -3 in Campanula persicifolia L. cultiva- tion in an unheated plastic tunnel results in an increased fresh weight of inflorescence stems and number of primary side stems. Application of benzyladenine in the concentra- tion of 400 mgdm -3 is recommended for Campanula persicifolia L. cultivated in the field due to better branching in the first and second year of flowering. Application of benzy- ladenine in the concentration of 200 and 400 mgdm -3 on the leaf of Campanula persicifo- lia L. cultivated in the tunnel leads to the production of shorter inflorescence stems in the first and second year of flowering. In the field, only the older plants (in the second year of flowering) react similarly.",

AVG was sprayed 4 weeks before the anticipated harvest date and Zn was sprayed when the fruits reached the size of a walnut. As compared to the control, both the single AVG and zinc treatments significantly reduced the pre-harvest drops. However, combined AVG + Zinc treatments were found to be more effective in reducing the pre-harvest drops. At the last measurement date (15th of August), 60% fruit drop was measured in control, but 22% in AVG + Zinc treatment. AVG and AVG + Zinc treatments reduced ethylene synthesis. On the other hand, single zinc treatments stimulated ethylene synthesis. AVG treatments retarded red skin color development, but zinc treatments again stimulated red color development. As compared to the control and single zinc treatments, AVG-treated fruits had greater firmness and acidity values, but lower SSC values. While AVG treatments increased the total phenolics and antioxidant activity, zinc treatments decreased these attributes. As compared to the control, zinc treatments significantly increased flesh Cu, N, P and K contents and leaf Mn, N and P contents. Based on present findings, it was concluded that AVG could be used as an efficient tool to reduce the pre-harvest drops in apples.",

    "abstract": "Methyl jasmonate (MJ) is a widely occurring molecule. Since it is synthesized constitutively, its presence is substantial to plant normal growth and development. Moreover, its elevated concentration detected under abiotic and biotic stress conditions seems to be crucial to plant in reacting to adverse events and its ability to survive. Because of the sophisticated biochemical machinery inside the plant body, MJ, among other molecules, helps the plant to adopt to the surrounding environmental changes and is involved in its defense system.",

    "abstract": "Rosaceae fruit trees are characterized by gametophytic self-incompatibility, with their production typically requiring artificial pollination or pollination tree is required in production. Both of these solutions cause reductions in production efficiency, and self-incompatibility has become a major issue in agricultural biology, and as such, has been extensively studied. In this review, we discuss the relationship between S-RNase content in the style and self-incompatibility, and the role of the SLF gene in stamen-determining factor. Considering mutations in self-compatibility-related genes and self-compatibility in polyploid fruit trees, we discuss the potential mechanisms of self-incompatibility. Based on a preliminary study of the role of pollen tube Ca2+ gradients in self-incompatibility in Pyrus, we propose a new mechanistic model of self-incompatibility taking into account the effect of Ca2+. We also discuss the potential for hormone regulation to be used to control self-incompatibility in Rosaceae fruit trees.",

Results indicated a decrease in chlorophyll content, and increase in proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and electrolyte leakage (EL) with increasing levels of salinity. The chlorophyll content in greenhouse and exterior space also increased with increasing levels of NS and HA, while proline in two environments, with increasing levels of NS and HA decreased. EL with increasing levels of NS fluctuated, but with increasing levels of HA, it decreased in two environments. With increasing levels of NS, CAT in both environments was eventually decreased after the oscillation, but there was no particular trend in HA levels. With increasing levels of NS and HA, MDA in the greenhouse decreased and in the exterior space – it increased. Finally, by increasing levels of NS and HA, SOD did not show any change in the greenhouse condition, but in the exterior space, the SOD was decreased.",

In this study, a seasonal evaluation of leaf gas exchange, leaf temperature, leaf greenness (chlorophyll content prediction) and vegetative development of Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Prima’ grafted to different rootstock genotypes having great variability in drought tolerance, were investigated. The experiment was conducted in a controlled experimental glasshouse on two-year-old soilless grown ‘Prima’ vines grafted on nine rootstocks [44-53 M, 5 BB, 140 Ru, Ramsey (Syn. Salt Creek), 99 R, Saint George (Syn. Rupestris du Lot), 41 B, 1613 C and 420 A]. A long-term deficit irrigation (DI) was imposed before bud break by reducing water supply to 40% of field capacity derived from concurrent measurements of water content of growth medium and maintained until the end of vegetation period. The rootstocks significantly modulated the physiology and vegetative growth of the scion cultivar in varying degrees according to their genetic features. Among them, 140 Ru rootstock found to be more prominent in terms of mitigating the adverse effect of water deficit on physiology and growth of the scion genotype ‘Prima’ as there were no significant difference between deficit and full irrigation treatments for most of parameters investigated. In general, the ‘Prima’ scion performed better when the rootstocks coming from V. berlandieri × V. rupestris pedigree rather than the others including V. berlendieri × V. riparia.",

It displays a broad spectrum of pro-health effects, ranging from the prevention of cancer to antiviral properties. It is present in many fruit from the rose family (Rosaceae): strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and walnuts as well as cranberries and grapes. The available literature states that the fruit of roses, in addition to their aesthetic and functional applications, also show therapeutic properties, which, among other things, are associated with a high content of polyphenols, including ellagic acid derivatives. The aim of this research was to determine the differences in the content of free ellagic acid in the fruit of selected rose species. The test material consisted of freeze-dried sublimation and ground fruit from the following species of roses: R. canina, R. moyesii, R. pendulina. The fruit was separated into two fractions: flesh and seeds. Quantitative analysis of free ellagic acid was carried out by spectrofluorimetry. The free EA was present both in the flesh and in the seeds of the studied species of roses. Its content in the mentioned fractions varied depending on the species. The flesh of R. pendulina was characterised by the highest level of EA in free form (247.72 μg·g–1 of dry weight). The seeds of R. moyesii proved to be the most abundant in free EA (105.69 μg·g–1 of dry weight.",

Sweet cherry cultivars – ‘Summit’, ‘Kordia’ and ‘Regina’ – were treated with bioregulators at the end of flowering. NAA significantly increased the fruit weight at harvest compared to the control in all cultivars assessed. BA stimulated the fruit growth in ‘Kordia’ and ‘Regina’, while it was ineffective in ‘Summit’. GA3 caused significant increase in fruit weight by 8.3% in ‘Kordia’ only. Moreover, BA and GA3 induced a higher firmness of fruits at harvest. Weight loss of fruits during storage at 0°C, RH 90%, was increased with NAA and reduced with GA3 in ‘Regina’ only. BA and GA3 reduced the weight loss of sweet cherry fruits stored at 3°C, RH 70%. Bioregulator treatments increased TA (titratable acidity) in fruits at harvest, while the effects on TA during storage were variable depending on the cultivar. ‘Summit’ had the highest sensitivity to storage fruit rot.

    "abstract": "Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni is a perennial plant belonging to Asteraceae family and its leaves contain steviol glycosides (SGs) that are 150 to 300 times sweeter than sucrose. The sweeteners obtained from S. rebaudiana can be safely used by diabetics as insulin secretion is not required during digestion of this sweetener. As it has zero calories, it is also used in diet products. Adaptation studies for Stevia conducted in Antalya, Turkey have shown that the stevia plant could easily be cultivated as a perennial. However, the lack of a sustainable vegetative propagation method creates a significant problem for stevia production. In the generatively populations, homogeneity and therefore quality are decreased because of cross-pollination. Stevia, as a self-incompatible and cross-pollinated species, has been shown to have very high genetic diversity. Therefore, development of a sustainable in vitro propagation method to prevent genetic heterogeneity of selected varieties is crucial for stevia cultivation. The aim of this study was to evaluate 2 different gelling agents (plant agar and Gelrite) and 20 different growth regulators combinations. The results demonstrated an approximately 200-fold multiplication rate obtained within 13 weeks using MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg·dm–3 BAP and 0.25 mg·dm–3 kinetin and solidified with Gelrite. Average stevioside and rebaudioside A contents in in vitro propagated plant samples were found to be 8.1% and 8.6%, respectively.",

In the face of increasingly serious environmental and food problems, organic agriculture is considered to be an effective solution. In this experiment, the effects of organic cultivation patterns on the growth, quality, disease resistance in tomatoes, and the physical and chemical properties of soil were studied by different treatments. The results showed that the application of effective microorganisms (EM) bio-organic fertilizer in the cultivation process can significantly improve the yield, quality, and antioxidant enzyme activity of tomato. The use of straw mulching was found to significantly increase the growth, chlorophyll content, transpiration rate, and soluble sugar content of tomatoes. The application of EM bio-organic fertilizer or straw mulching significantly increased the activity of antioxidant enzyme and the expression of LeCHI gene in tomato leaves and enhanced tomato resistance to diseases.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of medium type (MS or VW), growth regulators, i.e. BA, KIN, TDZ used separately or in combinations and natural additives, i.e. coconut water, banana pulp, casein hydrolysate, on Paphiopedilum insigne plantlets grown in vitro. It was found out that BA in concentration of 0.5 mg·dm–3 allowed to obtain the highest multiplication rate (2.92), however the use of KIN in concentration of 1 mg·dm–3 resulted in formation of bigger and higher quality plantlets, It is possible to replace cytokinins with other biologically active substance, such as banana pulp. The 1/2 MS medium might be used for Paphiopedilum insigne tissue culture, as there was no difference in terms of multiplication rate and the obtained plantlets were of better quality, especially that it is cheaper and easier to prepare.",

    "abstract": "Hazelnut is a very important nutrient in terms of human health. It is widely consumed as natural and roasted. Aromatic components could be used as marker for export criteria in hazelnut. Thus, this study aimed preliminary to compare the aroma profile of some hazelnut varieties and to determine the effect of roasting on aroma component in natural hazelnuts. Hazelnut varieties (18 Turkish and 2 foreign varieties) were obtained and then roasted at 135°C for 30 min. The volatile aroma components of hazelnuts were characterized via solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME/GC-MS). A total of 20 and 29 aroma compounds were detected by SPME/GC-MS in natural and roasted hazelnuts, respectively. Concerning natural hazelnut samples, the highest values among the Turkish and foreign varieties were obtained from nonanal in ‛Kalınkara’, ‛Kan’ and ‛Negret-N9’, which are mainly characterized by citrus, rosy, fatty flavor. In roasted samples, 2(3H)-furanone was determined in highest level in ‛Cavcava’, ‛Mincane’ and ‛Negret-N9’ and the flavor attributes of these varieties were oily-nut-like. In particular, Turkish hazelnut varieties such as ‛Acı’ and ‛Kalınkara’ could be promising in terms of the highest amount of aromatic components in roasted hazelnuts.",

Tree crowns had a vase form and they were strongly damaged by frost during the winter 2005/2006. In spring 2006, intensive tree pruning was carried out. The objective of the studies was the estimation of the effect of a radical pruning of frostbitten trees on their regeneration and yielding, as well as to estimate the role of rootstocks in this process. Studies have shown that the tree pruning evoked a very strong compensation growth, the reaction of trees was the stronger, the more intensive was the tree pruning. As a result of the pruning, after 3 years, the lowered tree height (on the average by 40–50 cm) was maintained in relation to the control trees. After pruning, in the tree crown, longer productive long-shoots with diameters > 0.5 cm, developed as compared with the control. However, the radical pruning of trees caused in the third year after pruning a decrease in tree yielding from 30 to 40%, in comparison with the not pruned trees.",

One of new, unconventional methods of seed quality improvement is low-frequency variable magnetic field. It has been found that this physical factor has a favourable effect on seed germination, emergence and growth of many crop plants. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of low-frequency magnetic field (LFMF) on the germination of radish seeds, with particular emphasis on old seeds. The experimental material were seeds of 7 lots of radish cv. 'Mila', with germination capacity of 66.5-92.5%. The age of the seeds was from 1 to 8 years. Seeds from all the lots were treated with variable magnetic field with frequency of 50 Hz, at 3 doses of magnetic in- duction as follows: 0 (control), 30 and 60 mT for 30 seconds. Then, the seed germination energy and capacity were determined, as well as the length of the hypocotyl and of the radicle of the seedling, dry weight of seedling, and emergence and mean time of emer- gence. The low frequency magnetic field exposure (30 and 60 mT) improved radish seed germination energy and capacity of every old seed lot. The increase of germination energy of old seeds amounted to 12.3-19.2%, and the increase of germination capacity was 5.8-10%. Magnetic field stimulation caused the increase of germination energy for 3 out of 4 seed lots of high quality but did not affect the improvement of germination capacity of those lots. No significant effect of magnetic field of seeds on the hypocotyl and radicle elongation was observed with the exception of 1 out of the 7 seed lots. For the 2 old seed lots out of the 3 total, magnetic field treatment caused the increase of emergence by 4.4-13.0%.",

Phenolics content was determined by method with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and calculated on ellagic acid. The antioxidant activities were measured utilising 1,1-diphenyl-2 picryl- hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging test. The highest phenolics concentration was ob- served in the extracts prepared by extraction with the mixture of water:ethanol from 7:3 to 3:7 and ranged from 17.82% to 18.96% for A. glutinosa and from 10.82% to 12.55% for A. incana.

Therefore the mixture of water:ethanol from 7:3 to 3:7 should be used for preparing extracts from this species for medicinal purposes. Results also indicated the existence of a high correlation between antioxidant activity and total phenolics content.",

There were two types of non-glandular hairs on the sepals; the first one to prevent the nectar from flowing out beyond the sepal and the other type to protect the nectary itself. The clavate secretory trichomes, forming dense clusters, are composed of a base, stalk, and multicellu- lar head. The secretory cells of the trichome head contain a thick cytoplasm and a large nucleus; they are also characterized by a low degree of vacuolation. Nectar accumulates at the tip of the trichome in the space formed between the cell wall of the head cells and the cuticle. The several-layered subepidermal glandular parenchyma with densely packed cells is provided with vascular bundles containing xylem and phloem. Plastids containing small starch grains were noticed in many cells of the nectariferous tissue, whereas pheno- lic compounds were found in the adaxial epidermal cells of the sepals.

The objective of present work was to develop an efficient system for C. pannonicum in vitro propagation and comparison of morphological traits and the ability to flower in plants obtained by micropropagation and from seeds. Isolated shoot tips from 10-day-old seedlings were cultured on MS medium supplemented with: 6-benzylaminopurine (BA), kinetin (KN) or zeatin (ZEA) at concen- tration of 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0 mg .

The aim of this paper was to trace the changes in numerical force with reference to the weather conditions system, as well as to establish the bionomics of Panaphis juglandis (Goeze) occupying the trees of Juglans regia L. Studies were conducted on common walnut (Juglans regia L.) in Lublin in 2006-2008. Three locations were designed for observation: garden (A), park (B) and street-side (C). Numerical strength and bionomics of P. juglandis were determined. The greatest number of aphids was reported in the year 2007 in the park location. The course of weather condi- tions significantly affected the terms of spring and autumn presence of aphids. Warm spring with not very intense precipitation enhanced the development of P. juglandis. However, torrential rains and air temperatures exceeding 30oC in summer limited the population dynamics of this aphid. In the developmental cycle the appearance of subsequent generations was observed from family founders through virginoparous females to sexual generation. Studies on female fecundity were performed. In all the study years the highest mean fecundity was that of the family founders, and the lowest was found in the females of sexual generation. The most fecunde virginoparous females (68.4 larvae · female -1 ) were observed in spring 2006 in the street location. Observations were also undertaken, which concerned determining the place and term of aphid occur- rence, as well as the number of eggs on lignified sprouts of Juglans regia L.

The aim of the present studies was to investigate the potential of the yeast Candida melibiosica for bio- control of Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria alternata and A. radicina, fungi pathogenic to car- rot roots, and explain the possible mode of action of this antagonistic microorganism. The ability of the yeast to inhibit fungal growth in vitro, produce volatile compounds and lytic enzymes, and protect infected carrot roots was studied. C. melibiosica inhibited the growth of B. cinerea on potato-dextrose agar and malt agar by 25.9% and 33.3%, respec- tively, but only slightly restricted the growth of A. radicina and had no effect on A. alter- nata. The volatile compounds acting against B. cinerea and A. radicina were produced by C. melibiosica growing on malt agar. The yeast produced -glucanase and chitinase with activities between 34.0-232.86 U · cm -3 and 20.74-43.7 U · cm -3 , respectively. Applica- tion of the yeast to carrot roots before inoculation with the fungi B. cinerea and A. radicina reduced the progress of the disease",

Under the conditions of Lublin, the onset of flowering of L. clivorum oc- curs in the second half of July, whereas L. przewalskii starts to bloom already in the last week of June. Depending on species and weather conditions, the period of flowering of L. clivorum lasted 48-67 days, while in the case of L. przewalskii from 29 to 38 days. In both taxa, female ray florets and bisexual disc florets are found in capitulum inflorescen- ces. The weight of pollen produced by 10 L. clivorum flowers was almost twice higher than that in L. przewalskii. Pollen production per unit area for these taxa was 6.92 g·m -2 and 1.53 g·m -2 , respectively.",

Corms soaked in water were served as the control. During the vegeta- tion season measurements of vegetative and generative traits of plants were conducted. After the end of vegetation period, coefficients of corm weight and number increase were calculated. It was found that cormlets of Easy Pot Freesia can be recommended for culti- vation in pots. Cultivar had a significant effect on vegetative and generative parameters of plants. Among evaluated cultivars 'Gompey' was characterized by the greatest decorative value. Plants of this cultivar had the longest inflorescence shoots with the greatest number of lateral shoots and the greatest number of flowers. Irrespective of cultivar, gibberellic acid increased plant height, total number of leaves, length of inflorescence shoots and de- creased flower diameter. The use of gibberellic acid increased weight of the offspring corms. Among evaluated concentrations the highest effect was noted for 160 mg dm -3 .

The plants were grown on rockwool slabs, 15 dm 3 in vol- ume, and slabs of the same volume made of the following straw chaff: rape straw; rape straw + peat (3:1); rape straw + pine bark (3:1); triticale straw; triticale straw + peat (3:1), triticale straw + pine bark (3:1). Two tomato plants were grown on each slab, leaving 22 fruit clusters on each plant during the period from February to October. The obtained re- sults showed that photosynthetic pigment content, chlorophyll fluorescence, rate of photo- synthesis and substomatal CO2 concentration in the leaves of tomato grown on rockwool and on rape or triticale straw chaff substrates did not differ statistically significantly. No significant differences were found in total yield of tomato fruits. Peat or pine bark addi- tion to the rape or triticale straw substrates had no significant effect on the change in their usefulness. The substrates used differed only in the content of total phenolic compounds after tomato harvest. The substrates prepared from triticale straw and its mixture with peat and bark as well as from rape straw with bark were characterized by a higher level of phenolic compounds than the other substrates. In the opinion of the present authors, sub- strates of rape or triticale straw alone, and even more so with the addition of peat or pine bark are not inferior in any way to commonly used rockwool.",

In the present study the growth and develop- ment of one-spore cultures of six isolates of P. diachenii at the temperature: 0 o C, 4 o C, 10 o C, 16 o C, 22 o C, 28 o C, 33 o C and 38 o C on Czapek-Dox medium and also the growth and development of the same isolates in eight agar media at the temperature 25°C were exam- ined. It was shown that the optimum temperature for the growth and sporulation of most isolates of P. diachenii and for the secretion of mature conidia from conidioma ranged 22 o C to 28 o C. Based on the nature of growth and development of P. diachenii on the ex- amined media, Czapek-Dox and mineral ones as slightly acidic, and possibly malt extract should be recommend for isolation of the fungus from the plant tissue. PDA and Czapek- Dox media were considered the most suitable for diagnostic purposes due to the formation of characteristic macroscopic and microscopic features on these substrates.

Cherry tomato (Dasher F1 and Organza F1) and middle fruit size tomato (Admiro F1 and DRW 7594 F1) cultivars were grown in the years 2008-2009 in the greenhouse with controlled climate and drip fertilizing system, in three different growing media. Organic media - coconut fiber and wood fiber were compared to rockwool, commonly used as a standard horticultural me- dium. The quality traits that mostly differentiated tomato fruits were the cultivar, harvest time and to the lesser degree the medium quality. Tomatoes harvested in July had a higher sugar content and received a higher sensory evaluation than those harvested in September. The sugars to acids ratio was the highest in fruits grown on coconut fiber. These fruits also obtained higher notes of particular determinants of sensory analysis, especially to- mato flavor. The highest quality in respect to the content of the investigated chemical components and sensory evaluation was observed in fruits of Dasher F1 and Admiro F1 cultivars. A significant correlation between the content of chemical quality attributes of tomato fruit with such determinants of sensory evaluation as skin firmness, tomato and sweet taste was revealed. Sugar in fruits was positively correlated with the overall tomato assessment. Firmness and sweet taste were significantly correlated with organic acids and soluble solids contents.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of fungi causing sooty blotch and flyspeck on apple during fruit storage. The experiments were conducted in 2007-2010. Fruits were collected from the orchard in Warsaw-Wilanow. Mass reduction in heavily and slightly infected or healthy apples per gram fresh weight of fruit was compared. Changes in quality of apples (wilting, wrinkling) were also observed during storage. Over a dozen to several dozen percent in reduction of the weight of heavily infested stored fruit as compared to a loss of fruit weight only slightly affected or healthy was found. It was also observed a wilting and wrinkling of the skin of heavily infested fruit.",

    "abstract": "Cosmos atrosanguineus is a tuberous, tender perennial with velvety, dahlia- like, brownish-red flowers that have a chocolate aroma. It is sterile, so no viable seeds are produced. This species is particularly suitable for a border plant in any perennial garden. A study was undertaken to determine whether shoot apex and leaf removal as well as ex- plant orientation had an influence on axillary shoot induction. Explants were prepared from shoots taken from aseptically grown shoot cluster and were cultured for 6 weeks on Murashige and Skoog medium containing BA (1 mg�� dm -3 ). The study results showed that the removal of the apex from the non-defoliated shoot tip improved axillary branching. The removal of developed leaves from the shoot tip with the apex removed caused a re- duction in axillary shoot production. The defoliated shoot tip inserted vertically in the medium in an inverted position regenerated the highest number of axillary shoots charac- terized by the highest fresh weight. The defoliated shoot tip after removal of the apex, placed vertically with the base down, produced axillary shoots characterized by the great- est elongation growth and the highest percentage of shoots that reached a length of more than 1 cm.",

In the analysed model, 8 quantitative characters such as: time of flowering and ripening, number of inflorescences, flowers per inflorescence, crowns and fruits as well as yield and average fruit weight were assessed. The obtained results showed that for the majority of analysed traits a considerable role is played by non- additive genetic effects except for ripening time, for which additive genetic effects were essential. Heritability coefficients of broad sense were very high in almost all cases, whereas ones of narrow sense were low for most characters.

During 1965-2004, a linear trend was proved and it was found to be negative for almost all phenological dates, for harvesting and for the length of conserve cucumber growth periods, except for the date of sowing and the period from the end of emergence to the beginning of fruit setting. On the basis of the date of sowing, the former phenological dates and the time trend, the dates of phenological stages, harvesting and the length of cucumber vegetation periods can be separately forecast in the area of western Poland with the accuracy of 92.3 to 99.3%. The length of the period from sowing to the end of conserve cucumber harvesting in western Poland (113 days) was longer by 46 days than that of the period from sowing to the beginning of harvesting and at the same time it was slightly less differentiated spatially.",

Callus was initiated on the cotyledon fragments grown on the medium supple- mented with NAA and BAP. The tolerance of callus to salt was tested on MS media con- taining NaCl in concentration 25, 50, 75, 100, 200 mM. Callus tolerant to 100 mM NaCl was next regenerated by ten weeks on the media with different doses of growth regulators. After this time genetic differences between selected fragments and control (MS medium containing no growth regulators) were determining using ISSR-PCR method. The results show that NaCl concentration significantly affects the regeneration of callus in L. hirsu- tum f. typicum and L. chilense. The dose 200 mM NaCl of the medium results, in both species, in callus dying. Comparing the genetic similarity of examined callus samples with the control ones in both species, it may be stated that the differences in their response to NaCl and applied growth regulators were generally in the range 2-30%.",

    "abstract": "In the cultivation of herbal plants, besides the size of the crop, the quality of obtained raw material is extremely important, which is proven not only by the appearance and taste, but also biological value. Factors that affect these parameters include plant nutrition. The main nutrient affecting the correct course of metabolic processes in a plant is potassium. To obtain high yield in terms of quantity and quality, the nutritional requirements of plants must be met. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of potassium nutrition on the quality of basil herb. The experiment was established in a two-factor scheme, in which the factors were: potassium dose (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 g K·dm–3) and the type of potassium fertilizer (KCl, K2SO4, KCl + K2SO4). The yield of basil plants was influenced by the dose and type of potassium fertilizers used (0.5 g K·dm–3 – 92.5; 1.0 g K – 67.3; 1.5 g K – 69.75 g·plant–1). The highest content of L-ascorbic acid was found in basil plants fed with the average potassium dose (65.9 mg·100 g–1 FW). The least nitrates (V) were contained in basil fertilized with KCl in the highest dose of K (63 mg·100 g–1 FW). No effect of the dose and type of potassium fertilizer on the content of phosphorus and sulfur in the plant material, was recorded. The content of Ca and Mg was influenced by both the potassium dose and the type of potassium fertilizer. The most of these components was revealed by plants fed with KCl, and with the increase of the dose, the content of both these mineral components decreased. Chlorine content in the herb increased with the applied potassium dose, the effect on the concentration of chlorine in the plant material was exerted by the type of potassium fertilizer applied – the highest concentration of this element was recorded. The content of macroelements in the substrate from basil cultivation was influenced by the dose and type of potassium fertilizers used. The best quality parameters of basil were obtained after application of 1.0 g K·dm–3 substrate in the form of KCl + K2SO4.",

The research was carried out in a greenhouse covered with double polymeric film at the Institute of Horticulture, Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry. Cucumber seedlings were grown in different substrates: peat, peat + zeolite 1 : 1, peat + zeolite 2 : 1, peat + zeolite 3 : 1 and peat + zeolite 4 : 1. Cucumber seedlings grown in peat and zeolite substrates are shorter; the leaf area is smaller than that of the seedlings grown in peat alone. The dry mass of the aboveground part of these seedlings is lower (difference insignificant), however, the root mass is higher than those grown in peat alone. The addition of zeolite to peat substrate does not have any positive effect on the photosynthesis pigment content in cucumber seedling leaves. The physiological growth indices of the seedlings grown in peat-zeolite substrates were lower compared to those grown in peat. When zeolite is added to peat substrate, net assimilation rate is higher compared to those grown in peat. Higher yields (significant difference) were demonstrated by cucumbers, the seedlings of which had been grown in peat-zeolite substrates.",

    "abstract": "Spaghetti squash is an interesting novelty in Poland. Popularization of spaghetti squash cultivation in our country requires development of agricultural recommendations. The size and the quality of yield is highly affected by the sowing date and plant popula- tion. The paper presents the results of a four-year study on the effect of the sowing date (5, 15 and 25 May) and plant spacing (1 × 0.6 m, 1 × 0.8 m and 1 × 1 m, ie. 16,668, 12,500 and 10,000 plants per ha) on the yield of spaghetti squash ('Makaronowa War- szawska' and 'Pyza') under the soil and climatic conditions of central-eastern Poland. The highest yield per hectare and the largest number of marketable fruits per plant was ob- tained while sowing on 5 May. Delaying the sowing date resulted in a decrease in the yield per hectare and of the number of marketable fruits per plant, although the average weight of a marketable fruit sown on 15 and 25 May did not significantly differ in com- parison to sowing on 5 May. Increasing the spacings between plants from 1 × 0.6 m to 1 × 1 m resulted in decreasing the yield per hectare, but the number of marketable fruits per plant was larger. Plant spacing did not have a significant effect on the average weight of a marketable fruit. The yield per hectare for the 'Pyza' was larger in comparison to the 'Makaronowa Warszawska'. The number of marketable fruits per plant did not signifi- cantly differ, but the weight of the 'Pyza' fruit was higher.",

Its decorative qualities are often diminished by the effects of pathogens colonizing the roots, shoots and leaves. The study was conducted in three consecutive growing seasons. The experimental material originated from a nursery located in southern Poland. The subjects under study were diseased leaves, stems and roots of the boxwood variety ‘Suffruticosa’. Samples consisting of 720 diseased fragments of the shrub were taken for mycological examination. Mycological isolations were performed according to the standard methods used in phytopathology. A total of 1059 colonies of fungi and fungus-like organisms were isolated from the diseased boxwood plants. The fungus Alternaria alternata dominated among all the isolates. The pathogens frequently isolated from the leaves included Macrophoma candollei, Volutella buxi and Fusarium buxicola. Those frequently isolated from the shoots included: Pestalotiopsis sydowiana, Volutella buxi and Fusarium avenaceum. The root system, in turn, was colonized in large numbers by: Fusarium oxysporum, F. avenaceum, Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea and Phytophthora cinnamomi. Results of the three-year study show a comprehensive participation of phytopathogens in the disease process affecting the boxwood variety ‘Suffruticosa’.",

In recent years, the consumption of hydrangeas as a cut flower has gradually increased. However, the vase life of cut hydrangea flowers is short depends on wilting. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the effects of different treatments [thymol (100, 150 and 200 mgL–1), 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate (8-HQS) (200 mgL–1)], and their combination with and without 1% sucrose on the vase life, relative fresh weight, daily (solution uptake for 3 days) and total solution uptake of hydrangeas (Hydrangea macrophylla ‘Green Shadow’) harvested freshly. Distilled water was used as the control. Compared to the control, thymol 150 mgL–1 treatment with 1% sucrose significantly increased the vase life of hydrangeas flowers in 5.80 days (from 10.7 to 16.5 days). It was also determined that same treatment increased the total solution uptake and delayed relative fresh weight loss. These results indicated that thymol treatments in combination with sucrose can be used to extend the vase life of cut hydrangea.",

The paper presents also studies on soil-borne fungi threatening the healthiness of carrot roots. In the conventional cultivation of carrot the population of bacteria (including Pseudomonas spp. and Bacillus spp.) was the smallest, while after the application of oats it was the largest. Oats and spring vetch were most effective in limiting the occurrence of soil-borne fungi. Those plants and tansy phacelia caused an increase of the population of saprotrophic fungi (Albifimbria spp., Clonostachys spp. and Trichoderma spp.) in the soil.

This study was carried out in Belen district of Hatay province located in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Wine grape cultivars ‘Syrah’, ‘Merlot’, ‘Sangiovese’, ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ and ‘Sauvignon Blanc’ were researched for 2 years (2016 and 2017) in terms of phenological characteristics, effective heat summation (EHS) requests and maturity time, some quality characteristics and grapevine yield and vegetative growth. Under the conditions of the study, bud break of cultivars took place at the end of March, blooming in late April-early May, and maturity in late July-early August. Bud break-maturity period EHS requests of cultivars ranged from 1540.9 to 1999.2 d.d. (day.degree). Cultivars reached the optimum total soluble solids (TSS) values under the regional conditions, while the total acidity (TA) content was low in cultivar ‘Sauvignon Blanc’. In color cultivars, maturity index were found to be in the range of the optimum values. Berry weight values of the cultivars ranged from 1.06 g (‘Cabernet Sauvignon’) to 2.15 g (‘Sangiovese’). Ravaz index values were low due to high vegetative growth. It was foreseen that this situation could be put under control via summer pruning. It was concluded that wine grape could be grown at sufficient quality and yield level with cultivars ‘Sangiovese’, ‘Merlot’, ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ and ‘Syrah’ under the conditions of Belen where the study was conducted.",

    "abstract": "The most frequent Artemisia species found in Poland are ruderal plants and garden or field weeds. Some species can be grown as ornamental, medicinal, or spice plants. Pollen grains of Artemisia contain strong allergens and cause allergic reactions during the late summer period. The aim of the study was to analyse the Artemisia pollen seasons in Lublin, to determine the effects of meteorological conditions on the occurrence of pollen grains of this taxon in the air and to develop statistical predictive models. The present study investigated Artemisia pollen concentrations in the air of Lublin in the pe- riod 2001-2012. Aerobiological monitoring was conducted by the standard volumetric method using a Hirst-type sampler (Lanzoni VPPS 2000). The method is currently rec- ommended by the International Association for Aerobiology. The atmospheric Artemisia pollen season lasted on average from the second 10-day period of July to the middle of September. The highest pollen concentrations usually occurred in the first ten-day period of August. The season start date was characterized by the lowest variation, while the daily maximum pollen concentration values showed the highest variation. Forecasting models for the pollen season start date and duration as well as for the seasonal pollen index were developed using regression analysis. The obtained forecast models largely explain the variation of the season parameters. Regression analysis can be successfully used to predict the Artemisia pollen season features on the basis of meteorological data.",

The appearance, taste and chemical composition of their fruits are reminiscent of those from wild varieties of Vaccinium angustifolium. The research was conductedat the Re- search Station of the Laboratory of Orchard at the West Pomeranian University of Tech- nology in Szczecin. The plant height, size, yield, quality and the chemical composition of fruits of Lowbush blueberry bushes ('Emil' and 'Putte') were determined. Lowbush blue- berry bushes were planted at distances of 1.0 × 2.5 m in acid muck soil (peat) at the Re- search Station of the Fruit Farming Department in 2005. Six-year-old bushes were charac- terized by a relatively low height, 70 cm on average; however, 'Putte' cultivar plants were slightly bigger. They also rendered a higher yield, totalling to 1401 g over the 4 years of research. On average, 100 g of fruits were collected from one bush in the first year and 600-700 g in the last year. Moreover, fruits from these bushes were characterized by a higher content of extract, organic acids and polyphenolic compounds, among which an- thocyanins constituted the largest group. 'Emil' cultivar fruits were bigger and firmer than fruits of 'Putte' cultivar.",

Different parts of the plants can be used to obtain essential oils, including the flowers, leaves, seeds, roots, stems, bark, wood, etc. There are many ways in which these aroma substances can be used in our life, but more importantly benefits are therapeutic properties of the oils. Distillation of buds and leaves of hazelnut (Corylus L.) grown in Poland revealed the presence of essential oils at efficiencies of 0.49% and 1.01%, respectively. The profile of physicochemical properties of achieved oils was de- termined, i.e.: density d20 (g . ml), refractive index, and optical rotation. The GC/MS analysis allowed for detecting 43 compounds in buds, among which 35 were identified, as well as 42 compounds in leaves, including 37 identified ones. Hydrocarbons and monoterpene alcohols were the main components of examined essential oils. Following compounds dominated in the oil made from hazel buds: nerol (20.6%), myrtenol (19.5%), �. -campholenol (4.7%), and p-cymene (3.7%), while hazel leaves contained prevailing amounts of: nerol (13.0%), myrtenol (9.4%), �. -campholenol (9.0%), menthol (6.7%), ge- raniol (4.8%), and limonene (3.9%).

The biggest problem for the Polish producers is to obtain high yield of good quality bulbs, so that it is advis- able to verify other than traditional methods of cultivation. The field experiment was con- ducted in 2006-2009. 'Ballerina' tulips were cultivated with a traditional method flat and on the ridges. Bulbs were planted at the depth of 9, 12, 15 and 19 cm. Cultivation methods used in the experiment did not affect the length of tulips flowering shoots. Tulips culti- vated on the ridges produced longer tepals. Flowering shoots and tepals were shorter in case of tulips cultivated at the depth of 19 cm in comparison to those cultivated at the depth of 9-12 cm. Cultivation on the ridges led to production of 7.5% more of daughter bulbs and 8.2% of commercial bulbs. Weight of daughter bulbs was higher in ridge culti- vation on average by 10.8%, and the weight of commercial bulbs on average by 14% in relation to flat cultivation. Cultivation on the ridges also increased the amount and weight of first grade bulbs (of circumference of >12 cm) by respectively 19.5 and 23.3% in com- parison to traditional cultivation. The highest yield of commercial bulbs in ridge cultiva- tion was obtained when bulbs were planted at the depth of 12-15 cm. In flat cultivation, greater amount and weight of commercial yield bulbs and first grade bulbs was obtained by planting tulips at the depth of 15-19 cm. Cultivation on the ridges ensures better aera- tion of soil, what results in smaller share of bulbs infected with pathogens in the total yield, in comparison to flat cultivation.",

The foliar CaCl2 treatment of plants before harvest contributed to a statisti- cally decrease in the nitrate levels and nitrite increase in whole leaves in fresh plants. The greatest changes were noticed after using of 0.1M CaCl2 solution on plants. During the storage time of lettuce in the non-treatment plants were observed the higher concentration of nitrates and nitrites in leaf blades compared to fresh plants. The CaCl2 treatment on let- tuce caused a significant decrease in the nitrite concentration of whole leaves of plants stored for 7 days, while in the leaf blades higher nitrite amounts were accumulated in let- tuce which was stored in cold conditions during all experimental time.",

During the realization of studies, the mineral soil content (P, K, Mg) was identified, the total content of nitrogen and the pH value of soil were determined. In order to recognize the nutritional status of trees, the mineral contents of leaves (N, P, K, Mg and Ca) were investigated. Obtained results indicated that the content of mineral components in the soil depended on the earlier applied cultivation methods and on the soil layer from which the samples were taken. The highest mineral content was found in the soil which had been earlier use for agricultural purposes. The content of total nitrogen in the soil was significantly differentiated, depending on the soil locality where the apple-trees were planted and on the term of sampling. In summer season, the total nitrogen content in the soil was on the lowest level.

    "abstract": "Extending the harvesting time allows the consumers to eat fresh strawberries from the spring to the autumn. It also creates the opportunity to increase profits for the growers. However, such production requires new technologies and appropriate cultivars. Studies on extending (delaying) of the fruit harvesting period of two Polish strawberry cultivars - 'Grandarosa' and 'Pink Rosa' - were conducted at the Research Institute of Horticulture in Skierniewice (Central Poland) in 2012-2013. The productivity, fruit ripen- ing time and fruit quality of both cultivars were assessed in the open field conditions (three dates of delayed planting, frigo potted and bare-root plants) as well as in soilless cultivation in gutters under plastic canopies and in a high tunnel (delayed planting, frigo potted plants). 'Elsanta' was used as the reference cultivar. It was found that delayed planting of frigo plants resulted in extending the harvest time by roughly 10 weeks in field condition and up to 12 weeks in soilless cultivation under cover. Both Polish cultivars were suitable for the cultivation in the open field and under covers for the delayed harvest. In both types of cultivation the peak of harvesting was 8 to 12 days earlier in 'Elsanta' as compared to 'Grandarosa' and 'Pink Rosa'. The overall productivity as well as average fruit weight and fruit firmness of both Polish cultivars were significantly higher in com- parison with 'Elsanta'. The production under covers was more effective than in the open field, where the high temperatures of soil and air prevailing after planting resulted in de- crease of yield and fruit quality. Moreover, plants under covers did not suffer from the early autumn frosts and they were harvested in a longer period of time as compared to plants grown in the open field.",

Cooler regions are expected to be unsuitable for grape growing due to insufficient maturation and variability of quality parameters. Therefore, a field trial was conducted, aimed to determine the effect of pruning time on low cordon cane (CP) and spur pruned (SP) grapevines of the hybrid cultivar Hasanski Sladki in a cool climate conditions. A vineyard, with the low double trunk (25 cm in height) training system, was established at the experimental station of the Estonian University of Life Sciences (58°23'17'' N, 26°41'50'' E) in June 2007. The treatments were carried out in autumn af- ter leaf fall and in spring at the two leaf phase in 2010/2011 and 2011/2012. Pruning time affected grape maturity parameters depending on pruning method. Autumn SP increased the soluble solids content from 18.5 to 19.8 °Brix in 2011 and from 17.1 to 18.0 in 2012. Ti- tratable acids content was high in both experimental years ranging from 1.3 to 2.1 g 100 g -1 , and only autumn CP decreased it. Pruning in spring significantly decreased the soluble solids/ titratable acids for both pruning methods. The timing of SP affected the maturity index (MI = °Brix × pH 2 ) variably; in 2011, spring pruning decreased the index whereas; the index was increased in 2012. Spring pruning decreased the total phenolics up to 22% in both treatments in the two years mean. In CP, spring pruning increased anthocyanins content from 31 to 77 mg 100 g -1 in 2012.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and phenotypic stability of plants obtained via somatic embryogenesis may be disrupted. The reason can be an indirect regeneration of somatic embryos via cal- lus or a high concentration of growth regulators added at the induction stage of somatic embryos. Somatic embryogenesis of 'Lady Salmon' (chimeric) and 'Lady Vitroflora' (non-chimeric) cultivars was induced on modified Murashige and Skoog (MS) media, supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and kinetin (KIN) or 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). Flow cytometry (FCM) revealed that the plants derived from somatic embryos of both cultivars maintained the ploidy of control plants obtained from the meristem. The colour and pigment content of the inflorescence of plants derived from somatic embryos of 'Lady Vitroflora' were similar to the original control plants. However, the ray florets of clones of 'Lady Salmon' did not contain carotenoids, charac- teristic for this cultivar, and consequently produced flowers of different colours. Thus, somatic embryogenesis in chrysanthemums can be applied for separating periclinal chi- mera components for chimeric cultivars and for receiving an additional source of variation in the breeding of cultivars. In the case of genetically homogeneous cultivars it can be used in production laboratories for cloning plants in vitro via somatic embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Geraniums are popular bedding plants used in urban public space and private gardens. Although well adapted to drought they often suffer from water stress, especially when planted into containers. In this trial, a response to periodical soil water shortage was tested on potted geraniums fertilized with a fertilizer containing 36% silicon and 20% phosphorus. During five weeks of culture under the experimental conditions, half of the greenhouse-grown plants were subjected to two 7 and 10-day periods without irrigation, separated by the periods of standard watering (7 and 10 days, respectively) (stressed plants) while the other half were irrigated (control plants). Half of the plants in each watering regime were planted into a growing medium enriched with the Si+P fertilizer. The parameters of growth and flowering were evaluated on the 35 day and the leaves were analyzed for RWC, chlorophyll a+b and free proline contents. Water stress had little effect on plant height but decreased by one third the fresh weight of the above-soil plant parts. The number of flowers remained unaffected but the number of flower buds developed under the experimental conditions fell to 30% in plants subjected to stress as compared to the watered control. The application of the fertilizer enhanced plant growth regardless the watering regime but decreased flower numbers in both groups. However, this treatment positively affected development of new flower buds, especially in stressed geraniums, where the increase in bud number was nearly 8-fold relative to the non fertilized plants. The relative leaf water contents remained unaffected by the watering regime while the fertilizer increased RWC in both plant groups. Total chlorophyll contents doubled under stress, and were further increased by the fertilizer in both plant groups. Water deficit increased the free proline content in leaves by a third. However, in the non-stressed and fertilized plants it increased by 48% and remained unchanged in stressed fertilized plants. The experiment demonstrates that Si+P fertilization may mitigate the undesirable effects of water-stress in potted geraniums.",

Five strawberry cultivars (from 10 initial ones) including ‘Kent’, ‘Teresa’, ‘Senga Sengana’, ‘Chandler’ and the breeding clone 1387 were examined and self-pollinated in order to obtain first (S1), second (S2) and third (S3) inbreeding generations. 5 cultivars differing in pedigree which were assumed to have the inbreeding coefficient of zero (F = 0) were compared with self-pollinated populations with expected inbreeding coefficients F = 0.5 (S1), F = 0.75 (S2) and F = 0.87 (S3). The effects of different inbreeding levels were estimated for the following traits: number of inflorescences, number of flowers per inflorescence, fruit yield per plant, fruit number per plant, average fruit weight, weight of leaves per plant and pollen viability. Both positive and negative inbreeding depressions were found in many progenies in terms of the analysed characters. Weight of leaves per plant in S1, S2 and S3 was affected the most (inbreeding depression ID = 62.5, ID = 66.2 and ID = 67.2, respectively). In the second generation (S2), average fruit number per plant increased in comparison to S0 (ID was -6.1). Inbreeding depression for average fruit weight per plant decreased in the successive inbreeding generations.",

BA decreased the content of majority of cations, while higher dosage of this compound resulted in the lowest fruit firmness. Application of NAA and GA3 increased of Ca and Mg content and resulted in the most expressed water loss. Titrable acidity and pH were not affected by any applied treatments.",

Si was applied at a concentration of 50, 100, 200 and 500 mg dm–3. The highest explant (2.02 cm) with the highest number of new shoots (1.91) and fresh weight (55.16 g) was obtained on WPM medium with the addition of Si in concentration 200 mg dm–3. In experiment 2, similar to 0.1 mg dm–3 zeatin explant growth was achieved when 15% CW was added to the WPM medium (2.13 cm). The use of CM did not have a positive effect on blueberry growth in vitro. The results of experiment 3 indicated that explants of blueberry better developed when pH was lower (5.0) with the highest number of new shoots (2.85) and fresh weight (95.67g). However, there were no significant differences in plant height between pH used. The application of 200 mg dm–3 Actisil benefits the negative effect of higher pH of the WPM medium on micropropagation of blueberry in case of plant height, fresh weight, and biochemical parameters (proline, malondialdehyde – MDA and catalase – CAT activity).",

The results obtained showed that both auxin and both of the brassinosteroids used increased the percentage of rooted cuttings almost twice, the degree of rooted cuttings and root length – for BL + IBA – longer roots than the control by 41% in jasmine and by 59% in hydrangea. The growth regulators applied during the rooting of cuttings also caused changes in the organic compound content of plant tissues and the activity of oxidative stress enzymes. The studies and results suggest that brassinosteroids may soon replace the popular rooting stimulants.",

The results indicated that the leaf growth rate, the individual pepper fruit weight, and the fruit longitudinal and cross diameters of the pruned group were significantly higher than those of the control. The stomatal conductance (Gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and transpiration rate (Tr) of the pruned group were significantly higher than those of the control. The initial slope of the rapid light response curve, which represents light energy utilisation efficiency (α), the maximum electron transfer rate (Jmax) and saturated light intensity (PARsat) were all higher in the summer pruning group than in the control group. The F0 of the pruned group decreased by 16.83%, Fv/F0 increased by 23.69%, PIabs increased by 58.33%, and DIo/RC decreased by 22.09% compared to the control group. In summary, summer pruning significantly improves the leaf growth rate and fruit appearance quality of pepper, effectively promotes the photosynthesis of functional leaves, and reduces the degree of stress under adverse environmental conditions.",

Mycorrhizal symbiosis seems to have improved the survival of ‘Meski’ and the growth rate of ‘Zarrazi’. Plant water status and gas exchanges were enhanced in ‘Meski’. Mycorrhization helped maintain a higher photosynthetic assimilation rate and stomatal conductance in ‘Zarrazi’. AMF-symbiosis exhibited an inter-cultivar difference in the enhancement of the ecophysiological performance of olive trees under aridity. It also improved pre-existent indigenous defense strategies.

Whole apples, apple slices, seeds, and leaves belonging to ‘Free Redstar’, clone 118, ‘Ligolina’, ‘Pink Braeburn’, and ‘Pinokio’ were imaged using a digital camera. The texture parameters were extracted from images in color channels L, a, b, R, G, B, X, Y, Z, U, V, and S. The classification models were built using traditional machine learning algorithms. Models developed using selected image seed textures allowed the classification of apple cultivars and a clone with the highest average accuracy of up to 97.4%. The apple seeds ‘Free Redstar’ were distinguished with the highest accuracy, equal to 100%. Machine learning models built based on the textures of apple skin allowed for the clone and cultivar classification with slightly lower correctness, reaching 94%. Meanwhile, the average accuracies for models involving selected flesh and leave textures reached 86.4% and 88.8%, respectively. All the most efficient models for classifying individual apple fruit parts and leaves were developed using Multilayer Perceptron. However, models combining selected image textures of apple skin, slices (flesh), seeds, and leaves produced the highest average accuracy of up to 99.6% in the case of Bayes Net. Thus, it was found that including features of different parts of apple fruit and apple leaves in one model can allow for the correct distinguishing of apples in terms of cultivar and clone.",

    "abstract": "Dog rose (Rosa canina L.) is a beautiful ornamental plant that provides fruit with high biological value. To be available throughout the year, rose hips need to be conserved, such as dried and canned. For this reason, a study was undertaken to investigate the effects of drying as the most common method for preservation. Therefore, the influence of variation drying temperature (20, 35 and 68 °C) on the content of flavonoids, total polyphenols, ascorbic acid, carotenoids and antioxidant activity - determined using the free radical source DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and a test measuring the measuring of compounds to reduce ferric ions Fe3+ (FRAP) - of rose hips was the main topic in this study. Drying decreased total polyphenols (from 38.06 mg g–1 by fresh fruits to 9.41 mg g–1 drying to 20 °C), ascorbic acid (from 2000.5 mg 100 g–1 by fresh fruits to 1308.2 mg 100 g–1 drying to 68 °C) and flavonoids, the latter only in those dried at 35 °C (0.54 mg g–1), but did not affect the antioxidant activity of DPPH (84.21–85.73%) and FRAP (2.99–3.41 mgTr g–1). The study also showed that the extraction time influenced the antioxidant activity level of fruit infusions for the first time. The antioxidant potential FRAP value increased systematically with extraction time, but the DPPH values of extracts obtained from dried rose hips were not affected by the extraction time. These results indicate that changes in the antioxidant activity of extracts may not be linear and that the choice of the time of evaluation of this activity may determine the results.",

    "abstract": "The effect of N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA, 5.0%, w/w in lanolin) on the growth of Solidago canadensis (Canadian goldenrod) stem was studied, focusing on histological analyses, comprehensive analyses of phytohormones and polar metabolites. NPA substantially induced stem swelling at and above the application site and stimulated vascular cambium activity around the area of its application. The cambial zone in the swelling part of the stem was twice as wide as that treated with lanolin only (control). The proliferation of cambial cells increased xylem production and, consequently, vascular bundle thickness. A significant enlargement of parenchymatous pith cells and an increased diameter of the pith were also observed. Comprehensive phytohormone analyses revealed that NPA increased the content of indole-3-propionic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, and indole-3-acetyl-aspartic acid in the swelling part of the stem, as well as trans-zeatin riboside. These results suggest that NPA-induced stem swelling depends on the dynamics of changes in aux-in and cytokinin metabolites. Furthermore, the contents of monosaccharides (glucose, fructose and galactose) as well as malic, succinic, fumaric acids, cyclitols and quinic acid derivatives in-creased markedly in the swelling stem. This may indicate that the site of NPA-induced stem swell-ing is a physiological sink for polar metabolites needed for the growth of this tissue. Thus, it seems that auxins, in interaction with cytokinins, regulate the strength of the sink, controlling the transport of polar metabolites into the swelling part of S. canadensis stem.",

The seed germination parameters: germination percentage, relative salt tolerance and salt tolerance index, as well as growth parameters of seedlings as plant height, leaf number, plant fresh weight, root length, root fresh weight, plant height/root length ratio, plant height stress tolerance index, root length stress tolerance index, and chlorophyll content, were evaluated in Giza 02 and Q102 Chenopodium quinoa varieties. Halopriming with KNO₃, hormopriming with GA₃, followed by halopriming with MgSO₄, effectively mitigated the negative impacts of salinity. This priming approach shows promise for enhancing quinoa crop resilience in saline soils and could serve as a model for other salt-sensitive crops.",

The correlation and principal component analyses were also conducted on the experimental data. The results demonstrated that the calcium ions were effective in maintaining the appearance and color of the fruit peel, enhancing its antioxidant capacity, and regulating its nutrient content. This treatment significantly increased the calcium content of the passion fruit peels, extending the fruit’s freshness beyond four days. The correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the mass loss rate of the passion fruit and the majority of the physicochemical properties examined. The findings indicated that the calcium chloride treatment could effectively maintain fruit storage quality and prolong the shelf life of postharvest passion fruit by several days.

The smallest number of species (22) and individuals (535) was noted in the protected plantation and the highest number in an unprotected one (46 species and 2787 individuals). In the forest the presence of 46 species and 1317 individuals was observed. The dominant species among beetles on hazel plantation in south-eastern Poland are from weevils' family (Curculionidae). Curcu- lio nucum and leaf-eaters from Phyllobius sp. genus were most often collected. The rema- ining species that were observed are non-economic pests of hazelnut, but giving up suitable chemical pest control and horticultural treatment results in an increase of their number.

Results confirmed that a dry and dark storage of Zant- edeschia leaves negatively affected their decorative values while for Hosta foliage a dry storage was improper both in darkness and in light. Negative effects of storage conditions could - at least partly - be alleviated by a 24 h puls conditioning with gibberellic acid or benzyladenine for Zantedeschia and Hosta, respectively. In Zantedeschia the pulsed leaves cold stored in darkness had their vase life seven-fold that of non pulsed leaves. In Hosta pulsing leaves with BA prior to storage increased their vase life six times relative to untreated leaves, however, the cytokinin did not completely overcome a negative effect of dry storage.

The heads of plants fertilized with calcium nitrate and urea were characterized by the highest content of Al, Mn, Sr, Zn, Cd and Mo. Urea caused a significant increase in the content of Cu, Li and V, while ammonium nitrate resulted in an elevated level of Fe and Co accumulation in cabbage heads. Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 led to a substantial de- crease in the content of Al, Mo and V, and fertilization with NH4NO3 caused a decline in Sr concentrations in cabbage in comparison with other objects of the experiment.

The concentrations of extracts from N. meyeri in Petri dishes were 2%, 5% and 10% (w/v) for aqueous extract (AE); 500, 1000 and 1500 ppm (v/v) for methanolic extract (ME), and 0.6, 0.8 and 1 µL for essential oil (EO). After the treatments, mycelial growth, spore germination, and germ tube elongation were determined. Sterile distilled water at the same ratios was used for the control treatment. Thirty-six different compounds were identified in the EO of N. meyeri by GC/MS. The highest antifungal activity has been registered for EO of N. meyeri. The inhibition rates in 1 µL/Petri of the EO were 80.72%, 18%, 38.15% on mycelial growth, spore germination and germ tube elongation, respectively. However, AE and ME of N. meyeri showed diverse effects on the studied parameters of B. cinerea. It is suggested that the favourable concentration of EO from N. meyeri can contribute to the prevention of B. cinerea infection (grey mould) which causes disease in vineyards.",

    "abstract": "Water deficit during the growing season is a major factor limiting vegetable production. Therefore, saving water used for vegetable production by applying regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) can be a strategy to reduce water supply. The effects of different RDI levels from irrigation systems on vegetable yields, yield components, water use, and water use efficiency (WUE) of maize, lettuce, and garland chrysanthemum were investigated in a pot experiment. Plants were subjected to four irrigation levels, as follows: full irrigation as a control (RDI-100), 70% of full irrigation (RDI-70), 50% of full irrigation (RDI-50), and 30% of full irrigation (RDI-30). The WUE values of maize and lettuce were significantly higher with RDI-30 than other treatments, yet a significant reduction of WUE in garland chrysanthemum was detected compared to other treatments. There were significant correlations of WUEi with WUEyield and WUEbiomass in maize plants, indicating that WUEi can be a useful nondestructive estimator of yields and biomass contents in maize. Moreover, a significant correlation between WUEi and WUEyield in lettuce plants was observed. This index was correlated with economic production, and can be used to assess fresh weights and as an index of the irrigated water content. These results for evaluating water deficits in plants used nondestructive measurements that are applicable to large-scale water management of vegetable plants, thereby enabling scarce water resources to be conserved.",

The effects of three different greenhouse covering materials, clear glass, polycarbonate and diffuse tempered glass were used to evaluate its effect on cucumber productivity, water and energy use efficiency. Results show that either water or light use efficiency was higher in compartments covered with diffused or clear glass than polycarbonate compartment. Inconsequence, fruit yield of cucumber plants/m2 was significantly higher (58%) in clear and diffuse glass greenhouses as opposed to polycarbonate greenhouse. In term of the effect of cultivar or plant density, no significant differences on cucumber yield were found. Using of different covering materials did affect environmental data of greenhouses. Less light was transmitted through polycarbonate cover than clear or diffuse glass. The photosynthesis active radiation (P.A.R.) was 996, 1703, 1690 mol/m2/d, while the electricity consumption was 2.97, 3.44, and 2.88 kWh under polycarbonate, clear glass, and diffuse glass, respectively. Meanwhile, diffuse glass compartment revealed 16% lower of water consumption than other covering materials.

This paper, based on the results of 3-year experiments, evaluates utility and biological value of fruits of four Polish cvs.: 'Bronowicka Ostra', 'Orkan', 'Cyklon' and 'Rokita'. Agricultural study was conducted for three years, during the period 2009-2011. Fruits of various maturity stage consisted of the marketable yield of the and hot pepper from a single harvest. The evaluated cultivars differed in utility and biological value of fruits, quantity and fruit yield structure. The greatest yield was ob- tained from 'Orkan' and 'Rokita' cvs. (2.17 kg·m -2 ), yet the greatest yield of physiologi- cally mature fruits (1.16 kg·m -2 ) from 'Bronowicka Ostra' cv. whose share in marketable yield was 65.0%. Biological value of fruits depended on maturity stage and cultivar geno- type. Physiologically mature fruits contained most dry mass (13.18%), soluble solids (4.4%), L-ascorbic acid (199.9 mg·100 g -1 f.m.), total sugars (2.92%). Yet more capsaici- noids were proved in green fruits and fruits turning colour. Least dry mass (%) and total sugars (%) were noted in 'Orkan' cv., whereas least L-ascorbic acid in 'Bronowicka Os- tra' cv., in which fruits at every stage of maturity accumulated most capsaicinoids.",

    "abstract": "One of the reasons lowering the esthetic appearance of a lawn are diseases caused by fungi. The study on seed material of 11 ornamental grass species was carried out in 2009 and 2010. 681 fungi isolates belonging to 22 species and non-sporulating forms were obtained over the two year study period. Among fungi pathogenic to grasses, species of the genus Fusarium were obtained especially in 2010. In that year, isolates of these fungi constituted 29.94% of all isolated colonies. Colonies of Alternaria alternata were also frequently isolated from the analyzed seed material of the ornamental grasses; in 2009 and 2010 its isolates accounted for respectively 25.36 and 12.57% of all isolates. The study on the health of ornamental grasses conducted in field conditions revealed the occurrence of plants with necrosis of the roots and lower stem internodes. The percentage of such plants ranged from 12% for Coix lacryma-jobi to 69% in the case of Festuca ovina. The mean values of the diseases indices were from 2.6 in the case of Coix lacryma- jobi to 39.6 for Lagurus ovatus and they differed significantly. From the infected plants mainly species of genus Fusarium were obtained. Majority of isolates consisted F. oxysporum and also F. culmorum, F. crookwellense, F. graminearum, F. solani, F. avenaceum, F. sporotrichioides and species Bipolaris sorokiniana and Exserohilum pedicellatum were obtained. Studies on susceptibility of the seedlings of seven ornamental grass species to infection by Fusarium culmorum No. 34 and F. equiseti No. 62 were con- ducted in a growth chamber. The statistical analysis of disease indexes for plants that grew in the experimental combination with artificial infection of the subsoil with above- mentioned strains as compared to the control indicated significant differences in all stud- ied species in the case of F. culmorum and in 5 species in the experimental combination with F. equiseti. Strain Fusarium culmorum No. 34 proved to be the most pathogenic to- wards Festuca glauca (98.25), and F. equiseti No. 62 towards Phalaris canariensis (89.5).",

In view of increasing resistance of spider mites on acaricides, searching for alternative methods of nursery plants protec- tion against those pests, seems to be reasonable. In this work it was important to find out which cultivars of Norway spruce grown in nurseries are threaten by infestation by large amounts of spider mites and to verified if and which species of phytoseiid mites occur on spruces grown in chemical protected nurseries. Density and species composition of tetranychid and phytoseiid mites were also investigated on Norway spruces growing in forests. Our investigations showed that, almost all cultivars of Norway spruce that are of- fered for sale in nurseries are inhabited by spider mites. Cultivars 'Inversa', 'Remontii', 'Waldbrund', 'Nidiformis' or 'Pumila Glauca' were identified as especially threatened with massive infestation by those pests. Also some predatory mites, such as Typhlodro- mus tiliae Oudemans, were observed in nurseries, but their density was several times lower than on spruces growing in natural conditions. Additionally in forests we observed also Anthoseius bakeri (Garman) and Amblyseius andersoni (Chant).",

    "abstract": "Strawberry is propagated vegetatively. Nowadays, traditional bare-root trans- plants are often replaced with plantlets (plug plants) produced from runner tips. The nutri- ent level and type of growing medium may influence the quality of planting material. Phosphorus and potassium are important elements for plant metabolism. Insufficient supply of plants with these elements negatively influences the rooting and plant vegetative growth. The objective of the study was to evaluate the influence of substrate and monopo- tassium phosphate (MKP) on rooting and quality of strawberry plantlets grown in the greenhouse soilless system. 'Elsanta' mother plants were planted in containers and set on a special rack in the greenhouse. Emerging plantlets were set (clipped with metal clips) in micro-pots filled with peat or coconut substrate. Four concentrations of MKP in the grow- ing medium were applied: 0, 0.22, 0.44, 0.66 g dm -3 . Rooting of plantlets was carried out before cutting them off from the mother plants for a period 7, 10 or 14 days. The investi- gations have showed a very similar dynamics of root formation both in coconut substrate and in peat. A significant effect of the application of monopotassium phosphate on rooting of strawberry plantlets was observed. The optimal dose of MKP depended on the length of rooting period of plantlets. After 7 days of rooting the highest root weight was recorded in case of plantlets rooted in the growing media supplemented with 0.44 or 0.66 g dm -3 MKP. After 10 and 14 days of rooting even the lowest dose of MKP (0.22 g dm -3 ) re- sulted in significantly stronger root growth in comparison with not fertilized control plant- lets. MKP also significantly influenced the growth of plantlets after transplanting them into bigger containers. The highest quality plantlets were obtained at the dose 0.44 or 0.66 g MKP dm -3 of substrate.",

However broad bean green seeds had as a very shortly time to use because the green seeds very quickly lost the white-green fresh colour. The aim of the study was to evaluate the content of biologically active substances in fresh broad bean seeds immediately after the harvest and seeds from pods stored for a week under low temperature conditions. Experimental material consisted of fresh, green broad bean seeds of Bachus, Basta, R-366/1, Bolero, Jankiel Bia· y, and Windsor Bia· y cultivars. Broad bean seeds were sown in the second decade of April at 60 × 10 cm spacing, 100 seeds per plot of 6.0 m 2 area. Broad bean pods were harvested once at the stage of technological maturity of seeds in the second and third decade of July. Marketable seed samples of 500 g were collected for laboratory tests. At the same time, immediately after the harvest, samples of 2 kg marketable broad bean pods of each culti- var were collected and storage within 7 days at 1-4°C. The contents of L-ascorbic acid, chlorophyll (a + b), flavonoids (QE), free phenolic acids sum (CAE), and dry matter were determined in broad bean seeds directly after the harvest as well as in the seeds from the pods stored for 7 days. In the results of the investigation indicate that green faba bean seeds from the storage pods had a good white-green colour and marketable quality, how- ever the seeds had the significantly lowest content of L-ascorbic acid and chlorophyll (a + b). The content of selected biologically active substances in the seeds after storage in the pods indicates a significant difference in dependence on cultivar.",

In the present study, we in- vestigated the efficient lighting spectrum and elevated CO2 concentration for cultivating healthier plants more rapidly. One of the aims of our study is to optimize LEDs light spec- trum for healthier vegetable production in greenhouses and maximum economical benefits for growers. The impact of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration on antioxidant and nutritional properties of green leaf 'Multigreen 3' and red leaf 'Multired 4' baby leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), grown under optimized light spectrum was investigated. CO2 concentrations of 0.963 g �� dm -3 and 1.938 g �� dm -3 were maintained in the growth cham- bers. Lettuce was grown under four wavelength (640, 455, 660 and 735 nm) light-emitting diode based (LED) illumination. Under 0.963 g �� dm -3 CO2 conditions, 'Multired 4' let- tuce represented higher antioxidant value due to higher ascorbic acid, anthocyanin, toco- pherol contents and higher sucrose concentration, as compared to 'Multigreen 3' lettuce. Higher CO2 concentration (1.938 g �� dm -3 ) had uneven effect on the quality of both baby leaf lettuce cultivars. Red leaf lettuce reacted to the higher CO2 level by lowered D toco- pherol, ascorbic acid concentrations and significantly higher glucose contents in their leaves, when green leaf lettuce - contrarily - contained higher ascorbic acid and D toco- pherol concentrations under 1.938 g �� dm -3 of CO2.",

This species suffers 100% mortality after infection of root rot caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi. The hybrid material A. cilicica × A. cephalonica (CZ) and A. koreana × (A. cilicica × A. cephalonica) was utilized as mother trees for applications of Abies fraseri pollen. In addition to resistance to fungal disease, a long-term monitoring of growth of young seedlings along with the impact of artificial crossing on morphology of the progeny is covered. Except for increased resistance, some offspring has also exhibited a remarkable heterosis effect at younger age and different growth habit and different shape of their needles. All this may offer in the future a wide range of applications, both for crops under strong anthropogenic pressure with changing climatic conditions and for crops grown for production of Christmas trees and outstanding ornamental cultivars. An- nual crossing success was determined in present study using X-ray imaging. The most successful combinations in 2012 were those of CZ1 × FF25 and CZ1 × FF76 with 7% of full seeds, followed by CZ2 × FF25 with 6% and CZ2 × FF31 with 4% of the full seeds. The evaluation of young seedlings from control crossing in 2007 highlighted significant accented height growth of complicated hybrid (A. koreana × (A. cilicica × A. cephalo- nica)) × FF PC. Morphology of needles showed variability in their length as compared with the needle width which was found to be less appropriate characteristic for distin- guishing between different combinations.",

The average content of chlo- rophyll a + b per 100 g of rocket fresh biomass was 1.16 mg, while the L-ascorbic acid concentration - 92.66 mg. 100 g of dried rocket leaves contained on average 0.84 g of flavonoids and 0.15 ml of essential oil, while 1 g of dry plant material was characterized by the presence of 10.56 μmol of glucosinolates, on average. Potassium chloride proved to be an interesting source of potassium; its application significantly increased the concen- tration of glucosinolates in the rocket leaves. However, this form of potassium was not found to have a significant effect on the accumulation of L-ascorbic acid, chlorophyll, flavonoids, and essential oil. An increased rate of nitrogen contributed to a decrease in the content of L-ascorbic acid and glucosinolates. The presented results show that it is possi- ble to modify the chemical composition of rocket leaves by using an appropriate system of plant mineral nutrition.",

In addition, the metal chelating potential of this plant was also evaluated. The higher the inhibition % value calculated in these tests, the higher the antioxidant activity was considered and the results were evaluated. The average ABTS radical cleaning test results of Smilax excelsa extracts prepared in different concentrations of methanol, ethanol and pure water were found to be 98.14%, 98.16%, 90.20%, respectively. The average DPPH radical cleaning test results of the extracts of this plant prepared in different concentrations of methanol, ethanol and pure water were determined as 87.48%, 76%, 46.53%, respectively.

The components of the hydro distilled oil samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In the study, the essential oil was evaluated for its antibacterial activity against six bacterial strains consisting of two Gram (+) and four Gram (–) by the agar disc diffusion method. Additionally, the antioxidant properties of the oil were determined by TEAC/ABTS+ free radical scavenging assay. As a result, there were 27 compounds in the essential oil of J. excelsa. Of the 27 essential oil components identified, α-pinene (40.59%), α-cedrol (18.15%), β-myrcene (4.53%), and limonene (3.84%) were determined as the main components in total 91.54% of the essential oil.

Green leaves were treated with MeJA in lanoline on the abaxial or adaxial side of the leaf blades. After three weeks of treatment, leaf blades and petioles were collected separately for FA analyses. Additionally, petioles and leaf blades were sampled for analyses before the experiment and after 6 weeks when leaf senescence was occurring. Linolenic (C18:3) and palmitic (C16:0) acids appeared to be the quantitatively most abundant FA in leaf blades and petioles of G. biloba. Both leaf senescence and that induced by MeJA caused a decrease in unsaturated FA content, especially linolenic (C18:3). However, the decrease in C18:3 acid in both leaf blades and petioles was greater when MeJA was applied to the abaxial side than when it was applied to the adaxial side of leaves or during senescence. At the same time, saturated FA content increased, resulting in a significant decrease in the ratio of total unsaturated to saturated FA. Since leaf fatty acids occur mainly as components of cell membranes, changes in their composition may have a crucial effect on membrane function and stability, as pointed out in the discussion of the results.",

Shoot proliferation, and biomass and secondary metabolite accumulation in the shoots were assessed after a three-week growth period in a RITA® bioreactor. The levels of polyphenols in four types of extract (hydromethanolic extracts – mixtures with a 20%, 50%, and 80% methanol content and infusion) were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Within three weeks, the culture increased its biomass 283-fold, with a proliferation ratio of 40.5 shoots or/and buds per explants. The most efficient solvent for extraction of phenolic compounds from raw material turned out to be 80% methanol solution; the highest polyphenol content was 40 mg/g DW (dry weight) with acacetin rhamnosyl-trihexoside (12.97 mg/g DW) and rosmarinic acid (10.68 mg/g DW) predominating. The intensive growth of the biomass of the culture allowed 570 mg of polyphenolic compounds to be obtained per liter of the medium. The antioxidant potential of extract of D. forrestii shoots was evaluated using three free radical-scavenging tests, and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation assay.

    "abstract": "Generally, moderate to high salinity conditions and excess boron (B) occur together as limiting factors for plant growth in the soils of arid and semiarid regions. To determine the combined effect of excessive boron, salinity stress, or both, five different levels of B (0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) and 80 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) were applied to lavandin plants grown in a greenhouse. The results showed that under nonsaline conditions, biomass production in shoots and roots and photosynthetic pigment contents (chlorophyll (Chl) a, b, and Chl a + b) decreased with exceptionally high B applications compared to the control. Moreover, the bioconcentration (BCF) of B (in shoots and roots), potassium (K) concentrations (in roots), K/sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca)/Na ratios (in shoots), and Ca/B ratios (in shoots and roots) decreased for all B applications compared to the control. In contrast, all B applications caused a remarkable increase in the carotenoid (Car)/Chl ratio, B concentrations (in shoots and roots), translocation (TF) of B, and net B accumulation compared to the control. In addition, under nonsaline conditions, concentrations of K (in shoots), Ca (in shoots and roots), and K/Na and Ca/Na ratios (in roots) were significantly increased by B applications compared with the control. Under saline conditions, significant decreases in Chl b, Chl a + b, BCF of B (in shoots and roots), and Ca/B ratio (in shoots) were observed in all B applications compared to the control. However, under saline conditions, B application caused significant increases in the Car/Chl ratio, TF of B, net B accumulation, and concentrations of B (in shoots and roots), K (in shoots), Ca, and Na (in shoots and roots) compared to the control. It was concluded that although it is not seen in the growth parameters, NaCl application could effectively alleviate the harmful effects of B toxicity in lavandin plants. Under saline conditions, notable decreases in the mean B concentration in shoots could be strong evidence for this hypothesis.",

Transcriptome analysis of flower and leaf color formation provides new sources for producing novel Oncidium hybridum cultivars. We sequenced 12 samples of flowers (yellow and white) and leaves (striped and regular) of O. hybridum and assembled 381,136 and 453,566 unigene sequences from RNA-seq data, respectively. Among unigenes, 662 and 1,324 differentially expressed genes were identified in flower and leaf samples, respectively. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment showed that secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways were responsible for flower and leaf color formation. It was determined that UGT75C1, E2.4.1.115, CCD7, E2.1.1.76, and CCoAOMT are involved in regulating flower color, and UGT75C1, LHCB, UGT, RP-L18Ae, and ABCB1 play crucial roles in regulating leaf color. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that UGT75C1 was significantly enriched in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, showing effects on flower and leaf colors. This study was the first detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms of O. hybridum flower and leaf colors, and the results advanced the understanding of the genetic basis of flower and leaf colors; they also provided additional support for improving commercial value and producing novel cultivars of O. hybridum.",

Disinfection and regeneration results were better for the apical buds than the axillary buds. Soaking explants in nystatin before surface disinfection or using a medium with an antibiotic increased the effectiveness of disinfection (even by 27–46%, depending on the combination) and did not inhibit the regeneration of explants. At the shoot propagation stage, the multiplication rate was twice as high for the shoots originating from the apical buds (5.5 per explant) than for those originating from the axillary buds. The addition of yellow light to the red and blue light (RBY) spectrum increased the multiplication rate, and the addition of green light to the red and blue (RBG) spectrum increased the fresh weight of the shoots. The highest content of chlorophyll a was found in the shoots propagated under RB, as well as RBY and RBG light.",

The main plot was three drought stress levels: control, moderate drought stress (MDS), and severe drought stress (SDS), whereas the subplots were three Si appli­cation levels: control or non-use of Si, calcium silicate and nano-Si, and two Ck application levels: control or non-use of Ck, Ck application. The results indicated that the sesame seed yield was reduced by 9.3% under MDS and by 32.7% under SDS when compared with control conditions. The highest MDA content and proline accumulation were observed when the plants were subjected to SDS, whereas the higher activity of antioxidant enzymes occurred under MDS. Higher activity of antioxidant enzymes and reduction of MDA content was observed in the plants treated by combined application of Si and Ck under MDS. However, the higher seed yield, greater proline content, and higher antioxidant enzyme activities were obtained from plants treated by nano-Si than calcium silicate. Overall, the results of the present study revealed that the foliar application of nano-Si + Ck can be a promising option for mitigating the negative impacts of drought stress and improving sesame seed yield.",

The effect of legume species on soil microbial biomass was also investigated. Mycorrhizal and nodulation intensity varied greatly between legume species. The higher number of nodules (14 nodules per plant) and mycorrhization intensity (54%) were registered in root of Argyrolobium arabicum. Rhizosphere soils of all legume species harbored higher AMF fungal spores than bulk soils. Our results suggest also a significant effect of legumes species on soil microbial biomass.

Punjab selection produced significantly greater number of flowers and pods per plant as compared to other two cultivars. Seed germination (%), plant height, and fruit set (%) were not affected by the cultivars. Among the PGR treatments, seed primed with GA3 resulted in significantly higher germination percentage and greater plant height at flowering. Seed priming and foliar spray with NAA and GA3 were effective in increasing the final plant height, number of branches, number of leaves, number of flowers and number of pods per plant and fruit set (%), fresh weight per pod and pod yield. However, pod diameter, pod moisture content and dry weight per pod were not influenced by the PGR treatments applied.

The agrobiological features of the genotypes selected for testing, indicate that they may be useful for the breeding of new cultivars and grape production. The use of 12 ISSR primers allowed to obtain 94.4% of polymorphism. The polymorphic information content (PIC) value was high and varied between 0.829 and 0.953 with an average of 0.897. The resolving power (Rp) ranged between 3.678 and 8.892 with an average of 6.347. Primers UBC 809, UBC 810, UBC 812, UBC 855, UBC 891 and UBC 810 were found to be highly effective (informative). Similarity coefficient ranged between 0.167 and 1.0, which indicates high degree of diversity of tested grape cultivars. Tested cultivars were grouped in 3 main clusters; one of them was further divided into 6 subclusters. ‘Pannonia Kincse’ and ‘Danmarpa Polonia’ were not differentiated. Phenotypic differences among those two cultivars suggest that ‘Danmarpa Polonia’ might be a clone of ‘Pannonia Kincse’ and other molecular techniques must be used to differentiate them. Morphological and agrobiological characters of cultivars support the results obtained by ISSR markers.",

    "abstract": "In this research, we examined some of the physical (fruit dimensions, geometric mean diameter sphericity and surface area) and mechanical (puncture force, deformation, energy absorption and hardness) properties on the four different domestic (Şebin, Kaman, Bilecik and Yalova-3) and two different foreign (Chandler and Fernor) walnut (Juglans regia) varieties. For this purpose, we applied puncture force on the walnuts at the direction of width orientation (x–x), length orientation (y–y) and suture orientation (z‒z). According to obtained results, there are significant differences among the walnut varieties for crustacean walnut weight and walnut weight. The maximum and minimum values of crustacean walnut weight were observed as 18.27 g and 10.98 g for Kaman and Chandler, respectively. In addition to these results, Bilecik has a maximum walnut weight – 8.71 g, while the minimum walnut weight was observed for Yalova-3 – 4.57 g. Furthermore, geometric mean diameter and sphericity values ranged to 31.93–38.57 mm and 82.78–92.54%, respectively. There are statistically significant differences on the puncture force, deformation, energy absorption and hardness according to the load axes. The maximum and minimum puncture force values were determined at the Fernor (572 N) with y–y axes and Chandler (211.9 N) with z–z axes, respectively. Also, the highest hardness and the lowest deformation values were obtained for Kaman (y–y axes) and the highest deformation and the lowest hardness were determined at Bilecik (x–x axes). The energy absorption values changed as follows: 0.455–1.086 J, 0.404–0.985 J and 0.426–1.051 J for x–x, y–y and z–z axes, respectively.",

The paper discusses in vivo multiplication with leaf cuttings of Lachenalia cv. ‘Namakwa’, ‘Romaud’, ‘Ronina’ and ‘Rupert’. Mature leaves were collected from non-flowering donor plants. Each leaf was halved to make proximal and distal leaf cuttings. ‘Ronina’ distal leaf cuttings produced the lowest number of bulblets (5.7 per cutting), while ‘Namakwa’ proximal leaf cuttings turned out the most productive (10.5 bulblets per cutting). The bulblets produced by cv. ‘Namakwa’ distal leaf cuttings were the lightest (0.3 g per bulblet), and those formed on cv. ‘Ronina’ proximal leaf cuttings were the heaviest (0.9 g per bulblet). In general, the weight of individual bulblets ranged from 0.1 to 1.2 g. Irrespective of the cutting type, the leaves of cv. ‘Namakwa’ produced the greatest number of bulblets, and the leaves of ‘Ronina’ yielded the heaviest bulblets. With no dependence on their genotype, proximal leaf cuttings were advantageous in terms of total number of generated bulblets and their quality (weight, diameter).",

Septoria melissae Desm. is the most important pathogen of lemon balm crops, which may cause serious yield loss by the severe leaf fall. As chemical control of the pathogen is restricted, alternative plant protection methods, like the use of tolerant varieties, should be taken under consideration. The goal of our work was to evaluate the susceptibility of three lemon balm varieties to Septoria leaf spot in field. The trials were carried out in 2016 and 2017 in Budapest-Soroksár, Hungary. Dynamics of infection showed characteristic sharp increase from the beginning of August in both years. The lowest infection levels were observed in cultivar ‘Lemona’. The disease incidence in the middle of August was 19% in the first year and 59% in the second year, while these values were over 40% and 70% in the other cultivars ‘Soroksári’ and ‘Quedlinburger Niederliegende’, respectively. The manifestation of symptomps was also significantly lighter on the ‘Lemona’ plants and they had the highest ratio of healthy leaves (81%) compared to the other cultivars. According to the data, weather conditions might modify the range of the differences among the cultivars. It was concluded that appropriate selection of varieties could be an effective and enviromental friendly plant protection method in the practice of lemon balm cultivation.",

Experimental treatments consisted of 100% chemical fertilizer (urea), bio-fertilizer (nitroxin), integration of bio-fertilizer + 25% chemical fertilizer, integration of bio-fertilizer + 50% chemical fertilizer, integration of bio-fertilizer + 75% chemical fertilizer and the control. Results showed that the effect of different treatments of fertilizers on all measured traits, except for number of rows in each ear and carotenoids, was significant. The results indicated that integration of bio-fertilizer + 75% chemical fertilizer affected the highest grain yield (9.31 t ha–1), dry biological yield (20.96 t ha–1), number of kernels in each row (41.67), plant height (201.02 cm), hectoliter weight (0.82 g cm–3), chlorophyll b (0.43 mg g–1 FW), total chlorophyll (1.1 mg g–1 FW) and leaf area index (LAI) (4) and there was no significant difference among this treatment and 100% chemical fertilizer (N) and integration of bio-fertilizer + 50% chemical fertilizer treatments in all measured traits. The greatest harvest index (45.8) and grain protein-content (9.1%) resulted from the integration of biofertilizer+ 50% chemical fertilizer treatment.

On the other hand, both extracts at the assayed concentrations affect the membrane stability and cellular metabolic capacity of the CHO-K1 cell lines. These finding provide a direction for further researches, and suggest the Matico and Zarzaparrilla flower extracts as promising sources of antioxidants, and as research objects through the analyze of their metabolic behavior and antitumoral potential.",

In cultivation with irrigation, a higher yield of fresh and yield of air-dried inflorescences was obtained compared to cultivation without irrigation. The use of supplementary irrigation in lavender crops contributed to an increased amount of essential oil (EO) compared to plants without irrigation. The main components of the essential oil were Linalyl acetate, Linalool, and E-Caryophyllene. In EO obtained from plants cultivated with irrigation, the share of oxygenated monoterpenes (OM) was higher and the share of hydrogenated monoterpenes (HM) was lower than in the oil from plants without irrigation. The EO content in lavender flowers dried at a temperature of 30°C was twice higher than in those dried in natural conditions. In 2016 in which the air temperatures were high and a greater number of sunshine hours was recorded in July and August, plants accumulated more EO than in 2017.

Recently it was proposed for biomass production in marginal environments, but vegetative biomass compositional analyses had not been available so far. The study of plant morphology and biomass composition was conducted on three different S. marianum accessions grown under open field conditions. The results indicate that plant morphological traits show major differences between accessions: this suggests that the available natural variability can be further utilized in order to develop improved S. marianum cultivars. Biomass compositional analysis shows that extractives, ash, lignin and cellulose content are comparable to other herbaceous bioenergy crops and that these traits display only limited variability in the studied accessions. Hemicellulose fraction is composed only by xylans and its content appears averagely lower in comparison to other herbaceous biomasses. Interestingly, in S. marianum biomass total nitrogen content is lower if compared to other herbaceous species.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of a study on the effect of different N fertilization and seeding rates on yield and some quality parameters (of seeds) of pot marigold. A field experiment was carried out during 2014–2016 under soil and climatic conditions of Belarus (Priluki Research Station near Minsk). The experiment included the following factors: N fertilization rate 40, 60, 80, 100 kg ha–1; plant density per 1 m2 (30, 50, 70, 90). The experiment was set up as a randomized block design in five replicates, with a single plot area of 8.0 m2. The soil in Priluki was characterized by medium nutrient availability (at the level: P = 120–127, K = 164–174, Mg = 59–66 mg kg–1 soil). Regardless of the experimental factors, weather conditions had a significant impact on pot marigold productivity. The year 2016, characterized by an even distribution of rainfall during the growing season and moderate air temperatures, proved to be most beneficial for pot marigold productivity and quality. Hydrological conditions in the other years (2014 and 2015) there was a slight drought. The year 2014 should be considered to be cold, whereas the second year of the study (2015) was moderately warm. Best production effects (seed yield, fat yield) were obtained at rates of 60–80 kg N ha–1. This rate of nitrogen fertilization also modified the fatty acid composition, contributing to a higher content of linoleic acid and calendic acid (∑ α-calendic and β-calendic acids). A nitrogen rate of 100 kg N ha–1 proved to be irrational in terms of the quantity and quality of pot marigold yield. A density of 50–70 plants per 1 m2 resulted in the highest seed and fat yield per unit area. A plant density of 50 plants per 1 m2 resulted in the highest content of C18 unsaturated acids (stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid) in the oil.",

In Poland however the production of white spears prevails and it is still low. Asparagus is cultivated on light soils, but green spears may yield well on heavier, loamy soils as well. The aim of the study conducted in the years 1999-2007 was to assess the yield of green spears of asparagus cultivated on a medium heavy soil of loess origin. Plants of four asparagus cultivars of Dutch origin - 'Backlim', 'Gijnlim', 'Horlim' and 'Thielim' were compared in the experiment in the Lublin region. High total yield, affected by the year of harvest, but not by the cultivar was stated. Each year a significant (except the seventh year) yield increase was noted, only in the fifth year the yield decreased. Marketable yield of cv. 'Gijnlim' was significantly higher than that of the other cultivars. The mean share of marketable yield in the total yield was low, only 56,5% and varied very much with years (from 32.7% to 6.9%). The highest share of marketable yield in the total was stated for cv. 'Gijnlim' (60.4%), significantly lower (55.2-55.7%) for other cultivars. Plants of cv. 'Gijnlim' yielded significantly more spears in total and marketable yield than other cultivars. Marketable spears constituted on aver- age 63% of all harvested shoots (the percentage did not differ between cultivars, but very much between years - from 30% in 2002 to 80% in 2007). The highest share of non mar- ketable yield was stated in the years with a high rainfall deficit in May.",

Trees as isolated elements of greenery in the urban environment were taken into the consideration. The highest density of overwinter- ing eggs was observed in the bark crevices of forking shoots. The shortest pre- reproduction and reproduction periods and the highest fertility was exhibited in the second generation of aphids. Pre-reproduction and reproduction periods of successive aphids' generations were extended while females' fertility was reduced. Despite of varied number of aphids on F. sylvatica and its two varieties, no significant differences were stated. Feeding aphids caused leaves' curling downwards on both sides of the mid-rib.

In intensive horticultural produc- tion mineral fertilizers, containing mineral or chelate compounds with varying micronu- trient fertilization efficiency, constitute the main sources of micronutrients for plants. In the years 2009-2010 experiments with lettuce were conducted to investigate the effect of mineral (sulfates) and chelate (IDHA chelate, EDTA + DTPA chelate) forms of copper, zinc and manganese on yield and micronutrient contents in leaves. Two levels of micronu- trients were applied (mg· dm -3 of substrate): I. 5 Cu, 10 Zn, 10 Mn, and II. 20 Cu, 40 Zn and 40 Mn. Lettuce was grown in 6 dm 3 containers filled with limed highmoor peat, en- riched with macro- and micronutrients. Lettuce was harvested at the consumption stage. Contents of Cu, Zn and Mn were determined by ASA in lettuce leaves. The volume of let- tuce yield at a lower content of micronutrients in the substrate did not depend on the form in which copper, zinc and manganese were introduced. After the application of higher rates of micronutrients in the mineral or IDHA chelate forms a significantly higher crop was produced than in case of EDTA + DTPA chelates. An increase in micronutrient rates in the substrate had a significant effect on an increase in their contents in vegetables. At the nutrition of crops with micronutrients at higher rates in the form of EDTA + DTPA chelates a significant increase was found in copper content in lettuce. After the application of higher rates of micronutrients plants that were introduced two micronutrients in the IDHA chelate forms and one in the mineral form contained less zinc. Leaves of lettuce grown on substrate with mineral forms of copper, zinc and manganese contained signifi- cantly more manganese than those grown in substrate with chelate forms of micronutri- ents.",

    "abstract": "In Poland common viper’s bugloss (E. vulgare L.) is the most common species. E. vulgare belongs to medicinal, ornamental and bee plants, since it is a source of nectar and pollen forage. These flowers are frequently visited by bumblebees and honey bees. Flowering specimens of common viper’s bugloss were collected in the area of Lublin. Flowers and their parts were observed using stereoscopic microscopy. The micromorphology of the nectary at the initial stage of nectar secretion was observed in a scanning electron microscope. The rate of nectar production and pollen yield of the plants were determined as well as insects visiting flowers of this species were identified. The nectary, located at the base of the ovary, was found to be fused with its lower part. Nectar is secreted through numerous stomata located in the epidermis of the nectary. Nectar secretion, which starts at the bud stage, lasts throughout the flower life (3–4 days). Over this period, one flower of common viper’s bugloss produces 2.14 mg of nectar with high sugar concentration (48%). Sugar yield of its flowers is on average 9.8 mg/10 flowers. The flowers start to shed pollen at bud break and release the largest amount of pollen during late morning hours. The weight of pollen produced by 10 flowers is 5.4 mg. The present study shows that the flowers of E. vulgare are a very good source of nectar and pollen forage.",

When it is cultivated for pharmaceutical purposes arti- choke should be obtained from one-year-old plantations, characterized by high amount of active substances (CQA and flavonoids). The objective of three year field study was to evaluate the effects of different methods of plantation establishment: direct seed sowing, seedlings produced in multicells transplanting, seedlings with 'bare roots' from nursery beds transplanting as well as plant densities: 3.3 and 4.2 units·m -2 in artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) cv. Green Globe culture. Additionally, quality of raw material obtained in two following cuts (performed in August and October) was estimated. Generally, tradi- tional method of plantation establishment by direct seed sowing results in lower yields of worse quality of artichoke raw material (characterized by significantly lower active sub- stances content), while, seedlings produced previously in multicell trays in plastic tunnel transplantation could be indicated as better method of artichoke plantation establishment for pharmaceutical purposes. A decrease of artichoke yields and dimensions but at the same time tendency to significant improve its quality (on an average two times higher content of flavonoids and CQA in comparison to direct seed sowing) was noted when seedlings transplantation from plastic tunnel (with 'bare roots') was used as method of plantation establishment. Increasing plant density of 3.3 to 4.2 units·m -2 caused a decrease of size and weight (by 13,4%) of individual plant leaves, and at the same time an increase of their numbers, and total yields harvested from the unit area (by 0.2 t·ha -1 ). Moreover, during the second cut significantly higher (by 27%) yields of better quality artichoke leaves (characterized by higher flawonoid and caffeoylquinic acids content) were ob- tained.",

Expanded clay is classified as an inert medium, that is, chemically and biologically passive, although some studies indicate the possibility of the occurrence of exchange sorption and ion adsorption in this medium during cultivation. The aim of the study, conducted in the period 2007-2008, was to determine the usefulness of expanded clay being post-production waste in soilless tomato culture under extended cycle conditions. The study used new expanded clay (I) as the control and expanded clay being post-production waste from year-round tomato cultivation with the following ex- perimental design: chemically sterilized material (II); material washed in water with the remains of the old root system of plants removed and additionally chemically sterilized (III); and material without any modifying treatments (IV). Expanded clay was placed in 12 dm 3 poly sleeves and formed in the shape of growing slabs. Crops were grown using a drip irrigation and fertilization system with closed nutrient solution circulation, without recirculation. The nutrient solution was supplied to all plants in the same amount and with the same composition. The study found the lowest total fruit yield (15.10 kg�� plant -1 ) and marketable fruit yield (14.07 kg�� plant -1 ) of tomato grown in reused expanded clay without any modifying treatments (IV), whereas this yield was significantly higher from tomato plants grown in the material washed and additionally chemically sterilized (III). Fruits with the highest unit weight (150.8 g) were picked from plants grown in new expanded clay (I), while fruits with a significantly lower weight (138.6 g) were obtained from the treat- ments with the reused medium both washed and chemically sterilized (III). Fruits of tomato plants growing in reused expanded clay subjected to washing and chemical sterilization (III) contained the highest amount of dry matter (5.71%) and total sugars (3.08% fr.w.), whereas fruits of tomato grown in the new medium (I) had the highest amount of vitamin C (21.96 mg·100 g -1 FW), zinc (25.86 mg�� kg -1 d.w) and copper (6.10 mg�� kg -1 d.w).",

For that reason, it is desir- able to seek for alternative, equally rapid and easy-to-perform (but requiring less hazard- ous chemicals) methods of iodine analysis in environmental samples on the same detec- tion level. The aim of the research was to assess the applicability of iodine determination in spinach after incubation of plant samples with 2% acetic acid in comparison with stan- dard analytical procedure using solution of TMAH (tetramethylammonium hydroxide). Studies were conducted on spinach samples from two vegetation experiments carried out in pots and field including soil fertilization and foliar application of diverse iodine doses in the form of KI and KIO3. Obtained results indicated a relatively high usefulness of sample incubation with 2% acetic acid for iodine determination in spinach plants. Still, the statistical significance of the relation (defined with the use of correlation coefficients) between iodine content determined in TMAH (x variable) and 2% acetic acid (y variable) was primarily influenced by iodine form, dose and method of its application during plant cultivation. In the pot experiment, values of correlation coefficients between tested vari- ables were statistically significant and equal to r = 0.66. In the field study, values of corre- lation coefficients (between x and y variables) for plants with foliar application of KI and KIO3 were statistically significant and equal to r = 0.99 and r = 1.00, respectively. Com- bined comparative analysis of data obtained in both experiments revealed that correlation between tested variables was statistically significant and its coefficient was equal to r = 0.80. Mean iodine recovery from fortified samples after incubation with 2 % acetic acid was 91.1% ±17.7% (n = 15), whereas using TMAH - 89.3% ±30.7 (n = 15).",

    "abstract": "Tracheary elements appear already in the early stages of in vitro organogenesis and precede the formation of meristemoids and shoot primordia which further develop into shoots. Thus this process can be considered as an important indicator of potential, or- ganogenic capability of the explants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of auxin (IAA), cytokinin (BAP), sucrose and the light conditions (light with 16-h photope- riod, darkness) upon de novo differentiation of tracheary elements (TEs) in callus derived from mature embryos of pepper cv. Bryza. Moreover, it was to determine the proliferation ability of the callus cells and changes of callus morphology. TEs were differentiated in the form of single cells, irregular clusters, strands and whirls exclusively with reticulate and pitted thickening of the secondary wall and the clusters occurred the most frequently. Cy- tokinin used alone, as well as in auxin combination, stimulated xylogenesis with the high- est efficiency as well as with regard to the frequency and TE cell number within clusters. The highest number of TEs per cluster was obtained in the case of combination 0.1 mg·dm -3 IAA + 0.1 mg·dm -3 BAP on the light. Smooth surface, large cohesion cell degree and green colour are the morphological callus features accompanied by the effec- tive TE formation.",

The aim of the experiment was to determine the effect of BA applied in different time of rooting and its cooperation with NAA on Portulaca cuttings and subsequent growth of plants. Stem cuttings of Por- tulaca umbraticola were treated with BA or BA and NAA in different concentrations and time of BA application (0; 2 and 5 days after placing in medium). BA, administered at the beginning of rooting, negatively influenced percentage of rooted cuttings, while applied two days later stimulated rooting. BA positively determined lateral shoot length and num- ber on cuttings. Application of BA with NAA stimulated root development, but negatively affected the axillary shoot outgrowth. Considering the effect of BA treatment on rooting and branching of Portulaca cuttings the most advantages combinations occurred to be BA applied after 2 days of rooting.",

Immature inflo- rescence stem sections and leaf bases isolated from 'Allium aflatunense 'Purple Sensation' and Allium karataviense 'Ivory Queen' bulbs in October were used as source of explants for shoot regeneration. The use of a two - step sterilization procedure (2% Cl - - 30 min and 1% Cl - -15 min) gave much better results than a one - step (2% Cl - - 30 min). Inflorescence explants in inverted orientation were cultured on a Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium containing BA in concentration of 2 mg�� dm -3 and NAA in concentration of 1 mg�� dm -3 . Leaf bases placed in normal and inverted orientation were incubated on MS medium sup- plemented with: BA 2 mg�� dm -3 plus NAA 1 mg�� dm -3 , BA 5 mg�� dm -3 plus NAA 1 mg�� dm -3 and TDZ 1 mg�� dm -3 plus NAA 1 mg�� dm -3 .

Susceptibility of various oat cultivars and breeding lines to leaf infection by this pathogen was investi- gated in the field in 2001-2002 and in a growth chamber. After natural infection in the field, brown or brown-red spots caused by D. avenae were found in all oat genotypes and both years, but were less common in the drier and colder growing season (2001). Mean values of leaf infection index in the studied oat genotypes for the 2 years varied from 5.65 (CHD 2100) to 10.33 (Akt). After artificial inoculation in the growth chamber, symptoms were similar but leaf infection index was much higher - from 15.0 (Bajka) to 41.3 (STH 4699). High-performance liquid chromatography showed that anthraquinone derivatives produced by strain 1 of D. avenae include anthraquinone compaunds - cynodontin and helminthosporin.

This evaluation was done on the basis of activity of enzymes: dehydrogenases, proteases, acid phosphatase and urease, IAA content, total content of organic carbon and of organic carbon soluble in water. Our studies have shown a significant influence of the soil locality and of the term of soil sampling for the identification of the biochemical properties of soil expressed by the enzymatic activity. The activity of three studied enzymes was significantly lower in the locality 1 in comparison with the soil in a locality 5. Also in case of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), its highest value was found in the soil of combination 1 while the highest value of the IAA acid was found in combination 3. The previous method of soil utilization also exerted a significant influence on the content of organic matter in the soil. The content of total organic carbon and organic carbon soluble in water were significantly lower in the soil from the orchard planted directly after previous agricultural use. Enzymatic activity and content of organic carbon were the highest in the autumn period, while the lowest value was shown in summer.",

    "abstract": "Dense trees planting is one of the ways to obtain high yielding from area unit soon after establishing an orchard. Diminished space occupied by trees in dense planting systems also brings about their weaker vegetative growth. Another factor influencing growth and yielding is planting trees in ridges. Investigation was conducted in the orchard belonging to Research – Development Station in Samotwor, owned by Department of Horticulture at Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences. It aimed at the assessment of growth and yielding of four apple cultivars: ‘Piros’, ‘Sunrise’, ‘Pinova’ and ‘Ligol’, growing on two dwarf rootstocks M.9 and P 22. The trees were planted in ridges in high density. Two – year – old trees were planted in the spring 2004. Research covered the years 2004–2008 and was carried out as two – factorial experiment. The first factor involved particular way of planting trees – traditional or in ridges. The type of rootstock used constituted the second examined factor. The trees on M.9 rootstock were planted in 3.5 m × 0.5 m spacing (5714 trees ha), while apple trees on P 22 rootstock followed the spacing of 3.5 × 0.3 m (9523 trees ha). In the case of young trees growing densely, the effect of planting in ridges on growth and yielding was strictly related to apple cultivar and rootstock. Among the trees on M.9 rootstock, the highest yield was collected from cultivar ‘Ligol’. The trees of ‘Piros’ cv., planted in ridges provided the lowest yield on both used rootstocks. The negative effect of ridges on total yield for ‘Ligol’ and ‘Sunrise’ cvs. on M9 was noted. No differences were observed in the total yield from trees of ‘Pinova’, ‘Ligol’ i ‘Sunrise’cvs. on rootstock P 22. Method of planting had no effect on the yield of each cultivar on this rootstock. Cultivar ‘Ligol’ on M.9 rootstock, characterized the strongest growth. Among the trees on rootstock P 22, cultivar ‘Sunrise’ grew the weakest. Planting in ridges, reduced the growth of ‘Ligol’ on M.9 and ‘Piros’ cvs. on P 22 rootstock. Dense planting of trees in ridges did not affect yield and vigour of four cultivars of apple trees on two dwarfing rootstocks. In the conditions of high density trees response to planting in ridges was diverse and depended on a cultivar, the kind of a rootstock and the age of trees. Dense planting of trees in ridges did not provide favorable conditions for growth and fruiting of the examined apple trees cultivars in the first five years after planting.",

Gib- berellic acid enhanced the post-harvest longevity of Z. elliottiana flowers. Those of the 'Black Magic' cultivar lasted the longest when not conditioned, but merely stored in gib- berellic acid solutions. 8-hydroxyquinoline citrate shortened their longevity by a week. The post-harvest longevity of flowers of the 'Florex Gold' cultivar significantly depended on the concentration of gibberellic acid and conditioning time. The longest-lasting flowers were those conditioned in 8-hydroxyquinoline citrate for 2 hours.",

    "abstract": "Plants respond to water deficit through several mechanisms. Among which, plant hormones play an important role in induction to abiotic stress tolerance. To bring this issue closer, an experiment was conducted to examine whether salicylic acid (SA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) exogenous applications through foliar spray could alleviate detrimental effects of water deficit on Persian petunia. Treatments consisted of water stress in three levels: 100% field capacity (F.C.) as control, 50, and 25% F.C linked with different concentrations of GA3 and SA sprayed at four levels (0, 100, 200 and 300 mg L–1). Results showed that the dry and fresh biomass, leaf area, photosynthetic pigments levels, relative water content (RWC) and the total number of flowers were significantly (P≤0.01) reduced in response to water deficit. However, free proline concentration and root-to-shoot ratio significantly increased in stressed plants. Plants subjected to severe water stress (25% F.C.), exhibit about 66% stomatal conductance rate lower than the plants grown at 100% F.C. The results showed that SA-treated plants exhibited reduced negative effect of water stress on most of the qualitative and quantitative attributes compared to control, while GA3 application had little impact on studied traits. Importantly, stomatal conductance and RWC were improved in water-stressed plants treated with SA. Moreover, SA-treated plants produced more flowers at all water deficit levels compared to GA3 sprayed plants. It can be concluded that Persian petunia plants respond to water deficit through adaptive changes at biochemical and morphological levels and that adverse effects of water deficit could be alleviated by exogenous application of SA.",

The current research was aimed to study the effect of irrigation levels (100%, 85%, 70% of irrigation requirements), and shading levels (60%, 40%, 0%) on the growth and productivity of ‘Keitt’ mango trees. This experiment was conducted during two growing seasons (2016/2017 and 2017/2018) at El Behera Governorate, Egypt. Decreasing irrigation level (IR) decreased leaf area, malformed panicle, powdery mildew infection, final fruit set, fruit numbers, yield but it increased chlorophyll content, proline content, leaf water content. While, increasing shading levels (SH) increased leaves number, leaf area, fruit set, powdery mildew infection, malformed panicle but it decreased fruit sunburn damage, proline content, chlorophyll content and relative water content. Moreover, accumulative effects of 85% IR + 40% SH significantly increased leaf area, fruit set, fruit number, yield, chlorophyll content, WUE, proline content, relative water content, leaf water content while decreasing powdery mildew and sunburn damage. Results suggest that shading at 40% increased the yield up to 20% and decreased sunburn damage up to 0% under irrigation level of 70%. Shading may be a new technique to alleviate the adverse effects of water stress beside their role in avoiding excessive solar radiation on ‘Keitt’ mango trees.",

The results indicated that there was a considerable variation in the yield and yield components of coriander, and the yield significantly increased as the dose of microbial fertilizer was increased. The maximum essential oil content and seed yield were recorded for the plots grown under the F1 and F3 treatment. It was found that the maximum seed yield was obtained in the F3 treatment (839.0 kg ha–1), and the seed yield decreased in the F4 (754.1 kg ha–1) and F5 (759.9 kg ha–1) treatments. Although the increase in the microbial fertilizer dose increases seed yield, using the fertilizer in optimum dose can be more profitable. Therefore, this study suggests that the fertilizer dose “F3” can improve the productivity of the coriander grown in the areas treated with microbial fertilizer.",

In this paper, we evaluated the effects of pulse treatment with disinfectants including cobalt chloride (CoCl2), cerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3), silver nanoparticles (SNP) and Nanosil on the vase life and physiological characteristics of cut S. reginae flowers stems. Cut flowers kept in the vase solution containing these disinfectants showed significant increase in solution uptake, the content of total protein and pigments of petals, the activities of antioxidantive active enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Also, the number of stem-end bacteria and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in cut flowers were decreased as compared to control. Based on obtained results, we introduce Ce(NO3)3 as the most effective treatment to extend the vase life of cut S. reginae flowers. More so with the concentration of 300 µM which induced the maximum solution uptake and SOD and APX activities that resulted in the longest vase life. Findings of the present study suggested that Ce(NO3)3 prolonged postharvest longevity of S. reginae by increasing the solution uptake and SOD and APX activity and decreasing the MDA content. The use of Ce(NO3)3 reduces the use of chemicals and make saving in costs. The highest bacterial population of micro-organisms on cut stem ends were Escherichia coli, Bacillus, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Cerium nitrate had the strongest effect on reduction of these bacterial population and yeast.",

Presented studies were conducted in 2006 in three localities of the Lublin region: in the vicinity of Zamo��, near Krasnystaw and near Opole Lubelskie. Those studies included three cultivars of Zinnia elegans Jacq.: Golden Dawn, Lawa, Scarlet Flame as well as the mixed material of the cultivars belonging to the dahlia group. Six weeks after the sowing, the seedling's healthiness was assessed. The proportion of seedlings with disease symptoms ranged from 7% to 44%. The main cause of root infection at the seedling stage proved to be the species of F. equiseti and S. scle- rotiorum. Considerable amounts of B. cinerea and F. culmorum and A. alternata were also detected from diseased seedlings. Studies on the susceptibility of analyzed cultivars and the mixed material of elegans zinnia to infection by B. cinerea and F. avenaceum, F. culmorum and F. equiseti were conducted in a growth chamber. Results obtained from this experiment confirmed considerable harmfulness of the species B. cinera and F. equi- seti towards the seedlings of elegans zinnia, which can be reduced introducing less sus- ceptible varieties to the cultivation. However, none of the studied varieties of elegans zin- nia, only its mixed material, showed such properties.",

Glufosinate-ammonium (600 g∙ha–1) and flame weeding (90 kg propane∙ha–1) were applied 12–13 days after lemon balm sowing, i.e. shortly after weed emergence and 4 days before crop emergence. Bentazon (960 g∙ha–1) and fluazifop-P-butyl (150 g∙ha–1) were sprayed approximately 3 weeks after sowing, during the emergence of lemon balm, and when the weeds were in the cotyledon – 2–4 true leaves stage. All of the studied weed control methods significantly reduced the number and fresh weight of weeds growing 4 weeks after lemon balm sowing. The most effective method was spraying with glufosinate-ammonium, which controlled 69–76% of weeds. The efficiency of flame weeding was slightly lower. Bentazon caused slight, temporary chlorosis of some lemon balm cotyledons. Content of essential oil (1.9–2.1%), its composition and content of rosmarinic acid (2.08–2.44%) in lemon balm leaves, as well as content of total nitrogen (2.18–2.55%), phosphorus (0.30–0.32%), potassium (2.94–3.22%), calcium (1.02–1.60%), and magnesium (0.30–0.32%) in lemon balm raw material were independent of the weeding method.

Studied weed control methods proved useful in the cultivation of lemon balm from direct sowing into the field. Methods with total action (flaming and glufosinate-ammonium) were more effective than those with selective herbicides (bentazon and fluazifop-P-butyl).",

    "abstract": "Paclobutrazol (PBZ) enhances plant resistance to salt stress in two ways: directly, by straight clearance of reactive oxygen species; and indirectly by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, photosynthetic efficiency, and metabolite content, and by regulating transcription factors associated with stress. However, the regulatory effects of PBZ under salt stress in soybean are still not well explained and need further investigation. With this aim, the combination effect of salinity (250 mM NaCl) and three different doses of PBZ (5, 10 and 20 ppm) on physiological, biochemical and molecular traits of soybean (Glycine max L.) leaves were studied in soil experiments. Furthermore, physiological parameters (relative growth rate, relative water content), chlorophyll, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content and as well as enzymatic antioxidants (SOD, POX, APX, CAT and GST), ion content (Na, Cl) and soybean Na+/H+ antiporter GmNHX1 and chloride channel GmCLC1 gene expressions were investigated. The results showed that PBZ caused a reduction in salt-induced damages and an increase in biomass yield, water status, and chlorophyll. Moreover, PBZ regulated enzymatic antioxidants and alleviated the oxidative damages under salinity. In this study, for a first time it was determined that PBZ increased both GmNHX1 (ABA dependent or independent) and GmCLC1 (ABA independent) gene expressions and reduced Na and Cl concentrations in soybean under salinity. In conclusion, PBZ plays a role as a regulator and stimulant in salt stress response by mostly regulating ion balance in soybean leaves.",

The growing medium for the cultivation of lettuce consisted of A-SMS (10%) and commercial peat (90%). It was further enriched with Se and Zn concentrated at five levels, i.e. 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mmol·L–1 to obtain six growing medias. Se was added to the growing medium in the form of sodium selenite and sodium selenate at a 1:1 ratio, whereas Zn was added in the form of zinc nitrate hexahydrate. Lettuce was grown under controlled conditions in growth chambers. The experiment was conducted in a randomised complete block design in three replicates. The results indicated that the A-SMS added to the growing medium increased both the yield of lettuce and its biological value by increasing the content of Se and Zn. Consumable percent recommended daily allowance and safe hazard quotient for lettuce biofortified with Se and Zn were achieved. The experiment also showed that the addition of Se + Zn did not negatively affect photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, which proved that these elements did not have toxic effect on lettuce in agronomic perspective.",

    "abstract": "Humic acid (HA) can be considered as an important alternative to chemical fertilizers in sustainable agriculture. For this purpose, an experiment was conducted for two years (2014–2015) as a factorial in the form of randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications in Chalous city. First factor included time of application (T1 – application of HA before planting, T2 – spraying HA at middle of vegetative growth, T3 – spraying HA at early time of reproductive growth). Second factor included the amount of HA as foliar application at four levels (0 (control), 200, 300 and 400 mg l–1 ha–1). The results of the mean comparison show that the highest seed yield was obtained by spraying HA at 200 and 300 mg l–1 ha–1 at the beginning time of reproductive growth and recorded 2821 and 2773 kg ha–1, respectively. The results also show that the highest percentage of protein were recorded by foliar application of HA at 300 mg l–1 ha–1 during T2 treatment. The use of HA at 200 and 400 mg l–1 ha–1 treatments and T2 treatment had the highest protein percentage and protein yield. The results showed that the use of HA at different concentrations had a positive effect on chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll, seed yield and protein yield. Also, the time of application of HA had a significant impact on the measured traits. It seems that foliar application at the early period of reproductive growth has improved growth, increased flower fertility, and seed yield by increasing the absorption of nutrients. According to the results, foliar spraying with 300 mg l–1 ha–1 HA at the T3 is the most appropriate treatment for proper faba bean.",

    "abstract": "Stachys schtschegleevii Sosn. is an endemic medicinal plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family and mainly grown in North-western Iran. Drought stress is an important factor in reducing the yield of medicinal herbs. Water-stress tolerance involves subtle changes in cellular biochemistry. It appears to be the result of the accumulation of compatible solutes and of chemical compositions that can be rapidly induced by osmotic stress. For this purpose, the effect of different irrigation regimes (well-watered and irrigation after depletion of 40% and 70% of field capacity (FC)) were studied in S. schtschegleevii. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design in three replications. The results showed that water-deficit had negative effects on shoot dry matter, relative water content, and photosynthetic pigments of the exposed plants. The essential oil (EO) content under water-deficit had an increasing trend. Water-deficit significantly increased total phenol content, proline, H2O2, and malondialdehyde contents. Linalool, β-pinene oxide, α-campholenal and germacrene-D were the major compounds of essential oils (EOs) affected by water-deficit stress. Finally, although water deficiency reduces the shoot dry matter yield of the S. schtschegleevii, the accumulation of EO increased as a plant response to water-deficit stress.",

In a 3-year field experiment (2013–2015), amaranth’s plants were grown in a wide-row spacing on the soil of the good wheat complex in south-eastern Poland (50°71'N, 23°04'E). The field experiment included 4 variable factors: weather conditions; selected amaranth growth stages (5-leaf, full flowering and seed maturity stages); NPK dose combinations (I: 40 kg N ∙ ha–1, 30 kg P ∙ ha–1, 30 kg K ∙ ha–1; II: 60 kg N ∙ ha–1, 40 kg P ∙ ha–1, 40 kg K ∙ ha–1; III: 80 kg N ∙ ha–1, 50 kg P ∙ ha–1, 50 kg K ∙ ha–1; IV: 120 kg N ∙ ha–1, 70 kg P ∙ ha–1, 70 kg K ∙ ha–1) and two cultivars (‘Rawa’ and ‘Aztek’). No pesticides are applied in the cultivation due to the absence of pathogens and pests of this plant in Poland. Plant protection was limited to reducing weed infestation twice. The conducted research showed that weather conditions were the main factor affecting catalase activity in the soil under amaranth cultivation, followed by other factors, such as fertilization, cultivar and growth stage. All the analyzed factors proved to exert a significant impact on organic matter content in the soil, while only the applied NPK fertilization had effect on sorption capacity. Moreover, it was found that the cv. Aztek positively influenced the activity of catalase and humus accumulation in the soil in comparison to the cv. Rawa. The beneficial effect of amaranth on the soil environment and its enzymatic activity was ascribed to the lack of introduced pesticides.",

The use of biochar also contributes to eliminating the effects of soil fatigue, especially in perennial fruit crops. In our study, biochar was applied in the spring of 2014 in the cultivation of one-year-old peach trees of the cultivar Meredith. Biochar, an organic fertilizer, and microbiologically enriched compost were applied to the arable soil layer. In the experiment, three combinations with biochar were used: (1) biochar at 1.6 kg/tree, (2) biochar at 1.6 kg/tree + microbiologically enriched compost at 0.3 kg/tree, (3) biochar at 1.6 kg/tree + an organic fertilizer at 0.2 kg/tree. In the first growing season, no positive changes were found after the use of biochar. The highest number and yield of fruits in 2015 were obtained from the trees that were treated with microbiologically enriched compost, and the lowest in the combination where biochar + organic fertilizer were used to treat the peach trees. In 2016, the largest number of fruits and their greatest weight were re­corded for the trees treated with biochar + organic fertilizer, whereas the control trees produced the lowest yields. The use of biochar with microorganisms and biochar with organic fertilizer improved the vegetative growth of trees compared to the growth of control trees.",

The activity of the oils on the inhibition of the linear growth of mycelium was evaluated by measuring of fungal colonies, while the fungistatic activity was evaluated on the basis of the percentage growth inhibition of fungal colony and calculated according to Abbot’s formula. The sensitivity of the tested isolates of fungi was variable and depended on the type and concentration of the studied essential oils. The most effective antifungal effect on all tested fungi was in essential oil of oregano even at the concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, while the weakest effect was in essential oil of grapefruit at all studied concentrations. Moreover, oregano essential oil caused degradation and decay of mycelium and spores. Essential oils are potential and promising antifungal agents used as bio fungicides in plant protection and indoor air disinfection. Therefore, further in vivo studies should be carried out.",

The underground rhizomes of the plant contain steroidal saponins, compounds with proven therapeutic effects and used mostly in treating venous insufficiency. The research aimed to optimise the extraction of saponins from butcher’s broom rhizomes to obtain the highest possible content of active compounds in the dry extract. The extraction was carried out in five variants using pure water or a mixture of water and ethanol as solvents in different potions. Three samples of butcher’s broom rhizomes from Albania, Bulgaria, and Germany were examined for the presence of highest level of sapogenin active ingredient. Results show that Albanian sample has the highest percentage of ruscogenins, and hence Albanian butcher’s broom rhizomes were chosen for the extraction of active ingredient by alcoholic solution with different concentration. The sapogenin content in the extracts was determined by the pharmacopoeial method using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A strong, positive correlation was found between ethanol concentration and the content of ruscogenins in the dry extract. The most efficient variant of the extraction turned out to be the use of 50% ethanol as a solvent, where 304 mg of ruscogenins were obtained from 50 g of the raw material.",

    "abstract": "Long term investigations revealed that cultivation of strawberries (Fragaria magna Thuill.) for 10 years continuously in one plot reduces their vitality: the number of the produced runners decreases by 41%, of leaves - by 30%, form only 28% of inflore- scence, the yield reduces by 50% in comparison with strawberries grown for two years in a new plot. Evident decline in the vitality and productivity of strawberries was detected during 4th-6th years of cultivation. Unequal reaction of the tested cultivars upon the du- rability of cultivation was noticed; strawberries of the cultivar 'Senga Sengana' reacted slightly, while the ones of the cultivar 'Nida' - strongly. It is related with different sensi- bility of these cultivars towards the disease agents of root rots. It was determined that long-term cultivation of the Fragaria genus plants results in the accumulation of the parasitic fungi propagules in soil: Ascochyta fragaricola, Cercospora fragariae, Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, Perenospora fragariae, Phytophthora cacto- rum, Pythium intermedium, P. ultimum, Plasmodiophora brassicae, Sclerotium rolfsii, Verticillium alboatrum. Therefore, cultivation of strawberries in the same plot for longer time increases the phytopathogenic potential of soil, and short interval (1-2 years) betwe- en planting has little significance upon it. The second reason for low productivity of strawberries cultivated for a long in one plot is soil tiredness caused by fungi, synthesising and excreting into surrounding toxic secondary metabolites, widespread in the rhizosphe- re, especially those belonging to the Penicillium genus: P. janthinellum, P. verruculosum var. verrucosum, P. canescens, P. spinulosum.",

    "abstract": "In the years 2004 and 2005, in an unheated greenhouse, an experiment was car- ried out with hot pepper 'Wulkan' cultivar. The purpose of studies was to determine the effect of nitrogen and potassium fertilization on the salinity of substrate in hot pepper growing and to show the dependence between the content of these elements in the sub- strate and in the indicator parts of the plant. Fertilization with nitrogen and potassium was differentiated in two levels: N 250 and K 300, and N 350 and K 400 mgdm -3 substrate. It was found that a higher dose of nitrate and potassium caused an increase of EC in the sub- strate. A differentiated level of nitrogen fertilization had no effect on the nutritional status of hot pepper plants by this macroelement. On the other hand, potassium content in leaves was slightly higher with a higher fertilization level.",

    "abstract": "The longevity of cut leaves in flower arrangements is an important commercial consideration in horticultural practices. Here we report on the effect of short-term cold storage, in combination with a cytokinin treatment, on the post harvest longevity of cut leaves of Hosta 'Minima Glauca' and Hosta 'Golden Tiara'. Cut leaves were stored dry or wet in polyethylene bags for 2 or 4 days in darkness or in light at 6°C and then transferred to 20°C where their vase life was compared with those of freshly cut leaves. Storage length and method affected the vase life of detached leaves of both Hosta cultivars; how- ever, reduced longevity of leaves in storage could not be attributed to a single parameter of the storage conditions. Pulse conditioning with a cytokinin benzyladenine was effective in prolonging vase life both in non stored and stored leaves, in the latter increasing it 2.5-fold as compared to untreated leaves. Practical implications are that cold storage can be successfully used for cut Hosta leaves but only in combination with a BA pre- treatment.",

The clearer link in this issue concerned enzymatic part of antioxidant apparatus, for which the particularly high year effect was noted. Except for anthocyanins, non-enzymatic bioactives end-status was not strictly related to their harvest size. However the content during the first months of stor- age might be closely connected with antioxidant status measured after harvest. A signifi- cantly higher concentration of majority assessed antioxidants was characterized by apple harvested and stored in 2005/2006 season, on the average. Simultaneously many, statisti- cally proved, correlations over storage between the examined antioxidants at that time ex- isted. Total antioxidant power (FRAP assay) significantly increased after the first storage period, probably as a result of fruit acclimatory response to storage conditions, and next decreased. In general, changes of FRAP value reflected fluctuations of individual com- pounds measured in this study.",

    "abstract": "Garden perennials are a source of floristry material produced in field or under covers. A perennial producing long, leafy shoots, which in flower arrangements might successfully substitute fern or palm leaves, is Polygonatum multiflorum. The variety characterizing with decorative white margined leaves is 'Variegatum'. To improve their quality, the growth stimulator Actisil Hydro Plus, which contains 0.6% of active silicon in a form of orthosilicic acid was applied. The aim of the conducted experiment was to estimate the influence of silicon and a place of cultivation (tunnel and open field) on post-harvest quality determined with morphological features, vase life longevity and mechanical properties of Polygonatum multiflorum (L.) All. 'Variegatum' stems. The plants were sprayed with water solutions of Actisil in concentrations: 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.4%, six times during the growing season in weekly intervals, starting from the first decade of May, always in the morning. It was stated that cultivation of Polygonatum in the unheated foil tunnel increases quality of shoots for cut greenery, determined with morphological features and post-harvest longevity. Cultivation of Polygonatum in a foil tunnel and spraying plants with Actisil in concentrations of 0.3 or 0.4% is advantageous due to possibility to increase a number of shoots from 20% to over 31%, their length from 9% to 11% and fresh weight from 52% to 71%, in comparison to control plants. It is advised to treat plants cultivated in a tunnel, with Actisil in concentration of 0.4% as it improved shoots quality evaluated with their diameter and lower leaves blade area. Spraying plants with Actisil in concentrations of 0.2–0.4% in the tunnel and 0.2% in field prolongs post-harvest shoots longevity by 3–4 days. Plants cultivated in the tunnel characterize with higher strength of shoots determined with higher maximum force causing permanent damage and lower stem deflection than plants cultivated in field. Plants grown in a tunnel and sprayed with Actisil in concentrations of 0.4% characterized with the strongest shoots after 14 days of storage, however a similar effect was observed with the concentration of 0.3% and in case of plants cultivated in field and sprayed with 0.4% of Actisil.",

Thus, this study explored the effect of soil water moisture and provenance on the growth of Paris polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis (PPY). Three provenances (Jinping, Luquan and Weixi in Yunnan, China) of PPY samples were grown in different soil water moisture conditions [0.80, 0.70 and 0.50 field capacity (FC)] during Dec. 2015 to Sep. 2017. Results showed that the highest biomass weight was presented in 0.70 FC for Luquan and Weixi samples. Biomass weight for Jinping provenance presented a decreasing tendency with the decreased soil water moisture and the highest biomass were shown in 0.80 FC. However, quantitative analysis revealed that the total content of polyphyllin increased with decreasing the soil water moisture for Jinping and Weixi samples. The highest total content of polyphyllin in rhizome was inclined to show in Jinping samples, while the stem and leaf tissues were shown in Weixi samples. Additionally, results of ANOVA combined with PCA indicated that the difference among these three provenances were significant. Correlation analysis results revealed that 0.50 FC induced the competitive relationship occurrence for polyphyllin distribution. Thus, 0.70 FC was the most suitable soil-water condition for PPY growth. Besides, provenance collected from Jinping could consider as a good quality germplasm. Consequently, this study might provide a preliminary foundation for irrigation project formulated and provenance screened for PPY cultivation.",

To evaluate the effect of different treatments of super absorbent and zinc sulfate fertilizer on the yield and yield components of Calendula officinalis L., this experiment was conducted at the Islamic Azad University of Khoy. This was a factorial experiment using as the first factor super absorbent polymers at four levels to the soil (0, 4, 6, 8 g/kg) and as the second factor, 4 zinc sulfate concentrations of 0, 25, 50, and 70 mg per pot (based on a randomized complete block design with three replications). The results showed that super absorbent polymers had significant effect on all yield traits, but Zn sulfate fertilizer had only a significant effect on flower diameter, number of stems, total biomass with seeds, total biomass yield, seed yield, and harvest index. The interaction of the super absorbent polymers and zinc sulfate fertilizer increased the plant height, total biomass with seeds and flowers, seed weight, and flower and seed harvest index, whereas the diameter of flowers, number of stems, dry flower yield, flower number per m2, and seed yield were not affected. Super absorbent polymers with zinc sulfate fertilizer had the greatest effect on most yield traits and had a positive effect on increasing the yield components of Calendula officinalis L., which improved the grain yield. The use of super absorbent polymers can improve the water holding capacity of the soil, which reduces the need for water and improves the yield in arid and semi-arid areas.",

Cutting the branched shoots when the first flower in the main inflorescence was fully open, the second was opening and the subsequent buds showed visible color allowed for maintaining their decorative value for an average of 18.8 days, irrespective of storage conditions and flower food. Vase life and ornamental value depend on storage conditions.

The paper compares the chemical (bentazon, 960 g·ha–1 and fluazifop-P-butyl, 150 g·ha–1) and nonchemical (scattering mustard seed meal in two doses 1.5 and 3.0 t·ha–1) control of weeds in the cultivation of lemon balm for seeds. Additionally, the influence of these factors on the yield of fresh herb and seeds of lemon balm and the sowing value of seeds was evaluated. The best method to control weed infestation was to use mustard seed meal in an amount of 3.0 t∙ha–1. Scattering of mustard seed meal in that dose reduced the number and weight of weeds on average from two years of research by 52.1 and 60.2% in relation to unweeded control. Slightly less effective methods were successively: bentazon and application of mustard seed meal in quantity of 1.5 t·ha–1. The largest yield of fresh lemon balm herb was collected from plots where mustard seed meal was used in an amount of 3.0 t∙ha–1. Seeds harvested from plots, on which mustard seed meal was used in a larger quantity was characterized by the lowest sowing value determined by the lowest energy and capacity of germination and the highest share of nongerminated seeds. Lowering the amount of used mustard seed meal to 1,5 t·ha–1 significantly improved their sowing value. Although this method was less effective in counteracting weeds than using larger dose, it provided comparable effects of reducing the number and weight of weeds in relation to chemical protection.",

The susceptibility of ten apple cultivars: ‘Beni Shogun’, ‘Braeburn Hillwell’, ‘Elise’, ‘Gloster’, ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Idared’, ‘Jonagold Decosta’, ‘Ligol’, ‘Mutsu’ and ‘Šampion’ was tested using an impact test to obtain bruising of fruits. The analyses were performed on fruits immediately after harvest and four times after different period of cold storage (9 and 18 weeks) and shelf-life (7 days). The following analysis and characteristics of apples were determined: soluble solids content, dry matter content, acidity, fruit mass and size, and firmness. Impact test was carried out by dropping a glass ball with a mass of 25.68 g from height of 40 cm, due to which kinetic energy value of 0.1 J was obtained. Slight differences in acidity and soluble solid content were observed. On the other hand, stress noticed at firmness test was significantly higher for fruits treated with 1-MCP. It was also observed that firmness decreases after the shelf-life and after storage of fruit at room temperature. The ‘Beni Shogun’ apples fruits stored for 9 weeks are most susceptible to bruising (volume = 438.26 mm3). After cold storage, less susceptible cultivar was ‘Szampion’, for which the volume of fruit bruise was 145.62 mm3 only. After 9 weeks of cold storage, for most cultivars, there was no significant differences in bruise volume; however, the shelf-life had significant influence by differing the cultivars, and for all studied cultivars, the bruise volume was lower.",

Pojark. ‘Gerda’ using cytological and embryological methods. We found out that the flower initiation has began during June in the conditions of southwestern Slovakia. Male and female archespores were differentiated before entering winter dormancy. In most cases we have observed normally developed tetrads, normal appearance of microspores, two-celled polen grains and mature pollen grain. In both species a sufficient amount of normally developed pollen grains was observed. Disturbances during female gametophyte development occurred occasionally, most mature ovules contained 7 cells female gametophyte. Our research pointed to fact that the species are protogynous. Flowering usually takes place in the first half of April. The fruits were mature in the second half of May. We have found that 10 to 11 fully developed seeds have evolved in the fruits of both representatives of Lonicera on average. The above results show the suitability of L. edulis and L. kamtchatica cultivation in SW Slovakia with a relatively low risk of fruit loss due to climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Volatile compounds, present in olives, are responsible for the olive fruit flavor and oil aroma, influencing the consumer’s preference. These compounds have a biological activity to fight off pathogens. The aim of this work is to characterize volatiles in pulps and cores of Chemlali, Arbequina and Koroneiki olives, collected from Menzel Mhiri-Kairouan, and to test both the efficiency of these compounds against two bacteria and six phytopathogenic fungal species, by diffusion and dilution methods, and their antioxidants activities. The analyzis of volatiles were determined by GC-FID and GC-MS in three cultivars at the full ripening stage. Thirty five compounds were identified, such us an assortment of phenol, alcohol, hydrocarbon, aldehyde and terpenes derivatives. A high changes in volatiles was noted between cultivars and fruit organs. In fact, the major compounds in the pulps and the cores, of different cultivars, are (E)-2-decenal (46.9%), nonanal (19.6%), 1-hexadecene (16.3%), 7-Methyl-1,3,5-cycloheptatriene 7-Methyl-1,3,5-Cycloheptatriene (15.47%), (E,E)-2,4-decadienal (14.5%) and 1-tetradecene (14.6%). Also, the cores volatiles illustrated more richness in aldehydes than the pulps for all cultivars. Volatile fractions exhibited a moderate to important antibacterial activities against bacteria. However, Arbequina cores volatiles and both Chemlali and Koroneiki pulps volatiles established a moderate to higher activities against tested fungi. The DPPH and ABTS•+ tests demonstrated that the highest antioxidant capacity of volatiles were assigned to Arbequina cores and Koroneiki pulps. The Principal Components Analysis showed a significant relationship between antioxidants and/or antimicrobial properties and the levels of the main volatile compounds (limonene, methyldecane, nonanal, E-2-decenal, camphor, geranic acid, tetradecene, hexadecane, tetradecane) in different fruit organs.",

The analysis focused on the yields of two raspberry cultivars: ‘Polana’ and ‘Polka’, factoring in the influence of cultivation methods (in the ground; in the beds with an agrotextile), soil classes (IIIa; IVb), and plantation age (2–5 and 6–10 years). The commercial yields of fruit intended for processing were determined. The economic efficiency analysis of the production of both varieties was carried out. It was shown that regardless of the factor under scrutiny, higher results (in t·ha–1) were obtained from the ‘Polana’ variety. There were differences in the yields of the two varieties depending on the factors. In the case of both varieties, higher results were obtained in traditional cultivation and in class IIIa soil. The plantation age caused only slight differences in the yields of both varieties. The analyses showed statistical significance only in the case of the impact of the cultivation method on the yields of the ‘Polana’ cultivar. Regardless of the variety, the value of production decreased year after year, which resulted mainly from the downward trend in raspberry prices.",

As the sun lighting decreased, yield and good kernel rates decreased; blank nut ratio increased. In addition, the oil content was decreased as the lighting in the orchards increased but it was found to be significant only in ‘Tombul’ hazelnut cultivar.

Studies concerned effect of different tree pruning methods on growth and yielding of 3 apricot cultivars: 'Goldrich', 'Hargrand' and 'Sirena'. During the first 3 years, tree crowns were shaped in a 'vase' form and pruning was carried out on three levels of intensity: intensive pruning, medium-intensive pruning and slight pruning. During the first 3 years after plantation, the effects exerted by the three pruning intensities were studied in reference to the growth, morphology of tree crown, flower buds setting and fruit yield. Obtained results showed that the most intensive pruning system increased width and projection of crowns. It also resulted in beneficial changes in fruiting zone of crowns by increasing number of branched longshoots and shortshoots, and higher length of not branched longshoots and sylleptic shoots. There was also better flower buds setting and yielding of trees pruned intensively. The highest yield was obtained from trees inten- sively pruned, the best yielded were trees cultivars: 'Hargrand' and 'Sirena' but the lowest yield was obtained from trees of 'Goldrich' cultivar.",

The frequency of Syrphidae occurrence in apple orchards and on their edges was studied in 2008-2010. A quality analysis of Syrphidae communities in apple orchards and surrounding habitats was performed. The studied orchards bordered on cultivated fields, shrubberies and a road overgrown with trees and bushes. In total 55 Syr- phidae species were reported, which made up 13.9% of this family fauna in Poland, with 38 species recorded in the orchards and 49 species in their vicinity. Both in the orchards and in their edges the dominant were zoophagous species. The analysis of occurrence fre- quencies for the Syrphidae in orchards and their vicinity established that they were similar and at the same time higher than for all the other habitats except the orchard and the agri- cultural land bordering on it. All the habitats were dominated by two zoophages, namely Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer) and Eupeodes corollae (F.). The study proved that the plants of orchard edges constitutes a more attractive habitat for Syrphidae species than the orchard itself. The orchard edge habitats with abundant blooming greenery are the ele- ments which attract Syrphidae more strongly than agricultural cultivations and which may determine the migration of those useful species onto orchards.",

In the available scientific literature, few publications present the problems of growing herbal plants for direct consumption and discuss the biological value of fresh herbal material. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the yield and quality of tarragon herb grown for bunching depending on plant density (20 × 20 cm and 30 × 30 cm) and harvest date (beginning of July and beginning of September). This study was conducted during the period 2010-2012 at the Experimental Station of the Department of Vegetable Crops and Medicinal Plants, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, in south-east region of Poland (51o14'N 22o34'E). In fresh plant material, the contents of L-ascorbic acid, chlo- rophyll, carotenoids and essential oil were determined, while the contents of essential oil, tannins and flavonoids were determined in leaf herbage. The yield of tarragon herb grown for bunching was dependent on the plant density and harvest date as well as their interac- tion. Plants grown at lower density and harvested during the early summer period were characterized by better yield parameters compared to the other treatments. Tarragon herb harvested at the beginning of July was characterized by higher concentrations of L-ascorbic acid, chlorophyll a, b and a + b, flavonoids and essential oil as well as a lower content of tannins than the plant material harvested at the beginning of September. The carotenoid content in tarragon herb was not dependent on the factors studied, with their significant interaction. In growing tarragon for bunching, lower plant density can be rec- ommended, since it contributes to high herb and essential oil yields. The beginning of July proved to be a more favourable time for harvesting tarragon grown for bunching than the beginning of September due to the quantity and biological value of tarragon yield and es- sential oil yield.",

In some cases nearly at the base of previously formed leaf and even on its petiole one or two leaves as well as shoot apex in their axils were induced thereby forming young shoot which underwent elongation and whole plant regeneration after 2 subculturing. More advanced developmentally structures of adventi- tious shoot were obtained while prolonging preculture duration. This was the favourable effect on the shoot differentiation, their elongation and plant regeneration as seed submit- ted preculture for 3, 4, 5 days however, seeds not treated with preculture revealed the best response as regard to shoot primordium formation at the earliest stage.",

The water content and storage temperature of seeds were used for determining differential thermodynamic parameters: Gibbs free en- ergy, entropy, and enthalpy. The experiments were carried out with aging pepper seeds stored in ambient (uncontrolled) conditions for 132 months. It was found that the viability potential deteriorated more rapidly after 4-5 years of storage. Thermodynamic parameters - differential enthalpy and entropy, and free energy decreased with decline of germination. Therefore these parameters can be used as means for better understanding of aging processes and this is of great importance for agricultural practice because it allows more detailed de- scription and prediction of the deterioration of pepper seeds during long-term storage.",

Little gardens established in the areas adjacent to blocks of flats constitute a relatively new phenomenon in urban landscape. The occurrence of plants in front gardens of Lublin's housing estates was examined in the years 2008-2009. Two years ago were made additional comparative work in Łeczna and Biala Podlaska in order to find out to the effect that species composition of front gardens.

The list included all plants, if they were planted by the hosts of a darden, the plants from planned plantings performed by specialist firms within housing estate greenery management were neglected. In the case of synanthropic plants and spontane- ously passing from natural communities, only those were taken into consideration, which were purposefully planted or incorporated into the gardens and were not an effect of neg- ligence. In total 262 species were determined in 325 gardens. Perennial plants were pre- dominant: 152 species, one-year plants 52 and shrubs were represented by 49 plants, two- year plants - 9 species. As to the numerical force of occurrences in gardens the first place was taken by orris iris - 147 occurences, then tagetes, encountered in 133 gardens and roses - in 116.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a procedure to identify promising, chilling-insensitive cu- cumber genotypes from a pool of 55 breeding lines. Selected genotypes may constitute valuable material in further selection of high-yielding cultivars in moderate climate. The approach is based on determining nitrate (NO3 - ) content, nitrate reductase activity (NRA) and chlorophyll content (Chl) in cotyledons of cucumbers grown at 12 o C. These observa- tions were then used to develop a simple algorithm, which facilitates the ordering of geno- types according to their chilling sensitivity by assigning them ranks on the basis of quar- tile values (from 1 to 4) of determined traits. From the examined collection, 14 least chill- ing-sensitive genotypes were selected, i.e. their selection for further breeding carries the lowest risk. Low chilling sensitivity of the above mentioned 14 cucumber genotypes was manifested by high Chl levels and high NRA as well as high NO3 - contents, i.e. the sum of quartile ranks ranged from 10 to 12, at a maximum of 12. Then cluster analysis was applied to select genotypes, which possess desirable levels of tested traits. Cluster analysis showed that at the division into two and into three subsets all the 14 genotypes considered promising were found within the same cluster, when these genotypes were divided into more subsets, 13 out of the 14 best genotypes were found in one cluster. The presented method may be used to select the least chilling-sensitive cucumber genotypes also from other collections. Knowing the quartile values calculated on the basis of presented results, the rank of new genotypes characterizing their chilling sensitivity may be estimated, pro- vided that experiments are carried out under conditions similar to those used in this study. Otherwise the application of this algorithm has to be preceded by an in-depth explorative analysis and the determination of new quartile values for the analyzed traits.",

First, through incubation of 50 g of the roots on sieve. Second, by centrifuga- tion method using 200 g of soil. Nematodes obtained were killed by hot 6% formaline and then processed to glycerine. Permanent slides were determined to the species using keys. During this process there were obtained nematode species from which 12 belonged to ge- nus of fungivorous, 4 to genus of bacteriavorous and 38 to plant parasitic species. Ten of them are known as nematode vectors of plant viruses (GYFV, CLRV, TRV, AMV, SLRV, GLRaV-1, -2, -3, GVA, GVB, GVE, GFLV, GCMV, GrSPaV, GFkV, GRSPaV).

The aim of this investigation was to assess the biological quality of endive cultivated in three different growing media. Organic media: coconut fiber and wood fiber, were com- pared to rockwool, commonly used as a standard horticultural medium in greenhouse vegetable production. Three crispum leaf endive cultivars: 'Galanti', 'Perceval' and 'Ba- rundi' and one latifolium leaf cultivar (escarole chicory): 'Kethel' were examined during the spring time. At about 10 days before harvest the plants were covered with low tunnel made from double-sided black and white foil to bleach the leaves and at 5-7 days before the end of the experiment nutrient solution was replaced by water to reduce the nitrate concentration in the leaves of endive. The content of dry matter, ascorbic acid, total solu- ble solids (TSS), total sugars (TS), phenolic acids and nitrates (NO3), P, K and Ca was de- termined in leaves of both bleached and not bleached plants. Also the antioxidant activity was measured by two assays DPPH and FRAP. The effect of cultivation substrate, culti- var, and bleaching treatment on the quality of endive appeared diversed. The unbleached endive showed a higher content of dry mass, higher concentrations of sugars, TSS, potas- sium, and calcium than the bleached plants. The bleached plants had significantly lower fresh mass of plants (by 33% in average), but in turn were characterized by higher con- centrations of phosphorus and polyphenolic acids. Plants cultivated on wood fiber con- tained the smallest amount of nitrates, comparing to plants grown either on rockwool or coconut fiber. None of the investigated plants contained more nitrates than the acceptable level of nitrates for lettuce grown under cover. The antioxidant activity of endive plants measured by FRAP method was higher in not bleached endive plants than in the bleached ones. The antioxidant impact of endive plants expressed as DPPH was not reduced in re- sponse to bleaching. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in plants of 'Kethel'.",

However, phenotypic changes often observed in the field performance of tissue culture-produced strawberry plants might affect their agronomic value. So, it is of utmost importance to assess the field performance of in vitro propagated plants to verify their fidelity to conventional propagated plants. In this study, the agronomic value of the strawberry plants derived from cultivars ‘Filon’ and ‘Teresa’ via in vitro propagation and their first vegetative progeny was compared to conventional plants. During the field experiments, agronomic traits such as plant vigor, abundance of flowering and yield components were evaluated. The results showed the different field response of cultivars tested to in vitro propagation. In spite of the phenotypic changes observed in in vitro derived plants, their agronomic value was equal or superior in comparison with conventional plants. In conclusion, it should be stated that in vitro propagation method can be safely recommended for the reproduction of these strawberry cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Coriander is a herbal plant, whose fruit has medicinal and aromatic use. The field research described herein was conducted in 2006-2008, where a controlled, one- factor experiment was set up in a random block design with four replications. The ex- perimental factor was nitrogen fertilization in doses of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 kg N·ha -1 and a control treatment (no nitrogen fertilization). The objective was to determine the ef- fect of nitrogen fertilization on the yield and quality of coriander herbal material (fruit). The experimental results showed that the weather conditions during the research deter- mined the morphological traits and yield components as well as the volume of unproc- essed herbal material obtained from coriander plants. The yield of coriander fruit was sig- nificantly higher in the season with high precipitations than in the other two years with lower precipitations. The respective differences were 44 and 32%. Nitrogen fertilization did not differentiate the number of plants per plot surface area, weight of fruits per plant or 1000 fruit weight, meaning that the fruit yields were not differentiated, either. How- ever, a significant relationship has been shown between coriander yields and nitrogen fer- tilization in the years of the experiment. The experiment evidenced that the chemical com- position of coriander fruits was more strongly determined by the weather conditions dur- ing the growing season than by nitrogen fertilization. A higher content of essential oil in fruit (1.50%) was obtained by coriander growing under drier weather; when the growing season was much wetter, the content of essential oil was much lower (1.07%). The major component of coriander oil was linalool, which made up 67.4% of the chemical profile. Nitrogen fertilization did not differentiate the chemical profile of coriander essential oil.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the nutritional and energy potential of the leaves of rocket (Eruca sativa Mill.) as affected by different regimes of plant nitrogen and potassium nutrition. Plants were grown in a greenhouse in a peat substrate, using varying amounts of nitrogen and potassium: 0.3 and 0.6 N as calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) as well as 0.3 K, 0.6 K, and 0.9 K in the form of potassium sulphate (K2SO4 ) and potassium chloride (KCl), with a constant level of the other macro- and micronutrients. Fresh leaf yield and the content of soluble sugars, fat, ash and dietary fibre were determined, as well as the caloric value of the plant material studied was estimated. It was shown that the nutritional value of rocket leaves could be increased by using an appropriate system of plant mineral nutrition. The use of KCl significantly increased the nutritional value of rocket leaves, as determined by the presence of fat and dietary fibre. The application of K2SO4 proved to be more beneficial due to the concentration of carbohydrates and available carbohydrates. An increase in the rate of nitrogen caused an increase in biomass and fat content, but also contributed to a decrease in the concentration of glucose and fructose. The higher rates of potassium had an effect on increasing the content of fat, ash and glucose. The energy value of rocket leaves was not modified by mineral fertilization applied.",

Thus, endophytes can be used for plants improvement. These facts stimu- lated a more detailed investigation aimed at providing more insight into the problem of these endophytes in Poland. The aims of the research were as follows: (i) to determine the levels of colonization of Polish-grown cultivars of perennial ryegrass, meadow fescue, and red fescue with endophytic fungi of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloe; (ii) to de- termine the potential hazards associated with the toxins produced by the active associa- tions; (iii) to isolate viable endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloe from ac- tive associations; and (iv) to determine the levels of antagonistic activity of the obtained endophyte isolates against selected microorganisms, in particular serious grass pathogens, in vitro. The staining method was used for endophytes detection in grass seed collection. Endophytes were isolated on PDA medium and characterized. Antagonistic activity of N/E isolates and seed extracts were determined in dual culture assays and on microscope slides respectively. Ergovaline and lolitrem B content were assayed. There were 242 sam- ples of seeds of 50 cultivars of grasses collected in Poland, including 124 samples of 20 cultivars of perennial ryegrass, 61 samples of 10 cultivars of meadow fescue, and 57 sam- ples of 20 cultivars of red fescue. Endophytic fungi were only detected in 33 seed samples of 5 perennial ryegrass cultivars and in 15 samples of 2 meadow fescue cultivars. The lev- els of seed colonization of these species reached maximum 8 and 90%, respectively. No colonization by endophytes was found in seeds of red fescue. The viability of endophytic mycelium in the seeds of perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue was very low. Endo- phytic fungi were isolated only from 3 and 4 samples of these grasses respectively. In laboratory conditions, endophytic fungi showed stronger antagonistic properties at 25°C. The highest and most frequent growth inhibition was observed for M. nivale, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium avenaceum and F. equiseti. The obligate pathogens B. graminis, P. coronata, and P. graminis ssp. graminicola were not sensitive to water and alcohol ex- tracts of E+ seeds. Isolates Fp28, Fp40, and, to a lesser degree, Fp37, originating from meadow fescue, were characterized by the strongest antagonistic properties. Moreover,",

Therefore, the producers seek for more effective methods of its propagation. In the years 2011-2014 in the Felin Experimental Farm of the University of Life Sciences in Lublin the research was undertaken to estimate the crowns efficiency of four Polish border dahlia cultivars. The tubers were taken out from storage in early spring, then planted in trays filled with peat and placed on the tables in a glasshouse. The soft stem cuttings snipped off from the sprouts arising from tubers were used for experiments which aim was to evaluate the quality of four types of rooted soft cuttings. It was stated that the number of sprouts appearing in spring on a mother plant depended on a cultivar and a season. Tubers of 'Krynica' and 'Halinka' cul- tivars formed the most sprouts. The most effective were crowns from which apical cuttings were snipped off (90-115) pieces from the 10th of February till the 20th of April. The number of soft stems that were used to obtain cuttings 'with heel', 'without heel' and 2-node' ones ranged on average from 50 to 80 per season. The best quality rooted cuttings, in terms of a fresh weight, number of leaves and a fresh weight and number of roots, were the heel cuttings.",

The study also evaluated the usefulness of propagation material for establishing a rhubarb plantation. To produce in vitro plantlets, shoots were placed on modified Murashige and Skoog medium containing different cyto- kinins: benzyladenine (BA - 4.4, 11.1, 22.2 µmol·dm -3 ), kinetin (4.7, 11.6, 23.3 µmol·dm -3 ), isopentenyl adenine (2iP - 4.9, 12.3, 24.4 µmol·dm -3 ) as well as on control medium with- out growth regulators. Cuttings were obtained by division of crowns, while seedlings from seeds. In the period 2004-2006, vegetatively and generatively propagated plants were grown in a nursery. The obtained propagation material was used to establish a rhubarb plantation. Yield of field-grown plants was evaluated in the years 2007-2009. In the first year of cultivation in the nursery, plants propagated in vitro in the medium with the addi- tion of kinetin at a concentration of 11.6 μmol dm -3 or 2iP at 12.3 μmol dm -3 developed crowns with the highest average weight of 1.48 and 1.05 kg, respectively. In the second year of cultivation in the nursery in the treatment with grown regulators applied, the aver- age rhubarb crown weight ranged from 2.51 to 3.33 kg, while for the control treatment it was 1.78 kg. To characterize the population of in vitro plants, they were compared with plants obtained by division of the mother plant and from seeds. Plants propagated vegeta- tively from in vitro plantlets produced crowns with the highest average weight (0.83 kg), followed by those obtained from division of mother plants (0.79 kg), while plants pro- duced from seeds had crowns with a much lower average weight (0.54 kg). In the second year of cultivation in the nursery, vegetatively and generatively propagated plants were characterized by a similar size and greater uniformity than in the first year. In the first year of planting (2007), petiole yield obtained from micropropagated plants was higher by 0.7 kg·plant -1 compared to generatively propagated plants, whereas in the second year of cultivation this difference was smaller and amounted to 0.6 kg· plant -1 . In the third year of the plantation, plant productivity was more equal. During the study years, by far fewer leaves were harvested from generatively propagated plants compared to plants propagated",

Flavonoids and phenol acids content in leaves, stems, and roots of sweet pep- per plants were analyzed. Flavonoids and phenol acids content was studied using isocratic HPLC method. Disease index of tested cultivars was evaluated in the field. The leaves, stems and roots of pepper were analyzed in the laboratory. The fungi most frequently iso- lated from pepper were Alternaria alternata, Fusarium spp., Botrytis cinerea, and Scle- rotinia sclerotiorum. The highest content of flavonoids and phenol acids was in the leaves of pepper. Flavonoids content in plant parts was positively correlated with the intensity of colonization by pathogenic fungi. Sweet pepper cultivars 'Caryca F1' and 'Roberta F1' were characterised by low content flavonoids in the tested plant parts and they were colo- nized by the low number of pathogenic fungi. The cultivars most frequently colonized by pathogenic fungi such as 'Barborka', 'Podstolina', 'Robertina', had a high content of fla- vonoids in the tested plant parts. There was no correlation between the content of phenol acids and health status of pepper cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Taking the decreasing water supplies into consideration, more attention should be paid to reasonable water management. However, in order to be able to minimise the water use and manage it reasonably, it seems necessary to investigate the plants water management and their reactions to water stress. Most of the previous studies concerning the effects of irrigation and fertilisation was conducted on apple orchards and there is little information in the literature about the influence of these factors on stone fruit trees.The study was conducted in 2011, 2013 and 2014 years in the Agricultural Experimental Sta- tion in Lipnik. The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of irrigation and mineral fertilization on photosynthetic activity, water use and yielding in cherry cv. 'Kelleris 16'. The first factor of the study was under-crown watering: 0 - controlled ob- jects, with no irrigation, W - irrigated objects, with soil water potential below - 0.01 MPa. The secondary factor was nitrogen and potassium fertilization: 0 NK (control, no fertilization), 1 NK - 80 kg . ha -1 (40 + 40), 2 NK - 160 kg . ha -1 (80 + 80). The meas- urements of the leaves photosynthetic activity in each year were taken in the dynamic fashion, using a LCA-4 analyser (ADC Bioscentific LTD, Hoddeson, Great Britain). WUE increased under water shortage conditions and decreased when water was more available. The calculated water use efficiencies, both WUE and WUEI, were higher for the objects fertilized with 1NK dose. The application of the supplementary irrigation as well as NK fertilization significantly influenced the increase in cherry cv. 'Kelleris 16' yielding. Moreover, it was found a significant positive correlation between yielding and intensity of assimilation, as well as between yielding and water use efficiency (WUE).",

Numerous varieties of this species have been produced, how- ever, the information concerning their requirements and cultivation conditions is lacking. The study was conducted in the field conditions in the years 2008-2010. The plant mate- rial included corms of four crocosmia cultivars: 'Emily McKenzie', 'Lucifer', 'Mars', and 'Meteor'. The corms were planted on 15 th April, 5 th May and 25 th May. The number of days from the beginning of sprouting until the end of flowering was established, and measurements of vegetative and generative traits were performed during cultivation. Corm yield was determined at the end of the cultivation period. It was found that delaying the planting time resulted in accelerated sprouting of the corms. Irrespective of the culti- var, the plants grown from the corms planted on 5 th May were the first, and those planted on 25 th May - the last to bloom. The corm planting time affected vegetative and genera- tive features of the crocosmia plants. The plants grown from the corms planted on 5 th and 25 th May were higher, had more shoots and leaves on the main shoots. The plants grown from the corms planted on 5 th May were characterized by the longest main inflorescence shoots and flowers of larger diameter than the plants grown from the corms planted on 15 th April and 25 th May. Cultivar-specific features largely determined the vegetative and generative traits. The plants of 'Emily McKenzie' cultivar were characterized by the longest main inflorescence shoots and the largest flower diameter, but they produced the lowest number of inflorescence shoots and flowers per main inflorescence spike. The study showed that earlier planting time (15 th April and 5 th May) resulted in higher coeffi- cient of weight and number increase of the new corms, but it did not affect the coefficient of total corm weight increase, as compared to the delayed planting time (25 th May).",

In the recent years the infections of the eastern purple coneflower by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium ox- ysporum, Verticillium dahliae and by Erysiphe cichoracearum have been observed. The development of these pathogens is dependent on the species composition of the phyl- losphere organisms, but it is also affected by the form and the level of nitrogen nutrition. The undertaken study aimed at the analysis of the mycobiota composition of the cone- flower phyllosphere as dependent on the rate of ammonium sulphate used in the plant fer- tilization. The experiment was set up in 2007-2009 at Psary near Wroc· aw. Two fertilizer rates were applied: 50 kg N·ha -1 and 200 kg N·ha -1 . The fungal taxa most abundantly iso- lated from the leaf surface of coneflower are: Cladosporium spp., Alternaria alternata, yeast-like colonies, Fusarium spp. and Epicoccum nigrum. These fungi make up > 90% of the isolated colonies., with C. herbarum and A. alternata as the dominant components of the assemblages. The dominant species within Fusarium spp. is F. equiseti. The species composition of the assemblages of fungi in the coneflower phyllosphere is variable and dependent on the course of the weather. The fertilization rate of ammonium sulphate does not affect the species composition of the phyllosphere fungi assemblages of the cone- flower.",

    "abstract": "Carrot is one of the most important vegetables in Poland. It is the best carote- noid source in a human diet. Carrot is consumed in large quantities, thanks to continuous supply of fresh and storage roots as well as wide choice of processed products on a food market. Also consumer demands increase with regard to carrot quality and biological value. Polish breeders offer new carrot cultivars for processing. The choice of cultivar is the important factor under human control that may be used to improve carrot quality. The experiment was carried out at the University of Agriculture in Krakow, Poland, in the years 2009 and 2010, with carrot cultivars ('Askona F1', 'DZE II F1', 'Galicja F1', 'Kari- oka F1', 'Karotan', 'Rumba F1', 'Afro F1', 'Broker F1', 'Kongo F1', 'Korund F1') to evaluate its morphological and chemical characteristics and processing usefulness. Root morphological features predisposed investigated cultivars to mechanical harvest and proc- essing. Analyzed chemical characteristics allowed to point out genotypes of high biologi- cal value and low nitrates accumulation, such as 'Karioka F1'. The source of frozen cube of the best quality were 'Karioka F1', 'Rumba F1', and 'Askona F1', because of the lowest centrifugal leakage value. 'Karioka F1' and 'Korund F1' showed the greatest capacity for drying, because of the highest value of rehydration ratio. This shows that the comparison of the cultivars is necessary when the decision about the raw material selected for process- ing should be made. The parameters characterizing the minimally processed carrot cube quality were also correlated with morphological and chemical features of the roots. The equations allowing to predict the processing indices as the function of independent mor- phological and chemical variables were proposed with a use of the multiply regression method.",

    "abstract": "Non-chemical methods of agrophage control have gained increasing popularity recently, and particular attention has been paid to enhancing biodiversity in agrocenoses. Inter- cropping, i.e. growing of two or more crops (onions, carrots, dill, beans, Lacy phacelia, mus- tard) simultaneously in the same field, reduces pest infestations. The rationale behind inter- cropping is that different crops planted together act as attractants for beneficial insects (hover- flies, ladybirds) and effectively disorientate the pests (aphids, carrot flies) which are then un- able to find host plants. This study was conducted in the Experimental Garden of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, in the growing seasons of 2009-2010. The experiment was established on brown soil of quality class IV b, and ridges were prepared in line with the gener- ally observed standards of organic farming. The first experimental factor were six carrot cultivars differing with respect to the growth and development period: 'Deep Purple F1', 'Florida F1', 'Interceptor F1', 'Joba', 'Kazan F1' and 'Purple Haze F1'. The second experimen- tal factor were three methods of carrot fly biocontrol, compared in the following treatments: control - unprotected plants, the application of the biocontrol agent Bioczos BR containing paraffin-coated garlic pulp (10 g cubes), carrots intercropped with dill cv. 'Szmaragd' and car- rots intercropped with Welsh onions cv. 'Parade'. Carrot-dill and carrot-Welsh onion inter- cropping effectively reduced damage to carrot roots caused by carrot fly larvae. The applied biological control methods had a significant effect on carrot yield. The application of Bioczos BR and carrot-Welsh onion intercropping had a beneficial influence on the total and market- able yield of carrot storage roots. Carrot-dill intercropping resulted in a significant yield de- crease. The content of dry matter, total sugars and L-ascorbic acid in carrot roots was affected by the cultivar and the cultivar × biocontrol method interaction. Higher concentrations of dry matter and L-ascorbic acid were noted in carrot cultivars with purple-colored roots, 'Deep Pur- ple F1' and 'Purple Haze F1'. The average nitrate content of carrot storage roots did not exceed the maximum permissible levels set out in the Regulation of the Minister of Health.",

    "abstract": "Yucca elephantipes is an important commercial ornamental pot plant, excellent for growing in flats, patios or winter gardens. Traditional vegetative propagation of the most decorative yuccas is complicated due to a very low rate of propagation, so in vitro culture is an alternative method for commercial propagation of these plants. The influence of BA (0.4, 2.2, 4.4, 11.1, 22.2 µM) and TDZ (0.5, 2.3, 4.5, 11.4, 22.7 µM) on shoot mul- tiplication of Yucca elephantipes Regel on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium was stud- ied. Explants cultured on medium without growth substances were used as a control. The two types of explants used in the experiment: shoot tips and nodal segments of shoots, were obtained from aseptically grown shoot clusters. When comparing regeneration capa- bility of 2 types of Yucca elephantipes explants, it was found that more newly formed shoots and roots were obtained from nodes. The highest formation of shoots was obtained from nodes on MS medium supplemented with 4.5 µM TDZ or 11.1 and 22.2 µM BA (6.5, 6.0, 5.8, respectively). The shoots regenerated from nodes showed best elongation. On the control medium and on the media with the lowest level of BA or TDZ, their aver- age length was 31.0-37.8 mm. The growth regulator-free medium and the media with a low level of BA were the most effective in inducing roots.",

An ex- periment was carried out in 2002-2005 at the Experimental Farm in Zawady belonging to University of Podlasie. The objective of the study was the effect of cover plants (phacelia, spring vetch, serradella and oat) ploughed down in the autumn, spring or retained on the soil surface as a cover crop on the yield of red and savoy cabbage, and dry matter and vi- tamin C contents in white and savoy cabbage was investigated. The effects of covers were compared to the uncovered control. White cabbage cv. 'Masada F1', red cabbage cv. 'Koda' and savoy cabbage cv. 'Wirosa F1' were cultivated. Irrespective of the date of ploughing down of cover plants, serradella was the best plant cover preceding red cab- bage, and phacelia was most beneficial when preceded savoy cabbage. Oat cover ploughed down in the autumn favoured dry matter accumulation, when spring- incorporated, stimulated vitamin C in white cabbage. The autumn-incorporated phacelia cover resulted in the greatest dry matter and vitamin C contents in savoy cabbage.",

The experiment was con- ducted in the following cycles: 04.08.2003-12.01.2004 and 29.07.2004-30.12.2004. Plant growth was evaluated on the basis of the following characters: total height, plant diameter, the number of leaves, the weight of the aboveground part and tuber diameter. The following characters were assessed in the evaluation of flowering: earliness of the cultivar, flower de- velopment rate and the number of flowers and buds. The experiment was completed when most plants reached commercial value, i.e. after developing five flowers per plant. It was found that slow-release fertilizers did not have a significant effect on the growth and flowering of Cyclamen persicum from Halios group, only the application of fertilizer Osmocote resulted in an increase of plant diameter and weight. A bigger effect was found for the year of cultivation: bigger insolation during cultivation boosts growth. Earliness of flowering was not affected by the year of cultivation, cultivars formed similar numbers of flowers, whereas the rate of flower development depended on both factors and in the year with bigger insolation it was higher and resulted in the formation of a bigger number of flowers.",

A pot experiment was conducted to determine the effect of seed priming of pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) with Se on growth, physiology and antioxidant activity grown under both control and drought stress conditions. Treatments included 6 levels of seed priming with Se (0 (control), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 4 mg. L–1) and 2 levels of water stress (well-watered and drought conditions). The results showed that supplemental Se at lower concentrations improved growth parameters like total leaf area, root length and total biomass of control and drought-stressed plants. In addition, relative water content and chlorophyll content of the drought-stressed plants increased with the application of Se at lower concentrations. Treatment with Se mitigated adverse effects of drought stress through enhancement of photosynthetic pigments, improvement of water relations, accumulation of soluble sugars and increased antioxidant activity. Seed priming with Se also increased total phenols, flavonoids and free radical scavenging activity of pot marigold plants both under well-watered and water stress conditions. It was found that seed priming with Se at lower concentrations (especially 1.5 mg. L–1) can mitigate the adverse effects of drought stress and improved antioxidant system of pot marigold plants.",

Mediterranean countries are the most concerned where olive tree constitutes one of the most dynamic cultivations. This work focuses on the research for new indicators of the adaptation of the olive tree to several climatic conditions. ‘Chemlali’ and ‘Chetoui’ represent the primary Tunisian olive tree cultivars. To adapt to different climatic conditions characterizing the north, the center and the south of the country (superior semiarid, inferior semiarid and inferior arid respectively), these varieties synthesize many interesting compounds that have been screened and compared. Indeed, the methanolic extracts from ‘Chemlali’ and ‘Chetoui’ leaves have been tested for their antioxidant activities. The chemical compositions of the extracts have been quantified in antioxidants. Both ‘Chemlali’ and ‘Chetoui’ exhibited a significant antioxidant activity, reaching 90%. However, Chemlali activity was more important in the inferior semiarid (80%) and in the inferior arid (70%), while ‘Chetoui’ activity was more significant in the superior semiarid and in the inferior arid. Total phenols of ‘Chemlali’ showed a triple content in the inferior arid comparatively to the superior semiarid. Additionally, flavonoids, o-diphenols, saponin and carotenoids of ‘Chemlali’ increased significantly in this area as opposed to those of ‘Chetoui’. 2(3H) 5-methyl furanone, 4-vinyl methoxyphenol, and hexadecanoic acid known for their antioxidant activity and many others have been identified in these varieties.",

Nitrogen fertilization had a significant effect on changes in the assimilable elements in soil. It exerted an effect on the decrease of assimilable potassium in the arable and subarable layer and an increase of assimilable magnesium improving the K : Mg ratio. A smaller effect was found in the changes of assimilable phosphorus content and in soil reaction. Nitrogen fertilization had an effect on the increase of total nitrogen content in leaves and it decreased the content of phosphorus. The content of assimilable components in soil was not correlated with the content of general components in leaves. The content of mineral components in fruits was closely correlated with the component content in leaves. Climatic conditions, and particu- larly the absence of atmospheric precipitations and the increase of temperature, as well as the aging of trees contributed to the decrease of the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, po- tassium and magnesium and to the increase of calcium content.",

In the years 2006–2008 in Przybroda near Pozna the objects of studies were peach trees ‘Harbinger’ on rootstocks Manchurian Peach, Sand Cherry and Rakoniewicka Seedling, formed as a spindle, severely damaged by frost in 2005/2006 winter. In May 2006, an intensive tree pruning was carried out. The objective of studies included the estimation of the pruning effect and rootstocks of frostbitten trees on the process of their regeneration and yielding. Pruning caused a decrease of tree height and crown width in relation to control. Trunks of the strongly pruned trees became thicker, as compared with control trees. In the third year after regenerative pruning, the trees decreased their yield by about 30% in relation to control. The best yielding trees were on rootstock Rakoniewicka Seedling, but the weakest on Sand Cherry.",

Daily light dose was 0.54 mol·m (25 mol·m·s × 6 h). Significant effect of light colour on postharvest longevity and quality of plants was observed. The post-harvest longevity of hyacinths depends, among others, on the length of the flowering period and it is the longest after the application of white and blue light colour. Red light decreased flower life and deteriorated the ornamental value. The rigidity of inflorescence shoots depended on the cultivar, but in all flowers, it was significantly lower than it is recommended in market turnover for flowering plants grown in pots. It also refers to leaves, whose elongation is the greatest under lamps with red colour. In the ‘Fondant’ cultivar, elongation caused a maximal flabbiness of inflorescence shoots and leaves.",

Tulips were treated 3 times (since the mid of April till the beginning of May) at weekly intervals with the oils at concentrations: 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0%. The oil preparations used at concentrations 1.0–1.5% had no negative influence on stem and tepals lengths at tulips grown in the field. No phytotoxicity symptoms on stems nor leaves were found. On plots protected with mineral oils, percentage of virus-infected plants was lower than for control, while high efficiency was recorded only in 2011 when using Sunspray 850 EC at 1.0–2.0% concentration. The oil preparations applied for a prolonged time at concentration of 2.0% caused a decline in commercial and the first choice bulb yields. No negative sequential effects of oils on quality of obtained flowers during tulip forcing in a greenhouse, was observed. The efficiency of mineral oils in reducing the virus spread evaluated based on the number of virus-infected flowers during forcing in the greenhouse depended on the year of study and type of the oil. The best results were achieved applying Sunspray 850 EC at concentrations of 1.0–1.5%. Oil preparations can be safely applied for tulip cultivation for a prolonged time if concentration does not exceed 1.5%. Despite of positive effects in reducing the virus spread in the field growing and forcing, three spraying treatments using mineral oils during vegetation season did not ensure a complete plant protection against viral infections.",

After 28 days of culture, the percentage of germinated seeds was the highest (70%) in the full-strength MS medium. The cytokinin BA was superior to other tested treatments in terms of its ability to promote germination of lentisk seeds. When tested at different concentrations, sucrose gave the best results obtained at concentrations of 1–4%, whereas high concentrations (6 and 8%) mainly decreased germination rate and there was no a regular pattern for elongation of the aerial parts of plants. With this described protocol, on average 76.67% seeds germinated 4 weeks after culture. Developed seedlings were satisfactorily acclimatized in sterilized peat, soil and perlite containing compost, with high percentage survival viability was obtained 9 months after transfer to in vivoconditions (93.33%). The results obtained showed that the enriched full-strength MS medium supplemented with 1 mg L–1 BA and 3% sucrose induced homogeneous and healthy seedling development in a period of 4 to 8 weeks of culture.",

On the trees intensively flowering in 2013, the thinning treatments were performed as follows: thinning at the pink bud stage to the 50% of flower clusters leaving only a king flower in the remaining flower clusters; thinning at the pink bud stage to the 50% of flower clusters leaving only one lateral flower in the remaining flower clusters, thinning 4 weeks after full bloom to the 50% of fruit clusters leaving only a fruit from king flower in the remaining fruit clusters, thinning 4 weeks after full bloom to the 50% of fruit clusters leaving only one fruit from lateral flower in the remaining fruit clusters. Intensively flowering control trees in 2013 and poorly flowering trees in 2013 were left unthinned. The best results in terms of regularity of yielding and high-quality fruits after thinning at pink bud stage to king flower, were obtained. The largest fluctuations in yields were observed with the control tree that flowered poorly in the beginning of the study. It was found that the cultivar ‘Szampion’ is characterized by equal distribution of fruits in lower and middle parts of crown, however in the top of crown, the amount of fruits is significantly lower. Apples with the largest mean fruit weight were from spurs on wood older than two years. However the best flesh firmness, soluble solids and dry matter content was detected in fruits from brindles.",

    "abstract": "Decalepis hamiltonii Wight &amp; Arn., is a plant species that is endemic to southern parts of India. The aim of this study is to explore the influence of habitat heterogeneity on total phenolics, flavonoids, flavor compound 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzaldehyde (2H4MB) and antioxidant potential of tubers. The flavor metabolite 2H4MB was quantified by HPLC using isocratic solvent system (methanol : acetonitrile : water : acetic acid 47 : 10 : 42 : 1) that indicates obvious difference in 2H4MB content of tubers with a maximum of 96.4 ±2.6 and 92.6 ±1.2 mg 100 g–1 dry weight basis (DW) in samples from B.R. Hills and Mysore area of Karnataka, followed by samples from Tirumalai Hills and Kurnool from Andhra Pradesh (89.02 ±0.9 mg 100 g–1 DW), Tamil Nadu (81.6 ±2.4 mg 100 g–1 DW) and Kerala (80.18 ±1.1 mg 100 g–1 DW) of tubers. There was variation in total phenolics, total flavonoids and 2H4MB content of root samples collected from different habitats. Also significant variation in free radical scavenging potential of methanol root extracts was noticed, which is directly proportional to the phenolics, and flavonoids content. Overall, there was 10–16% difference in content of 2H4MB in D. hamiltonii tubers that were collected from different natural habitats, and this habitat heterogeneity has to be considered vital, while using such tubers for edible purposes and food formulations.",

    "abstract": "Mandevilla sanderi is an important commercial ornamental pot plant. Traditional vegetative propagation is limited due to the low rate, therefore there is a need to develop an alternative, more efficient method. There is an interest in development of micropropagation technology for the species, as it allows to obtain a lot of offsprings in a relatively short time. The aim of the present work was to estimate an influence of explants type and position on regeneration of Mandevilla sanderi in tissue culture. Four different types of explants (leafy shoot tips, decapitated leafy shoot tips, defoliated shoot tips, decapitated and defoliated shoot tips) were used in the experiment, which were placed on the media vertically, while defoliated shoot tips were placed horizontally or vertically upside down. The explants were cultivated on a Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1 mg·dm–3 benzyladenine (BA) and 0.5 mg·dm–3 indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). It was noted that both explants orientation and positioning, influenced the multiplication rate. Defoliated shoot tips placed horizontally were characterized by higher multiplication rate (6.8) in comparison to upside down vertical positioning (3.2). It was also observed that removal of shoot apex improved axillary branching, while defoliation of shoots placed in a normal position reduced multiplication rate.",

Iris suaveolens Boiss. et Reuter is an endemic species with high seed dormancy and has high tolerance to cold and drought. This study focused on seed dormancy break of I. suaveolens under in vitro conditions. In the first experiment, the seeds were given stratification treatment on MS medium containing different concentrations of BAP with or without NAA. The 2nd experiment reports effects of alternative combinations of cold (at 4°C, 24 h dark) – warm (16 h light photoperiod) conditions on medium containing different concentrations of plant growth regulators on agar solidified MS medium. Both experiments showed about 8.33% seed germination against 64.5% seed viability as confirmed by tetrazolium test. All germinating seeds were abnormal and very weak. In the third experiment, 10 minutes acid scarified seeds cultured at 24°C in 16 h light photo period on MS medium achieved 60.0% germination. Similar treatment under cold + dark condition was inhibitory and failed to show identical results. This underlines the importance of acid scarification, photoperiod and warm treatments of I. suaveolens seeds to break seed dormancy. All germinated seeds showed normal growth and development under field conditions.",

The disease incidences of approximately 50% were recorded in various fields visited in the Almaty region. The pathogen was aseptically isolated from the symptomatic leaves and maintained in an in vitro culture media. Morphological characteristics and sporulation of the fungus was determined under both light and electron microscopy. The extracted genomic DNA of the fungi was subjected to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using ABCsens/ABCrev and ITS1/ITS4 primers amplifying ABC transporter (Atr1) gene and the internal transcribed spacer regions, respectively. The amplified products of PCR were sequenced, aligned, blasted and compared for similarity with other species in the NCBI GenBank. The cluster analysis result showed 99% homology with related fungi retrieved from the NCBI GenBank for the ITS region. The fungal isolate was pathogenic towards twenty-two-day-old plants, namely, Brassica oleracea, Lycopersicon esculentum, Solanum melongena, and was established as the causal agent of leaf spot on these plants. This is the first record implicating A. brassicae for black leaf spot disease of cabbage in Kazakhstan.",

    "abstract": "Thrips nigropilosus Uzel is a polyphagous species occurring mainly in temperate climates. Its life cycle de- pends on photoperiodic and temperature conditions. T. nigropilosus feeds on different plant species, but it is considered one of the most serious pests of pyrethrum plants causing serious economic problems. However, several additional agricultural host plants have been affected by T. nigropilosus, including spearmint, cu- cumber, and lettuce, indicating that this insect can significantly widen its habitats and occurs especially frequently in greenhouses. We report that T. nigropilosus massively attacked Mentha × piperita L. cultivated in greenhouses in central Poland and destroyed the entire mint crops within a short time. The study provided insight into the harmful effect of the thrips and showed that the length of the thrips developmental cycle was reduced with temperature increases from 18 to 26.6°C. The lower threshold temperatures were 13.7, 10.2, 5.0, and 10.1 for eggs, larvae, pupae, and total development, respectively, and the thermal constant for the same developmental stages was 65.9, 90, 132.5, and 284.9-degree days. Both parameters were estimated by linear regression analysis. During our experiment, T. nigropilosus developed by thelytokous parthenogenesis. The morphological and anatomical changes in damaged plants were associated with the fact that the insect began feeding on the lower lamina surface close to the leaf midribs, but no damage to vascular bundles and glandular cells was observed.",

From three cytokinins, benzyladenine, kinetin and 2-isopentenyl-adenine, only BA effectively stimulated shoot multiplication from axiliary buds. The highest multiplication rate was obtained from nodes in presence of 0.25–0.5 mg·dm–3 BA. Higher concentrations shortened internodes and decreased leaf blades and growth of callus. 1 mg·dm–3 of KIN and 2iP positively influenced shoots growth and size of leaves. Gibberellic acid (GA3) used with BA increased the number of axillary shoots. The best quality shoots and the highest multiplication rate were obtained when 2 mg·dm–3 BA was used with 5 mg·dm–3 GA3. Cytokinins affected rooting and acclimatization ex vitro. Dahlias shoots multiplicated in presence of 1 mg·dm–3 KIN or 2iP rooted faster in the soil and 100% survived in field, while those from 1 mg·dm–3 BA media rooted slowly, had shorter shoots and only 60% survived. Plants bloomed after 11–12 weeks in the field. Dahlia plants that had been multiplicated in presence of KIN had a bigger diameter and fresh weight in the field. BA and 2iP positively influenced flowers diameter, length of flower stalk and a number of first order shoots.",

This study aimed at establishing dehydrin profile and accumulation in four local melon varieties of Iran: Mino, Dargazi, Saveii, and Semsori, as well as in a commercial variety Honeydew. Plants were treated with drought stress by adjusting the soil water content to 75, 50, 40, 30 and 20% of field capacity (FC) by withholding water. Water status of plants was monitored based on the seedling fresh weight (FW) and relative water content of leaves (RWC). Total protein content was extracted, then heat-stable protein (HSP) fraction was isolated for each variety and water stress treatment. After SDS-PAGE of HSP, Western blotting analysis was carried out with Anti-dehydrin rabbit (primary) and Goat anti rabbit (secondary) antibodies. ANOVA results showed that with decreasing FC below 75%, FW and RWC decreased, but these changes significantly varied among genotypes. On the basis of FW and RWC data under different drought stress treatments, the following drought-tolerant ranking was established: Mino &gt; Dargazi &gt; Saveii and Honeydew &gt; Semsori, from tolerant to sensitive order. Results of Western blot analysis showed that expression of some proteins with molecular weights of 19–52 kDa was induced in the studied varieties under drought stress (% FC). Expression level of the dehydrin proteins in different varieties was variable and also depending on the drought stress level applied. However, dehydrin proteins (45 and 50 kDa) showed strong expression levels in all varieties under severe drought stress (20% FC). The abundance of dehydrin proteins was higher in tolerant varieties (Mino and Dargazi) than in moderate and drought sensitive genotypes. Consequently, dehydrins represent a potential marker for selection of genotypes with enhanced drought tolerance.",

    "abstract": "The genus Fragaria belongs to the Rosaceae family. The most popular representatives of this species are the strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) and wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.), whose taste and health benefits are appreciated by a huge number of consumers. The cultivation of Fragaria plants is widespread around the world, with particular emphasis on the temperate climate zone. Increasingly occurring weather anomalies, including drought phenomena, cause immense losses in crop cultivation. The Fragaria plant species are very sensitive to drought, due to the shallow root system, large leaf area and the high water content of the fruit. There have been many studies on the influence of water deficit on the morphological, biochemical and physiological features of strawberries and wild strawberries. There is a lack of research summarizing the current state of knowledge regarding of specific species response to water stress. The aim of this study was to combine and compare data from many research carried out and indicate the direction of future research aimed at improving the resistance of Fragaria plants species to stress related to drought. These plants show patterns of response to stress caused by drought, such as: osmotic adjustment, reduction of transpiration and photosynthesis, and increased efficiency of water use. Drought also causes significant changes in the composition and palatability of the fruit of the Fragaria plant species.",

The high concentration of heavy metals impresses biochemical pathway and changes fatty acid compositions of plant cells.

In the present study, heavy metal content was analyzed with ICP-MS, fatty acid composition was investigated with GC and physiological parameters were determined with spectrophotometrically in the leaves of tomato subjected to increasing doses of heavy metals. In this study, the treatment of heavy metals on the growth medium changed the fatty acid contents of corn. The application of Cu significantly increased the level of palmitic acid and oleic acid. The treatment of Pb raised the content of oleic acid, whereas it significantly decreased the content of α-linolenic acid and erucic acid at 20 and 50 mg kg–1, respectively. The addition of Cd significantly increased the level of oleic acid and linoleic acid; however, it significantly decreased the content of α-linolenic acid and erucic acid. Cu and Pb significantly raised the proline content. The application of Cu and Cd showed similar effect on hydrogen peroxide and the higher doses of them increased the content of H2O2. The level of lipid peroxidation significantly increased in response to all applied concentration of Cu. The results obtained in this study show that the aapplication of heavy metals changed the content of fatty acids, particularly that of oleic acid significantly increased in response to them.

    "abstract": "The enzyme strictosidine synthase (STR, EC: 4.3.3.2) plays a key role in the biosynthetic pathway of terpenoid indole alkaloid (TIA). It catalyzes the condensation of the tryptamine and secologanin to form 3α(S)-strictosidine, which is the common precursor of all TIAs. In this paper, a STR gene designated as DoSTR (GenBank: KX068707) was first cloned and characterized from Dendrobium officinale with rapid amplified cDNA ends method (RACE). DoSTR has a length of 1380bp with 1179bp open reading frame encoding 392 amino acids. BlastP analyses showed that its amino acid sequence was classified into Str_synth superfamily. qRT-PCR showed that DoSTR was expressed in all tissues tested, with a significantly higher level in flower and the lowest in stem. Four different treatments with MeJA, SA, ABA and AgNO3, respectively, could induce the DoSTR expression to a different extent. And the effect of MeJA was the most obvious and transcript level of DoSTR induced by MeJA was 20.7 times greater than that of control at 48 hours after treatment. Furthermore, it was found that DoSTR was localized in vacuole through transient expression in tobacco. The characterization and expression of DoSTR can help in further studying the role of DoSTR in the biosynthesis of TIAs in D. officinale. This study may throw light on the alkaloid biosynthesis pathway of D. officinale.",

The objectives concerned microclimatic zones in the tunnel and the yield and quality of butterhead lettuce (spring), cucumber (summer), and butterhead lettuce (autumn). Besides the properties of the soil in the high tunnel, a crucial role was played by microclimatic factors. The measurements showed variations in solar radiation, temperature and air humidity depending on the zone in the tunnel and the weather. Higher temperature in the centre of the tunnel was conducive to obtaining greater yields of spring lettuce and cucumber. In the spring and summer periods, the amounts of dry matter and total sugars in the edible parts of the cultivated vegetables were higher in the eastern and central zones of the tunnel. In the autumn, with less solar radiation, the amount of sugars in lettuce leaves was greater in the western zone. There was observable influence of the location in the tunnel from which samples were taken for analyses (zonal effect) on some physical parameters of the soil (bulk density, water capacity, and water-stability index).",

The study was conceived as a randomized block design with three replications and carried out during the 2017 growing season. On average, the irrigated plots produced 161.27 kg da–1 seed yield whereas it was 33.67 kg da–1 in non-irrigated plots. The highest yield among the commercial pumpkin varieties was obtained from the G2 hybrid variety in the irrigated conditions. On the other hand, in the non-irrigated plots, higher seed yields were obtained from G9, G34, and G36 pure lines. Drought resulted in a remarkable decrease in the total oil content and significant increase in the amount of Ca and Zn in pumpkin seeds. These results clearly indicated that G9 line, which has the highest seed yield in both irrigated and drought conditions, can be utilized as a recommendable parental pumpkin line in future hybrid breeding efforts.",

    "abstract": "The evergreen tree olive (Olea europaea L.) is the only species of the genus Olea that produces edible fruits with high ecological and economic value. This tree species has developed a series of physiochemical mechanisms to tolerate drought stress and grow under adverse climatic environments. One of these mechanisms is photosynthesis activities, so that as yet little information achieved about the relations between olive production and photosynthetic parameters under drought conditions. An experiment was carried out during two consecutive years (2015–2017) to study the response of 20 different olive tree cultivars (Olea europaea L.) to drought stress. Several parameters like net photosynthetic rate (PN), stomatal conductance (GS), transpiration rate (TE), photosynthetic pigments (total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a, b and carotenoid) and fruit yield were measured. The results of combined analysis of variance for fruit yield and other measured traits showed that year, drought treatment, cultivar main effects and their interactions were highly significant. The results indicated that drought stress reduced all traits, however GS (42.80%), PN (37.21%) and TE (37.17%) significantly affected by drought. Lower reduction in photosynthetic performance (PN, GS and TE) in the cultivar T7 compared to other olive cultivars allowed them to maintain better fruit yield. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified two PCs that accounted for 82.04 and 83.27% of the total variation in photosynthetic parameters under optimal and drought stress conditions, respectively. Taken together, mean comparison, relative changes due to drought and biplot analysis revealed that cultivars ‘T7’, ‘Roghani’, ‘Koroneiki’, ‘Korfolia’ and ‘Abou-satl’ displayed better response against drought stress. According to our results, one olive cultivar namely ‘T7’, could be used in olive breeding programs to improve new high yielding cultivars with drought tolerance for use in the drought-prone environments.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays sweet violet (Viola odorata) is an ornamental-medical plant that considered as endangered and threatened species. On the other hand, biotic and abiotic stresses impose a major threat to agriculture. Here, we investigated the effects of salinity and drought stresses, based on polyethylene glycol (PEG; 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 4%) and NaCl (0, 50, 100 and 150 mM), on growth characteristics, physiological parameters and antioxidant defense system of sweet violet under in-vitro conditions. The influences of NaCl and PEG gradients in the culture media on plant height, green leaf percentage, root dry weight (DW), and electrolyte leakage (EL) was described by a linear or quadratic model. All measured parameters (except EL) decreased when NaCl or PEG concentration increased. In contrast, EL increased other traits. Moreover, with increasing in salinity and drought severity, shoot DW decreased, while antioxidant enzymes activity such as catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and proline content increased. However, total soluble carbohydrates (TSC), at all drought levels, increased with increasing NaCl concentration up to 50 or 100 mM, and then decreased. Most variations in the shoot DW, CAT activity, proline and TSC contents due to salt stress occurred at low concentration of PEG. Overall, our findings highlight that the effect of combined drought and salt stress was more severe. However, the sensitivity of the plant to drought or salinity stress was higher in the absence of other stress.",

    "abstract": "Morels are well known due to their nutritional and food value since ancient human history. In this study, biochemical and proteomic analyses were carried out on the ascocarp of Morchella tridentina Bres. For this, several ascocarp of M. tridentina were collected from different sites of Neelum Valley Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. Identification was confirmed by phylogenetic sequencing using nuclear ribosomal DNA bar-coding technique along with morph-anatomical analysis. During the biochemical analysis, different bioactive compounds used in drugs to treat cancer, heart diseases, edema (veprisinium, visnagin, and bumetanide), and breast cancer (petunidin) were identified. Cerulinin, daidzein, guanthidin and okanin (imperative compounds) were also detected. Furthermore, protein analysis by FTICR/MS/Orbitrap revealed the presence of 921 proteins belonging to 171 protein groups having 165 unique peptide sequences. The study shows that this morel could be used as a source of bioactive substances to develop anticancer, antifungal, and antiviral drugs in the future. This fruitful addition of M. tridentina in Mycota of Pakistan increases the number of morels to three.",

    "abstract": "Daminozide (B-Nine) it is a plant growth regulator, is translocated from the leaves to the stem to avoid elongation and produce more compact plants and uniform growth and vigor. For the cultivation of Lisiathus the information of the damonizide application is scarce despite of great marketing potential, so the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of daminozide on the vegetative growth and flowering of Lisianthus grown in pot. Granulated Lisianthus seeds were germinated and transplanted into pots under nursery conditions. Three foliar applications of daminozide were realized; two applications in vegetative stage and one in flowering, adding three concentrations in each of them (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 ml L–1) were used and water was applied as a control during the vegetative and flowering phases. The applications of daminozide at 1.0 and 1.5 ml L–1 were optimal for the vegetative development in Lisianthus (plant height – 15 cm, size of the internodes – 2.5 cm, number of branches – 3, width and length of the leaves – 3 cm and 6.5 cm), while the dose of 0.5 ml L–1 was favorable for all flowering stages (beginning of flowering – 182 buttons, sepals closed and larger than the petals – 53), visible petals larger than the sepals – 25, floral opening and full flowering – 3 flowers per plant). Based on these results, the application of B-Nine at low concentrations (0.5 and 1 ml L–1) is recommended for the development of Lisianthus in pots.",

We investigated the influence of light (white and violet LEDs as well as fluorescent white and red light) on the rooting and growth of blueberry cuttings (V. corymbosum L.) 'Aurora' and 'Huron'. Blueberry cuttings (4 cm tall) were planted into boxes with peat, which were placed in a phytotron at 22 °C and illuminated for 16 hours a day. The plants died under the red fluorescent light source and, therefore, we discontinued its use. The other three light sources had a positive effect on plant growth and development. The light source had little effect on the content of macroelements in the leaves. Plants grown under white fluorescent and white LED light did not significantly differ in the height (22.0-25.8 cm), proline (4.67-7.23 μmol g-1), and polyphenol content (4987-5212 mg 100 g-1). In both cultivars, the violet LED light reduced plant growth and increased the content of polyphenols (6,448 mg 100 g-1) and proline (8.11-9.06 μmol g-1) in the leaves, which may indicate abiotic stress. &#x0D; During the rooting of highbush blueberry cuttings, it is advisable to use white LED light. It has a positive economic impact on crop production due to low electricity consumption and it benefits the environment by eliminating mercury.

At harvest, the severity of root diseases was low. During storage, carrot roots were susceptible to soft rot, Sclerotinia rot and dry rot. In the integrated farming system, the symptoms of mixed rot were more observed at harvest and after storage, and of dry rot after storage. In the organic farming system, the symptoms of dry rot were more noted at harvest, and the symptoms of crater rot were more observed after storage. During storage, the applied crop protection methods significantly suppressed mixed rot in the integrated farming system, and dry rot in the organic system. The isolation of potential pathogens from carrot petioles and roots confirmed their participation in the disease process.

The experiment was set up in a complete randomized four-replicate design with a plot area of 8 m2. Moreover, the content of essential oil in marjoram herb obtained from the control plants, as well as the composition of this oil were also studied. Marjoram emergence began 13–17 days after sowing, and it was very uneven and in some years it was extendend up to 5 weeks. Flaming (90 kg propane ∙ ha–1) was applied in two times: immediately after noticing the first marjoram emergence or 5 days later, while glufosinate-ammonium (600 g ∙ ha–1) was applied on the same date as the first flaming. The tested methods of weeding significantly reduced the number and fresh weight of weeds growing 3–4 weeks after the start of marjoram emergence, i.e. in the period of its greatest sensitivity to weed competition. They had no soil residual activity and their effect on weeds disappeared after the first weeding. Among weeds occurring in the experiment, only barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.) was partially tolerant to flaming. Flaming applied at the second time did not increase the effectiveness of weed control, but significantly decreased the number of emergence and the yield of marjoram herb. Essential oil content in marjoram grated herb varied considerably depending on the year, ranging from 1.35 to 2.34%. The oil contained from 33 to 36 identified compounds, among which trans-sabinene hydrate (28–34%) and terpinen-4-ol (17–21%) were clearly dominant.",

Three root chicory cultivars, Polanowicka, Orchies and Chrysolite, were grown in a plot experiment. Three levels of topsoil N fertilization were applied before sowing: 0, 80 and 120 kg ha–1. The severity of leaf diseases was estimated during the growing season. Root yield, agronomic and marginal N-use efficiency, DM content and macronutrient concentrations in roots were calculated after harvest (10–20 October). The symptoms of powdery mildew, gray mold and leaf spot on chicory leaves were significantly least severe in the unfertilized treatment. The highest yield (83 Mg ha–1) was obtained in 2017, in cv. Chrysolite without N fertilization. Root yield decreased in response to the application of N fertilizer at both rates. A minor increase in yield was observed only in cv. Polanowicka in N-fertilized treatments in 2017, and in cv. Chrysolite fertilized with 80 kg N ha–1 in 2018. Root yield was negatively correlated with disease severity during the growing season. The DM content of chicory roots (mean values for years of the study, cultivars and N rates) was similar in all treatments. N fertilization induced changes in the content of N, K, Mg and S in chicory roots of the analyzed cultivars. The application of N fertilizer had a beneficial influence on the N content of roots in all cultivars.",

When using bio-herbicides, crop production and quality improve with virtually no damage to the ecosystem. Bioherbicides are target-specific, destroy only selected weeds that have been sprayed for and do not cause harm to non-target plants. Bio-herbicides can be quickly incorporated into weed control programs, which can reduce chemical herbicide dependence. We are also raising the chance of environmental pollution by pesticides. There are only a few bio-herbicides available on commercial bases although work began earlier in the 1940s. Sources of commercialized bioherbicides include Phytophthora palmivora (Devine), Collectotrichum gleosporiodes (Collego), Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Binomial) and Streptomyces viridochromogenes (Bialaphos and Glufosinate). Virulence for pathogens and their environmental requirement are major constraints for bioherbicide development.

So far, there is no available information on micropropaga- tion of this beautiful species. Determination of the optimal sterilization methods as well as types and concentrations of plant growth regulators as medium constituents is one of the most important factors of successful micropropagation. With the aim of optimization of in vitro initiation and multiplication of C. radicans, the effect of different methods of disin- fection and terms of explants isolation on contamination rate of cultures as well as the in- fluence of cytokinins on growth and branching of shoots was studied. The cytokinins used in the experiments were: benzyladenine (BA), isopentenyl adenine (2-iP) and kinetin (KIN). The obtained results show that contamination rate is a very significant problem to overcome in order to initiate tissue cultures of C. radicans. The best results were observed when explants were excised in spring (May), shortly after the vegetation had started (88% contamination rate). Soaking initial the fragments in a mixture solution of Topsin M 500SC and streptomycine for 12 hours decreased the contamination rate of explants from 100 to 94%. The shoot tips are more suitable to establish the tissue culture of a trumpet creeper, in comparison to nodes with axillary buds. The multiplication rate after two subcultures was 2.6-3.7 for shoot tips (depending on the media) and 1.9-2.1 for nodes. The cytokinins used in the experiment had a significant influence on multiplication rate of C. radicans. The highest number of good quality shoots was obtained on the media supplemented with KIN in concentration of 2 mg�� dm -3 .",

Brassinosteroids, a relatively new group of plant growth regulators, have been found with interesting results on plant growth and development. This research was carried out to evaluate the role of brassinosteroids and gibberellins in development of fruit quality and occurrence of physiological disorders in ‘0900 Ziraat’ sweet cherry. Gibberellic acid (GA3) and 22S, 23S-homobrassinolide were applied with a sprayer at full bloom and at the beginning of fruit development for a 2-year period. GA3 was applied in concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mg l and 22S, 23S-homobrassinolide was applied in concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg l. A combined application of 100 mg l GA3 + 0.1 mg l -1 22S, 23S-homobrassinolide was also applied. Plant growth regulator applications mainly caused an increase in fruit weight and flesh to seed ration, and a decrease in fruit length. The effect was mainly due to gibberellin. Both Total soluble solids and titratable acidity were affected by the hormones and the seasons. Neither growth regulators had an influence on occurrence of the physiological disorders. They were at a lesser level in the second seasons.",

    "abstract": "In recent years there has been an increasing interest in lawns and their appear- ance. Diseases affecting lawns, of which the causative agents can be various pathogens, reduce their quality. The study was conducted in two urban centers in the region of south- eastern Poland - in the years 2006 and 2007 in Lublin and in 2007 in Zamośc, both in sunny and in partly shaded places. The species composition of the grass sward and the se- verity of leaf infection were determined as well as mycological analysis of infected plants was carried out. In the case of the lawns in Lublin, the mean values of the disease indices for the leaves of the investigated turfgrasses were from 53.75 to 83.00 in the spring of 2006, while in spring of 2007 from 6.75 to 29.00. The mean values of the leaf disease in- dices determined in autumn of 2006 were from 16.00 to 86.25, whereas in autumn of 2007 from 4.50 to 21.25. The mean values of the disease indices for leaves of the turfgrasses studied in Zamośc were from 24.50 to 48.25 in the spring of 2007, while in the autumn of that year they ranged from 28.00 to 54.75. Microdochium nivale was a great threat to turfgrasses in lawn culture in spring, whereas the cause of leaf spot of turfgrasses in the autumn were species B. sorokiniana and D. siccans. As far as the lawns in both cities are concerned, species of the genus Fusarium, in particular Fusarium culmorum, had a high percentage in root infection both in the spring and in the autumn.",

    "abstract": "In many countries, the traditional method of growing shallots from bulbs is re- placed by direct seeding in the field or by planting seedlings. The availability of shallot seed with high parameters of the sowing value is an important condition for growing shal- lot in larger areas. It is possible thanks to the progress in breeding and introduction into cultivation of new cultivars that produce seed stalks and seed. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the sowing value of seed of the true-breeding cultivar 'Toto', when this seed is obtained by planting steckling bulbs (bulb-to-seed method) and by using the seed-to-seed method. This study, conducted in the period 2010-2012, was to evaluate some important characteristics of the seed quality obtained by planting different diameter bulbs (20-60 mm, 4 fractions every 10 mm) in autumn and spring and from seedlings planted in summer (third 10-day period of July and first and third 10-day period August). The quality of shallot seed was evaluated taking into account the following pa- rameters: 1000 seed weight (TSW), germination energy and capacity as well as vigour tests (seedling growth test and seedling growth rate test). Shallot cultivation method had a large effect on 1000 seed weight, but it only slightly affected germination capacity and vigour of seed obtained. Larger seeds were obtained from bulbs, regardless of their plant- ing time, compared to the cultivation method involving planting seedlings in summer. The diameter of bulbs used for planting at autumn planting time proved to be an important fac- tor for TSW, germination energy and the traits determining seed vigour. In the case of this planting time, seed obtained from large bulbs with a diameter of 40-60 mm was distin- guished by the best quality. The study did not show such a correlation for seed derived from spring bulb planting.",

In this study, it was aimed to determine the morphological and pomological characteristics and phytochemical contents of the superior F1 strawberry genotypes selected after hybridization with the local Osmanli strawberry under the ecological conditions of Bilecik province. Morphological and pomological analyzes were made and the best ten genotypes were selected according to the weighted grading method. According to this, the titratable acidity amount of the selected genotypes was determined between 0.28–0.51, the total soluble solid amount was determined between 5–10.5%, and the pH amount was determined between 3.3–3.78. By looking at the average fruit weight, fruit width and fruit length values, genotypes that can compete with commercial cultivars were selected and these were determined as table genotypes. While the total phenolic content of the ten genotypes selected by phytochemical analyzes was found between 2675.56–3983.89 μg GAE/g TA, the total amount of anthocyanin was determined between 156.19–39.12 μg Plg-3-glu/gta.

A factorial experiment based on completely randomized design with 20 treatments in 3 replications, 60 plots and 5 plants per plot were conducted in order to investigate the effect of amino acids on growth, nutritional parameters and antioxidant capacity in African marigold. Experimental treatments included two cultivars of African marigold (‘Yellow’ and ‘Orange’) and foliar application of three amino acids (arginine, glutamine and proline) each one at three levels (100, 500 and 1000 μM). Distilled water was used as control. The results showed that the application of amino acids increased plant height, display life, fresh weight and dry matter of flower, leaf total chlorophyll and petal carotenoid compared to the control in both African marigold cultivars. Petal protein content and malondialdehyde (MDA) were not affected by the above treatments, but the use of amino acids, especially arginine and proline, increased proline and calcium, zinc and iron in the petals of both African marigold cultivars. Treatments of 100 μM arginine and 1000 μM proline induced the highest vitamin C in both African marigold cultivars. In ‘Orange’ cultivar, the highest enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) belonged to 1000 μM proline and the highest peroxidase (POD) activity belonged to two treatments of 100 μM arginine and 1000 μM proline. In ‘Yellow’ cultivar, all three levels of arginine and proline together with 1000 μM glutamine significantly increased SOD and POD activity compared to other treatments. Also, the highest APX enzyme activity was recorded for 100 μM arginine. The results of the present study showed that external application of amino acids, especially arginine and proline, improved the nutritional properties of both African marigold cultivars by increasing the activity of antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "Rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri Lush.) – RL, is used as a rootstock for citrus plants in saline conditions. NaCl causes an osmotic stress on plants mainly preventing the water uptake by the roots and thus reducing the plant growth. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of salicylic acid (SA) on germination of seeds and the growth and development of seedlings of RL rootstock under salt stress. For seed germination, a study was conducted in a completely randomized design in a 4 × 4 factorial scheme (SA at 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, or 1.00 mM and NaCl at 0, 50, 100, or 200 mM) with 4 repetitions, totaling 64 plots, of 25 seeds per plot. RL seeds were incubated in SA solutions for 24 h. Then, they were treated with NaCl-containing water in Petri dishes and incubated in the growth chamber at 25°C. For greenhouse experiment, a study was conducted in a randomized complete block in a 4 × 4 factorial scheme (SA at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mM and NaCl at 0, 50, 100, or 150 mM) with 3 repetitions, totaling 48 plots, of 2 plants per plot. Some morphological and physiological characteristics were determined. While germination time was extended, germination ratio and radicle extension were decreased in seeds under salt stress compared to control. Moreover, in these conditions the leaf membrane permeability and leaf falling were increased. In turn, plant height, diameter, root and shoot dry weight, leaf relative water content, and leaf chlorophyll were decreased in seedlings. Salt stress had negatively affected seed germination from 97.5% in control to 23.5% in 200 mM NaCl. However, SA treatments significantly decreased plant height to 67.8 cm in 2.0 mM compared to 80.1 cm in control in RL rootstock.",

The low percentage of germinating seeds largely limits its generative reproduction. The germination tests confirmed deep dormancy of the Iris aphylla seeds. The dormancy was disrupted by isolation of embryos from seeds, which were further cultivated in vitro. The germination of isolated embryos proved the localization of endogenous inhibitors of germinating seeds of I. aphylla in the endosperm. The comparison of phytohormonal profiles of seeds, endosperm and embryos of I. aphylla and Iris sibirica, i.e. a species with a high percentage of germinating seed, revealed that the deep dormancy of I. aphylla seeds was associated with the balance between abscisic acid and gibberellins (ABA/GA), a significant predominance of ABA and a massive accumulation of salicylic acid. Isolation of embryos from seeds and their germination in growing medium in vitro is recommended as the most efficient method for I. aphylla propagation. Results of this study can be applied in conservation efforts of this attractive and important native species.",

Therefore, breeding programs are necessary for developing new varieties with various fruit quality and sensory traits. The present study evaluated morphological and fruit-quality attributes of thirty-seven apricot genotypes selected from several Iranian and Italian open-pollinated cultivars together with Shahroudi cultivar (control) during two growing seasons (2019–2020) using the UPOV descriptor and GT-biplot analysis. The results showed great variability in fruit size among all apricot genotypes studied. Most genotypes showed medium-sized fruits while large and small fruits were observed in eight and four genotypes, respectively. The highest yield was recorded in G-464, G-432, G-588, Shahroudi and G-571. Genotypes G-432, G-464, G-571, G-573, and G-576 had higher fruit weight than Shahroudi. In addition, G-450 and G-553 had the highest TSS (18.2°Brix) and TSS/TA (25.4), respectively. The GT-biplot analysis revealed that fruit weight and dimensions along with pH and TSS could be indicators for selecting superior genotypes. According to the present study, G-464, G-571 and G-450 can be introduced as superior genotypes and it is expected that the inter-crossing of these three have the potential to produce cultivars with sweet fruit, high yield and large fruit size.",

However, plant uptake of NPs may lead to disruptions in physiological and metabolic processes, particularly when the plant’s defense mechanisms are overwhelmed. In this study, sweet pepper seedlings were exposed to TiO2-NPs via foliar (2.5% suspension) and root (0.5% suspension) methods, with plants treated with distilled water serving as controls. Results showed that foliar application caused higher accumulation of Ti in leaves as compared to stems, while root exposure led to a higher increase of Ti content in stems than in leaves. Additionally, foliar application led to alterations in chemical composition of the plants, including changes in malondialdehyde (MDA), L-ascorbic acid, total phenolics content, carotenoids, in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and antioxidant enzymes activity. Root exposure also affected enzyme activity and TAC, but also altered H2O2, MDA and glutathione content. Chlorophylls remained at stable level in the leaves of the seedlings. Overall, these studies provide important information on plant-nanoparticle interactions and the potential effects of different nanoparticle application strategies. These data indicate also that the specific nanoparticles, applied at a controlled manner, have potential to boost the plant metabolism and improve stress tolerance, which is an important factor affecting crops’ quality and productivity.",

The research was conducted in an experimental orchard and a greenhouse of the National Institute of Horticultural Research in Skierniewice, Poland, in 2017–2019 (2 cycles of obtaining planting material and growing plants). The tray plants (rooted tips) were grown in the natural field conditions until they were transferred in batches to a cold store (–2°C) on five different dates: 12 Oct., 30 Oct., 20 Nov., 11 Dec., and 3 Jan. (of the following year). The number of accumulated chilling hours less than 7°C was recorded for each transfer date, and the roots were analysed for starch content at the time of transfer. After the end of cold storage (3 months, standardised for all treatments), the plants were planted in pots and transferred to a greenhouse to assess growth and plant yielding. The obtained results indicate that chilling induces changes in the extent of starch accumulation. The highest starch accumulation in ‘Sonata’ roots was recorded when the plants received about 500 h of chilling (under Polish conditions accumulated in November/December). In the ‘Albion’ strawberry case, the maximum was found at the lower chilling level – about 300 h (middle of November). The highest fruit yields were produced by ‘Sonata’ plants, for which the number of chilling hours (0–7°C) was 500–800 h. In the case of ‘Albion’, the values were 2–3 times lower. A more extended period of keeping tray plants in field conditions (over 1000 h of chilling) resulted in a deterioration in fruit yield.",

    "abstract": "The species Eutypa lata is one of the most critical phytopathogenic fungi that presents a threat to vineyards by causing significant economic damage. This grapevine disease is hazardous because there is no adequate chemical protection, so after its progression, there is a decrease in yield and dieback of parts or whole infected shoots. There are also no grapevine cultivars resistant to this disease. For these reasons, in this paper, testing of the susceptibility of a pair of grapevine cultivars to this disease was carried out. The testing was performed under semicontrolled conditions and included six of the most economically essential grapevine cultivars in Serbia (Riesling italico, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cardinal, Rkaziteli, Pinot noir, and Prokupac). Testing was performed using 14 isolates of E. lata isolated in Serbia and two control isolates obtained from the INRA. For specific detection of isolates of Eutypa spp. included in the experiment, a specific pair of primers, Lata 1/Lata 2.2, was applied, and an amplicon of the expected size of approximately 385 bp was established in all isolates. In the conditions of the set experiment, of all of the domestic and foreign-tested grapevine cultivars, the local cultivar Prokupac showed greater resistance to the isolates. In contrast, the cultivars Riesling italico, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cardinal, Pinot noir showed sensitivity to the isolates of E. lata, but not to the same extent as the cultivar Rkaziteli, which proved to be susceptible.",

    "abstract": "The study was repeated for two years to reduce the effects of water scarcity and drought stress in lettuce cultivation. The irrigation problem was created by applying 25% (I25), 50% (I50), 75% (I75) and 100% (I100) of the evaporation amounts formed in the class-A evaporation vessel. Si0 (0 kg ha–1), Si40 (40 kg ha–1), Si80 (80 kg ha–1) and Si120 (120 kg ha–1) silicon fertilisation was applied at four different doses. Head length, head diameter, head weight, root length, and leaf fresh and dry weight were measured in harvested plants. According to the data of 2020–2021, the best results in the effect of different doses of Si applications on plant head height, head diameter, head weight and root length at different irrigation levels were recorded from I75 × Si80, I75 × Si120, I100 × Si80, I100 × Si120 applications with the same severity level. While the Si40 dose gave good results at I75 and I100 irrigation levels, its effect decreased at I25 and I50 irrigation levels. At different irrigation levels where different doses of silicon were applied, I25 irrigation had the lowest leaf chlorophyll and relative moisture content and the most severe membrane damage, while I50 irrigation had a moderate effect. Leaf chlorophyll and moisture content increased, and membrane damage decreased in I75 × 80 kg ha–1 Si, I75 × 120 kg ha–1 Si, I100 × 80 kg ha–1 Si and I100 × 120 kg ha–1 Si applications. As a result, when the effects of the applications covering two years on plant growth and yield were evaluated, the most successful irrigation levels were determined as I75, I100, and the most successful silicon doses; were determined as 80 kg ha–1 and 120 kg ha–1.",

    "abstract": "Grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) are highly valuable crops enriched with minerals, vitamins, phenolics, and antioxidants required for daily human activities and to prevent cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The objective of this study was to elucidate the physicochemical and mineral evaluation of seven neglected local grape cultivars (‘Kishmish’, ‘Sra Kishmish’, ‘Askari’, ‘Sahibi’, ‘Haita’, ‘Sundar Khani’ and ‘Toran’) growing in Baluchistan, as it can help in future breeding, processing, and species conservation. Therefore, these cultivars were evaluated for different physical, biochemical, and availability of macro– and micro–mineral contents. In physical evaluation, the local cultivar ‘Haita’ showed maximum bunch length (19.72 cm) and bunch width (11.88 cm), while the highest bunch weight (527.33 g) was recorded in ‘Sahibi’. Similarly, significant differences were noted in biochemical traits, and maximum total soluble solids (24.76%) and titratable acidity (1.58%) were observed in ‘Sundar Khani’, while the highest vitamin C (26.17 mg 100 g–1), total sugars (30.26%) in Sundar Khani, and nonreducing sugars (8.79%) were recorded in ‘Haita’. The cultivars growing in Balochistan also showed variations in phenolics (113.79–346.50 mg GAE L–1) and antioxidants (85.77– 90.87%). Likewise, the concentrations of macro- and microelements were also highly variable in these cultivars. Overall, among these cultivars, ‘Toran’ performed better in the agroclimatic conditions of Balochistan, as it has high yield attributes such as berry length, width, and weight. Moreover, it was also enriched with total soluble solids, antioxidants, and calcium contents.",

The impact of hydro-alcoholic extracts of Calendula officinalis, Salvia officinalis, Tagetes sp., and Taraxacum officinale on growth and root development of plants of five strawberry cultivars (‘Albion’, ‘Florence’, ‘Magnum’, ‘Rumba’, and ‘San Andreas’) grown in semi-field controlled conditions was tested in the present study. The vigor and growth of the five strawberry genotypes were significantly affected by the extracts, with cv. Florence consistently producing more biomass than any other variety compared to the untreated control. The extracts also impacted the root system differently depending on the specific genotype. However, the C. officinalis flower extract consistently improved the root architecture, increasing the value of five out of six parameters compared to the control. The genotype-related response points to the strong influence of the “variety factor” on the possible effect of plant extracts considered for biostimulation, plant protection purposes, or both, prompting the need for additional work to unravel the bottlenecks in using botanicals.",

Biochars obtained from two different biomasses, rice husk (RBC) and tomato harvest waste (TBC), were applied at a dose of 2% to the growing medium consisting of a 1 : 1 soil and peat mixture. No biochar-added medium (1 : 1 soil and peat) was used as a control. The experiment was established in a completely randomized design with six replications for each treatment. At the end of the study, the height, number of lateral branches, total herb weight, and leaf weight of the plants were measured. In addition, chlorophyll contents in SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development), different nutrients and total phenolics contents, and antioxidant activities were analyzed. As a result of the study, the effects of biochar treatments differed depending on the biomass source. RBC significantly increased plant height, total herb weight, and leaf weight while negatively affecting the number of lateral branches. TCB did not cause any significant variation in plant height and number of lateral branches. While RBC provided a slight increase in leaf weight compared to the control, it did not cause a significant change in plant height, total herb weight, and the number of lateral branches. Except for a slight increase in K content due to RBC application, both biochar treatments did not cause a significant increase in leaf nutrient content. While RBC treatment did not cause a significant change in total phenol, it caused an increase in antioxidant activity. TBC application decreased the SPAD value from 22.4 in the control to 20.4.",

    "abstract": "The use of cover crops is aimed at sustaining soil health and productivity in the context of agricultural intensification and accompanying soil degradation. While cover crops have been extensively studied in field production systems, limited research has been conducted concerning their application in high-tunnel vegetable production. This study aimed to assess the effects of turnip (Brassica napus subsp. napobrassica (L.) Jafri) and swede Brassica rapa subsp. Rapifera Metzg) cover crops (CCs) on soil physicochemical and biological properties in an organic high tunnel system in southern Poland in 2017–2019. The planting sequence was as follows: winter cover crops/pumpkin/romaine lettuce/broad bean/chilli pepper. Soil analyses included measurements of bulk density, water capacity, soil aggregation, soil organic carbon (SOC), available soil nutrients, as well as microbial abundance and diversity. Rape crops produced a higher aboveground dry biomass (4.11 t ha−1) than swede (2.85 t ha−1), and the N content in their biomass was 101 kg N ha−1 and 75 kg N ha−1, respectively. The results presented that CC residue significantly contributed to soil organic carbon stock, retention of plant-available nitrogen, and improvement of soil physical properties, especially wet aggregate stability. Soils with the highest SOC concentrations were associated with the highest bacterial and fungal abundance. The most significant number of mesophilic bacteria was detected in the soil where turnip was grown as a cover crop (7.6 × 107 cfu g−1 DM soil). Moreover, a higher abundance of the tested nitrogen cycle bacteria was found in the soils after CC cultivation compared to the control soils, particularly bacteria reducing NH4 +-N and NO₃⁻-N. These findings highlight the importance of cover crop management practices in high tunnels, as they influence the composition of the total bacterial community and the abundance of N-cycling microbial guilds.",

This study aimed to examine the water deficit stress and foliar application with anti-stress compounds (ASC) on characteristics of Viola odorata. The study was carried out as a factorial experiment based on a randomized complete design. The factors consisted of water deficit and the foliar application of ASC at six levels [zinc-nano oxide (ZnO, 1000 and 1500 mg l–1), salicylic acid (SA, 200 and 300 mg l–1), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 200 and 300 μM)], and the control. The water deficit reduced the leaf water potential, cell membrane stability, and the shoot and root fresh weight but increased electrolyte leakage and soluble sugar accumulation. However, foliar applications, particularly SA and SNP, positively affected the measured parameters. The activities of superoxide dismutase and guaiacol peroxidase at all three field capacity levels were higher in the plants treated with SA and SNP than in the control and plants treated with ZnO. In sum, using 200 mg l–1 of SA as a foliar application, in addition to improvement of the growth and developmental conditions of the aromatic violet plant, moderated the adverse effects of water deficit stress and increased the plant resistance to water deficit stress. Based on the results, the application of SA, SNP, and ZnO reduced electrolyte leakage and enhanced the plant’s resistance to water deficit by increasing the compatible osmolyte accumulation and antioxidant enzyme activity.",

The growth of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H. Chou, commonly known as Suanzao in Chinese, is significantly influenced by environmental factors, particularly drought and salt stresses. In this study, we isolated and characterized a putative ABA receptor, ZjPYL8, from Sour jujube. To investigate the effects of ZjPYL8 overexpression on ABA-responsive pathways, we introduced it into Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) and examined the resulting phenotypes. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of ZjPYL8 in A. thaliana led to a significant reduction in stomatal aperture and root length under ABA treatment, while the wild type (WT) was relatively insensitive to ABA. Moreover, ZjPYL8 transgenic plants exhibited shorter roots under salt treatment than the WT did. These findings suggest that the overexpression of ZjPYL8 in A. thaliana enhances the plant's resistance to stress and support the hypothesis that ZjPYL8 serves as a putative ABA receptor in Sour jujube, which may improve the plant's adaptability to drought and salt stresses. ZjPYL8 appears to mediate plant responses to ABA, similar to most ABA receptors in A. thaliana, such as stomatal closure and root length.",

The study was carried out using a factorial design in a randomized complete block design arrangement with three replications during the crop year of 2019–2020. The first factor includes the use of biological fertilizers (fungi and bacteria) at four levels: 1) control (without the use of biological fertilizers), 2) mycorrhizal fungi, 3) growth-promoting bacteria, 4) combined use of growth-promoting bacteria and fungi. The second factor includes mulch (plant residues) at four levels: 1) control, 2) wheat straw (3 t/ha), 3) berseem clover mulch (2 t/ha), 4) living berseem clover mulch, cultivated among the rows of anise. Cultivation of clover and anise was done simultaneously. Results showed that the combined use of biological fertilizers (Glomus intraradices and Pseudomonas putida) along with living clover mulch led to a significant increase in seed yield, harvest index, and the essential oil yield of anise. Moreover, under such conditions, the highest seed yield (930.8 kg/ha) and the highest essential oil yield (18.15 kg/ha) increased by 48% and 51% compared to the control, respectively. We found that the use of living clover mulch led to a significant increase in biological yield, seed yield, and the number of umbels and umbellets of anise. Accordingly, the highest biological yield of 5332 kg/ha was obtained, which was 55% higher than the control. The extraction of essential oil components showed that α-pinene and para-cymene showed the highest amount and significant components of essential oil. Moreover, the maximum amount of α-pinene (2.277%) observed upon fungi and living clover applica­tion along with inter-row clover cultivation (increased by 60% compared to the control), and the maximum value of para-cymene (0.2300%) was obtained upon bacteria and living clover inoculation along with inter-row clover culti­vation (increased by 59% compared to the control). Finally, according to the perspectives of sustainable and organic agriculture in medicinal plant cultivation, the use of ecologically compatible inputs such as bacteria and fungi that stabilize food elements, as well as the use of living and non-living plant mulches, can be used as a tool to increase the quantitative and qualitative performance of the anise plant.",

The study aimed to evaluate the protein, fat, fibre and amino acids content of the seeds of two soya bean varieties sown at different row spacings under organic and conventional growing conditions. The study showed that the conventional method of production has a more favourable effect on the soya bean’s protein content and the most amino acids, primarily essential amino acids. In organic cultivation, soya bean seeds were characterised by a higher content of fat and sulphur amino acids (methionine and cysteine). The research carried out indicates that the seeds of the Aldana variety, compared to the Merlin variety, have greater nutritional importance to humans due to a higher content of protein and almost all amino acids, including essential amino acids. Only a higher content of seed fat and tryptophan was evidenced in the Merlin variety. Row spacing did not significantly differentiate the assessed soya bean seed quality parameters. Only the amount of methionine was significantly higher when soya beans were grown at a narrower row spacing (22.5 cm).",

The effect of two types of flat covers, perforated PE film and non-woven PP fabric, on the yield and quality of arugula was determined in the study. A two-factorial experiment was conducted in 2006-2008 in the Experimental Garden of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn. The first experimental factor was plant species - Diplo- taxis tenuifolia and Eruca sativa. The second factor was the type of plant cover - perfo- rated PE film with 100 openings per m 2 and non-woven PP fabric with surface density of 17 g·m -2 . Plants grown without protective cover served as control. Arugula was grown on proper black earth soil of quality class IIIb and cereal-fodder strong complex. Each year, seeds were sown in the middle of April. After planting out in the field, the seedlings were covered with PE film and non-woven PP fabric. The covers were removed after approxi- mately five weeks. Leaves were harvested gradually over the growing season, one to three times from each treatment. The use of PE film and non-woven PP fabric covers had a sig- nificant effect on the total and marketable yield of arugula leaves. In 2006-2008, the highest average total yield was obtained from plots covered with perforated PE film. The marketable yield had a higher share of the total yield in Diplotaxis tenuifolia and in plots covered with perforated PE film, compared with control plots and plots covered with non- woven PP fabric. The rosettes of Diplotaxis tenuifolia consisted of a higher number of leaves, while Eruca sativa had longer leaves and higher rosette biomass.",

Nowadays we have still too little informations about nutritional and fertilization need of that plant. Experiments involving eggplant of Epic F1 cv. were carried out in 2004- -2005 in unheated foil tunnel; the aim focused on evaluating the influence of pruning methods using plants treated with nitrogen in form of N-NH4, N-NO3, NH2 applied at various rates. Achieved results revealed significantly influence of nitrogen forms on total nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium, while no influence on potassium and magnesium con- tents in eggplant leaves. Instead, increasing nitrogen doses significantly elevated the ni- trogen, phosphorus, and magnesium concentrations in plants.

    "abstract": "One of the factors, determining early bearing of peach trees is planting them in high density. But it is difficult, because of the use of generative, strong growing rootstock. However the intensive growth of peach trees can be modified by planting in ridges and changing the shape of crown. The experiment was conducted in conditions of Lower Sile- sia Region. The experiment involved the assessment of trees on Manchurian peach root- stock, of 'Suncrest' and 'Cresthaven' cultivars, planted in the spring 2006, in: 3.5 × 1 m spacing (vertical axis) 3.75 × 2 m (spindel crown) and 4.25 × 3 m (open vase crown). Half of the trees following 3.5 × 1 m spacing were planted in a traditional way, while half of them, in ridges. The aim of research was determination of possibilities regarding the maintenance of the peach orchard on a seedling rootstock, with the use of a vertical axis crown form and the way of planting trees in ridges, as compared to trees planted tradition- ally and trained as spindle and an open vase crown. Summary yields from the first three years of yielding point to the possibility of obtaining high yield of peaches at dense trees planting in comparison to traditional model of peach orchard. The lowest yielding level characterized trees of both examined varieties planted in 4.25 × 3 m spacing and trained in the form of an open vase crown. The most intensive growth featured the trees trained in the form of an open vase crown and planted in 4.25 × 3 m spacing. Planting in ridges did not cause any significant diversity regarding peaches growth and yielding in high density of trees trained as vertical axis.",

The research analysed the occurrence of anthocyanins and carotenoids in ray florets and chlorophylls in leaves in Chrysanthemum × grandiflorum /Ramat./Kitam., 'Baton Rouge' grown in the glasshouse over 2010-2011. The plants were exposed only to short day in- duced by darkening, applying no supplementary lighting of the plants. From the ray floret tissues carotenoids were extracted using concentrated acetone and anthocyanins with 1% HCl in methanol, whereas to extract chlorophylls a and b from leaf explants, concentrated acetone was used. The samples with extracted pigments were exposed to studies applying the spectrophotometer UV-VIS 1601-PC at the wavelength corresponding to the maxi- mum of the band of a given pigment. For carotenoids the wavelength was λ = 440 nm, for anthocyanins: λ = 530 nm, whereas for chlorophylls: λ = 645 and 663 nm. There was also defined the colour of ray florets and leaves applying the RHSCC Colour Chart (1966). It was found that the date of plant planting, and thus their flowering, affects the concentra- tion of pigments: anthocyanins and carotenoids in ray florets and chlorophylls in leaves and, as a result, also their colour. The highest concentration of anthocyanins was reported in the plants planted into pots on 1.12., 1.01 and on 1.07., carotenoids in the growing cy- cles launched on 1.11., 1.12., 1.01, 1.03, 1.07 and 1.08., while chlorophylls a and b - on 1.03.",

The first experiment included a comparison of different tempera- tures between day and night (DIF-5 - 20/25°C, DIF0 - 20°C and 25°C, DIF+5 - 25/20°C) for a 16-h photoperiod.

Significant differences between DIF+5 and DIF-5 were observed in the case of plant height. Elongation growth was en- hanced by positive DIF and was inhibited by negative DIF, although the strongest stem elongation inhibition was recorded at the temperature of 25°C and a 16-h photoperiod. Leaf area was greatly affected by the temperature and DIF, but only slightly influenced by the photoperiod. Leaf area in DIF-5 was smaller than that in DIF+5 or 0 (20°C). The highest essential oil content in the herbage was recorded for a constant temperature of 25°C as well as 20°C and a 24-hour photoperiod.",

The observations of the health status of the leaves were carried out on marked trees for two years. The pathogen was identified based on the mate- rial obtained from laboratory cultures. The tannin content, expressed as (+)-catechin, was determined using the vanillin method. The greatest extent of disease development was ob- served at the end of July. It has been found that with disease symptoms covering > 25% of the leaf area, the (+)-catechin content in the diseased leaves was significantly higher com- pared to the healthy ones.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the dynamics of the Corylus pollen seasons over a 10-year study period (2001-2010). The study was carried out in Lublin by the volumet- ric method that is currently used in aerobiology. Years of abundant pollen production by this taxon were determined, as well as the period of maximum pollen release in each year, which is associated with the availability of large amounts of pollen to bees. Thermal con- ditions accompanying the beginning of pollen shed and the conditions prevailing during abundant pollen shed were presented. In particular years, the start of the Corylus pollen seasons was recorded between 9 January and 25 March, with an average temperature of 4.1°C. The duration of the pollen season varied between 19 and 78 days. Years of the highest hazel pollen production were as follows: 2006, 2010, 2007, and 2005. The period of pollen abundance, associated with the presence of high Corylus pollen content in the air, was recorded most frequently in the second half of March and at the beginning of April, with the average temperature between 2.4 and 14.4°C, with the 10-year mean value of 8.1°C. At the temperature of 8°C, the honey bee undertakes its first foraging trips, among others, to search for water and collect pollen. The present study showed that the nitrogen content in Corylus pollen grains was 4.82%, while the protein content 30.13%, which demonstrates the significant nutritional value of this pollen.",

    "abstract": "The method of tillage is one of the major factors determining the yield of root plants. Today we witness the degradation of soil on large cultivated lands. It is a result i.a. of more frequent tillage practices, and the omission of cover crops. The destruction of aggregate structures of the soil and the lowering of its organic matter content cause that conditions for growth and yields of the main crops are becoming worse. Field experiments were conducted in the years 2006-2008 on grey-brown podzolic soil with impermanent structure. The test plant was the rooted chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum Bisch.) of the 'Polanowicka' cultivar. This species has an important economical meaning, providing precious raw materials for inulin production. The experiments included: two kinds of pre- sowing tillage: a) a complex of pre-sowing tillage and sowing of cover crops (2 nd decade of August) and pre-winter ploughing and mixing the green mass with soil, b) a complex of pre-sowing tillage and sowing of cover crops (2 nd decade of August), leave them in the field during the winter and ploughing the plant mass in spring; two types of plant grow- ing: in ridges or in flat soil; three cover crops: common vetch, tansy phacelia and oats. Beneficial influence of mulching the soil with tansy phacelia on the total chicory root yield, compared with unmulched plots was observed. The highest content of inulin was found in chicory roots collected from plots mulched with common vetch. It was signifi- cantly higher than its content in roots coming from the plots mulched with oats. When the productivity of inulin per unit of area is taken into account, the most beneficial tillage combination was the tillage of chicory in ridges, after spring ploughing, mixing the mulch of common vetch with the soil. Both the cultivation of the plant in ridges and ploughed vetch affected the yield significantly. The factors of the experiment had no significant in- fluence on the content of dry matter and protein in the roots of chicory.",

The experiments conducted with lettuce of the Omega F1 variety aimed at an analysis of differentiated methods of nitrogen and calcium carbonate fertilization on the general crop yield and its biological value. After the plants were collected, the fresh weight of the plants, the dry mass, the vitamin C content, extract and protein contents were measured. After the vegetation period of plants samples of me- dium were collected and, with use of 0.03 M extract of acetic acid, the contents of mineral nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium were determined, as well as the pH and EC values of the medium measured. The crop yield of fresh leaves mass was significantly de- pendent on the used dose of nitrogen and calcium carbonate. The largest lettuce crop yield was recorded in objects fertilized with 0.4 g · dm -3 of nitrogen and the higher dose of cal- cium carbonate (283 g·plant -1 ). The vitamin C, extract and protein contents were depend- ent on the dose of nitrogen. The largest quantity of vitamin C characterized the lettuce plants fertilized with the largest dose of nitrogen and the higher dose of calcium carbonate (33.7 mg·100 g -1 fr. m.). The application of calcium carbonate in 14 g · dm -3 causes the calcium content of the medium to rise. The EC value of the medium was largely arisen under the influence of the mineral nitrogen and varied between 1.33 and 1.96 mS·cm -1 .",

The positive influence of scorzonera cultivation on ridges on dry matter content in roots was recorded. Diverse till- age systems and plant foliar nutrition had no significant effects on inulin content in scor- zonera roots; however the increasing tendency of the component concentration at plants cultivated on ridges after shallow spring tillage procedures, was observed.

Three weeks delaying of first weeding caused a significant decrease of these yields but it did not affect the breadth of green pods nor the weight of 1000 dry bean seeds.",

For several years, the disease symptoms described in the article have led to the loss of decorative val- ues of these trees. The study was conducted in the years 2002 and 2003 by means of the control of plant healthfulness, phytopathological diagnostics, isolation of microorganisms from tissues exhibiting diseases symptoms, as well as the culture and identification of the isolated fungi. Both, the control of tree healthfulness, and specialized laboratory tech- niques proved that the symptoms diagnosed in plants had an infectious character, and that the fungi might be the main causing agents. The analysis of the fungal populations iso- lated from the affected tissues indicates the combined occurrence of fungi in tissues of the studied plants and the domination of the following species: Alternaria consortiale, Aure- obasidium pullulans, Penicillium canescens, Phoma pomorum, Ulocladium consortiale, Zythiostroma pinastri.",

    "abstract": "Narcissus, belonging to Amaryllidaceae family, is one of the emerging cut flower in ornamental industry. Appropriate cut flower packaging for ideal time period provides potential benefit of improving their post-harvest quality of flower. Current research was conducted with an objective to find out best suitable packaging materials and optimum storage duration for cut flowers of narcissus. Narcissus postharvest features were analyzed statistically and results showed significant difference among the treatments with respect to packaging material as well as storage duration. In our findings, polyethylene sleeve showed best results in most of postharvest parameters (vase life, total life, dry weight, and change in fresh weight). In our results, 2 hours duration of storage significantly improved the post-harvest parameters of cut Narcissus. Vase life, fresh and dry weight of flower obtained maximum value in two hours storage duration. It was interesting to note that as storage duration increased, post-harvest characters reduced. In conclusion, postharvest quality of cut Narcissus can be improved significantly by using suitable packaging material and optimizing storage duration.",

Especially interesting are the ones, in which compounds of natural origin are used. One of such groups is ethe- real oils from plants. The commercial seed samples of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. 'Dumka') were soaked in 9 different treatments of 5% alcoholic solution of camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora L.) ethereal oil and 9 different treatments of 5% alcoholic solu- tion of patchouli plant (Pogostemon cablin Benth.) ethereal oil. Then the seeds were rou- tinely tested for seed germination, the length of the received seedlings was also measured and the seeds health status was evaluated. The tested ethereal oils had no effect on the germination of lettuce seeds. However, soaking the seeds in the ethereal oils solutions did decrease the percentage of dead seeds in the tested samples. Soaking of the seeds in the ethereal oils solutions also increased the percentage of healthy ungerminated seeds. Treat- ing the seeds with the concentrations of the ethereal oils solutions, although had no effect on their germination, still shortened the length of seedlings. Moreover, the used ethereal oils lowered the amount of identified Alternaria alternata and Cladosporium sphaeros- permum fungi on the seeds.",

The subject of the studies was the rhizosphere soil of these plant species. The experiment of each plant included 2 combinations, i.e. with dressing the seeds with Zaprawa Oxafun T and without dressing the seeds (control). Results of the microbiological analysis of the rhizosphere soil of runner bean and soybean showed that the plants grown of the seeds dressed with Zaprawa Oxafun T always gave a greater number of bacteria colonies, Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. but a smaller number of fungi colonies than in the control combination. In comparison to the rhizos- phere soil of soybean, the rhizosphere soil of runner bean contained much more bacteria and a much lower number of fungi colonies. Among the obtained saprotrophic macroorganisms, a more numerous group of antagonis- tic bacteria and fungi was achieved from the rhizosphere soil of runner bean than from the rhizosphere soil of soybean. Whatever the plant species, considerably more antagonistic bacteria and fungi occurred in the combination with Zaprawa Oxafun T as compared to the control. The plant species as well as the introduction of Zaprawa Oxafun T into the soil together with the seeds had a considerable influence on the quantitative and qualitative composi- tion of the populations of soil microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the amounts of nutrient elements taken up from the soil to the roots, stems and leaves, in five different growing periods and to the fruits in the harvesting period, in two different strawberry cultivars. For this purpose, ten plantations were selected for each cultivar. The roots, stems and leaves were separated and the amounts of nutrient elements taken up by each part was determined according to the development period. In this study, which was conducted over two years, the physico-chemical characteristics of the soils of the plantations from which the samples taken were determined. In both cultivars, the largest amounts of the macronutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium and of the micronutrient manganese were taken up at all phenological stages by the leaves, followed by the roots and stems. The amounts of potassium that taken up were as follows in the order of most to least: at the beginning and in the harvest period, leaves, stems and roots; in other periods, leaves, roots and stems. For the nutrient elements iron, copper and zinc, this comparison showed variation between parts of the plants according to year, variety and period. In general, statistically significant correlations were found between the nutrient elements taken up at different periods by different parts of the plant of different varieties in both years. Significant differences were shown among the years in the amounts of N, P, K, Ca and Mg taken up by the fruits of the Camarosa variety, and of Fe only by the Festival variety.",

Cover crops are used in the cultivation of various plants, including root vegetables such as carrot. The purpose of field and laboratory studies was to determine the effect of selected cover crops on the healthiness of carrot (Daucus carota L.). The field experiment took into consideration cover crops such as spring rye, white mustard, buckwheat, fodder sunflower and two systems of soil tillage, i.e.: tillage before winter (ploughing) + spring tillage (a combined cultivator) and only spring tillage (a combined cultivator). In each experimental treatment, the number and healthiness of carrot seedlings were determined. A laboratory mycological analysis made it possible to determine the qualitative and quantitative composition of fungi infecting the underground parts of carrot. Good emergencies and the healthiness of carrot plants were observed in the objects with rye and white mustard as cover crops. The cultivation system had no significant effect on the proportion of diseased seedlings of carrot. Rye and white mustard were more effective than buckwheat and sunflower in limiting the occurrence of fungi pathogenic towards carrot. Diseased seedlings and roots after harvest of carrot were most frequently colonized by Altenaria alternata, A. chartarum, A. dauci, A. radicina, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium spp.",

A relatively high level of genetic diversity was observed, with estimates of Nei’s diversity index (H) and the Shannon information index (I) of 0.2719 and 0.4158, respectively. Additional genetic distance- and STRUCTURE-based analyses clustered all accessions into two or four subgroups based mostly on origin or color. The genetic differentiation between/among countries and inferred groups was significant, with Fst values ranging from 0.083-0.194%. Accessions from the Netherlands showed higher genetic variation than those from South Africa.

The volatiles of Q. infectoria has been isolated by solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The compositions of the volatiles were revealed via gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Twenty-nine substances have been characterized in the volatile essential oil of Q. infectoria. The major components of the volatile oil were (Z)-Anethol 28.55%, pentadecanolide (26.44%), diethyl phthalate (6.46%), and acetoin (5.66%). Q. infectoria showed good-moderate antimicrobial (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces griseolus, Pseudomonas citronellosis) and antifungal (Candida glabrata, Candida krusei) activities against to test microorganisms with MIC value 250 µg/mL and 125 µg/mL, respectively. Also, total flavonoid and total polyphenol amounts were found for Q. infectoria, and our total polyphenol result (342.87 mg GAE/g) was found higher than the studies in the literature. At the same time Q. infectoria has been observed to have high antioxidant activity according to DPPH, FRAP, and CUPRAC assays. Especially it exhibited excellent DPPH activity for the IC50 rate of 0.002 μg/mL which is higher than the standard Trolox (IC50 = 0.008 μg/mL). This study is important because it is the first one, which reports the determination of essential oil, total polyphenol, flavonoid contents, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities all together for Q. infectoria.",

The use of resistant plant cultivars is the most effective way to control these viruses. National dry bean breeding studies have been conducted by seven different governmental agricultural research institutes in Turkey, and advanced breeding lines have been developed by using the selected local dry bean populations and crossing studies. In this study, 204 breeding lines were tested for resistance levels to BCMV and BCMNV. Initially, BCMNV NL-3 and BCMV NL-4 strains were individually sap-inoculated onto the leaves of bean plants belonging to each breeding lines with 10 replications, and the reactions of plants were evaluated for symptomatic appearance of virus infection 21 days after inoculation. Additionally, phenotypic evaluation was confirmed by molecular markers linked to resistance genes. As a result of the study, 153 breeding lines were found to involve the dominant I gene whereas four and five of the tested lines had the recessive genes bc-1² and bc-2², respectively. In conclusion, it was emphasized that these breeding lines could be registered after evaluating them in terms of yield and quality. Also, the use of seeds of the resistant lines to supply the source of virus-resistance in breeding studies and maintaining their seeds at the national genebank were recommended.",

Soil-borne diseases, caused by pathogenic fungi, are considered to be the main reason for the loss of soybean yields worldwide. The aim of the research was to isolate fungi inhabiting underground parts of soybean in order to identify potential pathogens present in south-east Poland. Research material comprised of seven soybean cultivars grown in field in 2017-2019. Samples collected in three subsequent vegetative seasons constituted soybean plants with disease symptoms on cotyledons, stems and roots. Fragments of the infected plant tissues were subjected to mycological analysis. A total of 1692 pure fungal isolates were obtained from the sampled plants and almost 80% of these isolates were assigned to Fusarium genus. Among Fusarium spp. isolates, the most frequently detected species was F. oxysporum (71.3%). Other detected Fusarium species included: F. graminearum, F. culmorum, F. avenaceum, F. poae, F. solani (syn. Neocosmospora solani), F. sporotrichioides and F. fujikuroi. Other fungi accounted for approx. 19% of the obtained isolates and their main representatives were: Alternaria alternata, Trichoderma sp., Rhizoctonia solani, Mucor sp., Cladosporium sp. and Rhizopus sp. Comparison of these results with published data from other regions of Poland shows differences in prevalence of different species of soil-borne fungi.",

Grapevines were found insufficient for P, K and Mg nutrients in the study. Total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a/b ratio showed significantly varied among to rootstocks and phenological stages (P &lt; 0.01). While the highest leaf chlorophyll content was measured during flowering period it was found at the lowest through to harvest on both rootstocks. Overall total chlorophyll contents and chlorophyll a/b ratio were significantly higher on 5BB grafted vines. In the research, 5C was found to be more successful rootstock than 5BB for nutrient uptakes.",

    "abstract": "Astragalus nitidiflorus is an endangered legume endemic to the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula. This species develops symbiotic relationships with N-fixing bacteria. However, the problem of isolating its rhizobia has not been solved. Because poor N fixation in plants can be corrected by fertilization, the effect of N-P-K fertilizers on growth, leaf chlorophyll and mineral ions was studied. Plants of A. nitidiflorus were grown in 100%-substrate with different N-P-K fertilizer rates (mg l–1): 1-1-8 (S0), 69-29-35 (SL), 144-43-131 (SM) and 245-58-235 (SH). A treatment with substrate plus soil from the natural habitat and no fertilizers (T0) was included. The reference foliar contents of N, P and K were 42.5, 3.5 and 36.5 mg g–1, respectively. Although the species did not form root nodules when grown in substrate, T0 plants produced active nodules that allowed the plants to grow properly without fertilization. In the absence of nodules, both N fertilization (~144 mg l–1) and Fe fertilization (&gt;12 mg l–1) are vital, as is, to a lesser extent, K fertilization (~75 mg l–1 K2O). The S0 and SL reduced leaf chlorophyll, while SM prevented its degradation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work is to produce the generative rootstocks for the wild pears, which will be of moderate denseness. The initial material is the population of wild pear in the area of Polimlje. The study focused on few segments. Very first one included recording of the phenological traits – first flowering, full flowering, end of flowering and harvest period. The other segment comprised pomological features, i.e. physical [fruit weight (g), fruit size (mm), mass of dry seed (g), and number of seed in 1 kg of the fruit]. Seeds from 9 selected genotypes of wild pears were planted in the nursery and raised seedlings were evaluated for nursery characteristics: germination, seedling vigor, uniformidty and branching. Raised seedlings were used as rootstocks for scion cultivar ‘Grand Champion’. The most important benefit of this study is the fact that the parent trees, the seeds of which provide the best morphological and physiological characteristics for the production of generative rootstocks, were found and favored (in situ). Results of this research show that the rapid growth and uniformity of scions depend on the genetic characteristics of generative rootstocks of selected genotypes of wild pears, such as: plant height, stem diameter (corpulence), branching and uniformity. The selected genotypes, especially ‘Genotype 11’, proved to be the best for mountainous areas of the north of Montenegro, higher altitudes and poorer types of soil. The ‘Genotype 11’ is suggested as the best option for the production of generative rootstocks due to its small vigour level.",

Those studies included cultivars of Tagetes spp.: T. erecta (cv. ‘Alaska’, ‘Hawaii’, ‘Mann Im Mond’), T. patula (cv. ‘Bolero’ and ‘Carmen’) and T. tenuifolia (cv. ‘Lemon Gem’ and ‘Lulu’). Six weeks after the sowing and in flowering stage of analyzed marigold cultivars, the plants healthiness was assessed. The mean values of the disease index ranged from 16.25 to 29.0. The main cause of root infection at the seedling stage proved to be the species of Fusarium and Rhizoctonia solani. Proportion of plants with disease symptoms in flowering stage ranged from 1.25 to 5.5%. Regardless of the place of cultivation, species: A. alternata, F. culmorum and F. equiseti were the most often isolated from diseased plants in the flowering stage. Studies on the susceptibility of analyzed cultivars of marigold to infection by Fusarium culmorum, F. equiseti and F. sporotrichioides were conducted in a growth chamber. Significantly, the lowest value of the disease index of cultivar ‘Bolero’ (T. patula) allows to accept that cultivar as the least susceptible to infestation by Fusarium spp. under conditions of controlled temperature and humidity",

The effect of calcium and fish flour (Ca and FF) (single or in combination) to improve plant tolerance against salt stress was studied. Sterilized mentha seeds were imbibed in each treatment: FF (10 g mL–1), Ca (1, 3%) applied alone and in Ca+FF-combination shaking for 24 h at 150 rpm. Changes in the antioxidants (carotenoids, phenolic, and flavonoid), enzymatic system (superoxidase – SOD, guaiacol-dependent peroxidase – GPX and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase – PAL) and lipid peroxidation levels of mentha seedlings were investigated under salt stress. It was suggested that Ca and/or FF had positive regulation effects on the key enzyme activities related to phenolic compounds biosynthesis and individual phenolic contents under salt stress. Additionally, the mentha plants developed from Ca+FF-combined pre-treatments showed better response to salinity than either Ca or FF single pre-treatment. Suppression of salt injury by Ca+FF pre-treatment reduced the LPO levels, increased enzyme activities and promoted total flavonoid and phenolic contents. Ca+FF-combined pre-treatment of mentha seeds seem to be a reliable, not-expensive and easy procedure to enhance plant salt tolerance and to gain more biomass.",

    "abstract": "Root vegetables have greater risk of metal contamination from compost application to soil than other horticultural crops. Moreover, soil organic amendments pose potential environmental hazards. The objective of the present study was to examine the heavy metal uptake in different tissues (petiole, blade, skin, pulp) of Raphanus sativus exposed to organic amendments doses. The impact of the above materials on heavy metal concentration of the soil and plant development parameters were also evaluated. A pot experiment was established with eight treatments arranged in a randomized complete block design and four replicates. Co-compost of sewage sludge and olive wastes at 100, 200, 300 m3 ha–1, composted olive leaves, olive tree pruning wastes, olive mill pomace and poultry manure at 100, 200 m3 ha–1, commercial liquid organic fertilizer at 50 Kg ha–1 with or without inorganic NPK fertilization and a no fertilizing control, were applied to plants. The results showed that sewage sludge application strongly increased the yield and improved radish size cultivated in silt loam soil. The edible radish part had the lowest Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Cr content, whereas the highest Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr was found in the blade and increased Fe, Ni, Pb were recorded in the skin. Organic treatments gave higher Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn amount in both aerial plant tissues compared to the control soil, while Ni, Pb, Cr of all the radish parts were not affected by treatments. This study suggested that organic amendments application gave low permissible levels of all metal content in radish tissues and increased radish productivity. Therefore, organic materials used herein can be applied for normal plant growth without metal contamination of the plant and the soil.",

The highest yield of marketable bulbs and the first-selection ones was obtained from tulips mulched immediately after planting and sprayed 2 weeks later with herbicides used in a single dose of 600 dm3 of a working liquid. Mulching of tulips after soil freezing and removal of mulch in spring adversely affects the number and weight of commercial bulbs. The lowest yield was obtained in combinations, in which the mulch was not used. The use of additional nitrogen fertilization before laying out the mulch did not affect the yield of tulips. Herbicides can be used both before mulching and after covering the plantation with mulch. It is not necessary to increase the dose of the agent and the amount of water.",

Two-year harvest data about fresh and dry herb yield, dry leaf yield, essential oil content and its components from the plants of year 2015 and 2016 was analyzed in this study. Essential oil components were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The resulting outcomes demonstrated that both ecotypes and harvests had important effects on fresh and dry herb, dry leaf yield and essential oil contents of sweet basil. The highest dry leaf yield was noted from green leafy ecotypes and from second harvest stage. Twenty-three constituents were detected in the essential oil of O. basilicum ecotypes. The main components of basil essential oil were linalool, methyl chavicol, neral, geranial and methyl cinnamate that differed according to ecotypes and harvests during experimental years 2015 and 2016. Purple leafy basil ecotypes were determined as linalool rich, while greenish leaf ecotypes were abundant in methyl chavicol. Silbe – green ecotype contains higher neral and geranial levels than the other ecotypes. It was concluded that basil plant could be grown successfully and harvested two or more times to prefer for maximum dry leaf yield and essential oil contents under semi-arid climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "In order to evaluate the relationship between traits affecting the seed yield of the garden cress, phenotypic correlations between seed yield and yield components were detected, direct and indirect effects of yield components on yield and its role in the description of diversity were estimated, and the experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications in 2017. The ANOVA showed that the difference among accessions was significant for all traits. There was a significant phenotypic correlation between yield and most of the traits. The highest value of phenotypic correlation was obtained between seed yield and the ‘thousand seed weight’ (0.97). The regression analysis showed that the seed yield was highly in- fluenced by the ‘thousand seed weight’, leaf height and the number of seeds per silique of the lateral branches and the main axis. These three traits constituted about 89% of changes in the total yield, while the ‘thousand seed weight’ was the most effective trait that entered the model and explained 51% of the variation. The path analysis of phenotypic correlation showed that the ‘thousand seed weight’ had the greatest direct effect on the yield (7.21). The ‘thousand seed weight’ had a positive indirect impact on other traits as well. As a result of the factor analysis, 3 independent factors explained about 79.33% of the yield variation. These factors con- sisted of the number of seeds per silique of the lateral branches, the number of seeds per silique of the main axis and the ‘thousand seed weight’.",

Trees were sprayed with Armothin® at 0.5%, 1% and 2% concentrations. All thinning treatments reduced the fruit set and fruitlet number (fruitlets/50 cm of branch). Armothin® at 2% conc. was the most aggressive treatment, drastically reducing the fruit set from 85.9% and 82.9% of the control and crop load to unprofitable levels during both seasons. Chemical thinning treatments at the two lowest concentrations (0.5 and 1%) did not significantly alter the crop load compared with the unsprayed control during both study seasons. Thinning costs were reduced (Armothin® 0.5%, 25.0% and 21.5% of the control treatment and Armothin® 1%, 24.6% and 24.1% of the control, during the first and second season, respectively). In general, chemical thinning increased the fruit size and total soluble solids content (TSS). Taking into account the ef- fects on thinning, crop load, fruit quality and thinning costs, Armothin® 1% and Armothin® 0.5% are the most advantageous treatments in the case of this study.",

The aim of the research was to study the usefulness of three rootstocks: Larix decidua, Pinus armandii, Cedrus deodara and two grafting methods: side grafting and split grafting for propagation purposes of Cedrus deodara ‘Karl Fuchs’. In addition, it was evaluated how the rootstock and the age of cultivar shoots influenced the level of chloroplast pigments in the needles. A higher percentage of grafts success was obtained on Pinus armandii and Cedrus deodara using the side grafting method. Grafted scions of ‘Karl Fuchs’ produced the greatest number of lateral buds and the longest lateral increments of growth on Cedrus deodara root stock. Side grafting significantly improved the percentage of plants that restarted their growth in the second year of cultivation. The largest number of buds on two-year-old shoots were counted on plants grafted on Cedrus deodara using split grafting method. The rootstocks used in this experiment had a slight effect on the content of chloroplast pigments in the needles. Plants grafted on Pinus armandii had the highest level of chlorophyll B, and those grafted on Larix decidua – chlorophyll A/B ratio. The content of chloroplast pigments in the needles depended on the age of shoots. The highest level of chlorophyll A, chlorophyll B and carotenoids was observed when needles were collected from the last year’s growth.",

    "abstract": "In the preceding research, stevia has been typically cloned in vitro using two media, on which the shoots were formed (3–6 weeks), and on the other they were rooted (3–5 weeks). This study aimed at finding the possibility for rapid stevia propagation from large nodal explants using the MS basal medium [Murashige and Skoog 1962], with low auxin concentrations (0.5, 1 and 2 mg‧dm–3). The plants were obtained as soon as after three weeks. The best results were obtained from media with various concentrations of the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and the highest concentration of phenylacetic acid (PAA). Plants were formed by 83.9-86.0% of explants, they had high weight (234−253 mg), two shoots measuring 2.07−2.37 cm and 5.8−8.3 roots measuring 1.00–1.24 cm. Mean plant weight was lowest on the media with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (185–192 mg). Both explant buds formed single shoots, but their development was typically uneven. The differences in the length and weight of shoots were lowest on the media with IAA and at lower PAA concentrations. Plants from the media with IAA and the control medium were distinguished by a higher number of nodes. The percentage share of shoots in the total plant weight was highest on the media with PAA (62.1–62.7%), and lowest at higher concentrations of α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) (47.9 and 48.9%). Parts of explants immersed in media developed callus, and the highest amounts of this tissue were found in the media with NAA. 92.3% of plants survived the acclimatization. The applied procedure may be used for rapid in vitro cloning of selected stevia genotypes. The use of one medium enables reduction of seedling production costs. Moreover, cyclical cloning and extending the production scale is possible.",

This plant has the competence to be developed as a new ornamental species. The purpose of this experiment was to provide an efficient micropropagation protocol for G. aretioides in order to facilitate the availability of this species for further studies of domestication. The influence of various concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and thidiazuron (TDZ) was investigated for multiplication stage. TDZ at low concentration of 0.05 mg dm−3 resulted in the maximum shoot (9.7) and leaf (42.3) number. The shoots were best rooted on MS medium containing 0.6 mg dm–3 indolebutyric acid (IBA) with 7.8 roots per shoot. Despite achievement of a successful protocol for in vitro multiplication and root induction of Gypsophila, low survival rate was obtained when rooted explants were exposed to ex vitro conditions. This is an important issue, which requires particular consideration and further studies. The possible reasons contributing to the low acclimatization rate of this species are being discussed.",

Seeds were directly or gradually exposed to these salt concentrations. With elevated salinity levels, significant reductions in growth parameters (dry shoot weight, fresh shoot weight, shoot length, root length, and root number) were observed. Also, significant difference in germination percentage was observed at 150 mM NaCl in both cultivars when compared with control treatment (90% germination percentage in Napoli and 71% in Jordan cultivar). Growth rate, tolerant index, and relative water content (RWC) declined as salinity increased. The 150 mM NaCl salinity treatment significantly reduced the shoot chlorophyll and protein content, but increased carbohydrate content. Lesser impairment by the gradual exposure of seedling to salinity provides an opportunity to study the acquirement of salt tolerance.",

The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of nitrogen sources (ammonium sulfate, AS; ammonium nitrate, AN; and urea) and humic acids from lignite sources (TKI-Humas and HUM-Zn) on the growth and flower production of snapdragon that are grown in pots under controlled conditions. It has been observed that plants started to flower during applications of HUM-Zn with AN and urea, whereas they remained at the vegetative stage during the application of HUM-Zn with AS. Furthermore, it has been determined that the two humic acid sources with AS usage prolonged the vegetative development and did not induce flowering of plants. Simultaneous application of humic acid and nitrogen sources has caused an increase in the leaf width, peduncle diameter, floret weight, chlorophyll content, and biomass of the snapdragon. Results show that the application of HUM-Zn with AN and urea has been effective on the plant’s vegetative organs, flowering, and dry weight. It indicated that HUM-Zn contains zinc, which is effective in flowering and biomass development. In conclusion, it was concluded that the simultaneous application of humic acid with AN or urea rapidly affected the flowering process of snapdragon.",

It was determined that 27 metabolites, including organic acids, amino acids, sugars, lipid metabolites, phenolics and steroids, were responsible for the variation in the Chinese yam bulbil groups. A metabolomics pathway was proposed based on the identified metabolites. The main processes affected during germination were those related to carbohydrate metabolism, the TCA cycle, lipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, lipid metabolism and polyphenol metabolism.

Among the promising rootstocks is ‘Pi-ku 1’, obtained in Germany. However, the possibility of its propagation using shoot cuttings has not been investigated. It was the purpose of this study. Two ways of cuttings treatment before placing them in the substrate were assessed. One used two preparations in powder (Rhizopon AA and Ukorzeniacz AB), and the second used two alcoholic auxin solutions (IAA and IBA). Instead of synthetic auxins, foliar spraying with two biostimulants was performed (Goteo and Bispeed). All the applied treatments increased the rooting percentage of ‘Pi-ku 1’ rootstock cuttings compared to the control from 5% for Rhizopon AA to 18.2% for auxin IBA. The exception was the lack of a positive effect of the Bispeed biostimulant (less than 5.2%). The use of synthetic auxins increased the number of utting roots more than three times (IBA) or almost twice (Ukorzeniacz AB) and their length more than twofold (IAA, Rhizopon AA) in proportion to the control. The effect of synthetic auxin treatments on the remaining growth parameters under study was also positive. Foliar treatment of cuttings with biostimulants did not change their growth. Only in one of the two years of the study did the fresh mass of cuttings improve after using Goteo biostimulant (7.5%). As part of the experiment, the effect of two substrate types – peat mixed with perlite and peat with sand – was also tested. During the two years of research, the cuttings were rooted several percent better in peat and sand (2.7% – 2018 and 4.4% – 2019). Using peat with sand as a rooting substrate significantly improved the number and length of roots (11.90 and 125.10) of Pi-ku 1 rootstock cuttings compared to the second one (9.23 and 109.08, respectively). All treatments applied to cuttings, except two biostimulants, increased the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves.",

For this purpose, a 3-year split-plot field experiment was conducted, which included the following factors: N fertilization (kg ∙ ha–1: N0 – control, N1 – 60, N2 – 90, N3 – 120, N4 – 150), amaranth cultivars (‘Rawa’ and ‘Aztek’) and developmental stages (BBCH 13, BBCH 16, BBCH 19). The factor that most significantly differentiated the vitamin C content in the leaves was the cultivar, followed by the development stage, N fertilization, and weather conditions. The cultivar ‘Aztek’, stage BBCH 13, N3 fertilization, and weather conditions during the last year of the experiment gave the best results in this regard. CAT activity in the leaves significantly depended on N fertilization and developmental stage. It increased with the higher N dose and decreased with plant development. The TAC of the leaves depended only on the developmental stage and weather conditions. The highest TAC was observed at BBCH 13 and the third year of the study. CAT in the rhizosphere significantly depended on N fertilization, cultivar, and developmental stage, while in the non-rhizosphere zone, it depended on N fertilization, developmental stage, and weather conditions.

This work aimed to study the response of three groundcovers (Alternanthera dentate, Sphagneticola trilobata, and Alternanthera amoena) to high sodium chloride concentrations. The trial was conducted in the natural greenhouse environment. Plants were raised in pots filling clay-loamy soil. Hewitt’s nutrient solution containing 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mM NaCl irrigated the plants. Plant growth, antioxidative enzyme activity, and the relative water content (RWC), proline, sodium, potassium, and chloride were determined. The study indicated that increasing NaCl concentration in the nutrient solution led to: a) significant differences in the fresh weight of shoots among salinity treatments and among species; b) increased root growth with increasing salinity stress up to the mild stress level of 25 mM NaCl, however at different rates with three species; c) reduced RWC of the leaves of three species grown under salinity-induced stress; d) the increased proline content of the leaves, and more pronounced increases with A. dentate and A. amoena from 0 to 50 mM NaCl, and with S. trilobata from 0 to 100 mM NaCl; e) significant changes in the activities of antioxidative enzymes including superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase; f) significant decrease of the K+/Na+ ratio along with increase of salinity stress; g) increased ratio of leaf/ root content of Cl– in A. dentate and in particular, A. amoena; h) a significant reduction in visual qualities of all examined plants. Therefore, because of its ability to maintain leaf characteristics, visual quality, and salt-tolerance mechanisms even under high salinity, S. trilobata can be considered for urban landscaping projects in semiarid and saline areas where low-quality water is used for irrigation.",

Various concentrations of ammonium molybdate solution (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg·L–1) were foliar sprayed to examine their impact on the growth, photosynthetic characteristics, carbohydrate metabolism, and fruit quality of melons under high-temperature stress. The results indicated that plants sprayed with Mo exhibited enhanced plant parameters, including height, stem diameter, root volume, root activity, and physiological characteristics of melons under high-temperature stress, in comparison to the control (CK). The most significant improvements were observed in plants treated with 0.1 mg·L–1 Mo (T2). This treatment also showed higher improvement in melon net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr) and total chlorophyll relative to other treatments. It also significantly promotes carbohydrate metabolism in melon plant leaves under high-temperature stress, enhancing their antioxidant enzyme activity. Melon plants exhibit a respective increase in sucrose, soluble sugars, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) compared to the control. Melon sprayed with 0.1 mg·L–1 Mo showed significantly higher levels of vitamin C, soluble proteins, and soluble solids in fruits compared to other treatments, with a respective increase of 27.9% in individual fruit weight and 20.1% in per-plant yield compared to the CK. In conclusion, spraying 0.1 mg·L–1 Mo effectively mitigates damage caused by high-temperature stress during melon cultivation. It enhances the photosynthetic capacity of melon leaves, promotes carbohydrate metabolism in plant leaves, and thereby strengthens stress resistance. This comprehensive improvement leads to enhanced quality and yield of melon fruits.",

    "abstract": "Natural protection of plants against diseases, pests and environmental stresses is the only acceptable alternative to the progressive application of chemicals in plant production. Amidst evolving climatic patterns, various diseases pose significant threats to crop plant production. Among these concerns, a prominent menace across multiple regions of the world is seedling blight, incited by the pathogenic agent Bipolaris sorokiniana Sacc. The antagonistic effect may occur in/on the host itself or in its vicinity in the case of saprotrophic organisms. B. sorokiniana attacks many species of crop plants, especially in warmer growing areas and causes significant losses of field emergence and yield. This study aimed to assess the inhibitory impact of selected microscopic fungi on the growth and development of B. sorokiniana through dual-culture experiments. The study also aimed to identify potential fungal candidates for the biocontrol of seedling blight caused by this pathogen. The outcomes demonstrated that only several of the fungi subjected to testing had a noteworthy influence on the growth of B. sorokiniana. The presence of a few fungi species, such as Trichoderma viride, Fusarium graminearum, and Botrytis cinerea led to a decrease in B. sorokiniana growth by a minimum of 50%. In the instance of other fungi such as Sordaria fimicola, Epicoccum nigrum, Fusarium sporotrichioides, F. culmorum, and Nigrospora oryzae, the reduction amounted to at least 40%. The vast majority (75%) of the fungal species used in the test limited the growth of Bipolaris colonies by up to 39%.",

    "abstract": "The primary quality concern for spinach and other green vegetables during post-harvest handling is preserving the green color, specifically by delaying the yellowing caused by chlorophyll loss. The current study, therefore, aimed to investigate the effect of ethanol added to washing water in low concentrations on yellowing, chlorophyll loss, and the storage quality of spinach. For this purpose, ethanol was added to tap water at 0 µL L–1 (control), 200 µL L–1, 400 µL L–1, and 800 µL L–1, and after pre-washing, the spinach leaves were dipped in these solutions at a temperature of 16–18°C for five minutes. The spinach was stored at 4 ±1°C and at 90–95% RH for 21 days after being drained, dried, and packed, and the quality parameters were recorded at seven-day intervals. As a result of this study, the decline in chlorophyll losses was obtained especially by the application of the 400 µL L–1 ethanol treatment after the first 14 days of storage, and this result was positively correlated with both the color values L*, a*, b*, hue, yellowness index (YI), total color difference (ΔE), and the chlorophyll SPAD (soil-plant analysis development) values. Consequently, adding 400 µL L–1 of ethanol to the washing water was the most effective in delaying yellowing and chlorophyll loss in spinach. However, this effect declined with increasing solution concentrations and was accompanied by weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating onions for size, shape, damage, colour and discolouration is the first and most important step in classifying them for raw material quality, processing and the horticultural and agri-food sectors. Current methods of geometric evaluation and grading of onions involve mechanical and extremely invasive sorting, which causes additional damage, reduces the quality of the raw material and is also labour and time-consuming. As a result, non-invasive evaluation and classification methods that are both fast and accurate are being sought. One such method is digital image analysis, which, when combined with instrumentation and deep neural networks, can fully automate the process. The main aim of this study was the development of a model for the automatic evaluation and classification of onions using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. A fixed-architecture network was built, for which a computational algorithm was developed in Python 3.9 and published at https://github.com/piotrrybacki/onion-CNN.git (accessed on 4 October 2024). The Hyduro F1 onion variety, a hybrid all-purpose variety of the Rijnsburger type, was used to build, teach and test the model. The developed algorithm classified the onion images qualitatively with an accuracy of 91.85%. This classification was based on the geometric parameters of the onion, i.e. diameter, height, transversal and longitudinal circumference, and the estimated area of damage or discolouration of the skin. The root mean square error (MSE) in RGB space varied between 87.99 and 91.24, and the maximum image classification time was 28.98 ms/image. The developed algorithm has a very high utility, as it automates the classification process, reducing its time and labour intensity.",

    "abstract": "Amaranth seeds are characterized by a very high nutritional value, which depends on various environmental factors and variety. For this plant, it is crucial to maintain the appropriate post-harvest quality of the seeds, particularly in terms of fungal infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of increasing NPK doses, row spacing, and variety on the biodiversity of fungi colonizing amaranth seeds. For this purpose, a 3-year field experiment (2016–2018) was carried out involving the cultivation of two varieties – ‘Rawa’ and ‘Aztek’ – under the soil and climatic conditions of southeastern Poland. The experiment demonstrated that most of the analyzed research factors (NPK fertilization, row spacing, and variety) had a significant impact on the health status of amaranth seeds. Increasing NPK fertilization led to higher seed colonization by Alternaria alternata. Row spacing affected both the total number of fungal colonies and the population of Aspergillus brasiliensis on the seeds. In this regard, amaranth cultivation was more favorable with wide row spacing than narrow row spacing. The variety significantly influenced seed germination after harvest, and the total number of fungal colonies on the seeds, particularly of Aspergillus brasiliensis and Alternaria alternata. The variety ‘Rawa’ was characterized by lower seed germination capacity and was more frequently populated by pathogenic fungi, which negatively affected seed quality compared to the variety ‘Aztek’. Considering the production of seeds free of post-harvest biological contamination in southeastern Poland, it is advisable to cultivate the variety ‘Aztek’ in a wide row spacing system.",

    "abstract": "Drought and salinity are the most important abiotic factors limiting agricultural production. One of the effective ways to avoid their negative effects on plants is to determine the genotypes that will show resistance to these stress conditions. In addition, the gradual decrease in water resources in the world makes minimum water consumption important in agriculture. For this purpose, three different irrigation levels (I100: control – 100% full irrigation, i.e. 0% deficit irrigation, I50: 50% deficit irrigation, I25: 25% deficit irrigation) were applied within the framework of water constraint, and NaCl was applied at the doses of S0: 0 mM (control), S50: 50 mM and S75: 75 mM to create salt stress, and the experimental plots were designed according to the random plot experimental design with three replications and four plants in each replication. In the genotype × salinity interaction, compounds other than fumaric acid from organic acids formed significant interactions with genotypes YYU-4 and YYU-10. Among phenolic compounds, parameters other than total phenolic and antioxidant content formed significant interactions mainly with cv. Ananas. In the genotype × irrigation interaction, among organic acids, oxalic, succinic and fumaric acids and among phenolic compounds, only vanillic acid showed significant interactions particularly with genotypes YYU-1, YYU-10 and YYU-13. As a result of the study, it was concluded that the determined genotypes are prominent in terms of quality fruit production in saline and arid areas, and it is necessary to examine these genotypes using different parameters in different breeding studies.",

Phytophagous nematodes were isolated from the soil sample as well as the garlic plant shoots, with an average density of 75 individuals per 100 mL. Microscope slides were prepared from adult individuals and subjected to morphological and morphometric analysis, as well as DNA examination. It was demonstrated that the examined nematodes belong to the species Robustodorus subtenuis. Both the female and male nematodes differed from individuals previously found in the cultivation of Narcissus and Gladiolus. On average, R. subtenuis females have shorter bodies and longer tails, with the averages calculated for the nematode population from the soil being slightly lower than the average values for nematodes from the garlic shoots. Additionally, the females found in the soil had a shorter distance from the lip region to the vulva and a shorter post-vulval sac, the length of which constituted 32 to 45% of the distance from the vulva to the anus. On average, the male bodies were shorter and had longer tails. They were also wider at the level of the anus. The average body length of males isolated from the soil, like that of the females, was lower than the average for individuals isolated from the garlic shoots. Variations in the influence of the host plant on the morphometry of the parasitic nematodes were observed. This is the first report of R. subtenuis colonizing garlic plants in Poland.",

Loosely spread hyphae and conidial spores were more frequently observed on twigs in an orchard where no chemical control was employed. The largest amount of conidial spores was recorded on twigs of unpro- tected McIntosh apple trees as a result of high infestation of leaves in later autumn. A considerably lower amount of conidia was recorded on twigs of Jonagold apple trees. In orchards under chemical control the conidia wintering occurs less frequently and only if leaves were highly infested in the autumn.",

The trees were dwarfed with: rootstocks (M.9 and P60), and addi- tionally, with bark grafting (in normal and inverted position), microinterstocks (M.9, P22, M.27) and retardant (Paclobutrazol). Microinterstock is an additional way of dwarfing, where a ring of bark taken from dwarfing rootstock is grafted on the tree's trunk. In the years 1996-1999 fruit, leaf, wood, bark and root samples of each treatment were col- lected. After washing, samples were dried, grounded and subjected to mineralization and analised for calcium by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The highest concentration of Ca was noted in the bark of investigated trees (1.53% d.w.). Relatively high concentra- tion of Ca was noted in leaves and roots (0.98% d.w. and 0.48% d.w. respectively). The lowest content was noted in wood and friuts (0.09% d.w. and 0.02% d.w.). Analised root- stocks did not affect significantly the leaves calcium content. On the contrary rootstocks influenced fruit Ca ammounts; the lower Ca content was noted in fruits from trees grafted on P60 rootstock. Bark graftage or microinterstocks did not influenced or lowered Ca fruit content. The only exception was microinterstock P22 which significantly increased fruit Ca ammounts. No correlation between leaf and fruit Ca content was found. Bark grafting and microinterstocks decreased root Ca content. This effect was especially evident in the first year after grafting.",

After germination in growth chamber, seedlings were moved to a greenhouse for seedling growing till they were ready for planting. Seedlings were transplanted to the polyethylene greenhouse 35 days after sowing. Perlite as growing medium was used in open-system soilless culture. Nutrient solution was aerated with an air compressor and applied to plants 2 days after planting with drip irrigation. To diffuse oxygen into nutrient solution in large bubbles, a circular air-stone commonly used in fisheries was used. The nutrient solution without oxyfertigation and plants not treated with bacteria constituted the control treatment. Experiments were conducted in randomized plots design with 2 factors and 3 replications. Heads were harvested 2 months after transplanting. Yield and head quality parameters of head were determined. It was concluded that oxygen enrichment of nutrient solution through a compressor (aeration) provided increases in yield and plant growth. Especially root development, head size and leaf number were higher in plants grown with aerated nutrient solution. Among the tested bacteria, B. subtilis, P. fluorescens and B. subtilis + P. fluorescens were found promising due to the their higher performance under aerated conditions on greenhouse lettuce grown in perlite.",

To date, several regulatory components responsible for GS biosynthesis have been identified in Arabidopsis. However, the functions of GS biosynthesis regulators in Chinese cabbage have not been clarified. In our current study, a putative ATR1/MYB34 orthologous gene, BrMYB34.2, was isolated from Chinese cabbage leaves. To investigate the function of this gene, we engineered Arabidopsis plants that overexpress BrMYB34.2 ectopically and phenotypic analysis was performed. Moreover, we assayed the accumulation levels of indolic GS (IGS) and aliphatic glucosinolates in transgenic plants and test the expression of key genes of IGS biosynthesis and tryptophan synthesis by Real-time quantitative PCR. And further analysed the resistance of transgenic plants in 5MT stress treatment. The results indicate that ectopic expression of the BrMYB34.2 gene in Arabidopsis was able to up-regulate the accumulation level of IGS due to the increased expression of IGS and Trp biosynthetic genes. Moreover, overexpression of BrMYB34.2 conferred Arabidopsis 5MT resistance. These results suggest that the BrMYB34.2 gene may function as one of the regulators of IGS and Trp biosynthesis in Chinese cabbage.",

The pathogenicity of F. crookwellense was estimated based on the kernels yield reduction of 10 selected oat genotypes. Panicles of oat were inoculated with conidial suspension of F. crookwellense strain No. 72 which caused a reduction in kernels yield by 28.54% and kernels number per panicle by 28.07%, compared to the control. The lowest yield reduction, as a result of the panicle inoculation with F. crookwellense, was found in the case of the cultivar ‘Pablo’ (18.73%), while the highest in the case of breeding line POB 961-1344/13 (36.4%) and cv. ‘Kozak’ (34.3%). Statistically the highest average yield reduction was observed in year 2016, when a higher amount of rainfall, especially in July (just after inoculation) and higher temperature, compared to the long-term standard, were observed. During the period between inoculation and harvest, F. crookwellense was able to produce nivalenol, fusarenone X and zearalenone in oat kernels at the average level of 0.065 mg∙kg-1, 0.026 mg∙kg-1 and 0.015 mg∙kg-1 respectively.",

Except of ‘Polarnacht’, they had relatively large specific leaf area and ‘Michiko’ also free proline accumulation. On the other hand, R. repens ‘Scarlet Wonder’ and R. hybridum ‘Red Jack’ started with half gS values, continuously declining 1.5–2 fold longer compared to the first group of genotypes (RWC of ca. 60 and 75%, respectively). Both produced relatively thick leaves but did not show any osmotic adjustment. Among observed drought-resistance strategies, lower and longer period active transpiration with stomata sensitive to the water loss, as found in R. repens ‘Scarlet Wonder’ and R. × hybridum ‘Red Jack’, were accepted as the most effective for drought-affected rhododendron plantations.",

The field experiment was carried out in 2009–2012 on grey brown podzolic soil developed from loess formations covering the cretaceous marls with a granulometric composition corresponding to medium dusty loam. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of various species of cover crops and the method and date of mixing their biomass with the soil on the soil moisture in ploughless carrot cultivation. The experimental design included seven cover crop species (spring rye, common oat, common vetch, white mustard, lacy phacelia, buckwheat, fodder sunflower) and six kinds of soil tillage. The effect of cover crops and tillage on soil moisture was modified by the course of the weather and varied depending on the year of research, sampling date and soil layer. In spring, the highest layer of soil (0–20 cm) not cultivated before winter (NTz) accumulated the most water, and the least after pre-winter ploughing (Oz). In the 0–40 cm layer, the lowest humidity was in the soil ploughed before winter (Oz), and the highest after no-till (NTz) and after subsoiling before winter (GLz). The ridge cultivation performed in the spring caused the soil to dry out. In the remaining variants of no-ploughing tillage, soil moisture in the 0–40 cm layer was similar to that of conventional cultivation. Cover crops exerted a significant influence on the soil moisture in carrot cultivation at all test dates, increasing its moisture content compared to cultivation without cover crops. The rye cover crop had particularly favourable effect on the soil moisture.",

The field experiment was carried out in south-eastern Poland on Haplic Luvisol. The biostimulants were applied according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. Moreover, the biostimulants Asahi SL (active components: nitroguaiacolate and nitrophenolates), Beta-Chikol (a.s. – chitosan) and Bio-Algeen S90 (extract from seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum) were applied for the pre-sowing seed dressing of scorzonera cv. ´´Duplex´´. For comparison, the fungicide Zaprawa Nasienna T 75 DS/WS (a.s. – tiuram 75%) was used. Untreated seeds served as control. Moreover, the biodiversity of soil-borne fungi colonizing the roots of this vegetable was determined. The number of seedlings and the health status of scorzonera plants were determined during three growing seasons. In each year of the study, both scorzonera seedlings with necrosis symptoms on the roots and the infected roots obtained after scorzonera harvest were subjected to laboratory mycological analysis. The experiments showed that, the emergence and health status of scorzonera seedlings after the application of biostimulants, especially after Beta-Chikol, were significantly better than in the control. Asahi SL and Beta-Chikol were more effective than Bio-Algeen S90 in limiting the occurrence of fungi pathogenic towards scorzonera plants. Diseased scorzonera roots were most frequently colonized by Alternaria scorzonerae, Alternaria alternata, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Fusarium spp., especially by Fusarium oxysporum. In conclusion, Asahi SL, Beta-Chikol and Bio-Algeen S90 can be recommended as effective biostimulants in field cultivation of Scorzonera hispanica.",

These bud clusters have been shown to be propagable in vitro on both solid and liquid media, for which benzyladenine and thidiazuron cytokinins may be recommended. The process of shoot regeneration from these bud clusters was also investigated, which can be accelerated by inhibitors of gibberellin biosynthesis.

    "abstract": "The objective of this three-year study was to investigate the usefulness of flame weeding, spraying with glufosinate-ammonium and nighttime soil tillage for weed suppression in summer savory. The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with three experimental factors and four replications. The soil was cultivated with a rotary tiller a day before savory sowing or an hour after sunset on the night preceding sowing, while flaming (90 kg propane∙ha–1) and glufosinate-ammonium (600 g∙ha–1) were applied, depending on the year, 12–22 days after sowing, i.e. after the emergence of weeds and the first savory seedlings. Flaming and glufosinate-ammonium killed all weeds growing during the treatment but they did not prevent new weeds from emerging on the following days. Three weeks later, the number of weeds growing on plots weeded with the flame method and sprayed with glufosinate-ammonium was significantly lower by about 63 and 69% in comparison to control, respectively, and it was independent of the time of soil tillage. The studied methods had no effect on weed infestation assessed 3–4 weeks after the first weeding, or on the emergence, plant height and yield of fresh savory herb. The content of oil in dry herb varied from about 1.9% to 2.4% depending on the year while it did not depend on the weeding method. Oil produced by control plants contained 35 compounds making up 99.85% of the total, with the predominant share of carvacrol (45.2–46.8%) and γ-terpinene (34.6–39.9%). Much smaller was the share of α-terpinene (4.8%), p-cymene (2.7–4.0%), myrcene (1.5–2.0%) and α-thujene (1.4–1.8%). The average share of the remaining components did not exceed 1%.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of silicon (Si) and calcium (Ca) added to the substrate (perliteor its mixture with peat) used in soilless strawberry cultivation on the number of different groups of microorganisms in the substrate. Research was conducted on a farm located in southern Poland in which soilless cultivation of strawberries in gutters, under covers, with an irrigation system was carried out. The microbiological analyzes were performed by serial dilution method. The analyzes included determination of the total number of bacteria, actinobacteria, fungi and aerobic atmospheric nitrogen assimilators of the Azotobacter genus. In this work, we showed that the concentration of microorganisms associated with the cultivation substrate may be influenced by the presence of silicon and calcium added to the composition of the substrate. Correlation analysis showed that the addition of Si + Ca to the substrate affects increase in the total number of bacteria in the substrate. The obtained results confirm that the cultivation substrate can be modified in such a way that it is more conducive to the multiplication and survival of bacteria associated with the substrate.",

    "abstract": "Water stress is by far the most serious limiting factor to tomato (Solanum lycopersicom) production, particularly in Iran where located in arid and semi-arid regions. Silicon (Si) is considered an effective element to mitigate the adverse effects of water stress by promoting plant growth and production. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of the foliar application of Si (0, 100, and 200 mg L–1) and three water regimes – no stress (100), mild stress (80%), and severe stress (60%) – on the growth parameters, the yield, and the fruit quality as well as antioxidant status of the tomato. The imposed water stress significantly increased the total soluble solids (TSS), the total acidity (TA), and the flavonoids as well as antioxidant defense parameters such as catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX), while the growth parameters (plant height and leaf number) and tomato yield were decreased. In contrast, the foliar application of Si (200 mg L–1) remarkably improved the total yield of tomatoes when exposed to water stress by improving the antioxidant enzyme activities and total flavonoid compounds. In addition, the application of Si could significantly improve the growth parameters (plant height and leaf number) and fruit quality (fruit firmness and size). As a result, the foliar application of Si could be suggested as an effective strategy for imparting water stress resistance in the tomato.",

In both agricultural systems, pea was grown in crop rotation: potato – winter wheat – pea – winter barley. Shallow ploughing (10–12 cm) after previous crop harvest and pre-winter ploughing (20–25 cm) were performed, whereas a pre-sowing cultivation set was deployed in the springtime in TA. In CA, glyphosate was applied after previous crop harvest, and post-harvest residues were left on the filed surface (4.5 t ha–1). A cultivation-sowing set was used in the springtime, and pea was sown at the beginning of April. The study demonstrated that the agricultural systems tested had no significant effect on pea seed yield. A higher number and air-dry weight of weeds, and a higher weed species number were demonstrated in TA than in CA. Also, a higher number and air-dry weight of weeds were recorded in 2020 than in the other study years.

TotalHumus® is made from brown coal. Bacterbase is a bacterial preparation containing Bacillus velezensis and Bacillus amyloliqefaciens (Skierniewickie Microorganisms) with antifungal properties that stimulates the growth and yielding of plants. Unrooted microshoots of strawberry ‘Grandarosaʼ and highbush blueberry ‘Chandlerʼ, and rooted in vitro microcuttings of hip rose ‘Konstancinʼ were planted in a peat substrate. Three weeks after planting ex vitro, the plants were treated with the biopreparations. Four times, at two-week intervals, the plants were drenched and simultaneously sprayed with mineral fertilizer 0.2% Hydrovit (control), 0.04% TotalHumus® and 0.03% Bacterbase, which were used separately or in combinations. In hip rose and strawberry, compared to the control, similar or better growth parameters of shoots and roots were observed after the use of TotalHumus® and/or Bacterbase. The plants were characterized by the highest fresh weight, longer shoots/runners and more shoots than in the control (mineral fertilization). In strawberry, root parameters were significantly improved by TotalHumus®, and in rose by Bacterbase. The use of both TotalHumus® and Bacterbase separately or in combination significantly reduced the occurrence of symptoms of rose leaf infection with powdery mildew.

This study was carried out to determine the effects of rhizobacteria and algae treatments on some biochemical and physiological properties of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) grown under water stress conditions. According to the completely randomized experimental design, the study was carried out in 4 replications in factorial order. In the experiment, the Filiz-99 broad bean variety was used as a plant material. In the study, 4 different biological applications (control, blue-green algae, and 2 different bacteria) and 3 different irrigation levels – 100% (NI), 50% (RI1), and 25% (RI2) – have been applied. In the study, properties such as root and stem length, stem and root fresh weight, stem, and root dry weight, nitrogen balance index, antioxidant, flavonoid, and phenolic properties were examined. Root length changed between 21.37–25.62 cm in bacteria and algae applications, and the highest value was obtained from the B1 application with 25.62 g. At increasing water stress levels, the nitrogen balance index varied in the range of 128.01–77.50%. In bacteria and algae applications, the highest value was obtained from the B1 application. While the phenolic content ranged between 127.53 and 134.31 mg GAE (Gallic Acid Equivalents) g–1 with increasing water stress, the highest value among biological applications was B1 application with 138.06 mg GAE g–1. As a result of the interaction of factors, the highest phenolic values were obtained from B1 × RI2 (149.85 mg GAE g–1), B2 × RI2 (137.05 mg GAE g–1), B0 × NI (127.43 mg GAE g–1), and B0 × RI2 (123.69 mg GAE g–1) applications, while the lowest values were obtained from B2 × NI (123.22 mg GAE g–1), Alg × RI2 (126.65 mg GAE g–1), Alg × NI (127.75 mg GAE g–1), and B1 × NI (131.73 mg GAE g–1) applications.

The harmfulness of the studied fungi varied both between the spe- cies and between the isolates within the species. P. verrucosum var cyclopium and F. cul- morum proved to be the most harmful since the smallest number of onion plants grew in those experimental combinations and they were the least infected.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to examine response of 'Jersey' highbush blueberry to boron (B) fertilization. The experiment was carried out in 2002-2003 at a private plan- tation in Central Poland on mature blueberries planted on a sandy loam soil with pH 4.1, low organic matter status, and medium available B content. Blueberries were supplied with B by foliar applications or broadcasting. Foliar B sprays were done in the spring or the fall. Spring B sprays were performed at the beginning of blooming, at petal fall, and 3 and 6 weeks after the ending of flowering. In each spring spray treatment, B was used at a rate of 0.2 kg ha -1 . Fall B spray was done 5 weeks after fruit harvest using 0.8 kg B ha -1 . Soil B was applied at the stage of bud break at a rate of 2 kg ha -1 . Blueberries unfertilized with B served as control. The results showed that soil B application and spring B sprays increased B status in flowers and leaves. However, B fertilization, regardless of applica- tion mode, had no effect on plant vigor, the number of flowers per cane, fruit set, mean fruit weight, berry firmness, and yielding. Berries of blueberries sprayed with B in the spring had increased soluble solids concentrations. It is concluded that: (i) B fertilizer re- quirements of 'Jersey' highbush blueberry are low, and (ii) at hot water extractable B concentration in a soil below 0.37 mg kg -1 and/or at B status in leaves of current season shoots below 37 mg kg -1 , spring B sprays should be applied in blueberry culture to in- crease soluble solids concentration in fruit.",

In addition, the macro and microelement concentrations of fruits and seeds were also investigated. According to the data obtained, when fruit and seed were compared, it was determined that the seed (81.72%) contained more components than the fruit (79.4%), and the antioxidant activity of the seed was also higher. While the main component of the seed was “Methyl hydrogen disulfide” with 43.21%, the main component of the fruit was “5-Hydroxymethylfurfural” with 24.2%. As a result of antimicrobial activity tests, neither seeds nor fruits have antimicrobial activity. At the same time, the nutritional content values of the seeds and fruits of this plant were analyzed and evaluated. When the data obtained are evaluated in terms of both macro and micronutrients, it has been observed that the nutritional content values of the fruit (K (3.63%), P (0.68 %), Cu (24.31%), Zn (10.49 mg kg–1) and Mn (25.29 mg kg–1) for fruits) are higher than the seeds. In conclusion, the findings from the evaluation of Diospyros lotus fruit and seeds in this study highlight the richness in chemical composition and high antioxidant activity of the seeds, as well as the nutritional superiority of the fruit. Therefore, further research to better understand and harness the potential health benefits of this plant could contribute to a deeper understanding of this field.",

Therefore, the microbial safety of such products is of great concern. In the current study, a survey of general microbiological contamination (mesophilic bacteria, yeasts, molds, Enterobacteriaceae, coli bacteria, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and Escherichia coli) of fresh-cut vegetable salads and berry-packed fruits available in Polish supermarket was undertaken.In ready-to-eat salads, the high number of mesophilic bacteria ranged from 6.43 to 8.56 log10 cfu g–1, and also Enterobacteriaceae with mean value from 3.45 to 4.08 log10 cfu g–1 was detected. Mesophilic bacteria, yeast, and Enterobacteriaceae were detected in all salad samples. The molds were detected in 45% of salad samples, and their mean number ranged from 0.63 log10 cfu g–1 in salads with carrot or beetroot to 1.80 log10 cfu g–1 in salads with rocket.Berry fruit was also heavily microbiologically contaminated. In particular, the means of mesophilic bacteria, molds, and yeasts were high. The number of molds detected in fruit samples, especially in raspberry samples, could be alarming. Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and coli bacteria were detected in a few samples of berry fruit. None of the ready-to-eat salads and fruit samples were contaminated by Escherichia coli.Based on the tests that were conducted, it was found that the microbiological quality was not satisfactory. The findings suggest that following hygienic measures during processing and handling, the microbiological quality of vegetable salads and berry fruit available in Polish markets should be improved.",

People do not want polluting and toxic fertilizers used to cultivate the plants they use for nutrition, and they do not want the plants they use as ornamental plants. The study investigated the effects of mycorrhizal and bacterial applications on plant growth and chlorophyll content. As a result of the study, it was concluded that bacterial applications on the development of boxwoods are more effective than mycorrhizal applications. Shading further increased the effect of the applications. In B. microphilla, in a 70% shade, plant height increased by 18.5% with mycorrhizal application, and plant width increased by 29.7% with bacterial application. In B. herlandii, bacterial application increased plant height by 13.3% and plant width by 20.4%. In shadowless application, the amount of chlorophyll in B. herlandii leaves was found to increase by 47.20% with bacteria and in B. microphilla, it increased by 65.86. In shadow application in B. herlandii, leaves were found to increase by 76.70% with bacteria; in B. microphilla, it increased by 94.93%. It was concluded that the bacteria application is more effective than others because Azotobacters fix the free nitrogen in the air to the boxwood soil, which needs continuous nitrogen for growth and development. For this reason, N-fixing bacteria applications to the soil can be used as an alternative to chemical fertilizer applications in boxwood cultivation or hedge formation.",

    "abstract": "Dianthus chinensis L. is indigenous to northern China, Korea, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and southeastern Russia. It is widely cultivated in urban landscapes. Its flower has a great variety of colors and color schemes. Sugars control and induce anthocyanin synthesis and accumulation in plants. In sugar metabolism, many enzymes are specific for their substrate’s α or β anomer. Gaining and characterizing genes involved in sugar metabolism and flower color will be beneficial in clarifying the role of sugar in the flower colors of D. chinensis. Glucose-6-phosphate-1-epimerase (G6P1E, EC 5.1.3.15) catalyzes the α or β change of glucose-6-phosphate at the branch point of glucose metabolism. DchG6P1E1 (MZ292712) was isolated in D. chinensis and characterized using the tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system. Its cDNA full length is 1401 bp, including an open reading frame of 918 bp. In the DchG6P1E1-silenced flowers, the reducing purple was observed, as well as the anthocyanin content, reducing sugar content, G6P1E activity, and DchG6P1E1 expression were significantly decreased. During the development of floral buds and among the three flower colors, the anthocyanin content, reduced sugar content, G6P1E activity, and DchG6P1E1 expression rose dramatically, with pigments increasing in the petals. Among the organs, the flowers had the highest anthocyanin contents and reducing sugar. The highest levels of G6P1E activity and DchG6P1E1 expression were in the roots. The anthocyanin content was positively related to the reducing sugar content at 0.05 levels by correlation analysis. In conclusion, DchG6P1E1 is a root-enriched gene associated with flower colors in D. chinensis.",

    "abstract": "Gene pool variation of twenty varieties and breeding clones of Fragaria × ananassa, nine varieties and breeding lines of Fragaria vesca, and one new interspecific hybrid designated Fragaria × anavesca was analysed with three DNA marker systems. ISSR reactions with four primers produced 45 polymorphic markers. Similarly, RAPD analyses with three primers produced 26 markers and SSR method with three primer pairs revealed 28 different alleles. The total number of 99 polymorphic markers allowed distin- guishing clearly a group of F. × ananassa genotypes from that of F. vesca genotypes with F. × anavesca in between of these two. RAPD markers proved to be more informative than ISSRs as 3 of 26 were specific to F. × ananassa only and one exclusively to F. vesca and F. × anavesca. Thus, the presumed hybrid nature of F. × anavesca was effectively confirmed by RAPD markers. Especially important was the 1100bp long PCR product of the B104 primer present in all F. vesca genotypes as well as in F. × anavesca but absent in F. × ananassa. Presence of F. vesca DNA in the hybrid F. × anavesca was additionally corroborated by the 223bp product of the UDF017 primer pair and the 185bp-long band generated with the UDF006 primer pair.",

Root cultures were initiated from adventitious roots regenerated on micropropagated shoots. Proliferative root cultures of examined Daphne species were obtained both on solidified and liquid medium, supplemented with various doses of NAA. Cultures of detached roots proved to be a convenient system of testing to T. basicola resistance. Daphne roots cultured in vitro were distinctly contami- nated under laboratory conditions. Susceptibility of cultured organs differed between spe- cies.

    "abstract": "In recent years, biofertilisers have emerged as a promising component of an in- tegrated nutrient supply system in agriculture. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of selected biofertilisers on the vegetative growth, the content of N, P2O5 and K2O in the leaves and stems, and on the physiological parameters of pepper of the va- riety of 'Sofiiska Kapiya' cultivated under organic agriculture conditions. This experi- ment was carried out from 2009 to 2011 on the experimental fields of the Agroecological Centre at the Agricultural University-Plovdiv (Bulgaria), situated on the territory of a cer- tified ecological farm. The study included the following biofertilisers - Boneprot, Lum- brical, Baikal EM Effective Microorganisms, Emosan, and Bio One. The results of the biometric measurements of the average plant height at the end of the vegetative period showed the highest values for the variant treated with Emosan on the Boneprot basic fer- tilisation (62.60 cm - 2009; 64.80 cm - 2010, and 63.87 cm - 2011). Upon feeding with the biofertilisers Emosan and Baikal EM on basic fertilisation with Boneprot (2009, 2010 and 2011) at the pepper mass fruit yield stage, plants showed higher values of net photosynthesis (PN) that were also similar to the high values observed in the flower bud stage. The highest intensity of transpiration (�? ) was observed for the variants treated with the biofertilisers Baikal EM (2009 and 2011) and Emosan (2010) on basic fertilisation with Boneprot. It was concluded that the feeding with Emosan stimulated the vegetative growth of the pepper plants due to the high concentrations of nutrient-providing proteins contained in this biofertiliser. The results showed that biofertilisers do not significantly impact the P content of the pepper leaves and stems, but changes were more obvious in the leaves. The fertilisation with the studied biofertilisers increased the K2O content in leaves and stems compared to the control (non-fertilised) plants; the values were higher for the leaves.",

The experiment was carried out in 7 single-leader and 3 multi-leader training systems. The pest density was compared across the systems and between apple cultivars Elstar and Jonagold showing variable crown densities and trichome cover of leaves. The spider mite mobile stages were more abundant in single- leaders crowns, whereas more eggs were laid in multi-leader crowns. Nevertheless, the egg and the youngest stages survival was reduced in multi-leader crowns probably by the more intensive solar radiation reducing the air RH. The lowest pest abundance was found in the crowns of the V-Guttingen system, and in the similar, stretched Tatura trellis 2-leader system. These types of crowns should be therefore recommended for integrated and organic apple production.",

This study was conducted to evaluating the results of government sup- ported crop insurance (GSCIS) policies in terms of the apple producers and to determine characteristics of both farms participating and non-participating in government supported crop insurance system in the Isparta province of Turkey. The data used in the study was obtained from 77 apple producers by using a questionnaire. The farms were chosen by random sampling method and the data were analyzed by the chi-square test which was used to test relationship among variables. The result of the analyses showed that there is a significant difference between the farms participating and non-participating in GSCIS, considering social security status, farmer's experience, membership of a cooperative, ag- ricultural income level, non agricultural income status, agricultural advisory status, inter- net use, agricultural credit use, tractor ownership, farmers' experience in apple produc- tion, shapes of apple orchards and varieties of apples grown. In conclusion it is suggested that effective service delivery by insurance service providers will ensure continuity of producers' participation in agricultural insurance and also participation by producers who are yet to participate. Producers should be informed and be aware of the studies about government supported crop insurance.",

Results showed that the studied plum genotypes differed significantly in all of the assessed traits. Regarding the physical features, the best results were shown by hybrid 38/62/70, which had the highest fruit weight (56.92 g) and flesh percentage (96.91%), as well as by the new cultivar ‘Nada’, for which a larger fruit was observed in comparison to the standard (45.54 g and 42.24 g, respectively). Also, ‘Nada’ had better sensorial properties such as attractiveness, taste, aroma and consistency in relation to the other promising hybrids and the standard cultivar. From the aspect of all the studied sensorial characteristics, in addition to ‘Nada’, only hybrid 38/62/70 was aligned with the standard cultivar. Out of the studied genotypes, late ripening hybrid 22/17/87 had the best values of parameters of fruit chemical composition such as the soluble solids content (17.01%), total and inverted sugars contents (12.31% and 8.96%, respectively).

Experimental treatments were arranged as factorial design in a completed random block design.

For evaluation of phytochemical characteristics, the contents of the main constituents of the peppermint essential oils such as menthol, menthone, etc. (oxygenated monoterpenes and monoterpenes hydrocarbons) under different treatments were analyzed by GC-FID and GC/MS. Results indicated that using chitosan foliar meaningfully raised the amount of menthol, as the major constituent and quality index (&gt;60% v/w), in the essential oil from the peppermint plants inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal, however, the plants under the foliar spray of chitosan (without inoculum) revealed the highest amounts of menthone and limonene.

The aim of this study was to investigate the salt tolerance mechanisms of V. trifolia when subjected to different concentrations of NaCl (0, 90, 180, 270, 360 and 450 mM) by measuring growth parameters, ion contents, proline, soluble sugar, soluble protein, malondialdehyde (MDA), photosynthetic pigment contents, chlorophyll ﬂuorescence parameters and antioxidant enzyme activities. The plants died when the NaCl concentration reached 450 mM 20 days after salt stress. Biomass and shoot growth were inhibited by increasing salinity, while root growth was promoted at a NaCl concentration ranging from 90 to 270 mM. Na+ and Cl– accumulation was markedly promoted in both leaves and roots with increasing salinity, while no significant changes were observed in the K+ concentration and K+/Na+ ratio in the leaves. Proline, soluble sugar and soluble protein contents increased significantly with increasing salinity. In order to eliminate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by salt-induced oxidative stress, the activities of peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were enhanced. Photosynthetic pigment contents and PSII activity did not significantly decrease under salt stress. The results indicate that the mechanism of salt tolerance in V. trifolia are by ion homeostasis, osmotic balance, antioxidant enzyme induction and photosynthesis adjustment.",

    "abstract": "Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum fuscum, produces regular necrotic spots on oregano leaves and stems, causing severe crop losses. In this study, Koch’s postulates were fulfilled and infection process was investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Leaves and stems of Origanum vulgare were inoculated and incubated at 24°C in wet chambers under high relative humidity. Pathogenicity experiments demonstrated that all tested C. fuscum isolates had infected stems and leaves of oregano. Of all inoculation methods, direct placement of colonized agar plugs on injured epidermis and soaking plant organs in conidial suspension were the most effective. The behavior of the conidia deposited on the oregano leaves was investigated at different time intervals after inoculation: at 12, 18, 32, 48, 67 and 98 h. Conidia produced an appressoria of varying shapes which has been formed at the end of germ tubes of different lengths. Penetration to host tissue through stomata was observed. Acervuli formed on the leaves surface after 98 h after inoculation, typically with sharp pointed setoses.",

Within the examined factor of fertilization treatment, the following variances were represented: a1 – 800 kg ha–1 NPK 15 : 15 : 15 (control plot), a2 – 800 kg ha–1 NPK 15 : 15 : 15 + 2200 kg ha–1 pyrophyllite, a3 – 800 kg ha–1 NPK 15 : 15 : 15 + 1700 kg ha–1 of pyrophyllite, a4 – 800 kg ha–1 NPK 15 : 15 : 15 + 1200 kg ha–1 of pyrophyllite, a5 – 800 kg ha–1 NPK 15 : 15 : 15 + 700 kg ha–1 of pyrophyllite. The purpose of this research was to determine the extent to which the components of the yield and nutritional quality of cabbage depend on the different applied doses of pyrophyllite. The results indicate the fact that the treatments with the application of higher participation of pyrophyllite had a positive effect on the weight and quality of the cabbage head in relation to the control variance.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids can induce defence reactions and reduce the impact of abiotic stresses on plants, yet their impact on the yield of vegetable crops is varied. For this reason, an analysis of the published research on the effect of biostimulants containing amino acids (BCAA) on the quantity and quality of vegetable crop yield was carried out. The results of the research indicate the multidirectional effect of BCAA on vegetable plants and they also show that the use of these biostimulants may increase yield quantity and quality as well as influence biometric features and chemical composition of plants. BCAA may also affect the amount of losses caused by pests and during the storage of vegetables. However, the variability of the effects is very large and depends on many factors: composition of BCAA, time, dose, number and method of application, cultivation cycle, weather conditions, and plant species or even cultivar. Therefore, the effective use of BCAA requires further research, while their proper application in horticultural practice will require taking into account many factors.",

An algorithm describing the relationship between the absolute values of chlorophyll content and the colour components of a leaf image captured with a conventional scanner was developed and tested. The accuracy of the proposed method was compared with that of an optical greenness meters designed for assessing leaf chlorophyll content. The chlorophyll content in the strawberry leaves was correlated with the results of measurements recorded by the two optical meters (SPAD-502, CCM-200) and with RGB values of scans of these leaves. The highest values of correlation coefficients were obtained between the chemical analysis results and mean values of the red colour (R) of the scans. However, varietal differences were evident here, which indicates the need for individual calibrations. In the case of the green colour (G), the accuracy was slightly lower; however, no varietal differences were found, thus one calibration can be used for both cultivars. Three formulas: (R-G)/(R+G), (R-G)/(R+G+B), and R/(R+G+B) were selected and their relationship with the changes in chlorophyll content was tested. These variables did not explain the changes in chlorophyll content better than the variable R. The study confirmed the possibility of using the image capture method for the detection of chlorophyll status in strawberry plantlets cultured in vitro.",

Pre-breeding research showed the highly significant differences between genotypes regarding all traits analysed. Relationship between the bioactive phytochemicals content and antioxidant capacity of fruit were mostly positive and significant. Only correlation between vitamin C and flavonoids was negative (−0.482). Path analysis exhibited the highest positive direct effect of total phenolic content on antioxidant capacity (0.609). Heritability of traits was very high, reaching values above 0.90. The highest genetic advance was observed for flavonoids. Results suggested that the genotype plays the main role in shaping of fruit antioxidant potential. This study indicated that the efficient strawberry breeding focused on obtaining the forms with enhanced bioactive berry properties could be highly possible.",

Nodal segments of strawberry runners were sterilized through keeping in 7% sodium hypochlorite solution containing 1–2 drops of Tween-20 for 10 minutes. Five different Murashige ve Skoog (MS) nutrient media combinations containing 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) and Thidiazuron (TDZ) at the ratios 0.75 and 1.50 mg L–1 were tested (Medium 1: MS + 30 g L–1 sucrose, 7 g L–1 agar, Medium 2: MS + 30 g L–1 sucrose, 7 g L–1 agar + 0.75 mg L–1 BAP, Medium 3: MS + 30 g L–1 sucrose, 7 g L–1 agar + 1.50 mg L–1 BAP, Medium 4: MS + 30 g L–1 sucrose, 7 g L–1 agar + 0.75 mg L–1 TDZ, Medium 5: MS + 30 g L–1 sucrose, 7 g L–1 agar + 1.50 mg L–1 TDZ). During the study, darkening, infection and rooting rates (%), shoot number per plant in both first and second sub-culture, root number per plant and root length (cm) parameters were examined. Use of four genotypes/cultivars and five nutrient media, this study was planned according to the factorial design of randomized plots with three replications. JMP package program and LSD test were used for statistical evaluation of data obtained. It was found that the media including TDZ was generally more effective than BAP in terms of shoot proliferation in both first and second sub-culture. The number of shoots per explant varied from 0 to 4.18 shoots per explant in the first sub-culture. Regarding to mean of genotypes and media, Kaşka cultivar (2.53 shoots per explant) and medium 5 (2.88 shoots per explant) gave the best results, respectively. In the second sub-culture, the number of shoots per explant changed between 0.33 and 4.83 shoots per explant. According to mean of genotypes and media, Kaşka cultivar (3.23 shoots per explant) and medium 4 (3.63 shoots per explant) were found to be the best material and medium, respectively. Regarding to rooting parameters, it was determined that the hormone-free MS medium was highly efficient. The number of root per in vitro plant varied from 0 to 30 roots per in vitro plant. According to mean of genotypes and media, Rubygem cultivar (9.60 roots per in vitro plant) and medium 1 (22.30 roots per in vitro plant) gave the best results, respectively. Root lenght changed between 0 and 5.04 cm. Regarding to mean of genotypes and media, the best values were obtained from Kaşka cultivar (2.10 cm) and medium 1 (3.89 cm), respectively. The value of 0 obtained from rooting parameters refers to in vitro plants that can not be rooted. Infection rate was low in both sub-cultures. Especially in the first sub-culture, it was observed only in the genotype 299 cultured in the medium 3. In the second subculture, infection was detected at low rates in the genotypes 291 and 299 and Rubygem cultivar cultured media 2, 3 and 5. No darkening was observed in the explants cultured in both sub-cultures. Based on genotypes, Kaşka cultivar developed in the Horticulture Department of Cukurova University (Turkey) was found to be superior in terms of both shooting and rooting criteria. Achieving successful results of this cultivar will speed up its use in breeding studies. Based on the study result and literature, it was concluded that the selection of the appropriate hormone type and dose are genotype-dependent.",

The work concerns a study of the opportunities for growth and development of the fungus at different temperatures, pathogenicity tests and the influence of biotechnical preparations on the growth and de- velopment of the fungus in vitro. Studies have shown that mycelial growth of P. negriana is possible at the temperature range from 5 to 32oC with the thermal optimum from 20 to 24oC. The optimal temperatures for the abundant sporulation was 20, 24 and 28oC. The positive results of pathogenicity tests as well as re-isolation of the fungus from inoculated shoots confirmed the possibility of grapevine canes infection by P. negriana. A signifi- cant factor in facilitating infection were injuries of shoots, what indicates that the fungus is a facultative pathogen of grapevine. Biosept Active limited the growth and develop- ment of P. negriana significantly more strongly than Beta-Chikol. When it was applied at the concentration of 0.3%, it caused destruction and loss of fungal hyphae vitality.",

In the course of the experiment chemical analy- ses of the soil (humus, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium) were conducted in four soil horizons: I - 0-25 cm, II - 25-50 cm, III - 50-75 cm, IV - 75-100 cm, as well as analyses of the chemical composition (nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium) of leaves, shoots, adventitious roots and root stumps. The soil analyses revealed that changes in the chemical composition within the soil profile were similar: with in- crease in depth there was a decrease in the levels of humus, potassium, phosphorus and calcium, and an increase in that of magnesium. The chemical composition of leaves and shoots of both rootstock clones did not differ significantly, only the level of calcium in the leaves of rootstock M.9 was significantly higher than that in M.26. The organs of the mother plants (leaves, shoots, roots, root stumps) were characterised by the highest uptake of nitrogen, followed by that of potassium, calcium and magnesium.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of soil application of iodine and sucrose on accumula- tion of heavy metals and trace elements in spinach. In 2009-2010, a pot experiment was carried out with spinach Spinacia oleracea L. 'Olbrzym zimowy' cv. cultivated on min- eral soil. The research included diverse combinations with pre-sowing iodine fertilization (in the form of KI) and soil application of sucrose: 1) - control (without iodine fertiliza- tion and sucrose application), 2) - 1 mg I dm -3 of soil, 3) - 2 mg I dm -3 of soil, 4) - 1 mg I + 1 g sucrose dm -3 of soil and 5) - 2 mg I + 1 g sucrose dm -3 of soil.

A significant influence of iodine fertilization as well as its interaction with sucrose was found in respect of: Li, Ni, Pb, Sr, Ti, Y, V, Ag, Lu, Sc, Tb, Th, Yb, Dy and Sn level in spinach leaves. Fertilization with iodine only (in both tested doses) contributed to a significant increase in V, Sc and Th as well as reduced Ag content in spinach when compared to the control plants. Application of the higher io- dine dose (2 mg I dm -3 of soil) resulted in greater accumulation of Pb and Sn in spinach as well as lowered Sr concentration in comparison to plants treated with 1 mg I dm -3 . Simul- taneous application of iodine (in both doses) and sucrose decreased spinach content of: Li, Ni, Pb, Sr, Y, V, Sc, Tb and Yb when compared to the control object as well as plants fer- tilized only with iodine. In the case of Li, Y, V, Sc and Tb, a stronger influence was found for sucrose applied together with the higher dose of I. Obtained decrease in Sr, Y, Sc and Tb accumulation in spinach (after iodine and sucrose application) correlated with lower soil content of these elements.",

    "abstract": "Sweet corn grain is rich in nutrients. There are many factors, fertilization being one of the most important, which influence the quality of the grain. A special role in improving soil fertility is ascribed to catch crop plants when they are incorporated into the soil. A field experiment was carried out in central-eastern Poland to investigate the effect of phacelia and amaranth catch crops used as green manures on dry matter, sugars and ascorbic acid contents in sweet corn kernels. Catch crops were sown at three dates: 21 July, 4 and 18 August, and incorporated in late October. Sweet corn was cultivated in the first year following manuring. The effect of the green manures was compared to farmyard manure applied at a rate of 40 t·ha and a non-manured control. The highest average dry matter content (27.5%) was determined in corn kernels cultivated without manuring, significantly lower after farmyard manure (26.4%). Catch crops incorporation did not cause significant changes in dry matter content in corn. Corn cultivated after catch crops had higher or similar contents of sugars compared with cultivation after farmyard manure. The most total sugars (8.12% f.m.) were found in corn cultivated after phacelia sown on the 21 of July, the least (7.04% f.m.) in the non-manured control. The highest monosaccharides content was in corn following amaranth sown on the 21 of July and 4 of August (2.50% f.m.), it was significantly lower (2.27% f.m.) after farmyard manure. The highest ascorbic acid content was determined in corn after phacelia sown on the 4 of August (8.88 mg·100 g f.m.) and in amaranth sown on the 21 of July (8.98 mg·100 g f.m.). Significantly less ascorbic acid was found following phacelia sown on the 18 August and in the non-manured control. Ascorbic acid contents in corn from the remaining treatments did not differ significantly. ‘Sweet Wonder F1’ was characterized by higher contents of dry matter and total sugars in kernels than ‘Challenger F1’.",

Therefore, research should be conducted to select cultivars well adapted to less favorable temperature conditions and suitable for cultivation in the field, and to increase their yield. A field experiment was carried out in the years 2006–2008 in the Garden of the Research and Experimental Station of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn to determine the effect on plant cover on the yield and the content of dry matter and organic compounds in sweet pepper fruit. In comparison with the control treatment (without protective cover), the use of non-woven PP covers increased the marketable yield of sweet pepper cv. Iga, Lena and Mira, and it decreased the marketable yield of cv. Zorza. Sweet pepper fruit in the control treatment had the highest average dry matter content. The use of non-woven PP covers contributed to dry matter accumulation only in the fruit of cv. Zorza. The fruit of sweet pepper plants grown without protective cover contained greater amounts of L-ascorbic acid. Non-woven PP covers had no effect on the concentrations of total and reducing sugars, which were highest (subject to cultivar and cultivation method) in 2007.",

A 0–4 disease rating scale was used to analyze the genotypes, and the genotypes were categorized as resistant, moderately resistant and susceptible based on disease incidence and disease severity scores. The findings revealed that there were significant (p &lt; 0.01) differences in disease incidence and severity among genotypes. The study demonstrated that one of the 25 tested C. baccatum genotypes (KTB-11) found to be resistant, and three genotypes (KTB-29, KTB-34, KTB-57 and KTB-72) were rated as moderately resistant to CMV.

Pot plants were treated two times with dikegulac (0.1%) or/and Asahi SL (0.2%) foliar sprays in the late spring. The reaction of blueberry clones to the tested chemicals was different. Dikegulac-treated plants developed significantly more shoots making them a good and efficient source of cuttings when using the traditional propagation. Dikegulac limited the shoot elongation of two studied cultivars (‘Bluecrop’, ‘Darrow’). It also reduced the size of leaf blades but generally did not change the fluorescence and the relative content of chlorophyll. The influence of dikegulac in the applied dose was much stronger than the impact of nitrophenolates. The application of Asahi SL, alone or together with dikegulac, did not give any spectacular and advantageous effects.",

The level of chlorophyll in plants occupied by aphids was clearly lower than the level in plants where aphids were not found. We also found that chlorophyll levels increased with the progress of growing season, the level of chlorophyll differed between date of survey, being higher for the latest survey (mid-June) and that the place where the plant is located is important, wild V. opulus have slightly more level of chlorophyll compared to garden ones.

The pigment content and activities of key enzymes of P. chinensis during leaf discoloration were investigated. The correlation between leaf discoloration and environmental factors (temperature, relative humidity, light) was also analyzed. During the color change, the chlorophyll content decreased, while no significant change in the carotenoid content was observed. The anthocyanin content significantly increased in the middle of the period of color change. The ratios of carotenoids/chlorophyll and anthocyanins/chlorophyll showed an upward trend during the period of color change. The lightness parameter (L) and hue parameter (B) of P. chinensis Bunge leaves showed a fluctuating tendency, reaching the highest value at the beginning of color conversion. The hue parameter (A) showed an upward trend at the color conversion stage. The 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) values showed an upward-downward-upward trend. The contents of ALA and PBG at the end of the color transformation were 2.01 times and 2.88 times higher than those at the beginning. The activity of phenylalaninammo-nialyase increased during the color change period. Chalcone isomerase and chalcone synthase first increased, then declined, reaching their highest level in the middle of color conversion, 261.0 u/g and 157.3 u/g, respectively. Although the activities of both enzymes declined at the end of the color conversion, they were higher than at the beginning of the color change. Anthocyanin content was negatively correlated with temperature, relative humidity, day length, and chalcone isomerase, whereas it was positively correlated with phenylalaninammo-nialyase. The results revealed the reasons for the discoloration of P. chinensis leaves in autumn and thus should be considered when exploring the mechanism of color-changing plants and performing color-changing plant applications.",

There are also difficulties in the method of their obtaining, mainly through in vitro cultures, which is associated with high prices. The experiment compared the growth of maiden trees of four sweet cherry varieties on rootstocks that reduce their vigor, ‘Gisela 5’, ‘Krymsk 5;, and ‘Pi-ku 1’. In addition, rootstocks produced by cheaper means using shoot cuttings were evaluated compared with those from in vitro. The lower efficiency of maiden trees was obtained on the ‘Krymsk 5’ rootstock than on the other two rootstocks. In contrast, the vigor of maiden trees on this rootstock was significantly more potent. Generally, rootstocks derived from in vitro yielded a higher percentage of maiden trees. Additionally, for most of the varieties and years tested, the rootstocks obtained in this way improved the growth of the trees as determined by their diameter and length of the lateral shoots. The activity of the physiological processes of the maiden trees varied with the rootstock used. Maiden trees on the ‘Krymsk 5’ rootstock were most often characterized by the lowest levels of the three tested parameters (E, C, and I CO2). Meanwhile, the net photosynthetic intensity was lowest on the ‘Pi-ku 1’ rootstock.",

When stem tips were cultured in a proliferation medium, four types of proliferation occurred: basal stem cluster bud (occurring at the basal node), tiller bud (occurring at the root), protocorm-like body (occurring at the plant’s base incision), and high-position bud (occurring on plant stem nodes other than the basal nodes). Four methods produced 10.12 proliferation coefficients. In the MS1 medium with 0.5 mg · L−1 NAA, the plantlets rooted 100%, and the rooted plantlets survived 100% after domestication and transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Scorzonera (Scorzonera hispanica L.) is a particularly valuable species among little-known and rarely cultivated vegetables. It is a root vegetable of high dietary and nutritional values. The suitable microbiological activity of the soil favors the growth and development of scorzonera. Biostimulants can positively affect the communities of rhizospheric microorganisms of cultivated plants, including this important vegetable. The studies established the influence of biostimulants on the microbial communities in the scorzonera rhizosphere. Before setting up the field experiment, scorzonera seeds were dressed with fungicide Zaprawa Nasienna T 75 DS/WS or biostimulants Beta-Chikol, Bio-Algeen S-90, and Asahi SL. The laboratory microbiological analyses of scorzonera rhizosphere soil were conducted and determined the total population of bacteria and fungi. The obtained rhizosphere isolates of fungi Albifimbria, Clonostachys, Epicoccum, Penicillium, and Trichoderma sp. were tested to check the influence on fungi pathogenic to scorzonera (Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Rhizoctonia solani). The experiments showed that biostimulants, especially Asahi SL and Beta-Chikol, favored the development of rhizobacteria populations (including Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp.). All biostimulants (Beta-Chikol, in particular) and the fungicide decreased the population of rhizospheric fungi and limited the occurrence of polyphagous fungi in the rhizosphere of scorzonera. Biostimulant Beta-Chikol and fungicide Zaprawa Nasienna T 75 DS/WS were most effective in stimulating the development of antagonistic fungi. Clonostachys rosea, Trichoderma sp., and Albifimbria verrucaria predominated as antagonistic rhizospheric fungi.",

    "abstract": "Species of the Miscanthus genus are plants of considerable economic importance. During their vegetation, they produce a considerable amount of biomass, which makes them a useful source of bioenergy. They are also highly ornamental and, being highly tolerant of salt in the soil, they are useful both in city greeneries and in the reclamation of degraded areas. Several million tons of shrimps per year are fished and processed at present. This generates a huge amount of biowaste, contributing to the progressive degradation of natural environment. Proper utilization of this waste is, therefore, becoming a burning issue. The present study was carried out in the years 2020–2021. The plant material consisted of two species of the genus Miscanthus, i.e. Miscanthus sinensis and Miscanthus × giganteus. Dried and ground biowaste, a material of high nutritional value generated during shrimp cleaning, was used as an experimental component of the substrate. The shrimp biowaste was mixed with the soil at a dose of 5%, 10%, and 15% (v/v). The control was a mineral soil without the dried biowaste. No other fertilizer was used during the plant growth. The plant material was harvested at the end of the growing season in the first year, and at full bloom and at the end of the growing season in the second year. The following mineral components were assessed: N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Cd, Pb, and Ni. Regardless of the species, the plants growing in the substrates enriched with dried shrimps had a higher content of macro- and micronutrients in their leaves in comparison with the controls. In the next years of cultivation, the content of the assessed mineral components in the leaves seemed to drop. The biowaste generated during shrimp cleaning may successfully be used as fertilizer in the cultivation of Miscanthus sinensis and Miscanthus × giganteus.",

In this experiment, the suitability of this technology for the propagation of Chlorophytum comosum (Thunb.) Jacques was assessed. In vitro culture was carried out using a conventional technique on solid media and liquid media using the SETIS™ bioreactor. In addition, two culture media differing in macro- and micronutrient content (Murashige &amp; Skoog and Rugini OM), while having the same set of phytohormones were evaluated in both systems. Explants obtained from the flower stalk of the plants were used to establish the culture. The effectiveness of the cultures after the first and second subculture was assessed. The study has demonstrated that the efficiency of liquid culture carried out using the SETIS™ bioreactor is higher compared to the conventional culture. The highest multiplication coefficient, fresh weight of regenerants and RGR index value in bioreactor cultures was recorded on Rugini OM medium. No statistically significant differences were found between MS medium and Rugini OM medium in terms of shoot length and vigour with this method of culture. When using the conventional method, better results can be achieved with MS medium. This research can be considered as a first step towards the production of Chlorophytum comosum (Thunb.)

All sequences of coat protein (CP) and nucleic-acid binding protein (NABP) regions of Allexivirus isolates available in GenBank were also included in this study. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences identities within each population differed substantially depending on the region of the genome and virus species. The results of selection pressure analysis showed that populations of each Allexivirus underwent negative selection, but the extent of the negative selection varied. It was also concluded that the GarV-A and GarV-C populations underwent a decrease in population size or balancing selection, while the GarV-B and GarV-X populations underwent an increase in population size. It was concluded that both populations of GarV-X evolved independently in each respective area, in contrast to populations of GarV-A, GarV-B and GarV-C.",

    "abstract": "Striving to intensify horticultural production, new and more effective bio-preparations are being sought to stimulate plant growth and development. Bio-algeen S90 is a natural agent based on sea algae, the high bi- ological activity of which results from the high content of natural growth regulators. The aim of the study was to verify the influence of Bio-algeen S90 on the growth, morphological characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence of Rosa multiflora seedlings. The bio-preparation was applied one, two and three times at con- centrations: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg.dm−3. Following parameters were measured to evaluate the response of plants to the bio-preparation: F0 – initial fluorescence, Fm – maximal fluorescence in the dark-adapted state, Fv/Fm – maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII. All concentrations of the bio-preparation and frequency of its application stimulated the number of shoots in a bush, the length of shoots and the diameter of the root crown of plants intended for budding. The most beneficial was the two-fold bio-preparation application at a concentration of 0.4 mg.dm–3. Bio-algeen also positively influenced the chlorophyll fluorescence parame- ters. The highest mean F0 and Fm values were recorded with the two-fold preparation treatment. There was no significant effect of the bio-preparation on the Fv/Fm index, which was within the range of 0.75–0.66.",

The objects of research were the plants of ten canna cultivars: ‘Aida’, ‘America’, ‘Botanica’, ‘Cherry Red’, ‘La Boheme’, ‘Lucifer’, ‘Picasso’, ‘Robert Kemp’, ‘President’ and ‘Wyoming’. Observations were carried out each year in October. Plants with symptoms of stem and root rot, leaves yellowing and wilt were noticed on the investigated plantations. The plants were studied with regard to photosynthetic activity and also by disease index for all cultivars and statistical analysis was carried out upon them. The effect of disease index on photosynthetic intensity and transpiration was determined after the calculation of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Infected plants were collected for mycological analysis. The results of mycological analysis showed that canna plants were colonized by Fusarium spp., Sclerotinia spp. and Alternaria spp. Alternaria alternata, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium avenaceum and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum predominated among pathogenic species. The best health status and the lowest number of colonies were noticed for plants of cv. ‘Botanica’. The infection of canna leaves by pathogenic fungi has negatively affected the intensity of photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance and sub-stomatal CO2 concentration and it was largely related to the degree of infestation of specified varieties of canna. The photosynthesis process was limited especially in ‘La Boheme’, ‘Picasso’, ‘Cherry Red’ and ‘President’ cultivars, which were infected most frequently by pathogenic fungi. It was confirmed by negative Pearson’s coefficient.",

Three-year field experiment was conducted on the potato cultivar ‘Vineta N’. The isolates were classified into different species on the basis of macro- and microscopic features. In each year of the study, A. alternata dominated among the isolated fungi colonizing the leaves of potato plants and the selected weeds. The genetic similarities of A. alternata isolates was determined by the RAPD-PCR method. Tested genetic forms of A. alternata were closely related; only small differences in the pattern of the separated amplification products was evidenced. The dominance of A. alternata on the weeds accompanying potato crops suggests that if weed infestation is extensive, the pathogen is very likely to spread and its population to increase.",

The vines were sprayed after fruit set twice at 15 days interval at concentrations of 0, 0.20%, 0.30% and 0.40%. Fruit were harvested and kept under cold-storage at 0.5 ±0.5°C and 90% RH for 28 days. The physicochemical properties of treated and untreated berries were analyzed at 7 days intervals during the cold storage. The results showed that the pre-harvest application of vegetable extracts reduced the weight loss and inhibited the fruit decay. Treated grape also had higher ascorbic acid contents, total phenolics, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-radical (DPPH) scavenging activity, and higher soluble solid contents, titratable acidity, and reduced sugar:acid ratio. The concentration of 0.30% and cultivar ‘Kings Ruby’ gave the best result as compared to untreated control. In conclusion, pre-harvest vegetables extract application on berries showed higher antioxidant activities in grape berries, and maintained their post-harvest quality. These results indicated that foliar spray of vegetables extract could effectively improve the fruit quality, mainly through the reduction of phenolic content.",

Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) markers were used to identify the most diverse genotypes among the collected lots. Twenty six (26) different SSR primers were used for (genetic) variability among collected genotypes. These primers were selected from literature based on their previous results. These primers produced 135 scorable bands of which 75 were polymorphic, with an average of 55.5% polymorphic loci, and reflected the broader genetic background of the collected genotypes. An average 2.88 polymorphic bands with an average PIC value of 0.49 was recorded. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) divided all genotypes into three main groups. Group one contained three clusters, while group two and three had four and two clusters each. Based on the UPGMA dendrogram, genotypes collected from Kohat, Bannu, Swat and Haripur showed considerable amount of variation. From the present study, it is concluded that SSR markers can be proved as the best tool for the genetic variability of other local and exotic B. rapa genotypes.",

When plants reached 3–4 leaves growths stage, the exposure to 1 kJm–2 and 2 kJm–2 UV-B radiation was done once for 68 and 136 minutes, respectively. The photosynthetic and oxidative stress parameters were determined 2, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exposure. The stimulating effect of UV-B emerged on the 3rd day after exposure. The positive effect of UV-B was more pronounced for ‘Matador’. The highest DPPH radical-scavenging capacity and the highest concentration of α-tocopherols were detected 24 hours after 2 kJ UV-B exposure, but the decrease in photosynthetic rate was the highest as well. Meanwhile, on the 3rd day after 1 kJ UV-B exposure, the indicators of oxidative stress of ‘Matador’ decreased, and the photosynthetic rate increased. This study highlights that low UV-B radiation acts as an eustress, by awaking positive changes in photosynthetic and oxidative stress parameters of spinach.",

The effect of partial spur leaf removal on shedding, as well as on fruit quality and bourse shoot growth, was investigated. Removing spur leaves increased shedding, while there was no effect of partial leaf removal on mature fruit quality in terms of weight, firmness and sum of sugars, detected by HPLC-RI and resulted in lower contents of citric, fumaric and shikimic acids, detected by HPLC-UV. Growth of bourse shoots was poorer in treatments with leaf removal. To summarize, a decreased number of spur leaves caused more intensive fruitlet abscission and poorer bourse shoot growth but had no negative influence on fruit size. These results show the potential use of decreasing spur leaf area to stimulate more intensive natural shedding to support fruitlet thinning, which could be used in combination with prospective mechanical thinning.",

The experimental layout was a randomized complete block design with three replications. Data were collected for GDD (Growth Degree Days), plant height, canopy area, stem number, flower number, aerial fresh yield, aerial dry matter (DM) yield, seed yield, essential oil percentage and oil production. The essential oil compositions were detected in accession 2929 (Tassoj) using GC/MS. Result of combined analysis of variance across two years showed significant differences between years, populations and population x year interaction for all traits (P &lt; 0.01). In comparisons among populations, the population of Avaj and Ijroud with average values of 13.5 and 14.33 g/p had higher aerial dry yield and other agronomic traits followed by Meshkin2 and 3. For seed yield, Ormieh with average values of 3.11 g/p had higher production. For oil content, the populations of Tassoj, Salmas and Sharkord with average values of 1.25 to 1.56% had higher oil content and essential oil production. Result of correlation analysis showed that DM yield was positively correlated with GDD, plant height, canopy area, stem number, flower number. Oil content was negatively correlated with aerial DM yield. The results of PCA analysis showed that the first four components accounted for 50, 20, 12 and 10% of the total variation, respectively. Plant height, canopy area, stem number, flower number and aerial yield in the PCA1, essential oil content and oil production in the PCA2, seed yield in the PCA3 and GDD in PCA4 components were identified as important traits. Using Ward cluster method, the 21 populations were grouped into 3 clusters. In total, 23 compounds were identified in the essential oil from the aerial parts Z. tenuior. The major components in the essential oil were pulegone ranged (47.54 to 65.26%) followed by neo-iso-dihydro carveol, carvacrol, piperitenone, limonene, 1.8-cineole, p-mentha-3,8-dien, alpha-terpinene and terpinen-u-ol. It was concluded that there were wide range of variations for agronomic trait and essential oil in domestic germplasm of Z. tenuior to improved breeding new varieties in Iran.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to do a comparative study of Pseudomonas and Bacillus isolates for their plant growth-promoting (PGP) potential, monitoring the impact of selected isolates on the yield of English ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Isolation, physiological and biochemical characterization, in vitro assay of enzymatic and plant-growth promoting activities of isolates were done. Pseudomonas isolates have been shown to have the ability to use different sources of carbon, to live in the condition of low pH as well as temperature and to produce siderophore. On the other hand, Bacillus isolates have the ability to solubilize phosphate, to produce a greater amount of indol-3-acetic acid (IAA) than Pseudomonas isolates and have an inhibitory effect on the growth of phytopathogenic fungi. In other investigated traits, isolates were similar. The use of Pseudomonas sp. P12 and Bacillus sp. B1 isolates had a positive effect on the plant mass and total yield, which indicate that the use of these isolates can result in a better yield of forage crops.",

Typical FO symptoms showing greenhouse and open field areas used for collecting 62 plants and suspected Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) of 76 tomato plants have been studied respectively. In the researches, four different primers (uni, sp 13, sp 23, sprl) were used to determine the formae speciales and races of 62 isolates of FO isolates from different locations. PCR analyse studies have revealed that 81% of collected samples were Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (FOL) and 19% of them were Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL). Additionally, further PCR analyses have identified that 37% of FOL samples were race 1, 15% were race 2 and 29% were race 3 identified respectively. The different samples of 76 tomato plants were tested with specific primers in PCR amplifications. Their results determined that the strains TYLCV-Israel, TYLCV-Sicilia, TYLCV-Mild of TYLCV found. The molecular techniques have suggested that Israel, Sicilia and Mild strain of TYLCV were present in the tomato production areas at NC. The TYLCV races with single or mixed infections and Fusarium oxysporum formae speciales and races are able to identify in molecular techniques in not only accurately but also reliably.",

Phytostimulators reversed the negative effect of drought on plant growth. Significant interaction was determined for all parameters except stem diameter and stomatal conductivity between phytostimulator and drought applications. The best effect on stomatal conductivity was provided from ISR-2000 (23.5% reduction) application. The highest yield was obtained from the 25% water deficiency applied with 1.91 ton per hectare. It was determined that the best results were obtained from Messenger in Efsane and Asya cultivars and ISR-2000 in the Öz Ayşe cultivar on yield. Therefore, it was concluded that the use of phytostimulators under drought stress is important for the effective use of water.",

Treatments significantly improved yield and fruit physical characteristics (fruit weight, flesh weight, fruit volume, fruit length, fruit diameter and fruit firmness) in comparison to untreated control in both seasons. Fruit chemical characteristics (TSS, Acidity, total sugar contents, ascorbic acid, and total chlorophyll) were mostly improved by most tested treatments in both seasons over the control (water only).

    "abstract": "As well as the expansion of land use due to the short period of saffron growth, its intercropping can also enhance yields and agronomic traits, which usually happens through weed control, shading, and the reduction of soil temperature and growth climate. Therefore, the effects of cumin seed rates in an intercropping on quantitative and qualitative characteristics of saffron were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications in Zaveh, Torbat-E Heydariyeh, Iran, during 2016–2017. Treatments included five levels of cumin seed proportions (25, 50, 75 and 100% of the optimum density). The results of the study indicated the significant effect of cumin seed rates on all the measured traits of saffron except the number of flowers, daughter corms and leaves, as well as safranal value. The minimum and maximum weight of dry stigma was associated with the ratios of 100 and 25% of cumin seed, respectively. Any increase in the ratio of cumin seed by over 25% reduced the amount of other quantitative traits. The cumin seed ratio showed significant effects on the number of umbels per plant, the number of seeds per plant, and seed yield. Since the increase in the number of seeds per plant as a result of low ratios of cumin seed cannot compensate for the reduction of plants, therefore, lower yields would be attained. Totally, increasing shading and less competition, due to lower ratios of seed, improves physical, chemical and biological conditions of the soil, and helps to save more water. Such conditions improve the traits of corm, flower, and photosynthetic area, and so results in an economical saffron yield.",

Tebuconazole applied different concentrations (25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 ppm) were tested. According to the study results, the seedling length and stem length significantly according to the applied doses. The study found out that the stem, leaf and root dry matter contents and leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD values) also statistically significantly changed based on the applied doses. According to the data obtained, the lowest seedling length (12.68 cm) and stem length (4.75 cm) were obtained from a dose of 150 ppm. The highest dry matter content in seedlings was obtained at a dose of 50 ppm in stem (22%) and at 0 ppm (control) in leaves (25.01%) and root. In the study, the highest leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD values) was determined at doses of 150 ppm, 125 ppm and 75 ppm, respectively. This study revealed that various doses of tebuconazole had a positive effect on controlling the height of tomato seedlings and specific quality characteristics of seedlings. In addition, molecular analyzes showed that polymorphism ratios in plants that were applied the substance at different doses varied between 4.70% and 38.09% and the GTS (genomic template stability) value varied between 61.91% and 95.30%. Analyses indicated that the polymorphism ratio increased depending on the increase in dose whereas the GTS value decreased.",

The effect of harvest times on examined all parameters was very significant (p ≤ 0.05). The maximum yields of fresh herb and dry leaf + flower were obtained from after-flowering stage. However, no significant difference was observed between full flowering and after-flowering period for dry leaf + flower yield. On the other hand, the essential oil content (0.93%) and essential oil yield (24.01 L ha–1) in the full flowering stage were found to be higher. The main components of hyssop essential oil were as follows: pinocamphone (38.41–41.85%), isopinocamphone (22.73–22.99%) and β-pinene (7.92–8.94%). Maximum pinocamphone content was observed in the before-flowering period. To harvesting in full flowering of hyssop plant can be a reasonable strategy in terms of high dry leaf + flower yield, essential oil content and yield.",

    "abstract": "Bananas have been grown in both open-field and protected cultivation in the subtropics. There are a very limited number of publications focusing on the impact of cultivation systems on the physico-chemical characteristics of bananas. For this reason, we assessed these fruit characteristics including sugars, malic acid, L-ascorbic acid, macro and micro nutrients well as fat and fatty acids of green and ripe bananas (Musa spp. AAA) in both cultivation systems. Experimental results have showed that many parameters affected the fruit ripening stage more than the cultivation system. Sucrose was the most abundant sugar followed by fructose and glucose in both the unripe and the ripe fruit stages. Sugar content, malic acid and L-ascorbic acid were higher in the ripe stage compared to the green stage. The cultivation system affected only glucose content, however, malic acid and L-ascorbic acid were not affected by the cultivation system. The most abundant macro and micro elements found were potassium and iron respectively. Cultivation system affected only potassium, zinc and manganese contents. Nitrogen and phosphorous, were found to be higher in the ripe stage. However, calcium, zinc, manganese and cupper were higher in the unripe stage. The fatty acid showed low value in the unripe stage for both cultivation systems. The concentration of MUFAs were found to be higher in the unripe stage for open-field condition while SFAs and PUFAs percentage were found to be higher in both cultivation systems. Experimental results clearly showed that physico-chemical characteristics of bananas were mainly affected by the ripening stage while the cultivation systems only affected a few characteristics.",

Zeolite in five levels including Z1 (control), Z2 – zeolite application, Z3 – enriched zeolite with zinc, Z4 – enriched zeolite with copper and Z5 – enriched zeolite with zinc + copper as well as Poultry manure in five levels including P1 (control), P2 – poultry manure application, P3 – fortified poultry manure with zinc, P4 – fortified poultry manure with copper and P5 – fortified poultry manure with zinc+copper were considered as experimental factors. The results showed that the application of enriched poultry manure and zeolite with zinc and copper caused a significant increase in yield components, yield, photosynthetic pigments and nutrient concentrations in green beans compared to separate application of poultry manure or zeolite and control. In terms of poultry manure application, maximum grain yield (1.74 t/ha) by P5 treatment and in case of zeolite application, highest grain yield (1.71 t/ha) was achieved by Z5 treatment, and by not using fertilizer treatments, yield decreased by about 27% and 23.3%, respectively. Therefore, considering the positive response of green bean to the application of enriched poultry manure and zeolite, it seems that the use of these fertilizers while reducing the application of chemical fertilizers is a suitable method for improving plant yield along with healthy and sustainable production of agricultural products.",

Therefore the aim of this research was to determine the tolerance of plant growth and development of Berberis thunbergii DC.

The two-year experiment, conducted during vegetation season, was comprised of the following treatments: K (control, 100% DW), T1 (diluted GW containing 50% DW and 50% GW), T2 (100% GW) and T3 (alternating watering with 100% DW and 100% GW). After statistical analyses the results indicate the similarity between the K and T3 treatments in terms of the plant growth and development of new shoots. T1 treatment leads to slower plant growth, whereas T2 treatment leads to slower development of new shoots, but the vitality of the plants was not observed. Application of T1, T2 and T3 treatments resulted in slight salinization of the soil. In general, the results of this research indicated that GW can be used for irrigation of B. thunbergii, preferably with the application of alternating watering T3 treatment.",

T. chantrieri leaves and rhizomes contain phytochemicals that have been reported to have medicinal properties. T. chantrieri is increasingly hard to find in their native habitat; their seeds have a very slow and low germination rate, whereas propagation in vivo by division takes a long time. A protocol is presented to optimize seed germination and in vitro propagation of T. chantrieri from West Borneo, Indonesia. We have developed a method to improve in vitro germination of freshly harvested T. chantrieri seeds. Pre-sowing treatment with 5 mg L –1 of GA3 for 5 × 24 h and addition of GA3 at 5 mg L–1 to the MS medium significantly promoted earlier and final germination up to &gt;90% within 10 weeks after sowing compared to without GA3, or immersing in GA3 for shorter durations. MS media supplemented with indole acetic acid (IAA) at 0.5 mgL–1 and benzyl adenine (BA) at 1 or 2 mgL–1 was effective to induce shoot proliferation from in vitro germinated seeds; 7–10 shoots were produced after 12 weeks of culture. Shoot proliferation from basal shoot explants were best on MS supplemented with IAA at 0.5 mgL–1. The results of this study have provided a basis for further mass propagation efforts of T. chantrieri.",

For this purpose, 12 different wild P. cerasifera genotypes were used together with some commercially evaluated rootstocks as control. Results showed that plant elongation augmented in parallel with the increments in xylem diameter and xylem area ratio. Increases in cortex area ratio decreased the tree height. Moreover, the plant height was decreased by the elongation of xylem vessels in the vertical axis, but was increased by the decrease in xylem vessel area and the decrease in xylem vessel area increased the plant height.

Flaming (90 kg propane∙ha–1) was applied immediately before thyme emergence or 6 days later, and glufosinate-ammonium (450 g∙ha–1) was applied on the same date as the first flaming. Emergence of thyme began 15–18 days after sowing, was very uneven and in some years it was extended up to 4 weeks. Thyme seedlings were very fine and their initial growth was very slow, which made them highly sensitive to the competition of weeds. The growth rate of thyme increased over time, reaching its greatest value in the last ten days prior to harvest, when the plants gained their average height, depending on the year, from 18.3 to 22.4 cm and developed from 17 to 21 first and second order branches. Weeds started to emerge 8–11 days after thyme was sown and about 3 weeks later their number in the control plots varied depending on the year from 175 to 541 pcs.∙m–2. All methods were very effective in controlling weeds immediately after treatment, but had no soil residual activity and soon new weeds emerged. Four weeks later, the most effective method was spraying with glufosinate-ammonium, which, depending on the year, reduced both the number and fresh weight of weeds by 43 to 85%. Flaming applied at the first or second dates controlled 33–59% and 37–68% of weeds, respectively. After first weeding, the differences between compared treatments disappeared. Essential oil content in the grated herb obtained from the control plants ranged from 2.5 to 3.4%. In the oil, a total of 39 compounds were identified, with the number ranging from 33 to 36 in individual years. More than half of the essential oil was thymol and two other important compounds were γ-terpinene and p-cymene.",

Soil samples to assess nematode populations were taken from 7 sites that differed in terms of cultivation and age: 5 cherry orchards established in different years. Not all nematode taxa responded in the same way to temperature increase. Members of the families Belonolaimidae, Trichodoridae and the genus Aphelenchus increased in number with rising temperatures. The negative water balance limited the number of nematodes in the soil in the layer up to 30 cm, whereas the increase in soil moisture had a positive effect on the development of Paratylenchus spp., and mebers of the family Hoplolaimidae and Heterodera.

The GiSelA 5® rootstock contributed to the preservation of high firmness, high soluble solids content and high soluble solids content/titratable acidity (SSC/TA) ratio. MAP retained good fruit quality, although more favorable quality parameters were recorded after sweet cherry storage in CA, especially with regard to such features as fruit firmness, low respiration rate, small mass loss, low percentage of fungal diseases and good preservation of green color of the stem.",

    "abstract": "Non-degradable polypropylene nonwovens are difficult to dispose and their utilization represents high economic costs. This study was conducted on lettuce cultivated during the spring and autumn seasons in the southern part of Poland to test biodegradable nonwovens as plant covers. Several nonwovens were developed from aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters (ACC), one without modifiers (SB48/11) and three with the addition of fatty acid dimers: two commercial variants (SB20/13, SB21/13) and one made from plant biomass (SB28/13). Nonwoven polypropylene (PP) fleece was included as a control cover. One week after covering with SB48/11, stomatal conductance (gs) increased in lettuce plants in parallel with higher transpiration rate (E) and sub-stomatal CO2 concentration (Ci) relative to the control, but differences in these parameters evened out in mature plants. In the spring, degradable covers with their higher mass per unit area, caused a decrease in marketable yield of lettuce compared to the control PP, resulting mainly from the deterioration of plant quality and lower mean weight per head. In the autumn season, yield was statistically not different between treatments. Yield of spring lettuces was 78% higher compared to the autumn cultivation period. Plants grown under SB20/13 had the lowest dry weight and L-ascorbic acid, while plants under SB21/13 had the highest dry weight and L-ascorbic acid content. Plants under SB28/13 had higher chlorophyll a content. Generally, no effect of covers was noted for carotenoid concentrations. The content of dry weight, L-ascorbic acid, and carotenoids were higher in plants harvested in spring, while no effects of crop season on chlorophyll level were observed. All tested biodegradable nonwovens are a potential substitute for standard polypropylene in autumn trials, but for spring covering unit weight of these materials should be reduced.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the research was to determine an optimum method of postharvest handling of sweet cherry fruits which may contribute to prolonged shelf-life. The following physical factors were examined – storage temperature: 2–4°C, 6–8°C, 18–20°C; postharvest fruit packaging and treatment: Xtend® CH-49 bags + no exposure to UV-C, Xtend® + exposure to UV-C for 120 s or 600 s, no bagging + no exposure to UV-C, no bagging + UV-C for 120 s or 600 s. UV-C irradiation, regardless of the duration and storage conditions, prolonged the storage life of sweet cherry fruit. During the 14-day period of storage, the smallest weight loss as well as the highest number of fruits suitable for consumption were found after exposure to UV-C for 600 s in both Xtend® bags and flat, exposed polyethylene containers. After 28 days, higher amount of fruits suitable for consumption were found after storage at 2–4°C than at 6–8ºC. The most advantageous postharvest treatment method was placing fruits in containers and irradiating them with UV-C for 600 s. However, statistically similar results were obtained also after packing the fruits in Xtend® bags and irradiating them with UV-C for 600 s as well as placing them in containers and irradiation with UV-C for 120 s. In addition, UV-C irradiated fruits for 120 s and 600 s contained significantly more reducing sugars than non-irradiated fruits after 14 days of storage. UV-C irradiated fruits for 600 s also contained the greatest amount of flavonoids. After 28 days of storage, the highest content of flavonoids and phenols was determined in UV-C exposed fruits stored in containers. In addition, it emerged that storing sweet cherry fruit at 2–4°C without bagging contributed to increased total phenolic content compared with fruit stored in Xtend® bags. Packaging cherry fruit in Xtend® bags is the most reasonable when it stored at 6–8°C and at room temperature.",

The preparations used in the experiment affected the improvement of some growth parameters studied, especially the stem diameter and fresh mass of the maidens. Biopuls Original turned out to be the best preparation as it improved significantly three out of five studied growth parameters. A varied impact of the preparations used on the content of micro and macro-elements in leaves was detected. All tested preparations positively influenced the leaves area index of maiden trees except for Blackjak preparation. Photosynthetic intensity of maiden pear trees nourished through leaves was significantly smaller in comparison with the control. Only plants treated with Biopulus Original were characterized by a higher concentration of CO2 and its level in intercellular space. The aim of the second experiment was to check the influence of the application of Trifender WP preparation with hydrogel on the growth of ‘Champion’ maiden quince trees at the stage of planting the rootstocks into a nursery. A better branching of the rootstocks was obtained after the use of the preparation with hydrogel and the hydrogel alone. The trees in these combinations were also characterized by bigger fresh and dry mass of the leaves. The influence of Trifinder WP applied in connection with hydrogel was the best.",

    "abstract": "Tomato is major horticultural plant consumed worldwide. Biotic stress (nematodes, fungus and bacteria) has negative effect on tomato production due to causing reduced yield or plant death. Rootstocks confer resistance to soil-borne pathogen are considered the most effective and environment friendly approach for such a stress management. Thus, development of genetic resources having multiple resistance genes is essential for sustainable tomato breeding. Solanum habrochaites is one of the most studied wild tomato species due to its high genetic potential for biotic and abiotic stresses. In the present study, rootstock potential of an interspecific F1 hybrid derived from S. habrochaites was evaluated as using resistance genes (Frl, I-2, I-3, Mi-3, Pto Ty-1, Ty-3 and Sw-5) specific molecular markers for 6 major tomato diseases and 31 fruit quality traits. The study reported that F1 hybrid had resistance alleles for 5 genes (Frl, I-2, I-3, Pto and Sw-5) confer resistance to fusarium crown rot disease, crown – root rot disease, race 2 and 3 of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis lycopersici, bacterial speck and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), respectively. Despite high performance of F1 hybrid for biotic stress, the study pointed S. habrochaites specific graft incompatibility due to poor rate of grafting efficiency, small fruit formation and low yield.

Soil-borne diseases, caused by pathogenic fungi, are considered to be the main reason for the loss of soybean yields worldwide. The aim of the research was to isolate fungi inhabiting underground parts of soybean in order to identify potential pathogens present in south-east Poland. Research material comprised of seven soybean cultivars grown in field in 2017-2019. Samples collected in three subsequent vegetative seasons constituted soybean plants with disease symptoms on cotyledons, stems and roots. Fragments of the infected plant tissues were subjected to mycological analysis. A total of 1692 pure fungal isolates were obtained from the sampled plants and almost 80% of these isolates were assigned to Fusarium genus. Among Fusarium spp. isolates, the most frequently detected species was F. oxysporum (71.3%). Other detected Fusarium species included: F. graminearum, F. culmorum, F. avenaceum, F. poae, F. solani (syn. Neocosmospora solani), F. sporotrichioides and F. fujikuroi. Other fungi accounted for approx. 19% of the obtained isolates and their main representatives were: Alternaria alternata, Trichoderma sp., Rhizoctonia solani, Mucor sp., Cladosporium sp. and Rhizopus sp. Comparison of these results with published data from other regions of Poland shows differences in prevalence of different species of soil-borne fungi.",
