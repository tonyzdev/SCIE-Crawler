    "abstract": "A multimedia approach to the diffusion, communication, and exploitation of Cultural Heritage (CH) is a well-established trend worldwide. Several studies demonstrate that the use of new and combined media enhances how culture is experienced. The benefit is in terms of both number of people who can have access to knowledge and the quality of the diffusion of the knowledge itself. In this regard, CH uses augmented-, virtual-, and mixed-reality technologies for different purposes, including education, exhibition enhancement, exploration, reconstruction, and virtual museums. These technologies enable user-centred presentation and make cultural heritage digitally accessible, especially when physical access is constrained. A number of surveys of these emerging technologies have been conducted; however, they are either not domain specific or lack a holistic perspective in that they do not cover all the aspects of the technology. A review of these technologies from a cultural heritage perspective is therefore warranted. Accordingly, our article surveys the state-of-the-art in augmented-, virtual-, and mixed-reality systems as a whole and from a cultural heritage perspective. In addition, we identify specific application areas in digital cultural heritage and make suggestions as to which technology is most appropriate in each case. Finally, the article predicts future research directions for augmented and virtual reality, with a particular focus on interaction interfaces and explores the implications for the cultural heritage domain.",

    "abstract": "Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) as a field of research and site for digital efforts has grown significantly since the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Heritage. In contrast to tangible heritage, where cultural identities are manifested through physical objects, intangible cultural expressions are defined through tacit reliances and embodied practices. Such practices are usually bodily communicated, enacted, socially transmitted, and constantly evolving. Burgeoning trends in computational heritage and ICT applications have played a crucial role in safeguarding ICH as they produce versatile resources while making them accessible to the public. Nevertheless, most of the inventions are object-centric and cater to conserving material-based knowledge bases. Few endeavors thus far have fully supported the recording, representing, and reviving of the living nature of ICH. One of the challenges now faced is to find appropriate forms, together with efficient methods, to document the ephemeral aspects of intangible heritage. Another barrier is to find effective ways to communicate the knowledge inextricably linked to people. In response, recent efforts have embarked on capturing the “live” and “active” facets of the embodied cultures, which entails addressing technological and curatorial complexity to communicate the material and immaterial aspects within a meaningful context. Meanwhile, advancements in experimental museology have opened up new modes of experiential narratives, particularly through visualization, augmentation, participation, and immersive embodiment. Novel practices of cultural data computation and data sculpting have also emerged toward the ideal of knowledge reconstruction. This article outlines state-of-the-art models, projects, and technical practices that have advanced the digitization lifecycle for ICH resources. The review focuses on several critical but less studied tasks within digital archiving, computational encoding, conceptual representation, and interactive engagement with the intangible cultural elements. We aim at identifying the advancements and gaps in the existing conventions, and to envision opportunities for transmitting embodied knowledge in intangible heritage.",

    "abstract": "The increasing creation of 3D cultural heritage models has resulted in a need for the establishment of centralized digital archives. We advocate open repositories of scientifically authenticated 3D models based on the example of traditional scholarly journals, with standard mechanisms for preservation, peer review, publication, updating, and dissemination of the 3D models. However, fully realizing this vision will require addressing a number of related research challenges. In this article, we first give a brief background of the virtual heritage discipline, and characterize the need for centralized 3D archives, including a preliminary needs assessment survey of virtual heritage practitioners. Then we describe several existing 3D cultural heritage repositories, and enumerate a number of technical research challenges that should be addressed to realize an ideal archive. These challenges include digital rights management for the 3D models, clear depiction of uncertainty in 3D reconstructions, version control for 3D models, effective metadata structures, long-term preservation, interoperability, and 3D searching. Other concerns are provision for the application of computational analysis tools, and the organizational structure of a peer-reviewed 3D model archive.",

    "abstract": "Serious games present a promising opportunity for learning, but the genre still lacks methodologies and tools for efficient and low-cost production, particularly for teacher and domain experts. This article gives an authoring framework that aims to provide structured support, from content design to final implementation. In particular, we have abstracted a conceptual model—the SandBox Serious Game - which relies on a generalization of task-based learning theory. The model invites players to perform cognitive tasks contextually while exploring information-rich virtual environments. We consider it particularly suited for cultural heritage entertainment applications. The model defines games that are set in realistic virtual worlds enriched with embedded educational tasks, which we have implemented as minigames. This approach simplifies the authoring work, which can easily be supported by visual authoring tools for ontology-based urban 3D modeling and implementation tasks, thus allowing an approach similar to the mind-maps concept. We propose a top-down methodology for content preparation, starting from a city-level analysis down to the single points of interest and associated tasks, which are instances of simple predefined minigame/quiz typologies. We provide examples and discuss criteria for selecting task typologies according to the authors' cognitive targets. Finally, we discuss the results of a user test, which took place in a lab, aimed at verifying the acquisition of cultural heritage knowledge in a pleasant and engaging way. Games appear particularly suited for supporting the study of images, especially of iconography. Compared to reading text, a game forces the player to focus more strongly on problems, which favors knowledge acquisition and retention. Learning complex concepts requires an investigative attitude, which can be spurred by well-designed games. Good design involves usability, graphic appeal, appropriate content, and the presence of connections which a player must discover in the content. Players should be asked to pay attention to and reason about their whole game activity - including the relationships between the game content, the brief introduction, and concluding texts. More comprehensive tests are needed to better investigate the educational effectiveness—however, the first results are promising, especially in terms of user motivation and creation of new opportunities for learning about CH.",

    "abstract": "Technology can play a crucial role in supporting museum visitors and enhancing their overall museum visit experiences. Visitors coming to a museum do not want to be overloaded with information, but to receive the relevant information, learn, and have an overall interesting experience. To serve this goal, a user-friendly and flexible system is needed. The design of such a system poses several challenges that need to be addressed in parallel. The user interface should be intuitive and let the visitors focus on the exhibits, not on the technology. Content and delivery must provide relevant information and at the same time allow visitors to get the level of detail and the perspectives in which they are interested. Personalization may play a key role in providing relevant information to individuals. Yet, since visitors tend to visit the museum in small groups, technology should also contribute to and facilitate during-the-visit communication or post-visit group interaction. The PIL project applied at the Hecht museum extended the research results of the PEACH project and tried to address all of these considerations. Evaluation involving users substantiated several aspects of the design.",

    "abstract": "Presentations of virtual cultural heritage artifacts are often communicated via the medium of interactive digital storytelling. The synergy of a storied narrative embedded within a 3D virtual reconstruction context has high consumer appeal and edutainment value. We investigate if 360° videos presented through virtual reality further contribute to user immersion for the application of preserving intangible cultural heritage. A case study then analyzes whether conventional desktop media is significantly different from virtual reality as a medium for immersion in intangible heritage contexts. The case study describes bridge diving at Stari Most, the old bridge in Mostar Bosnia. This application aims to present and preserve the bridge diving tradition at this site. The project describes the site and history along with cultural connections, and a series of quiz questions are presented after viewing all of the materials. Successful completion of the quiz allows a user to participate in a virtual bridge dive. The subjective evaluation provided evidence to suggest that our method is successful in preserving intangible heritage and communicating ideas in key areas of concern for this heritage that can be used to develop a preservation framework in the future. It was also possible to conclude that experience within the virtual reality framework did not affect effort expectancy for the web application, but the same experience significantly influenced the performance expectancy construct.",

    "abstract": "This article attempts to understand how present Virtual Reality (VR) environments can contribute to enhancing the communication of cultural heritage by providing an experience of the past that is acceptable for the younger generation and how museums and cultural institutions should adopt and use such technologies. Aspects of acceptance, experience, and expectation of VR with the underlying values are not well understood but are important for the sustainability of the communication of cultural heritage as a bequest to future generations. We conducted a combined quantitative--qualitative study on the participants who have various prior experience with gaming and VR, and different levels of knowledge on the history presented within the virtual environment. This study investigates how participants accept and are stimulated in terms of personal experience and their expectations and ideas for the future of museums if VR is used for enhancing the learning of cultural heritage. Prior gaming and VR experience were investigated to see whether they do indeed influence the preference for using VR for learning cultural heritage. We demonstrated that particular age groups and background are especially agreeable to virtual reality as environments for learning and experiencing cultural heritage, regardless of their knowledge of the historical context of the virtually reconstructed site. Our findings also revealed important behaviours in our demographics group with regards to user preferred length of time and the believability of the virtual environment and how it influences aspects of their experience such as the exploration of the heritage site, familiarity, and meaning making. The study has implications for the use of VR for enhancing the experience of cultural heritage in museums and cultural institutions.",

    "abstract": "Cultural heritage artifacts often contain details that are difficult to distinguish due to aging effects such as erosion. We propose the revealing flashlight , a new interaction and visualization technique in spatial augmented reality that helps to reveal the detail of such artifacts. We locally and interactively augment a physical artifact by projecting an expressive 3D visualization that highlights its features, based on an analysis of its previously acquired geometry at multiple scales. Our novel interaction technique simulates and improves the behavior of a flashlight: according to 6-degree-of-freedom input, we adjust the numerous parameters involved in the expressive visualization—in addition to specifying the location to be augmented. This makes advanced 3D analysis accessible to the greater public with an everyday gesture, by naturally combining the inspection of the real object and the virtual object in a colocated interaction and visualization space. The revealing flashlight can be used by archeologists, for example, to help decipher inscriptions in eroded stones, or by museums to let visitors interactively discover the geometric details and meta-information of cultural artifacts. We confirm its effectiveness, ease of use, and ease of learning in an initial preliminary user study and by the feedback of two public exhibitions.",

    "abstract": "Location-based systems currently represent a suitable solution to enhance cultural experiences inside museums, as they can satisfy visitors’ needs through the provision of contextualized contents and services. In this framework, a promising approach to captivate the attention of teenagers—a hard to please target audience—is represented by mobile serious games, such as playful activities aiming to primarily fulfil educational purposes. The use of a mobile digital tool during the visit definitely discloses new opportunities for contextual learning scenarios; however, so far, only a few studies have analysed the impact of different communication approaches on visitors’ degree of exploration and acquisition of knowledge. This work aims to enrich this field of research, presenting the conceptual framework; the design principles; and the evaluation results of “Gossip at palace,” a location-based mobile game integrating a storytelling approach. The game was developed for an Italian historical residence to communicate its 18th-century history to teenagers, capitalizing on narrative and game mechanics to foster young visitors’ motivations to explore the museum and facilitate their meaning-making process. Following a mixed-methods perspective, the article firstly describes to what extent the components of the application were appreciated by teenagers as well as by other visitor segments. Secondly, it provides an insight on the effectiveness of the game in facilitating the acquisition of historical knowledge by participants, enriched by considerations on the methods to be adopted when evaluating mobile learning in informal educational settings. Thirdly, players’ degree of use of the digital game throughout the visit is compared to analogous patterns registered for people using a multimedia mobile guide in the same venue. On the one hand, the study pointed out that the game facilitated a wider exploration of the museum; on the other, it highlighted that players mainly gained a superficial knowledge of the proposed contents.",

    "abstract": "Motion capture (mocap) technology is an efficient method for digitizing art performances, and is becoming increasingly popular in the preservation and dissemination of dance performances. Although technically the captured data can be of very high quality, dancing allows stylistic variations and improvisations that cannot be easily identified. The majority of motion analysis algorithms are based on ad-hoc quantitative metrics, thus do not usually provide insights on style qualities of a performance. In this work, we present a framework based on the principles of Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) that aims to identify style qualities in dance motions. The proposed algorithm uses a feature space that aims to capture the four LMA components (B ody , E ffort , S hape , S pace ), and can be subsequently used for motion comparison and evaluation. We have designed and implemented a prototype virtual reality simulator for teaching folk dances in which users can preview dance segments performed by a 3D avatar and repeat them. The user’s movements are captured and compared to the folk dance template motions; then, intuitive feedback is provided to the user based on the LMA components. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, opening new horizons for automatic motion and dance evaluation processes.",

    "abstract": "The visualisation of historical information and storytelling in museums is a crucial process for transferring knowledge by directly and simplistically engaging the museum audience. Until recently, technological limitations meant museums were limited to 2D and 3D screen-based information displays. However, advancements in Mixed Reality (MR) devices permit the propagation of a virtual overlay that amalgamates both real-world and virtual environments into a single spectrum. These holographical devices project a 3D space around the user which can be augmented with virtual artefacts, thus potentially changing the traditional museum visitor experience. Few research studies focus on utilising this virtual space to generate objects that do not visually inhibit or distract the operator. Therefore, this article aims to introduce the Ambient Information Visualisation Concept (AIVC) as a new form of storytelling, which can enhance the communication and interactivity between museum visitors and exhibits by measuring and sustaining an optimum spatial environment around the user. Furthermore, this article investigates the perceptual influences of AIVC on the users’ level of engagement in the museum. This article utilises the Microsoft HoloLens, which is one of the most cutting-edge imagining technologies available to date, in order to deploy the AIVC in a historical storytelling scene “The Battle” in the Egyptian department at The Manchester Museum. This research further seeks to measure the user acceptance of the MR prototype by adopting the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The operational approaches investigated in this study include personal innovativeness (PI), enjoyment (ENJ), usefulness (USF), ease of use (EOU), and willingness of future use (WFU). The population sampling methodology utilised 47 participants from the museum's daily visitors. Results of this research indicate that the WFU construct is the primary outcome of this study, followed by the usefulness factor. Further findings conclude that the majority of users found this technology highly engaging and easy to use. The combination of the proposed system and AIVC in museum storytelling has extensive applications in museums, galleries, and cultural heritage places to enhance the visitor experience.",

    "abstract": "The amount of archaeological literature is growing rapidly. Until recently, these data were only accessible through metadata search. We implemented a text retrieval engine for a large archaeological text collection (~658 million words). In archaeological IR, domain-specific entities such as locations, time periods and artefacts play a central role. This motivated the development of a named entity recognition (NER) model to annotate the full collection with archaeological named entities. In this article, we present ArcheoBERTje, a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model pre-trained on Dutch archaeological texts. We compare the model’s quality and output on an NER task to a generic multilingual model and a generic Dutch model. We also investigate ensemble methods for combining multiple BERT models, and combining the best BERT model with a domain thesaurus using conditional random fields. We find that ArcheoBERTje outperforms both the multilingual and Dutch model significantly with a smaller standard deviation between runs, reaching an average F1 score of 0.735. The model also outperforms ensemble methods combining the three models. Combining ArcheoBERTje predictions and explicit domain knowledge from the thesaurus did not increase the F1 score. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyse the differences between the vocabulary and output of the BERT models on the full collection and provide some valuable insights in the effect of fine-tuning for specific domains. Our results indicate that for a highly specific text domain such as archaeology, further pre-training on domain-specific data increases the model’s quality on NER by a much larger margin than shown for other domains in the literature, and that domain-specific pre-training makes the addition of domain knowledge from a thesaurus unnecessary.",

Physical museums, while being irreplaceable, are limited to a physical space, requiring mobility and physical presence.

In a user study with 62 participants, usability and user experience were explored and the potential contribution of such virtual museums to learning, based on critical, cross-disciplinary, and participatory dialogue, both in cultural and educational institutions/programs has been investigated. The results have confirmed that the system has been well designed and developed, and the user experience was largely positive. The responses from educators and students confirmed that the application holds potential as a learning and education tool in either museums, schools, or when used independently.",

    "abstract": "Emotional engagement with exhibits and artefacts enhances learning by anchoring memories more vividly and improving information retention. However, achieving this level of engagement requires museums to thoughtfully design their displays and narratives to truly resonate with their audience. This study explores the emotional engagement elicited by displaying holograms in museum settings, offering a comprehensive analysis of visitors’ emotional responses and the technological features that influence them. A series of structured interviews were conducted to explore the experiences of diverse participants with holographic exhibits. These interviews involved 16 professionals, including museum experts, designers and cultural heritage practitioners, to gain in-depth insights into their perspectives on holographic displays. The study uncovered various emotional responses, with ‘curiosity’ and ‘wonder’ emerging as predominant sentiments. This indicates that holographic displays have the capacity to significantly enhance visitors’ engagement and learning experiences. The key technological aspects of holography, including three-dimensionality, display method and the lifelike representation, were found crucial in eliciting strong emotional responses and deepening understanding of the content of exhibit. This research highlights the importance of understanding and catering to visitors’ emotional and experiential needs in the evolving landscape of museum exhibit design, and the long-term impact of these experiences, suggesting that the display of holograms can leave a lasting impression and foster sustained interest in museum visits.",

    "abstract": "Cultural heritage artifacts connect us to past generations and provide links to previous worlds that are beyond our reach. We developed TombSeer, an augmented reality application that aims to immerse the wearer in a museum space engaging two senses (seeing and gesturing) through a holographic heads-up interface that brings virtual, historical artifacts “back to life” through gestural interactivity. This article introduces the TombSeer software prototype and highlights the application of embodied interaction to museum visits using an emerging hardware platform for 3D interactive holographic images (e.g., Meta head-mounted display). This article discusses the TombSeer prototype's development and functionality testing with the Tomb of Kitines exhibit, which was conducted at The Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Canada. TombSeer's embodied gestural and visual augmented reality experience functions to aesthetically enhance museum exhibits, cultural heritage sites, and galleries.",

    "abstract": "Video games and their design are complex in nature, given the variety of aspects and challenges to face and the different areas of expertise involved. Furthermore, serious games have an even tougher challenge, since the knowledge acquisition has the same importance and relevance as entertainment and pleasure for the players. Serious games in cultural heritage require additional effort to introduce immersivity and collaboration among players. This article introduces a framework, named FRACH, to conceive, design, and evaluate immersive and collaborative serious games in cultural heritage. In particular, FRACH provides a design framework with steps to follow during the whole process that is from the early design phase to the evaluation phase of a serious game. We assessed the efficacy of our framework, with a specific case study in cultural heritage, by implementing a section of a serious game named HippocraticaCivitasGame , where players were allowed to visit the thermae of the historical site of San Pietro a Corte and Palazzo Fruscione in the city of Salerno, Italy, and to solve a given puzzle. Results of the game evaluation showed that the game was effective in terms of knowledge acquisition, the participants enjoyed the game, were highly involved in the immersive experience, and, finally, positively rated the idea of using the game for educational learning in the field of cultural heritage.",

    "abstract": "Research e-infrastructures, digital archives, and data services have become important pillars of scientific enterprise that in recent decades have become ever more collaborative, distributed, and data intensive. The archaeological research community has been an early adopter of digital tools for data acquisition, organization, analysis, and presentation of research results of individual projects. However, the provision of e-infrastructure and services for data sharing, discovery, access, and (re)use have lagged behind. This situation is being addressed by ARIADNE, the Advanced Research Infrastructure for Archaeological Dataset Networking in Europe. This EU-funded network has developed an e-infrastructure that enables data providers to register and provide access to their resources (datasets, collections) through the ARIADNE data portal, facilitating discovery, access, and other services across the integrated resources. This article describes the current landscape of data repositories and services for archaeologists in Europe, and the issues that make interoperability between them difficult to realize. The results of the ARIADNE surveys on users’ expectations and requirements are also presented. The main section of the article describes the architecture of the e-infrastructure, core services (data registration, discovery, and access), and various other extant or experimental services. The ongoing evaluation of the data integration and services is also discussed. Finally, the article summarizes lessons learned and outlines the prospects for the wider engagement of the archaeological research community in the sharing of data through ARIADNE.",

    "abstract": "Starting from our experience in this domain, we discuss some fundamental concepts about the potentialities of the virtual reconstructions of cultural sites inside museums, with a specific focus on the communication needs, the design, the combination of media, the interaction interfaces, and the embodiment. We conceive a virtual reconstruction as a digital ecosystem, whose main peculiarities are (1) 3D reconstruction, (2) inclusivity, and (3) interactivity. A virtual reconstruction, in a wide sense, should integrate different levels of visualization, both realistic and symbolic; 3D models; metadata; storytelling; behaviors; and tools of visualization and interaction, in order to “reconstruct” and communicate a cultural context, an ecosystem where all the information is integrated. Despite the great advancements of the last years in the digitization process, computer graphics techniques, and archiving strategies, a basic limit of most of virtual museums is that they do not fire up the attention and the involvement of the public: they lack stimulating activities for visitors, narratives metaphors, and emotional impact. The interaction interfaces are not always simple to understand and to control in a few minutes, and they can generate a sense of frustration that causes users to abandon the application after a short and superficial approach. No gap should exist between knowledge and communication. But how can we translate the complexity of the knowledge in appealing to users and into simple applications that fit with the public's need? This article focuses on some communication rules and criteria that are often considered of minor importance by the researchers working in the field of digital cultural heritage but that are really essential to cultural transmission, especially inside museums. We believe that a stronger collaboration between research institutions and museums and among different disciplines would be recommended. Given this premise, we present the Etruscanning EU project, developed in 2011--2013, focused on the virtual reconstruction of two important Etruscan tombs of the Orientalizing period: the Regolini-Galassi tomb in Cerveteri and the tomb n.5 of Monte Michele in Veii.",

    "abstract": "For more than a decade, User eXperience (UX) has grown into a core concept of Human--Computer Interaction (HCI) and has been widely disseminated and accepted in the HCI community. At the same time, Cultural Heritage (CH) has been a favored domain for UX research, while the visitor is able to exploit CH material before, during, and after the visit, having different goals and requirements in each phase. Thus, CH organisations need to carefully explore the potential of investing in UX, as visitor satisfaction and intention to return and spread positive word-of-mouth is closely linked to the destination's overall success. A multitude of methods for UX analysis exist, but a clear overview of the current state of the available UX research methods in CH is missing. Recent studies [Othman 2012; Roussou 2018] have successfully developed frameworks to measure UX in cultural spaces, but most of them still lack understanding about how visitors interact with new technologies and simultaneously with the exhibits. In this article, a survey that describes the conceptual frameworks, models, research methodologies, and paradigms of incorporating Cultural User eXperience (CUX) in applications is reported, as well as the overall interaction between UX and CH and the related aspects that are influenced by the CH application domain and the parameters leading to optimization of the CUX. The outcome of this survey lays ground for understanding and defining the concept of UX research in CH, while current challenges and issues for future work are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Museums offer an ideal environment for informal cultural learning on heritage artifacts, where visitors get engaged in learning due to an intrinsic motivation. Sharing the museum space among visitors allows for collective learning experiences and socializing with each other. Museums aim to design and deploy Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) in order to embrace the physical materialities of artifacts in the visiting experience. TUIs are believed to be more collaborative, attract more visitors, and persuade them to explore further. Cultural learning on heritage artifacts is particularly meaningful from the early age when opinions and attitudes are shaped. Museums accordingly follow a gamification approach (i.e., using game elements in a non-game context) to provide a collaborative and entertaining learning experience to young visitors. In this study, we investigate the implications of merging these two approaches in order to take advantage of the qualities of both TUIs and gamification in an educational museum context. Accordingly, we present TouchTomb and its evaluation in a real-world museum environment. TouchTomb is a situated tangible gamification installation that aims to enhance informal cultural learning for young visitors and to foster engagement and collaboration among them. The basis of the installation is a shared progress bar and three games with different spatial configurations, embedded into a custom fabricated replica of an original ancient Egyptian tomb-chapel wall on a 1:1 scale. Our field study involved 14 school visits with a total number of 190 school pupils (from 10 to 14 years old). We deployed a mixed-method evaluation to investigate how such a tangible gamification approach entertains and educates 15 pupils collectively for a maximum of 15 minutes, including the evaluation procedures. We particularly investigated how the different spatial configurations of the game setups influenced the stages of pupils’ cultural learning, and the levels of engagement and collaboration among them. We conclude the article by discussing the qualities of tangible gamification and its role in facilitating cultural learning. For instance, cultural learning is enhanced by situating heritage artifacts in the experience, and embedding learning in the reward system. Engagement and collaboration among visitors are fostered by creating a sense of ownership and designing a diversity of goals.",

    "abstract": "Historical heritage is demanding robust pipelines for obtaining Heritage Building Information Modeling models that are fully interoperable and rich in their informative content. The definition of efficient Scan-to-BIM workflows represent a very important step toward a more efficient management of the historical real estate, as creating structured three-dimensional (3D) models from point clouds is complex and time-consuming. In this scenario, semantic segmentation of 3D Point Clouds is gaining more and more attention, since it might help to automatically recognize historical architectural elements. The way paved by recent Deep Learning approaches proved to provide reliable and affordable degrees of automation in other contexts, as road scenes understanding. However, semantic segmentation is particularly challenging in historical and classical architecture, due to the shapes complexity and the limited repeatability of elements across different buildings, which makes it difficult to define common patterns within the same class of elements. Furthermore, as Deep Learning models requires a considerably large amount of annotated data to be trained and tuned to properly handle unseen scenes, the lack of (big) publicly available annotated point clouds in the historical building domain is a huge problem, which in fact blocks the research in this direction. However, creating a critical mass of annotated point clouds by manual annotation is very time-consuming and impractical. To tackle this issue, in this work we explore the idea of leveraging synthetic point cloud data to train Deep Learning models to perform semantic segmentation of point clouds obtained via Terrestrial Laser Scanning. The aim is to provide a first assessment of the use of synthetic data to drive Deep Learning--based semantic segmentation in the context of historical buildings. To achieve this purpose, we present an improved version of the Dynamic Graph CNN (DGCNN) named RadDGCNN. The main improvement consists on exploiting the radius distance. In our experiments, we evaluate the trained models on synthetic dataset (publicly available) about two different historical buildings: the Ducal Palace in Urbino, Italy, and Palazzo Ferretti in Ancona, Italy. RadDGCNN yields good results, demonstrating improved segmentation performances on the TLS real datasets.",

    "abstract": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, public spaces such as museums and art galleries are experiencing increased demands to offer virtual online access. While current solutions seek to replace or augment a real visit, online tours often suffer from being too passive and lack in-depth interactivity to keep virtual visitors meaningfully engaged with an exhibition. Museums and art galleries seeking to broaden and engage their audience more deeply should offer intriguing experiences that invite the visitor to explore, to be entertained, and to learn by interacting with the content. We propose a novel virtual museum experience that utilizes multiple visualizations to contextualize a gallery’s digitized artworks with related artworks from large image archives. We make use of the WikiArt dataset that includes more than 200,000 images and offers diverse metadata used for comparative visual exploration. In addition, we apply machine learning methods to extract multifaceted information about the objects detected in the images and to compute similarities across them. Visitors of our virtual museum can interactively explore the artworks using different search filters such as artist, style, or object classes detected within an image. The results are displayed through interactive visualizations offering different perspectives on artwork collections, leading to serendipitous discoveries and stimulating new insights. The utility of our concept was confirmed by an informal evaluation with virtual museum visitors.",

    "abstract": "Digital archives of memory institutions are typically concerned with the cataloguing of artefacts of artistic, historical, and cultural value. Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors’ experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like the ones happening on social media platforms. Citizen curation is proposed in the context of the European project SPICE (Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) as a methodology for producing, collecting, interpreting, and archiving people’s responses to cultural objects, with the aim of favouring the emergence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, viewpoints and motivating users and memory institutions to reflect upon them. We argue that citizen curation urges to rethink the nature of computational infrastructures supporting data management of memory institutions, bringing novel challenges that include issues of distribution, authoritativeness, interdependence, privacy, and rights management. To approach these issues, we survey relevant literature toward a distributed, Linked Data infrastructure, with a focus on identifying the roles and requirements involved in such an infrastructure. We show how existing research can contribute significantly in facing the challenges raised by citizen curation and discuss challenges and opportunities from the socio-technical standpoint.",

    "abstract": "Oracle bone inscriptions (OBIs) are a kind of hieroglyph, used about 3,600 years ago for divination and the recording of events. The characters on these OBIs are of great interest because they are precursors to the modern Chinese characters widely used across Asia today. However, as the OBIs were only discovered in 1899, there are currently few documents to describe them. Hence, recognizing and unlocking the meaning of OBIs helps to understand the ancient history of China, the evaluation of Chinese characters, and more. Currently, deep learning has made great progress and brought about a revolution in the research field of recognition, and shows good potential to meet the challenges of OBIs recognition. Due to the scarcity of resources, many OBIs contain only a small number of instances, which causes dataset imbalance and limits the accuracy of recognition. This paper attempts to provide a suite of OBIs recognition methods comprising an original OBIs dataset creation, dynamic dataset augmentation, and a novel deep learning-based recognition method. To this end, we create an original OBIs dataset and propose a modified Generative Adversarial Network for augmenting the original OBIs dataset. The augmented data is then dynamically selected for training the deep learning model considering the data imbalance problem. A novel model called C-A Net is proposed for OBIs recognition. The results of evaluation experiments show that the dynamical dataset augmentation can effectively locate a suitable training dataset for the deep learning model and solve the problem of imbalanced OBIs distribution. In addition, the recognition accuracy of C-A Net is 91.10%, which is higher than that of eight state-of-the-art models, and thus effectively suppresses the occurrence of overfitting. We also present an original OBIs dataset named OBI125, which is currently the only rubbing-type OBIs dataset that is open to the public. The code is available at http://www.ihpc.se.ritsumei.ac.jp/obidataset.html.",

This study aims to understand the effect of thermal stimuli on virtual dark tourism experiences by employing cross-modal correspondence and the sensation transference theory.

However, while the human eye and brain can perceive visual art and notice the differences, similarities, and influential links between painters, computers employing artificial intelligence find this task far more challenging. In this article we show that computers can automatically analyze paintings of different artists and different schools of art in an unsupervised fashion. Experimental results show that the automatic computer analysis can group artists by their artistic movements, and provide a map of similarities and influential links that is largely in agreement with the analysis of art historians. These results demonstrate that machine vision and pattern recognition algorithms are able to mimic the complex cognitive task of the human perception of visual art, and can be used to measure and quantify visual similarities between paintings, painters, and schools of art.",

    "abstract": "The problem of the restoration of broken artifacts, where large parts could be missing, is of high importance in archaeology. The typical manual restoration can become a tedious and error-prone process, which also does not scale well. In recent years, many methods have been proposed for assisting the process, most of which target specialized object types or operate under very strict constraints. We propose a digital shape restoration pipeline consisting of proven, robust methods for automatic fragment reassembly and shape completion of generic three-dimensional objects of arbitrary type. In this pipeline, first we introduce a novel unified approach for handling the reassembly of objects from heavily damaged fragments by exploiting both fracture surfaces and salient features on the intact sides of fragments, when available. Second, we propose an object completion procedure based on generalized symmetries and a complementary part extraction process that is suitable for driving the fabrication of missing geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real-world fractured objects and software implemented as part of the European Union--funded PRESIOUS project, which is also available for download from the project site.",

A hybrid technique gives us real-time results, sufficient for piloting the ROV from the surface vessel and ensuring a uniform coverage of the site, as well as recording high-definition images using an onboard computer that will later provide a survey with millimetric precision. The measurements are made without any contact and are noninvasive. The time required on-site is minimal and corresponds to the time needed by the ROV to cover the zone. With the photos taken at a frame rate synchronized at 10Hz, the ROV required 2 hours to perform the experiment presented in this article: the survey of the Roman shipwreck Cap Bénat 4 , at a depth of 328m. The approach presented in this work was developed in the scope of the ROV 3D project.

This article provides a conceptual framework that guides the design of a virtual environment that facilitates cultural learning for casual users. The exploratory sequential mixed-method design approach was used as the basis for the overall research design. Five studies involving experts and end users were performed to identify and evaluate the framework components. The framework consists of four important components: (i) Information Design, (ii) Information Presentation, (iii) Navigation Mechanism, and (iv) Environment Setting, and outlines two types of design elements: basic elements, which are essential for cultural learning to take place, and extended elements, which provide options for enhanced user experience. Results from the framework evaluation suggest that the proposed design elements are useful in facilitating learning and that the experience of using the virtual environment affected the end users’ sense of awareness and appreciation toward heritage value and preservation.",

The objectives of this article are twofold. First, the research focuses on the development of a complete working set of a mobile tour application furnished with AR. For such an application to be successfully adopted by the general public, user requirements and application usability are investigated, and the application is designed and implemented to fulfill those findings. Second, the developed application is demonstrated by applying it to a UNESCO designated World Heritage site, Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon, South Korea, and evaluated via a survey instrument developed explicitly for mobile application evaluation. A systematically developed survey instrument from the fields of tourism, information systems, and human-computer interaction is tailored to fit into this research and employed for the application evaluation. The application’s operation flow consists of three main functions: navigation to the points of interest, visualization of information with AR technology, and interactive learning activities with AR-based serious games. Efforts are made to provide a more immersive and interactive experience of the historical, cultural, and architectural details of the heritage site utilizing novel AR visualization methods. The evaluation returned positive results with suggestions of possible refinements for future works. The proposed device-aided tour mechanism is anticipated to enhance tourists’ experiences as well as being important guidance in future mobile tourism application development as to how the application should be designed and implemented to be accepted by the general public.",

It is based on data from social media, a timely and large-scale data source that is nevertheless quite noisy. First, we collect images posted on social media that may refer to a cultural heritage site. Then, we automatically categorize these images according to two dimensions: whether they are indeed a photo in which a cultural heritage resource is the main subject, and whether they represent damage. Both categorizations are challenging image classification tasks, given the ambiguity of these visual categories; we tackle both tasks using a convolutional neural network. We test our methodology on a large collection of thousands of images from the web and social media, which exhibit the diversity and noise that is typical of these sources, and contain buildings and other architectural elements, heritage and not-heritage, damaged by disasters as well as intact. Our results show that while the automatic classification is not perfect, it can greatly reduce the manual effort required to find photos of damaged cultural heritage by accurately detecting relevant candidates to be examined by a cultural heritage professional.",

    "abstract": "Digital technologies are being introduced in museums and other informal learning environments alongside more traditional interpretive and communication media. An increasing number of studies has proved the potential of digitally mediated cultural heritage experiences. However, there is still a lot of controversy as to the advantages and disadvantages of introducing the digital into museum settings, primarily related to the risks and investment in terms of time and human and financial resources required. This work introduces the MUSETECH model, a comprehensive framework for evaluating museum technology before and after its introduction into a museum setting. One of the unique features of our framework is to consider the evaluation of digital technologies from three different perspectives: the cultural heritage professional, cultural heritage institution, and museum visitor. The framework benefited from an extensive review of the current state of the art and from inputs from cultural heritage professionals, designers, and engineers. MUSETECH can be used as a tool for reflection before, during, and after introducing novel digital media resources. The model covers technologies as diverse as mobile museum guides, Augmented and Virtual Reality applications, hands-on museum interactives, edutainment applications, digitally mediated tangible and embodied experiences, or online approaches used for museum education and learning.",

We reveal how the overlaying and juxtaposing of virtual and physical spaces established a VR architecture that underpinned the extended user experience. Overlaying was used to layer a virtual model onto a corresponding physical set to deliver physical sensations of touch and movement alongside visual and audio stimuli. Juxtaposition was used to embed the VR installation within the surrounding gallery space at each host museum, dealing with the challenges of entering, exiting, spectating, and invigilating the experience. We propose that museum designers can use these techniques to deliver VR installations that are compelling but also scalable and tourable.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of the structural behavior of historic masonry structures like Gothic cathedrals is an important engineering and architectural issue, because of the economic and cultural relevance of such buildings. In this article, we present a complete numerical methodology for point clouds processing, geometrical and parametric 3D modeling, and finite element structural analysis of the spire of the Cathedral of Senlis, France. Our work highlights the particular difficulties linked with digitization and geometrical modeling of highly complex Gothic structures, as well as the need to find compromises between quality and accuracy of extracted data used for geometrical modeling and structural analysis. The methodology enables the semi-automatic transformation of a three-dimensional points cloud, surveyed through terrestrial laser scanner, into a three-dimensional geometrical historic building information modeling (hBIM)-oriented model, and its use to propose a consistent 3D finite element mesh suitable for advanced structural analysis. A full software chain is integrated in the proposed numerical process, so as to use the most important data contained in the real geometry and accurately transposed in the point clouds. After a successful data processing step with 3DReshaper software that proved to be necessary for enhancement of point clouds, a semi-automated geometrical hBIM-oriented modeling step with Rhinoceros5 software and VisualARQ plugin has allowed the construction of a hybrid model by reverse engineering from the point clouds. This 3D model, containing both geometrical and parametric data of the structure, has been exported to the Hyperworks suite for finite element structural analysis under self-weight. Our computations focused on the estimation of the structure deformation and on the distribution of compression and traction stresses in all components of the complex structure. It is found that the spire is safe. Based on reliable and properly detailed results, our study provides significant information for understanding the behavior of the structure and potential damage monitoring.",

In this article two technologies were used: Spatial Augmented Reality, better known as videomapping, to valorize the monument and narrate its story through images and sounds; and Augmented Reality, to facilitate the reading and interpretation of the most important frescoes located along all the internal walls of the Basilica. The goal is to create a unique path starting from the Basilica façade and continuing and winding through the interior spaces. One of the most extensive and best conserved cycles of Late Gothic frescoes in all of Europe unfolds on the nave of the church covering every corner, from the keystones down to the floor. An in-depth bibliographic research confirmed the presence of frescoes also on the exterior of the Basilica façade whose traces, however, are no longer visible today. Pietro Cavoti’ s illustrations give an idea of how the façade has changed over the years, before, during, and after the restorations that permanently removed the already faint traces of frescoes. The purpose of this research is to demonstrate how the combined use of these technologies can be considered a valid aid to support the enhancement, fruition, and understanding of a monument that is very important for the cultural heritage sector and a reference point for the local and religious community.",

    "abstract": "The surge of Mobile Virtual Reality (VR) applications is getting growing attention among researchers and practitioners. The recent literature demonstrates its benefits when used for education purposes, since virtual immersion yields promising results for learning. Leveraging this trend, within the so called “digital didactics”, the need to gauge VR’s effectiveness in the didactic field has become paramount; so far, a method to connect traditional evaluation strategies to novel VR-based learning is still broadly missing. This paper investigates the problem of quantifying the learning outcomes and proposes a new didactic evaluation method for the Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) learning. This research, conducted in a higher education institute, proposes three new Key Performance Indicators, referring to Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy (RBT) : Mnemonic (M) , Transversal (T) , and Disciplinary (D) . A questionnaire was administered by the same teacher who holds the course, to evaluate how well the application communicated information. The participants have been subdivided into two groups with the same knowledge base. The first group (1ACAT) that represents the “VR group” used the app at home to deepen their subject studies; while the second group (1AGR) that represents the “control group” consulted and studied the app only before the test. The results have demonstrated that the “control group” has a greater ability to support purely mnemonic topics (1ACAT 46.9%, 1AGR 53.1%), such as dates and simple definitions. The skills reached by the “VR group” attest to both transveral (1ACAT 52.9%, 1AGR 47.1%) and disciplinary (1ACAT 52.5%, 1AGR 47.5%) knowledge. These results validate the use of VR in teaching, demonstrating both experiential value and student involvement, but even confirming the compensatory function of VR if compared with the irreplaceable role of teachers in guiding learners to learn.",

    "abstract": "Social communication around art and cultural heritage objects occurs mostly on location in the museums and between in-group acquaintances. Such discussions are often brief as competing array of displays and time constraints propel the social arrangement of groups of visitors forward to the next object. Discussions are more often than not fleeting and superficial, and rarely expand beyond the boundary of the group. We postulate that the interactivity afforded by augmented reality that allows the inspection of cultural heritage objects projected onto the real environment of users can be a better experience in terms of depth of viewing. We developed a mobile augmented reality application that allows multiuser interaction and propose that discussions that occur around cultural heritage objects can be replicated and that such discussions can be expanded beyond in-groups. We conducted hypotheses testing across 10 groups of 30 participants to investigate if aspects of social communication can be facilitated or impeded by the perceived realism or artificiality of objects and explore which features of Social AR are more important for communication. The research aims to understand how social communication would work for AR when co-viewing heritage objects. The results have implications for necessitating cross-border and cross-cultural exchanges in an increasingly virtually connected world.",

    "abstract": "While museums are designed to engage and interest various audiences, teenagers are often a neglected segment. Without digital interactivity, it is challenging for a museum to remain exciting and relevant to a young, tech-savvy audience. Games can benefit museums by fostering positive attitudes towards museum spaces and creating more joyful destinations to promote meaningful informal learning combined with entertainment. We developed a dual-gamified mobile experience targeted at teenagers, for the Natural History Museum of Funchal, Portugal: a story-based strategy ( Memories of Carvalhal's Palace — Turning Point) and a game-based strategy ( Memories of Carvalhal's Palace — Haunted Encounters ). These strategies were studied in depth with 159 teenagers (15–19 years old) to understand how gamified strategies might enhance their user experience in a museum. On one hand, game-based strategies, in which game mechanics predominate, can catch a visitor's attention by displaying challenging questions that promote competition. On the other hand, story-based strategies, in which storytelling is prominent, can promote an emotional connection with the museum and exhibits and facilitate awareness of historical facts by including an engaging plot with high-quality media and tightly edited stories. This article reports on lessons learned that museum experience designers and curators can use in designing enjoyable, interactive experiences for teenage visitors.",

Materials identification in works of art is a fundamental step for understanding an object's history or an artist's technique. Comprehensive characterization and diagnosis of the various constituent materials in artworks can provide valuable information on the artist's working methods, as well as significant evidence for dating, provenance attribution, or forgery detection. The development of databases with high-quality data on the pure substances used as artists’ materials is of utmost importance for the identification and characterization of unknown samples. However, there are relatively few open access spectra libraries dedicated exclusively to the cultural heritage field. To address this need, within the frame of the postdoctoral project INFRA-ART, an open access spectral library of art-related materials has been developed. The database is an ongoing compilation of spectra that contains at this moment over 1,000 high-quality attenuated total reflection–FTIR, Raman, and XRF spectra associated with over 500 known reference materials. In this article, a summary of the database structure and design, functionality, and use is presented, in view of the dissemination of this new open access spectral library to the scientific community.",

    "abstract": "Mural image inpainting is far less explored compared to its natural image counterpart and remains largely unsolved. Most existing image-inpainting methods tend to take the target image as the only input and directly repair the damage to generate a visually plausible result. These methods obtain high performance in restoration or completion of some pre-defined objects, e.g., human face, fabric texture, and printed texts, etc., however, are not suitable for repairing murals with varying subjects and large damaged areas. Moreover, due to discrete colors in paints, mural inpainting may suffer from apparent color bias. To this end, in this article, we propose a line drawing guided progressive mural inpainting method. It divides the inpainting process into two steps: structure reconstruction and color correction, implemented by a structure reconstruction network (SRN) and a color correction network (CCN), respectively. In structure reconstruction, SRN utilizes the line drawing as an assistant to achieve large-scale content authenticity and structural stability. In color correction, CCN operates a local color adjustment for missing pixels which reduces the negative effects of color bias and edge jumping. The proposed approach is evaluated against the current state-of-the-art image inpainting methods. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in mural image inpainting.

The digitization of the longest epigraphic text of the Greek civilization (6 m long and 1.75 m high, with approximately 2--3 mm-depth engraved letters) and its surrounding heritage area (around 30 × 30 m), required long planning and the construction of a dedicated acquisition system to speed up the surveying time, limited to few hours per day. Primarily, range sensors were employed in a multi-resolution way, digitizing detailed parts in high resolution and less smoothed areas with lower geometric resolution. Some selected areas were also modeled with our multiphoto geometrically constrained image matching approach to demonstrate that the same accuracy and details can be achieved using either scanners or photogrammetry. The derived 3D model of the heritage is now the basis for further archaeological studies on the incision techniques and a deeper structural analysis on the monument. The challenges of the work stay in the acquisition, processing, and integration of the multi-resolution data as well as their interactive visualization.",

    "abstract": "One of the main problems faced during reconstruction of fractured archaeological artifacts is sorting through a large number of candidate matches between fragments to find the relatively few that are correct. Previous computer methods for this task provided scoring functions based on a variety of properties of potential matches, including color and geometric compatibility across fracture surfaces. However, they usually consider only one or at most a few properties at once, and therefore provide match predictions with very low precision. In this article, we investigate a machine learning approach that computes the probability that a match is correct based on the combination of many features. We explore this machine learning approach for ranking matches in three different sets of fresco fragments, finding that classifiers based on many match properties can be significantly more effective at ranking proposed matches than scores based on any single property alone. Our results suggest that it is possible to train a classifier on match properties in one dataset and then use it to rank predicted matches in another dataset effectively. We believe that this approach could be helpful in a variety of cultural heritage reconstruction systems.",

Sherds that are found in the field usually have little to no visible textual information such as symbols, graphs, or marks on them. This makes manual classification an extremely difficult and time-consuming task for conservators and archaeologists. For a bunch of sherds found in the field, an expert identifies different classes and indicates at least one representative sherd for each class (training sample). The proposed technique uses the representative sherds in order to correctly classify the remaining sherds. For each sherd, local features based on color and texture information are extracted and are then transformed into a global vector that describes the whole sherd image, using a new bag of words technique. Finally, a feature selection algorithm is applied that locates features with high discriminative power. Extensive experiments were performed in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique and show very promising results.",

Though much attention has been devoted to the preservation of the physical supports of drama (e.g., films and tapes), there is a widespread acknowledgment that such tangible heritage is the expression of an intangible notion of drama. This article introduces drama as a form of intangible cultural heritage and presents a solution for its preservation in terms of a formal encoding through a computational ontology. After the review of a formal representation of drama, called Drammar, developed in previous works, we show how an abstraction of drama can be encoded into a digital item. We also show how the method proposed is compliant with the major initiatives for the documentation of cultural heritage, namely CIDOC-CRM and FRBR. Finally, we test the applicability of our solution by showing how the major tenets of two well-known theories of drama can be encoded in Drammar and presenting the results of a focus group of drama scholars and practitioners who have accessed the encoding through a visualization system. The encoding and visualization system have turned out to be a promising support for teaching and investigating drama.",

At the same time, learning games have proved that they can be a source of enjoyment and are, if well-made, powerful tools for communicating knowledge. For cultural heritage projects targeted to raising the awareness of the general public, the integration of interactivity and innovative storytelling techniques can be supporting elements to capture their target audiences' enthusiasm. In particular, games that deal with art history have particular flaws in integrating motivating elements. This observation led us to the development of the 3D online learning game, ThIATRO, that immerses the player an exhibition and, as a side-effect communicates knowledge of art history concepts to the player. Its playful approach not only increases motivation to learn but also raises interest in art history and cultural heritage in general. We provide an overview of the design ideas behind ThIATRO and summarize the results of evaluations conducted with a group of 14-year-old pupils in a classroom environment. The results indicate that ThIATRO changes the player's aesthetic response and allows him or her to perceive art on a deeper level.",

    "abstract": "Content-based image classification is a wide research field that addresses the landmark recognition problem. Among the many classification techniques proposed, the k -nearest neighbor ( kNN ) is one of the most simple and widely used methods. In this article, we use kNN classification and landmark recognition techniques to address the problem of monument recognition in images. We propose two novel approaches that exploit kNN classification technique in conjunction with local visual descriptors. The first approach is based on a relaxed definition of the local feature based image to image similarity and allows standard kNN classification to be efficiently executed with the support of access methods for similarity search. The second approach uses kNN classification to classify local features rather than images. An image is classified evaluating the consensus among the classification of its local features. In this case, access methods for similarity search can be used to make the classification approach efficient. The proposed strategies were extensively tested and compared against other state-of-the-art alternatives in a monument and cultural heritage landmark recognition setting. The results proved the superiority of our approaches. An additional relevant contribution of this work is the exhaustive comparison of various types of local features and image matching solutions for recognition of monuments and cultural heritage related landmarks.",

    "abstract": "Petroglyphs (rock engravings) have been pecked and engraved by humans into natural rock surfaces thousands of years ago and are among the oldest artifacts that document early human life and culture. Some of these rock engravings have survived until the present and serve today as a unique document of ancient human life. Since petroglyphs are pecked into the surface of natural rocks, they are threatened by environmental factors such as weather and erosion. To document and preserve these valuable artifacts of human history, the 3D digitization of rock surfaces has become a suitable approach due to the development of powerful 3D reconstruction techniques in recent years. The results of 3D reconstruction are huge 3D point clouds which represent the local surface geometry in high resolution. In this article, we present an automatic 3D segmentation approach that is able to extract rock engravings from reconstructed 3D surfaces. To solve this computationally complex problem, we transfer the task of segmentation to the image-space in order to efficiently perform segmentation. Adaptive learning is applied to realize interactive segmentation and a gradient preserving energy minimization assures smooth boundaries for the segmented figures. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency and the strong segmentation capabilities of the approach. The precise segmentation of petroglyphs from 3D surfaces provides the foundation for compiling large petroglyph databases which can then be indexed and searched automatically.",

    "abstract": "Folk dances often reflect the socio-cultural influences prevailing in different periods and nations; each dance produces a meaning, a story with the help of music, costumes and dance moves. However, dances have no borders; they have been transmitted from generation to generation, along different countries, mainly due to movements of people carrying and disseminating their civilization. Studying the contextual correlation of dances along neighboring countries, unveils the evolution of this unique intangible heritage in time, and helps in understanding potential cultural similarities. In this work we present a method for contextually motion analysis that organizes dance data semantically, to form the first digital dance ethnography. Firstly, we break dance motion sequences into some narrow temporal overlapping feature descriptors, named motion and style words , and then cluster them in a high-dimensional features space to define motifs . The distribution of those motion and style motifs creates motion and style signatures , in the content of a bag-of-motifs representation, that implies for a succinct but descriptive portrayal of motions sequences. Signatures are time-scale and temporal-order invariant, capable of exploiting the contextual correlation between dances, and distinguishing fine-grained difference between semantically similar motions. We then use quartet -based analysis to organize dance data into a categorization tree , while inferred information from dance metadata descriptions are then used to set parent-child relationships. We illustrate a number of different organization trees, and portray the evolution of dances over time. The efficiency of our method is also demonstrated in retrieving contextually similar dances from a database.",

Such challenges include, for example, the support for a collaborative management of the produced information, their curation from a multilingual perspective to break the language barriers and make collections available to different stakeholders, and the development of services for exposing structured version of data both to users and machines. Platforms satisfying all of these requirements have to support curators activities and, at the same time, provide facilities for engaging the virtual consumers of the produced data.

An instantiation of this architecture is discussed, and we present a use case concerning the management of a digital archive of verbo-visual art.

We empirically evaluate a recurrent neural network with recurrent units, including a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). Additionally, we evaluate hybrid deep-learning models (convolution neural networks [CNN]-LSTM and CNN-GRU) to build a prediction model, facilitating the preventive conservation of an invaluable cultural and national heritage site. The experimental results show that the LSTM unit is an effective and robust model. When comparing the hybrid models (i.e., the joint CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU architectures), we found that the vanilla LSTM and GRU models had superior time-series prediction capabilities.",

This is an extremely valuable innovation for the cultural heritage sector, as it allows a more transparent use of technology in the digital augmentation of museums and cultural heritage sites. The possibility to augment physical objects with sensors detecting when they are moved and manipulated enables scenarios where descriptive information about objects is presented to users at the very exact time they are looking at them, stimulating engagement. This article describes a collaborative research effort among cultural heritage professionals, human--computer interaction experts, and developers that was aimed at investigating the goals and constraints curators consider for a physical encounter between visitors and historic relics. In a case study, we co-designed an interactive plinth centred on tangible interaction and evaluated the impact on the user experience of combining digital information with a hands-on experience of relics of World War I. Our findings show that visitors value this type of tangible interaction with collection objects positively, as it allows the discovery of details and the learning of aspects that normally go unnoticed. The synergy between physical and digital aspects stimulates empathy with the original users of the object and fosters social interaction.",

Our findings provide statistically significant evidence that conversation is related to longer and more absorbed participation in the experience and greater learning regardless of personality traits. Where social interaction is purposefully integrated into the story, more conversation is generated, and these interactive prompts do not disrupt the story flow even though participants report awareness of them.

We present a Serious Game designed to enhance the language acquisition of the Middle Egyptian language. Therefore, using an immersive background of cultural heritage, we bring life to one of the oldest stories recorded, The Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor . The players learn basics and advanced topics of hieroglyphs, while immersing into the story itself. The game was created and refined in an iterative process with two pre-studies. In the current iteration, a larger user study with participants from different backgrounds was conducted to investigate the learning effectiveness of the game and the impact of using an autonomous feature for the learning success.",

    "abstract": "This empirical study was conducted to design, develop, and evaluate children's experiences with a game-based mobile guide (GBMG) application at Sarawak Cultural Village (SCV). The Interaction Design lifecycle model was used for the systematic development of the GBMG application. A total of 45 children took part in this study who were divided into two groups: a paper-based pamphlet and GBMG application group. The Museum Experience Scale were used to evaluate the overall experience with the GBMG application in this study. Results showed that the children in the mobile-based groups have a higher mean for the four dimensions of MES, although the difference is only significant for the emotional connection dimension. This study shows that the game-based mobile guide application did not significantly improve children's museum experience at SCV except for their emotional connection. Additional findings from the Heuristic Evaluation with six Human-Computer Interaction experts offered a deeper understanding of why the GBMG did not improve the children's visitor experience at SCV. The outcome of this study contributes to the research field of game-based mobile applications to enhance children's experiences at living museums with several issues raised for further research.",

    "abstract": "Cross-reality technologies are quickly establishing themselves as commonplace platforms for presenting objects of historical, scientific, artistic, and cultural interest to the public. In this space, augmented reality (AR) is notably successful in delivering cultural heritage applications, including architectural and environmental heritage reconstruction, exhibition data management and representation, storytelling, and exhibition curation. Generally, it has been observed that the nature of information delivery in applications created for narrating exhibitions tends to be informative and formal. Here we report on the assessment of a pilot scene for a prototype AR application that attempts to break this mold by employing a humorous and playful mode of communication. This bespoke AR experience harnessed the cutting-edge live-action capture technique of volumetric video to create a digital tour guide that playfully embellished the museological experience of the museum visitors. This applied research article consists of measuring, presenting, and discussing the appeal, interest, and ease of use of this ludic AR storytelling strategy mediated via AR technology in a cultural heritage context.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus spurred a keen interest in digital technologies for museums as both cultural professionals and the public took notice of their uses and limitations throughout the confinement period. In this study, we investigated the use of digital technologies by museums during a period when in-person interaction was not possible. The aim of the study was to better understand the impact of the confinement period on the use of museum technologies in order to identify implications for future museum experience design. We compared museums across four countries – France, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United States – by conducting an international survey in three languages on the use of digital technologies during the early phase of the pandemic. Additionally, we analyzed the Facebook activity of museums in each country and conducted a series of interviews with digital museology professionals in academia and the private sector. We found that despite a flurry of online activities, especially during the early phase of the pandemic, museums confronted a number of internal and external challenges that were often incongruent with their ability to offer new forms of digital engagement. In general, digital solutions served only as a temporary substitute for the museum experience rather than as an opportunity to usher in a new digital paradigm for cultural mediation, and many cultural professionals cited a lack of digital training as a limiting factor in robust ICT implementation. We also argue that the most successful digital engagement came from those activities that promoted a sense of community or an invitation for self-expression by visitors. We conclude with a framework that describes a ‘virtuous circle of museum participation’, aiming to support public engagement with museums through the development of content that builds on the interconnectedness of on-site and online interactivity.",

    "abstract": "This research explores technologically advanced means to enhance audiences’ connection with cultural heritage assets through participatory creative methods that particularly reinforce young people’s sense of identity and well-being during sensitive “transitional” periods of their lives. Hence, the research investigates how communities can meaningfully connect with cultural heritage through creative experiences, while aiming at lowering the entry barriers to increasing audiences’ participation. For this, the research deploys narrative approaches to illuminate different viewpoints and interpretations of cultural heritage within communities. The contribution of the article is twofold, as it includes a novel approach for developing and re-telling communities’ narratives linked to people, objects, sites, and events in the urban landscape. At the same time, it proposes a workflow to digitise and communicate these narratives through Augmented Reality (AR) Maps by proposing methods for digitisation and producing physical printed elements for the experience. These physical elements are then augmented with digital narratives, delivered through Immersive Web technology. This concept is proposed as a means to document and disseminate the narratives in a way that enhances the public understanding and appreciation of objects and sites. The approach was tested with a class of children in a local primary school in Brighton and Hove (UK) to understand its suitability for community engagement, targeting young audiences. The significance of the research is that it demonstrates the potential of the synergy between creative and digital approaches for enabling meaningful engagement with the cultural heritage while improving the well-being of the participants as well as their sense of community and place.",

The project makes an important contribution to community-centered intangible heritage, while bridging the gap between theory and practice of location-based, non-linear storytelling. Research by Design methodology has been adopted to integrate highly cross-disciplinary insights into the creation, reproduction, and evaluation of a tangible application. A web-based 360° panoramic image viewer platform has been utilised to design and curate an interactive heritage experience, by spatially linking stories (content) to specific locations. The key innovation is the location-based, non-linear and spatial storytelling inside a 3D immersive virtual space where users have the opportunity to interact with intangible heritage stories. GDOM application opened up new opportunities to connect people with intangible heritage to facilitate new forms of environmental knowing, spatial and cultural understanding, and the creation of a sense of place. An in-depth evaluation of GDOM, with both expert and non-expert user groups, confirmed the GDOM application as an effective tool to experience intangible heritage to facilitate better understanding of places compared to a physical experience of heritage in a museum. Potential context of application with immediate benefits have been reported as education and cultural tourism sectors.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce ICON, an ontology that models artistic interpretations of artworks’ subject matter (i.e., iconographies) and meanings (i.e., symbols, iconological aspects). Developed by conceptualizing authoritative knowledge and notions taken from Panofsky’s levels of interpretation theory, ICON ontology focuses on the granularity of interpretations. It can be used to describe an interpretation of an artwork from the pre-iconographical, icongraphical, and iconological levels. Its main classes have been aligned to ontologies that come from the domains of cultural descriptions (ArCo, CIDOC-CRM, VIR), semiotics (DOLCE), bibliometrics (CITO), and symbolism (Simulation Ontology), to grant a robust schema that can be extendable using additional classes and properties coming from these ontologies. The ontology was evaluated through competency questions that range from simple recognition on a specific level of interpretation to complex scenarios. Data written using this model was compared to state-of-the-art ontologies and schemas to both highlight the current lack of a domain-specific ontology on art interpretation and show how our work fills some of the current gaps. The ontology is openly available and compliant with FAIR principles. With our ontology, we hope to encourage digital art historians working for cultural institutions in making more detailed linked open data about the content of their artifacts, to exploit the full potential of Semantic Web in linking artworks through not only subjects and common metadata but also specific symbolic interpretations, intrinsic meanings, and the motifs through which their subjects are represented. Additionally, by basing our work on theories made by different art history scholars in the last century, we make sure that their knowledge and studies will not be lost in the transition to the digital, linked open data era.",

    "abstract": "Cinematic Virtual Reality (CVR) is a style of narrative-based Virtual Reality (VR) experience built on filmed or computer-generated 360-degree videos. Since CVR is becoming more popular and widely accessible, researchers and practitioners have been trying to address challenges such as the conflict between the viewer’s freedom of choice and the creator’s control over where to look, or the risk of missing key story elements due to such freedom. As part of the solution, CVR creators employ attention-guiding cues, introduce viewer interaction, and combine these two techniques into all-encompassing CVR production frameworks. However, there are very few CVR projects that embrace the various differences in the backgrounds, preferences, and expectations of each individual viewer. Further to this, they do not consider the content creator/owners’ perspective when presenting and digitizing stories from the real world, especially when considering viewer’s connection to the cultural significance contained. In this article, a case study is presented to explore the use of adaptability to viewer situations and the coherence to Māori (the indigenous people of New Zealand) storytelling contexts in CVR experiences. In the case study, we began with co-design sessions with storytellers from Te Rau Aroha Marae (an active Māori cultural heritage site in the deep south of New Zealand), about appropriate features to collect from visitors to a virtual storytelling event , then co-built personas as representative tools. 360-degree videos of pūrākau (stories) were then captured and presented via an adaptable VR system. Evaluations were conducted with the storytellers to validate the system and to collect reflections and opinions on both the use of CVR in Māori storytelling and the cultural appropriateness of CVR with adaptability. We conclude this article with a discussion of possible improvements for future CVR frameworks.",

Therefore, how to apply new Earth Observation (EO) technology to digitally reconstruct the complete and real model of ancient buildings without damage has become an urgent issue. This article proposes a multi-scan point cloud hierarchical registration method for 3D reconstruction of the ancient Chinese Great Wild Goose Pagoda based on Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) data. First, a multi-scan point cloud hierarchical registration method is elaborately designed for 3D reconstruction. Then, the outline feature of the ancient Chinese Great Wild Goose Pagoda is automatically extracted by point cloud slicing. Finally, fine modeling is carried out according to the outline feature extracted from the reconstructed point cloud, and after that block combination and texture mapping are conducted for 3D digitalization and documentation. The experiments indicate that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of multi-scan hierarchical registration of the translation and rotation are less than 3 cm and 0.862 ∘ , respectively, and the complete and real model of the Great Wild Goose Pagoda is obtained by fine modeling and texture mapping, which provides an important reference for 3D digital protection of ancient buildings.",

However, when visiting CH sites, due to physical limitations or conservation principles, audiences often focus only on the tangible aspects of CH, while neglecting or struggling to interpret the intangible cultural background. Therefore, presenting the rich intangible cultural contextual information associated with tangible CH is growing in significance, and virtual display methods are gaining prominence. In this work, we select the Shiwan pottery sculptures from over 100 years ago, located in the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall in China, as the subject of our CH research. We conduct a narrative analysis of the intended interpretation of its historical storytelling context. Based on this, we design a new system for embedding ICH narrative information into tangible CH, enabling their aligned comprehension, using 3D scene construction technology, motion capture and virtual reality (VR) technology. The system reimagines the storyline and spatial theatrical scene of Chinese local drama (Cantonese Opera) as ICH in the tangible CH. Results of a comparative user experiment show that the VR immersive interactive system enhances audiences’ aligned understanding of ICH contextual storytelling when visiting CH, and it generates a deep interest in ICH",

To this end, we extensively discuss the concept of similarity and assess the suitability of machine learning techniques for the purposes of classification and typology development. Our methodology covers all steps starting from unordered, unlabelled objects to the emergence of a consistent and reusable typology. The application of this process is exemplarily illustrated by classifying the vessels from a Late Bronze Age cemetery in Eastern Saxony. Despite the individual character of these vessels, we achieved class prediction rates of more than 95%. Such a success was only possible, because we permanently reconciled the output of the learning algorithms with our own expectations in order to identify and eliminate the systematic errors within the typology.",

This project is a collaboration between the Applied Laboratory for Interactive Visualization and Embodiment (ALiVE), City University of Hong Kong, and the Dunhuang Academy. In the Pure Land projects, the digital facsimiles of this cultural paragon have been transformed, providing formative personal experiences for museum visitors. The projects integrate high-resolution digital archeological datasets (photography and 3D architectural models) with immersive, interactive display systems. This work is of great importance because the treasuries of paintings and sculptures at Dunhuang are extremely vulnerable to human presence and, in the case of Cave 220, permanently closed to public visitors. Comprehensive digitization has become a primary method of preservation at the site. Both installations have been shown to the public at a variety of museums and galleries worldwide—to critical acclaim. The projects contribute to new strategies for rendering cultural content and heritage landscapes and suggest the future for embodied museography. Here, each project is described in detail, including innovations in interface technological application and user experience.",

    "abstract": "Ancient Chinese architecture from the Song dynasty is a prominent example of the ancient oriental architectures. The cai-fen system was a module system used for the carpentry of Song architectures, which was specified by the governmental manual, the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) compiled by Li Jie [1103]. We present a rule-based approach for generation of ancient Chinese architectures from the Song dynasty. Based on the special module system and the hierarchical topology of structural patterns in traditional Chinese architectures, the approach parameterizes the wooden elements of buildings and formalizes the construction rules for different architecture styles. In the approach, XML-based description files are generated for displaying the construction process. What the approach generates are standard architectures that strictly follow the ancient Chinese governmental manual. To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, architectures in different styles have been generated based on their corresponding rules. The fundamental difference between our approach and previous works is that we apply and implement the module system in digitalization of ancient Chinese architecture.",

    "abstract": "Games are used in various learning situations and domains, among which is cultural heritage. Storytelling is used in games regarding cultural places, but it often takes a simple form. Thus, the authors’ aim is to investigate the possibility to communicate cultural content through a narrative-based game that can function with multiple narratives. Another core element of our design is the less exploited in serious games combination of endogenous cooperation and competition. The social dimension of our design was expressed through features of Classroom Multiplayer Presential Games (CMPGs), in respect of using a one-to-many game environment projected on a single screen, while enhancing collaborative work in small teams. After providing an overview of the game, we briefly explain how t his was implemented with the use of Twine, a free authoring tool for the creation of interactive stories and text-based games. Subsequently, we present the two interventions we conducted, one with teenage students ( n = 19) and one with post-graduate students ( n = 14), to test how our game design functions with real users. A mixed research methodology was followed in the two trials and data were collected through observation, focus group discussions, short questionnaires, and game reports. Findings indicated that the suggested design is playable but provided helpful insights into its future improvements. The game managed to engage both teenagers and adults with the cultural content and create motivation towards it. Learning gains were registered for both groups, but these were more appreciated by the adult participants, who additionally found the game to be more entertaining. The limited character of our results imposes the need for future extensive evaluation of the game design in both formal and non-formal educational contexts.",

    "abstract": "By bringing together the most prominent European institutions and archives in the field of Classical Latin and Greek epigraphy, the EAGLE project has collected the vast majority of the surviving Greco-Latin inscriptions into a single readily-searchable database. Text-based search engines are typically used to retrieve information about ancient inscriptions (or about other artifacts). These systems require that the users formulate a text query that contains information such as the place where the object was found or where it is currently located. Conversely, visual search systems can be used to provide information to users (like tourists and scholars) in a most intuitive and immediate way, just using an image as query. In this article, we provide a comparison of several approaches for visual recognizing ancient inscriptions. Our experiments, conducted on 17, 155 photos related to 14, 560 inscriptions, show that BoW and VLAD are outperformed by both Fisher Vector (FV) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. More interestingly, combining FV and CNN features into a single image representation allows achieving very high effectiveness by correctly recognizing the query inscription in more than 90% of the cases. Our results suggest that combinations of FV and CNN can be also exploited to effectively perform visual retrieval of other types of objects related to cultural heritage such as landmarks and monuments.",

    "abstract": "Inpainting deteriorated regions in digital Dunhuang murals is important for Dunhuang mural content preservation. Algorithms of mural image inpainting help simplify the digital restoration process of the deteriorated murals. Most of the existing algorithms can restore plausible content for homogeneous missing regions in Dunhuang mural images. However, they often fail to fill accurate color in missing regions that contain complex structures, which is mainly due to the neglect of color relevance between positions in the missing structural region and the non-missing color regions. In this article, we propose a deep learning–based, structure-guided inpainting method for the Dunhuang mural image, which utilizes relevant color information in deep features to improve the color inpainting quality for structural regions. Specifically, we design a structure-guided feature refinement module, which explicitly leverages color relevance implied in structure information to select relevant features for refining features in the missing region. In addition, we propose a multi-step scheme for feature refinement to better propagate non-missing region feature information to the missing region. We conduct experiments on Dunhuang660 and Dunhuang No. 7 Grotto datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve improved color inpainting quality for missing structural regions in Dunhuang mural images.",

    "abstract": "For the protection of cultural heritage, modern techniques have been used alongside traditional methods in recent years. In addition to two modern measurement techniques (Unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanner) that have been the subject of much research as a three-dimensional (3D) data collection technique for the documentation of cultural heritage, the Wearable Mobile Laser Scanner (WMLS) technique has also recently been included in the research. Especially in cultural heritage documentation, it is essential to obtain accurate and precise data as well as fast and high-quality data. This study includes the visual and statistical comparison of the WMLS measurement method, which enables fast data collection, working with the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, in terms of accuracy and precision. To assess the accuracy of the three measurement approaches, eighteen (18) checkpoints (ChP) considered absolute values were measured using total-station techniques. With these data, the root means square error (RMSE) of each point were determined according to all three measurement techniques, and the directional and statistical errors were calculated. As a result of this research, while the terrestrial laser scanner method with an RMSE of 0.8 cm provides the best value, the RMSE of 2.64 cm and 4.92 cm was calculated in unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry and WMLS methods, respectively. At the end of the study, theories and limitations were taken into consideration for all three approaches. It was observed that the obtained accuracy of all three provide the measurement principles of cultural heritage and that a modern measurement tool such as WMLS was a significant innovation.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses the general problem of built heritage protection against both deterioration and loss. To continuously monitor and update the structural health status, a crowd-sensing solution based on powerful and automatic deep learning technique is proposed. The aim of this solution is to get rid of the limitations of manual and visual damage detection methods that are costly and time-consuming. Instead, automatic visual inspection for damage detection on walls is efficiently and effectively performed using an embedded Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This CNN detects the most frequent types of surface damage on wall photos. The study has been conducted in the Kasbah of Algiers where the four following types of damages have been considered: Efflorescence, spall, crack, and mold. The CNN is designed and trained to be integrated into a mobile application for a participatory crowd-sensing solution. The application should be widely and freely deployed, so any user can take a picture of a suspected damaged wall and get an instant and automatic diagnosis through the embedded CNN. In this context, we have chosen MobileNetV2 with a transfer learning approach. A set of real images have been collected and manually annotated and have been used for training, validation, and test. Extensive experiments have been conducted to assess the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed solution, using a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. Obtained results show in particular a mean weighted average precision of 0.868 ± 0.00862 (with a 99% of confidence level) and a mean weighted average recall of 0.84 ± 0.00729 (with a 99% of confidence level). To evaluate the performance of MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor, we conducted a comparative study with other small backbones. Further analysis of CNN activation using Grad-Cam has also been done. Obtained results show that our method remains effective even when using a small network and medium- to low-resolution images. MobileNetV2-based CNN size is smaller, and computational cost better, compared to the other CNNs, with similar performance results. Finally, detected surface damages have also been plotted on a geographic map, giving a global view of their distribution.",

The research is based on the Joconde database maintained by the French Ministry of Culture that contains illustrated artwork records from main French public and private museums representing archeological objects, decorative arts, fine arts, historical and scientific documents, etc. The Joconde database includes semantic metadata that describes properties of the artworks and their content. The developed methods create a data pipeline that processes metadata, trains a Convolutional Neural Network image classification model, makes prediction for the entire collection and expands the metadata to be the base for the SPARQL search queries. We developed a set of such queries to identify noise and silence in the human annotations and to search image content with results ranked according to the relevance of the objects quantified by the prediction score provided by the deep learning model. We also developed methods to discover new contextual relationships between the concepts in the metadata by analyzing the contrast between the concepts’ similarities in the Joconde's semantic model and other vocabularies and we tried to improve the model prediction scores based on the semantic relations. Our results show that cross-fertilization between symbolic AI and machine learning can indeed provide the tools to address the challenges of the museum curators work describing the artwork pieces and searching for the relevant images.",

A quasi-experimental research design has been conducted to check the effectiveness of integrating AR activities in terms of learners’ effectiveness. The sample for this study includes 40 and 64 participants in on-site and off-site groups, respectively. The on-site group visited the real environment and viewed AR-integrated materials such as posters and rhymes; the off-site group visited the school exhibition and viewed the same materials as the on-site group.

This study finds that the use of AR digital materials facilitated the visitors’ experience of cultural heritage and improved participants learning effectiveness, and particularly learning satisfaction and learning motivation, more so in the on-site experience than in the off-site experience. Results also revealed that there was a significant difference in gender and age toward learning motivation and learning effectiveness. With respect to participants with different artistic and educational backgrounds, the results showed no significant differences in learning motivation, learning effectiveness, learning satisfaction, and technology acceptance.

    "abstract": "The emergence of sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools poses a challenge to archives and records professionals, who are accustomed to understanding and documenting the activities of human agents rather than the often-opaque processes of sophisticated AI functioning. Preliminary work has proposed the term paradata to describe the unique documentation needs that emerge for archivists using AI tools to process records in their collections. For the purposes of archivists working with AI, paradata is conceptualized here as information recorded and preserved about records’ processing with AI tools; it is a category of data that is defined both by its relationship with other datasets and by the documentary purpose it serves. This article surveys relevant literature across three contexts to scope the relevant scholarship that archivists may draw upon to develop appropriate AI documentation practices. From the statistical social sciences and the visual heritage fields, the article discusses existing definitions of paradata and its ambiguous, often contextually dependent relationship with existing metadata categories. Approaching the problem from a sociotechnical perspective, literature on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) insists pointedly that explainability be attuned to specific users’ stated needs—needs that archivists may better articulate using the framework of paradata. Most importantly, the article situates AI as a challenge to accountability, transparency, and impartiality in archives by introducing an unfamiliar non-human agency, one that pushes the limits of existing archival practice and demands the development of new concepts and vocabularies to shape future technological and methodological developments in archives.",

    "abstract": "As extended reality continues to grow, new possibilities arise to provide users with novel ways to experience cultural heritage (CH). In particular, applications based on virtual reality (VR), such as virtual museums, have gained increasing popularity, since they can offer new ways for preserving and presenting CH content that are not feasible in physical museums. Despite the numerous benefits, the level of immersion and presence provided by VR experiences still present challenges that could hinder the effectiveness of this technology in the CH context. In this perspective, it is crucial to provide the users with high-fidelity experiences, in which also the interaction with the objects and the characters populating virtual environments are realistic and natural. This article focuses on this challenge and specifically investigates how the combined use of tangible and speech interfaces can help improve the overall experience. To this aim, a immersive VR experience is proposed, which allows the users to manipulate virtual objects belonging to a museum collection (in the specific case, Ancient Egypt remains) by physically operating on 3D printed replicas and to talk with a curator’s avatar to get explanations by using their voice. A user study was conducted to evaluate the impact of the considered interfaces on immersion, presence, user experience, usability, and intention to visit, comparing the richest configuration against simpler setups obtained by either removing the tangible interface, the speech interface, or both (and using only handheld controllers). The results show that the combined use of the two interfaces can effectively contribute at making the CH experience in VR more engaging.",

    "abstract": "Research domain and Problem: HBIM modelling from point cloud data has become a crucial research topic in the last decade since it is potentially considered as the central data model paving the way for the digital heritage practice beyond digitization. Reality Capture technologies such as terrestrial laser scanning, drone-mounted LiDAR sensors and photogrammetry enable the reality capture with a sub-millimetre accurate point cloud file that can be used as a reference file for Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM). However, HBIM modelling from the point cloud data of heritage buildings is mainly manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. Furthermore, image processing techniques are insufficient for classification and segmentation of point cloud data to speed up and enhance the current workflow for HBIM modelling. Due to the challenges and bottlenecks in the scan-to-HBIM process, which is commonly criticized as complex with its bespoke requirements, semantic segmentation of point clouds is gaining popularity in the literature. Research Aim and Methodology: Therefore, this paper aims to provide a thorough critical review of Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods for point cloud segmentation, classification, and BIM geometry automation for cultural heritage case study applications. Research findings: This paper files the challenges of HBIM practice and the opportunities for semantic point cloud segmentation found across academic literature in the last decade. Beyond definitions and basic occurrence statistics, this paper discusses the success rates and implementation challenges of machine and deep learning classification methods. Research value and contribution: This paper provides a holistic review of point cloud segmentation and its potential for further development and application in the Cultural Heritage sector. The critical analysis provides insight into the current state-of-the-art methods and advises on their suitability for HBIM projects. The review has identified highly original threads of research, which hold the potential to significantly influence practice and further applied research.",

However, this endeavour often faces challenges stemming from limited access to heritage sites and varying levels of student interest in the subject matter. This project introduces an augmented reality (AR) book design that seamlessly integrates pop-up three-dimensional models with a dedicated mobile app, effectively illustrating the architectural designs of educational heritages in Hong Kong Central and Western District. An evaluative study was conducted to assess the usability of the AR book for architectural heritage education, which employed a mixed-methods design comprising questionnaire survey with heritage education undergraduate students (N = 80) and semi-structured interviews with a subset of the participants. The results revealed a favourable response to the use of AR technology for virtual representations of cultural heritage, alongside participants’ positive attitudes towards the virtual learning experience facilitated by the AR book. The findings of this study underscore the feasibility and potential benefits of integrating AR technology into architectural heritage education. This integration can offer digitally-mediated learning experiences that actively engage young learners in the exploration and preservation of cultural heritage.",

    "abstract": "The understanding of how users interact with the virtual cultural heritage could provide digital curators valuable insights into user behaviors and also improve the overall user experience through the ability to observe and record interactions of virtual visitors. This article introduces the new User Behavior (UB) tracking algorithm that we developed investigating a salience of the Virtual Reality (VR) panoramic regions. The algorithm extracts the importance of Region of Interest (ROI) determining patterns of the visitors’ virtual movement and interest in combination with statistics of captured browser activity. The input of our algorithm is the virtual online interactive platform (Virtual Museum of the Civic Art Gallery of Ascoli Piceno in Italy) with 81 16,386 × 8,192 pixels panoramic images and several interactive features including maps, thumbnails, and menus. The software engine of the tracking model “Vice Versa” VR operates on inverse functions of all descriptive functions (descriptors), which are assigned particularly to each interactive feature such as viewing multimedia content and observing the panoramic environment. The tracking experiment was performed online and the web virtual museum key study collected behavior information from 171 visitors around the world. Collected data, multimedia and textual content, and the coordinates of the ROIs are then subjected to standard statistics operations to define common patterns of UBs. Thus, we have discovered that the ROIs are mostly mapped onto the artworks and it is possible to obtain patterns about the main interests of users. The developed tool offers a guideline for the panoramic tours design and the potential benefits for museums are to understand the public, verify the effectiveness of choices, and re-shape a cultural offer based on visitors’ needs. Exploiting this kind of user experience, our algorithm ensures relevant feedback during virtual visits and thus paves the way for further development of the recommender system.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence has brought significant opportunities for the advancement of digital humanities research. Intelligent processing of ancient texts, as an essential part of digital humanities, is also undergoing a transformation in research methodologies in the wave of AIGC. The integration of generative pre-trained models with Chinese ancient texts, a vital carrier of Chinese culture, allows for deep mining of the content of these texts and provides services that make ancient texts more understandable and accessible to the general public. In this research, we propose a method that combines the most renowned Chinese anthology, the “Siku Quanshu,” with generative pre-trained models. We developed the SikuGPT model, a generative model for ancient text processing tasks, based on GPT-type language models by continued pretraining. This model was tested on two typical tasks of ancient text processing: translation between classical and modern Chinese, and classification of ancient texts. The findings reveal that our model achieves advantages in understanding and generating scenarios of ancient texts. The capability of SikuGPT in processing traditional Chinese texts helps to promote the organization of ancient information and knowledge services, and advances the international dissemination of traditional Chinese culture.",

It consists of 2,454 images from 22 art-historical depiction styles, including those that have increasingly moved away from lifelike representations of the body since the 19 th century. A total of 10,749 human figures are enclosed by rectangular bounding boxes, with a maximum of four per image labeled by up to 17 keypoints. For machine learning purposes, the data set is divided into three subsets—training, validation, and test—that follow the JSON-based Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) format, respectively. Each image annotation provides metadata from the online visual art encyclopedia WikiArt, in addition to mandatory fields. In this paper, we report on the acquisition and constitution of the data set, address various application scenarios, and discuss the prospects for a digitally supported art history. We show that the data set allows for the study of body phenomena in art, whether on the level of individual figures, which can thus be captured in their subtleties, or entire figure constellations, whose position or distance to each other is considered.",

    "abstract": "Jiayuguan, the first majestic pass at the western end of the Ming Dynasty's Great Wall, is an important world cultural heritage site with high historical, scientific, social, and artistic value. It is primarily constructed of rammed earth and has existed in the form of earth relics for over 600 years. Due to prolonged exposure to natural environmental factors such as rainfall, wind-borne sand, and temperature variations, typical crack diseases have developed significantly, posing a threat to the overall stability of the earthen site. To ensure the long-term safety of rammed earth sites, we explore the primary environmental factors influencing the progression of damages in these sites using monitoring techniques. Additionally, employing data mining techniques to analyze the development trends of these damages for predictive warnings will prove to be a challenging task. In this context, this paper collects monitoring data on crack diseases and the occurrence environment of the Jiayuguan rammed earth site, and uses the wavelet correlation analysis method and Boruta feature screening to find the main environmental factors that affect the development of crack diseases. Then, combining with environmental factor variables, it uses deep learning LSTM, GRU, Transformer and transfer learning Transformer-LSTM, GRU-Transformer, and A-SBiLSTM to predict the development trend of crack diseases on the north wall and beacon tower respectively. It can be seen that (i) Transformer model RMSE=0.0154, R 2 =0.973; (ii) Transformer-LSTM model RMES=0.0290, R 2 =0.937; and (iii) Transformer model and Transformer-LSTM model are closer to the actual SD value than other models. The research results show that the Transformer and Transformer-LSTM models have high accuracy, good stability, and optimal prediction effects. They are suitable for predicting the development trend of crack diseases at the Jiayuguan rammed earth site. These models have application potential in related research fields and provide references for subsequent research.",

    "abstract": "Cultural heritage preservation is increasingly leveraging digital technologies to support art history research and to provide educational experiences to the public. In the case of some Medieval monuments, the myriad of architectural and pictorial transformations suffered due to the passage of time, and the geographical dispersion of its remaining decoration, substantially hinder their understanding. In this paper, we present a novel approach for enriching multi-layered, multi-phase 3D models of cultural heritage monuments with art history knowledge. Such knowledge is presented in the form of image-based annotations, interactive narratives, points of interest, text, and audio, organized into a collection of guided tours enabling visitors to traverse through different historical phases of the monument. A key benefit of our approach is that art historians require no programming skills to easily define all the elements of the interactive narratives. Our approach integrates various multimedia elements seamlessly into 3D models, offering visitors an engaging and informative journey through space and time. We conducted a pilot user evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its value in enhancing visitor engagement and understanding of cultural heritage. The study also provided valuable feedback on the user experience, which allowed us to enhance the final version of the web-based application and the associated narratives.",

This article studies the intersection between education, virtual environments modelling, and cultural heritage preservation, with a focus on the Moorish architectural site of the Bardo in Algiers. Our primary objective is to design an accessible, low cost educational tool that employs a Montessori-informed approach to create an engaging learning experience from a virtual 3D restitution. Initially targeting the general public, we aim at attracting and at interesting a younger audience. In this study, we first investigate tools and platforms that can be employed for achieving this objective. We evaluated several platforms with different degrees of immersion, the chosen technology will serve as the foundation for implementing our educational program. The selected platform has been subjected to an evaluation process, consisting of two phases: knowledge assessment and usability testing of digital learning. This article details the process, from acquisition using a standard DSLR camera to the visualization software, including the integration of annotations and questionnaires using Montessori pedagogy as a guideline. Technical aspects are discussed providing usability results. The work has been devised as a virtual learning environment showcasing the 3D reconstruction of the Bardo Palace of Algiers, a renowned historical landmark located in northern Algeria, known for its Moorish architectural style.",

Seamless interaction modalities driving a culturally engaging experience in AAR is a challenge. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an innovative, flow-aspired AAR experience for head-worn AAR, presented as a gamified historical narrative. User-driven DDA, spatialized auditory feedback and gaze-based interaction are integrated with location-specific musical elements. The DDA component uses heuristic distributions based on round completion time, hints’ usage, remaining time, and additional time needed, weighted to calculate an overall score. Players regardless of their skill level enjoy the game experience based on customized difficulty. Upon completing AAR missions, the user composes their own personalized soundscape. The proposed AAR experience overcomes interaction challenges of personalized AAR, putting forward a voice-assisted system for universal access, also employing accurate hand and gaze interaction, while the user is moving in a busy museum environment. A thorough evaluation showed that combining voice, hand and gaze interaction was of higher usability compared to voice-only and gaze-only interaction. The DDA component matched players’ individual styles, retaining cultural engagement.",

Focusing on the Gusu Prosperous Map as a case study, this research utilizes data visualization techniques and GIS-based mapping methods to delve into the multifaceted historical data in the traditional artwork. Through systematic categorization of tangible and intangible cultural heritage sites, encompassing spatial, temporal, functional, and perceptual dimensions, a digital GIS map is created to illuminate the spatial distribution of diverse cultural sites and highlight the interplay between tangible and intangible heritage. Tangible cultural heritage prototypes are constructed, while the intangible cultural heritage is dissected through perceptual analysis. Utilizing matrix and choropleth graphs, correlations within cultural data are elucidated from spatial and temporal perspectives. Ultimately, this study showcases a digital framework for visualizing cultural data, underscoring the significance of heritage sites. The resulting mapping framework not only translates the cultural panorama depicted in the painting into digital visuals but also holds promise as a valuable resource for landscape design and urban planning endeavors.",

The VR experience integrates archival material, such as Nikos Skalkottas’s compositions, personal letters, and photographs, along with fictional snippets of the composer’s thoughts and memories, to engage users in an interactive journey through his reconstructed memories of 1930’s Berlin. The VR experience has been the focus of a user study with 37 participants, aiming to assess the effectiveness of the experience to promote a deeper connection with the archival material and the composer’s life and work. The study employed a mixed-method approach, with pre- and post-experience questionnaires and interviews. The outcomes revealed a positive attitude towards the VR experience, with participants expressing enjoyment, curiosity, and a sense of immersion. Users particularly enjoyed interacting with the virtual environment and appreciated its aesthetic quality. While the experience evoked historical empathy, helping users learn new aspects of the composer’s life and work, it had a limited impact on their perception of his music, especially for those who had no prior familiarity. Overall, the VR experience was effective in introducing users to Nikos Skalkottas and his world. Its immersive nature sparked curiosity and interest among the participants, providing a unique opportunity for users to engage with classical music history in an innovative and engaging way.",

    "abstract": "Recent efforts to digitize textual, visual, and physical forms of cultural heritage require advanced tools for preservation and analysis. The availability of extensive online data creates a need for intelligent systems to help users and archivists understand latent relationships in these collections. A major challenge in cultural heritage studies is the labor-intensive process of analyzing these materials. Inconsistent linguistic terms and ambiguous concepts in digital documents make it difficult to uncover relationships without expert supervision. Moreover, while advanced models based on large-scale pretraining demonstrate strong performance in extracting semantic relationships, they depend on extensive pretraining on large external datasets, limiting their applicability for smaller or specialized collections. We propose a system that combines natural language processing for entity extraction with graph representation learning to model relationships among documents, categories, and n-grams, resulting in a fully-connected network representation. Unlike methods requiring large-scale pretraining, our approach operates effectively using only the information available in the dataset itself, making it particularly suited for smaller cultural heritage document collections. The system extracts significant terms from document metadata, produces embeddings for each document, and uses these embeddings to build a recommendation system for entity discovery. We tested the system on a collection of early 20th-century documents from Crete, evaluating its performance against alternative methods in collaboration with experts from the archival research organization SALT. This approach not only facilitates deeper insights into smaller, specialized collections but also reduces dependency on vast external training resources, enhancing its practical utility in cultural heritage studies.",

In this article, we explore the possibility of estimating the perceived relatedness of exhibits by museum visitors through a variety of ontological and document similarity-based methods. Specifically, we combine the Wikipedia category hierarchy with lexical similarity measures, and evaluate the correlation with the relatedness judgements of visitors. We compare our measure with simple document similarity calculations, based on either Wikipedia documents or Web pages taken from the Web site for the museum of interest. We also investigate the hypothesis that physical distance in the museum space is a direct representation of the conceptual distance between exhibits. We demonstrate that ontological similarity measures are highly effective at capturing perceived relatedness and that the proposed RACO (Related Article Conceptual Overlap) method is able to achieve results closest to relatedness judgements provided by human annotators compared to existing state-of-the art measures of semantic relatedness.",

    "abstract": "Museums have recognized the need for supporting visitors in fulfilling a personalized experience when visiting artwork collections, and they have started to adopt recommender systems as a way to meet this requirement. Content-based recommender systems analyze features of artworks previously rated by a visitor and build a visitor model or profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, based on those features. For example, the profile of a visitor might store the names of his or her favorite painters or painting techniques, extracted from short textual descriptions associated with artworks. The user profile is then matched against the attributes of new items in order to provide personalized suggestions. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution has changed the game for personalization from “elitist” Web 1.0, written by few and read by many, to Web content potentially generated by everyone ( user-generated content - UGC). One of the forms of UGC that has drawn most attention from the research community is folksonomy , a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this work, we investigate the problem of deciding whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests in the context of recommending digital artworks. We present FIRSt ( F olksonomy-based I tem R ecommender sy St em), a content-based recommender system which integrates UGC through social tagging in a classic content-based model, letting users express their preferences for items by entering a numerical rating as well as by annotating items with free tags. Experiments show that the accuracy of recommendations increases when tags are exploited in the recommendation process to enrich user profiles, provided that tags are not used as a surrogate for the item descriptions, but in conjunction with them. FIRSt has been developed within the CHAT project “Cultural Heritage fruition &amp; e-learning applications of new Advanced (multimodal) Technologies”, and it is the core of a bouquet of Web services designed for personalized museum tours.",

Game development comprised the tiers of data, logic, and presentation. During the data tier, we used taxonomy to extract the cultural components of Taiwan's Atayal tribe. During the logic tier, we employed an analysis of cultural characteristics and comparisons of historical education goals to confirm the game's framework and storytelling engine, selecting a construction management simulation game genre to present tribal life and economic operations. Finally, in the presentation tier, we converted cultural components into elements in the game's user interface. The game evaluation results showed that “Papakwaqa” (our serious game) had positive benefits for enhancing schoolchildren's learning motivation and performance regarding indigenous life and history. Our research verified that integrating the cross-disciplinary methods of anthropologists, history teachers, tribal elders, and game designers to establish instructional goals and design foci for game development and to create a cultural heritage serious game-creation framework warrants further study and effort.",

Three-dimensional models and associated information are presented on a large projection surface controlled by a touch-enabled surface placed at a suitable distance in front of it. Our indirect user interface, dubbed IsoCam , combines an object-aware interactive camera controller with an interactive point-of-interest selector and is implemented within a scalable implementation based on multiresolution structures shared between the rendering and user interaction subsystems. The collision-free camera controller automatically supports the smooth transition from orbiting to proximal navigation, by exploiting a distance-field representation of the 3D object. The point-of-interest selector exploits a specialized view similarity computation to propose a few nearby easily reachable interesting 3D views from a large database, move the camera to the user-selected point of interest, and provide extra information through overlaid annotations of the target view. The capabilities of our approach have been demonstrated in a public event attended by thousands of people, which were offered the possibility to explore submillimetric reconstructions of 38 stone statues of the Mont’e Prama Nuragic complex, depicting larger-than-life human figures, and small models of prehistoric Nuraghe (cone-shaped stone towers).

    "abstract": "Art conservators now have access to a wide variety of digital imaging techniques to assist in examining and documenting physical works of art. Commonly used techniques include hyperspectral imaging, 3D scanning, and medical computed tomography imaging. However, viewing most of this digital image data frequently requires both specialized software, which is often associated with a particular type of acquisition device, and professional knowledge of and experience with each type of data. In addition, many of these software packages are focused on particular applications (such as medicine or remote sensing) and do not permit users to access and fully exploit all the information contained in the data. In this paper, we address two practical barriers to using high-tech digital data in art conservation. First, users must deal with a wide variety of interfaces specialized for applications besides conservation. We provide an open-source software tool with a single intuitive interface consistent with conservators' needs that handles various types of 2D and 3D image data and preserves user-generated metadata and annotations. Second, previous software has largely allowed visualizing a single type or only a few types of data. The software we present is designed and structured to accommodate multiple types of digital imaging data, including as yet unspecified or unimplemented formats, in an integrated environment. This allows conservators to access different forms of information and to view a variety of image types simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Ancient mural paintings often suffer from damage such as color degradation, pigment peeling, and even large-area shedding. Image inpainting techniques are widely used to virtually repair these damages. Generally, the inpainting task can be very challenging when structures are totally missing within a large area. In this article, we study mural image inpainting by incorporating structure information collected from line drawings, and propose a line-drawings-guided inpainting algorithm for repairing the damaged murals of Mogao Grottoes, Dunhuang. Unlike traditional methods that use one single patch to inpaint the target area, the proposed method constructs the target patch with a linear combination of multiple candidate patches. These candidate patches are selected by a sparse model, where two special constraints have been introduced to guarantee the texture similarity and structure continuity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "In musicology and music research generally, the increasing availability of digital music, storage capacities, and computing power enable and require new and intelligent systems. In the transition from traditional to digital musicology, many techniques and tools have been developed for the analysis of individual pieces of music, but large-scale music data that are increasingly becoming available require research methods and systems that work on the collection-level and at scale. Although many relevant algorithms have been developed during the past 15 years of research in Music Information Retrieval, an integrated system that supports large-scale digital musicology research has so far been lacking. In the Digital Music Lab (DML) project, a collaboration among music librarians, musicologists, computer scientists, and human-computer interface specialists, the DML software system has been developed that fills this gap by providing intelligent large-scale music analysis with a user-friendly interactive interface supporting musicologists in their exploration and enquiry. The DML system empowers musicologists by addressing several challenges: distributed processing of audio and other music data, management of the data analysis process and results, remote analysis of data under copyright, logical inference on the extracted information and metadata, and visual web-based interfaces for exploring and querying the music collections. The DML system is scalable and based on Semantic Web technology and integrates into Linked Data with the vision of a distributed system that enables music research across archives, libraries, and other providers of music data. A first DML system prototype has been set up in collaboration with the British Library and I Like Music Ltd. This system has been used to analyse a diverse corpus of currently 250,000 music tracks. In this article, we describe the DML system requirements, design, architecture, components, and available data sources, explaining their interaction. We report use cases and applications with initial evaluations of the proposed system.",

    "abstract": "Cultural heritage institutions are spending considerable effort and resources to provide online access to their collection catalogues and collection management systems, usually through their institutional websites. This improves accessibility and supports research and engagement by diverse user groups, as well as meeting the increasing expectation by audiences that this type of information will be freely and easily available online. However, cultural organisations have not responded to these needs in the same way and have been employing different web tools and features to present their collections online. In this article, we argue that the technological implementation choices and the type of content provided reflect also the philosophy of communication of the institution itself. We used the constructivist approach's learning theory and theory of knowledge and combined these interrelated epistemological and cognitive perspectives to analyse the communication philosophy of a large number of museum online catalogues. The article presents the research carried out initially in 2007 through 2009 and then again in 2017, studying the provision of collections information online by different types of museums across Europe and in the United States. This enabled us to establish categories of presentation types and study the changes over time.

    "abstract": "Over the past years, Virtual Archaeology has introduced more experiential elements in virtual reconstructions, therefore going beyond the traditional visualization of 3D architectural models. In the case of dissemination, these experiences equate to a trip in time, in which users witness what the past was like and learn about it. However, due to a lack of explicit theoretical frameworks and/or systematic evaluation focusing on such experiential elements, it is uncertain whether the intended goals are achieved and why. Based on a novel theoretical framework arising from the concept of Cultural Presence, this article will investigate if and how current virtual environments achieve the feeling of traveling to the past. To that end, six different virtual reconstructions of the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük (Turkey) were built and evaluated in a between-subjects experiment. The results support the role of content meaningfulness, responsive characters, enhanced interaction, and multisensory realism in the achievement of successful Virtual Reality--mediated experiences.",

    "abstract": "In the cultural heritage domain, games have been used to engage users into an active state of learning through immersive and playful interactions that include visually enriched interaction contexts. There is evidence that individual differences in the inherent way people search, process, analyze, comprehend, store, and retrieve visual information in their surrounding environment are reflected in their performance, experience, effectiveness, and efficiency in such environments. Despite the fact that cultural heritage game designers favor learning experiences in such contexts, current design and evaluation practices of cultural heritage games barely consider the gamers’ individual differences in visual information processing. This can be attributed to a deficiency in understanding and modeling the effects among users’ visual behavior, gameplay behavior, and cognitive styles in cultural heritage games toward knowledge acquisition, resulting in insufficient methods of creating cognition-centered user models and considering such human cognitive factors practically, within current state-of-the-art design and evaluation approaches. To address this gap, we selected three known cultural heritage games, adopted a credible cognitive style theory, and performed, over a 6-month period, three separate evaluation user studies ( N =127) following a between-subject, eye-tracking based, experimental design. The results of the evaluation studies revealed that game designers’ decisions, related to visual search, unintentionally favored users with specific cognitive characteristics by influencing their visual and consequently gameplay behavior, resulting in differences in knowledge acquisition. The results of the evaluation studies also revealed correlation effects during gameplay among individual differences in visual information processing, users’ visual behavior strategies, and gameplay behavior. The findings necessitate the consideration of cognitive characteristics as evaluation and design factors when delivering cultural heritage activities that are based on visual search tasks. Their consideration will help us better understand and explain the different information processing approaches in cultural heritage contexts and will drive the design of adaptive mechanisms for delivering personalized cultural heritage activities, tailored to the users’ unique cognitive characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Describing cultural heritage objects from the perspective of Linked Open Data (LOD) is not a trivial task. The process often requires not only choosing pertinent ontologies but also developing new models that preserve the most information and express the semantic power of cultural heritage data. Indeed, data managed in archives, libraries, and museums are complex objects themselves, which require a deep reflection on even nonconventional conceptual models. Starting from these considerations, this article describes a research project: to expose the vastness of one of the most important collections of European cultural heritage, the Zeri Photo Archive, as LOD. We describe here the steps we undertook to this end. First, we developed two ad hoc ontologies for describing all issues not completely covered by existent models (the F Entry and the OA Entry Ontology ). Then we mapped into RDF the descriptive elements used in the current Zeri Photo Archive catalog, converting into CIDOC CRM and into the two new aforementioned models the source data based on the Italian content standards Scheda F ( photography entry , in English) and Scheda OA ( work of art entry , in English). Finally, we created an RDF dataset of the output of the mapping that could show a result capable of demonstrating the complexity of our scenario.",

    "abstract": "Digital heritage interpretation is often untethered from traditional museological techniques and environments. As museums and heritage sites explore the potential of locative technologies and ever more sophisticated content-triggering mechanisms for use outdoors, the kinds of questions that digital heritage researchers are able to explore have become increasingly more complex. Researchers now find themselves in the realm of the immersive, the experiential, and the performative. Working closely with their research participants, they navigate ambiguous terrain, including the often unpredictable affective resonances that are the direct consequences of interaction. This article creates a dialogue between two case studies which, taken together, help to unpack some key methodological and ethical questions emerging from these developments. First, we introduce With New Eyes I See, an itinerant and immersive digital heritage encounter which collapsed boundaries between physical/digital, fact/fiction and past/present. Second, we detail Rock Art on Mobile Phones , a set of dialogic web apps that aimed to explore the potential of mobile devices in delivering heritage interpretation in the rural outdoors. Looking outward from these case studies, we reflect on how traditional evaluation frameworks are being stretched and strained given the kinds of questions that digital heritage researchers are now exploring. Drawing on vignettes from experience-oriented qualitative studies with participants, we articulate specific common evaluative challenges related to the embodied, multimodal, and transmedial nature of the digital heritage experiences under investigation. In doing so, we make the case for reflexivity as a central and more collaborative feature of research design within this field going forward — paying attention to and advocating the reciprocal relationship between researchers and the heritage experiences that we study.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the user study of a mobile cultural heritage game designed to stimulate reflection about a city's history. Aided by location-aware technology, the game fosters the serendipitous discovery of points of interest, historical images and stories, whilst players wander the city. This exploration differs from the typical precalculated path recommendations used by other location-based applications. It triggers reflection about the city's past that is as unique as its visitors. Ours is one of the first studies to attempt an understanding of the effects of serendipitous urban discovery and historic reflection-triggering technologies on user experience. We combined field trials with controlled experiments, analysing perceptions of the experience and value using responses expressed in open-ended questionnaire items. Using thematic coding and sentiment analysis, we observed types of emotional responses, indicating four potential profiles of their likelihood towards future technology adoption. Enthusiastic and Interested users appreciated the freedom of movement choice that created an autonomous experience that fostered a sense of personal accomplishment. The interface interactions of the game, designed to stimulate reflection, supported a feeling of connectedness to others. In contrast, Cynical and Sceptical users were less tolerant of perceived technological issues, requiring more perfection in functionality and design. These users are less likely to be the early adopters of serendipitous location-based apps. The game was developed as part of a large cultural informatics project but, unlike typical evaluations, we conducted this study midway through the project and not at its end. This approach (1) gave the team the possibility to take stock, pause, and reflect and (2) provided insight on future design improvements for increasing the perceived value of serendipitous urban discovery applications. Our results contribute towards a grounded understanding of user experience and help progress the development of cultural heritage applications that incorporate elements of reflection and/or place-based exploration into their functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Cultural presence is a term used to explain and evaluate cultural learning in virtual heritage projects but is less frequently used for video games. Given the increasing importance of video games to cultural heritage, this article investigates explanations of cultural presence that could be communicated by games, especially concerning UNESCO and ICOMOS definitions of cultural significance. The aim is to determine if cultural presence can be communicated via video games and across a range of game genres. Observations derived from game prototyping workshops for history and heritage aided the development of a teachable list of desirable game elements. To distinguish itself from the vagueness surrounding theories of cultural presence, a theory of culturally significant presence is proposed. Culturally significant presence requires three components: culturally significant artifacts and practices; an overarching framework of a singular, identifiable cultural viewpoint; and awareness by the participant of both the culturally significant and the overarching cultural framework and perspective (which gives sites, artifacts, and practices their cultural significance and relational value). As awareness of cultural presence requires time for reflection, single-player games were chosen that were not completely dependent on time-based challenges. Another criterion was cultural heritage content: They must simulate aspects of heritage and history, communicate a specific cultural framework, or explore and reconstruct a past culture. Four games were chosen that simulate a culture, explain archaeological methods, portray indigenous intangible heritage, or explain historical-based ecosystems of the past based on educational guidelines. The games are Assassin's Creed: Origins ; Heaven's Vault ; Never Alone ; and a Ph.D. project: Saxon . Their genres could be described as first-person shooter/open world/virtual tour; dialogue-based puzzle game; 2D platform game; and turn-based strategy game. The aim is not to evaluate the entire range of interactive virtual environments and games, but to examine the applicability and relevance of this new theory and to ascertain whether the four games provided useful feedback on the concept and usefulness of culturally significant presence. A more clearly demarcated theory may not only help focus evaluation studies but also encourage game developers to modify or allow modification of commercial games for classroom teaching of digital heritage.",

    "abstract": "The cultural heritage sector has traditionally been concerned with sharing resources and furthering human knowledge, with particular interest to the issues associated with metadata and interoperability, especially when it comes to the use of technology. These goals and interests in the cultural heritage sector are natural alignments with those of linked data; hence. there has been an increasing interest in the application of linked data in this sector. This article studies the implementation of linked data in the cultural heritage sector, through a systematic literature review of case studies of linked data implementation projects in this sector. The results reflect on the parties involved, the level of collaboration, and the motivation behind these projects. The study suggests that universities and national institutions were the main players in implementing such technologies in the cultural heritage sector, suggesting that there may be some barriers preventing smaller GLAM institutions from implementing linked data projects. The results further suggest that many linked data projects in this sector were primarily exploratory projects, and often performed in a collaborative manner. They further indicate that the most common motivating factors behind these projects were research needs, a desire to contribute to linked data as a movement, and other specific user needs. Reflecting on this systematic literature review, this article makes a set of recommendations for future work to increase the use of linked data in the cultural heritage sector and to remove barriers to adoption.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a general computational model for the extraction of symmetry features of Islamic geometrical patterns' (IGP) images. We describe IGP images using the discrete symmetry groups theory. Our model contains the three following steps. (1) By noting that these patterns fall into three major categories, we begin our indexation process by classifying every pattern into one of these categories. The first pattern category describes all the patterns generated by translation along one direction. Every pattern of this category can be classified into one of the seven Frieze groups. The second type of pattern contains translational symmetries in two independent directions. Patterns of this category can be classified into one of the seventeen Wallpaper groups. The last type, called rosettes, describes patterns which begin at a central point and grow radially outward. We use rosette symmetry groups to classify patterns of this latter category. (2) For every pattern, we extract the symmetry features, namely, the symmetry group and the fundamental region, which is a representative region in the image from which the whole image can be regenerated. But for rosette groups, we can also compute the number of folds. (3) Finally, we describe the fundamental region by a simple color histogram and build the feature vector which is a combination of the symmetry feature (defined in the second step) and histogram information. Experiments show promising results for either IGP images' classification or indexing. Efforts for the subsequent task of classifying Islamic geometrical patterns' images can be significantly reduced.",

Today computing and information technology is pervasive and ubiquitous and has boosted at unprecedented levels, information diffusion and productivity. Such technology is today a ripe context for succinctly gathering knowledge by combining in innovative ways powerful visualization tactics, rapid access to a significant amount of relevant information, domain-specific knowledge, and rich and pervasive tools to sort, group, and slice the information and knowledge in different ways. To this end, we present a complete framework that is easy to use, does not require expensive custom equipment, and has been designed for helping archaeology researchers and educators reconstruct and analyze the historical context of cultural heritage objects. Our main inspiration is that archaeology today would benefit significantly from having spur-of-the-moment access to information from a variety of heterogeneous data sources and being able to have multiple participants visually observe factual and visual data in an intuitive and natural setting. While we present a framework geared towards archaeology, in the long term we envision reusing it in a variety of fields. Our framework includes data acquisition, data management, and data visualization components. The data acquisition component enables the fast, easy, and accurate addition of 3D object models and factual data, including narrations. The data management component includes a novel semantic database system that provides an intuitive view of the available contents in terms of an ontology, supports the addition of narrations, integrates data stored by other databases, and supports object retrieval, browsing, and knowledge navigation. The data visualization component provides visual feedback, which is a crucial part of an exploratory endeavor. It provides the ability to alter the appearance of archaeological objects, complete fragments of 3D object models, and several compelling forms of digital inspection and information visualization. All algorithms exploit knowledge from the database and from the obtained 3D models. Visuals can be applied on top of the physical object or on a 3D model shown in a traditional display, controllable via a Web page interface.",

    "abstract": "Large amounts of cultural heritage content have now been digitized and are available in digital libraries. However, these are often unstructured and difficult to navigate. Automatic techniques for identifying similar items in these collections could be used to improve navigation since it would allow items that are implicitly connected to be linked together and allow sets of similar items to be clustered. Europeana is a large digital library containing more than 20 million digital objects from a set of cultural heritage providers throughout Europe. The diverse nature of this collection means that the items do not have standard metadata to assist navigation. A range of methods for computing the similarity between pairs of texts are applied to metadata records in Europeana in order to estimate the similarity between items. Various methods for computing similarity have been proposed and can be classified into two main approaches: (1) knowledge-based, which make use of external knowledge sources and (2) corpus-based approaches, which rely on analyzing the frequency distributions of words in documents. Both techniques are evaluated against manual judgements obtained for this study and a multiple-choice test created from manually generated categories in cultural heritage collections. We find that a combination of corpus and knowledge-based approaches provide the best results in both experiments.",

    "abstract": "The dichotomy between full detail representation and the efficient management of data digitization is still a big issue in the context of the acquisition and visualization of 3D objects, especially in the field of the cultural heritage. Modern scanning devices enable very detailed geometry to be acquired, but it is usually quite hard to apply these technologies to large artifacts. In this article we present a project aimed at virtually reconstructing the impressive (7×11 m.) portal of the Ripoll Monastery, Spain. The monument was acquired using triangulation laser scanning technology, producing a dataset of 2212 range maps for a total of more than 1 billion triangles. All the steps of the entire project are described, from the acquisition planning to the final setup for dissemination to the public. We show how time-of-flight laser scanning data can be used to speed-up the alignment process. In addition we show how, after creating a model and repairing imperfections, an interactive and immersive setup enables the public to navigate and display a fully detailed representation of the portal. This article shows that, after careful planning and with the aid of state-of-the-art algorithms, it is now possible to preserve and visualize highly detailed information, even for very large surfaces.",

We present two completely automatic methods requiring no human intervention: text height estimation and text line extraction. Our proposed methods have been evaluated on a huge heterogeneous corpus of illuminated medieval manuscripts of different writing styles and with various problematic attributes, such as holes, spots, ink bleed-through, ornamentation, background noise, and overlapping text lines. Our experimental results demonstrate that these two new methods are efficient and reliable, even when applied to very noisy and damaged old handwritten manuscripts.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses the problem of automatic reconstruction of ancient artifacts from archaeological fragments. The technique described here focuses on pairwise matching of flat fragments (typically fresco fragments), and it is intended to be the core of a larger system for artifact reconstruction. Global registration techniques are challenging due to the combinatory explosion that happens in the solution space: the goal is to find the best alignment among all possible ones without an initialization. This fact defines the duality between performance and correction that we face in this work. The proposed technique defines a cost function to evaluate the quality of an alignment based on a discrete sampling of the fragments that ensures data alignment. Starting from an exhaustive search strategy, the technique progressively incorporates new features that lead to a hierarchical search strategy. Convergence and correction of the resulting technique are ensured using an optimistic cost function. Internal search calculations are optimized so the only operations performed are additions, subtractions, and comparisons over aligned data. All heavy geometric operations are carried out by the GPU on a preprocessing stage that only happens once per fragment.",

    "abstract": "Global reconstruction of two-dimensional wall paintings (frescoes) from fragments is an important problem for many archaeological sites. The goal is to find the global position and rotation for each fragment so that all fragments jointly “reconstruct” the original surface (i.e., solve the puzzle). Manual fragment placement is difficult and time-consuming, especially when fragments are irregularly shaped and uncolored. Systems have been proposed to first acquire 3D surface scans of the fragments and then use computer algorithms to solve the reconstruction problem. These systems work well for small test cases and for puzzles with distinctive features, but fail for larger reconstructions of real wall paintings with eroded and missing fragments due to the complexity of the reconstruction search space. We address the search problem with an unsupervised genetic algorithm: we evolve a pool of partial reconstructions that grow through recombination and selection over the course of generations. We introduce a novel algorithm for combining partial reconstructions that is robust to noise and outliers, and we provide a new selection procedure that balances fitness and diversity in the population. In experiments with a benchmark dataset, our algorithm is able to achieve larger and more accurate global reconstructions than previous automatic algorithms.",

Capitalizing on this dual nature of the project, this article introduces Wikipedia as a digital gateway to and site of an active engagement with cultural heritage. We have developed the open source and freely available analysis architecture Contropedia to examine already existing volunteer user-generated participation around cultural heritage and to promote further engagement with it. Conceptually, we employ the notion of memory work, as it helps to treat Wikipedia's articles, edit histories, and discussion pages as a rich resource to study how cultural heritage is received and (re)worked in and across languages and cultures. Contropedia's architecture allows for the study of the negotiations around and appreciation of cultural heritage without assuming an unchallenged and universal understanding of cultural heritage. The analysis facilitated by Contropedia thus sheds light on the contentious articulation of perspectives on tangible and intangible heritage grounded by conflicting conceptions of events, ideas, places, or persons. Technologically, Contropedia combines techniques based on mining article edit histories and analyzing discussion patterns in talk pages to identify and visualize heritage-related disputes within an article, and to compare these across language versions. In terms of digital heritage, Contropedia presents a powerful tool that opens up a core resource to cultural heritage studies. Moreover, it can form part of a conceptually grounded, technically advanced, and practically enrolled infrastructure for public education that opens up the dynamic formation of both knowledge about cultural heritage and new forms of digital cultural heritage that show a considerable amount of friction.",

Each frame has been labeled according to the location of the visitor and to what he was looking at. The dataset is freely available in order to encourage research in this domain. The dataset is complemented with baseline experiments performed considering a state-of-the-art method for location-based temporal segmentation of egocentric videos.

This study presents a survey of existing solutions to the time-consuming problem of orienting and drawing pottery fragments. Orientation is based on the 3D geometry of pottery models, which can now be acquired in minutes with low-cost 3D scanners. Several methods are presented: they are based on normal vectors, or circle fittings, or profile fittings. All these methods seek to determine the optimal position of the rotation axis. We also present and discuss new approaches and improvements to existing methods. We have developed a suite of functions for the computer-assisted orientation and drawing of archaeological pottery. The profile and contours of the fragment, as well as any possible decoration, can be depicted in various ways: photorealistic rendering or dotted patterns, calculated by ambient occlusion, combined or not with artificial light. The general workflow, evaluated using both synthetic and real-world fragments, is rapid, accurate, and reproducible. It drastically reduces the amount of routine work required to document ceramic artefacts. The information produced, together with the 3D representation of the fragments, can easily be archived and/or exchanged within the archaeological community for further research. The source code (built in the R environment), together with an installation notice and examples, is freely downloadable.",

Against this background, this article presents a four-stage investigation on standards, publications, disciplinary cultures, as well as scholars in the field of digital heritage and particularly tangible objects as monuments and sites, carried out in 2016 and 2017. It includes results of (1) the inquiry of nearly 4,000 publications from major conferences, (2) a workshop-based survey involving 44 researchers, (3) 15 qualitative interviews, as well as (4) two online surveys with 1,000 and 700 participants, respectively. As an overall finding, the community is driven by researchers from European countries, especially Italy, with a background in humanities. Cross-national co-authorships are promoted by cultural and spatial closeness and—probably due to funding policy—EU membership. A discourse is primarily driven by technologies, and the most common keywords refer to the technologies used. Most prominent research areas are data acquisition and management, visualization, and analysis. Recent topics are, for instance, unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV)-based 3D surveying technologies, augmented and virtual reality visualization, metadata and paradata standards for documentation, and virtual museums. Since a lack of money is named as the biggest obstacle nowadays, competency and human resources are most frequently named as demand. An epistemic culture in the scholarly field of digital heritage is closer to engineering than to humanities. Moreover, conference series are most relevant for a scientific discourse, and especially EU projects set pace as most important research endeavors.",

However, exposed under environmental impacts for about 500 years, these sites have been seriously threatened. The study on their damage assessment using reasonable methods is the key premise for further protection work. As there are few studies focused on the damage assessment of earthen sites, especially by using machine learning methods, this study explored to apply the current effective machine learning approaches, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and back-propagation (BP) Neural Network, into solving this problem. The authors used two such algorithms by training and testing the existing data of damage assessment results of 18 earthen sites located in Qinghai Province. By comparing experimental results, the prediction effects of SVM are much better than those of BP Neural Network. To test its practicability, Liutun Great Wall was chosen as an engineering case, showing better prediction and reasonable performance of SVM. This research has proved that SVM can be selected as a suitable model to assess the damage levels of earthen sites located in Qinghai Province for their future conservation works.",

However, prior art shows that immersive technologies present particular challenges with respect to usability, uptake, onboarding, sustainability, and authenticity. Towards addressing these challenges, a programme of action research has been established across a series of museums in Cornwall. Focusing upon the Augmented Telegrapher at Porthcurno Telegraph Museum, a co-designed social escape room experience that utilises the Microsoft HoloLens to simulate a telegraphy training exercise from World War 2, this article addresses what partnerships with smaller, rural establishments need to effectively realise the value of immersive technologies. Using the work of Erik Champion as a critical lens, the article shows how an iterative constructivist approach leveraging game design principles can underpin success.

This study shows the process of designing new museum experiences while considering how this technology changes previous museum experiences, what those experiences are, and what people should feel through these experiences. This process was systematically conducted according to the UX design process of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. In the analysis step, six types of museum artifact viewing experiences were defined: knowing, restoring, exploring, expanded scale, encountering, and sharing experience through research and user surveys related to the museum experience. In addition, through research analysis related to MR technology, presence, flow, and natural interaction were defined as three essential factors that users should feel in the MR experience. In the synthesis stage, optimized wearable MR experiences were designed and implemented by applying the necessary experience types and essential factors according to the characteristics of each artifact. In the evaluation stage, user experience evaluations such as user experience tests for essential factors in the MR experience, User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) tests for interaction products, and the Visual Aesthetics of Websites Inventory (VisAWI) test for visual experiences from various perspectives were conducted on the developed results. Through these evaluations, users gave positive scores to the design results based on the experience types and essential factors defined in this study. When applying new media technologies such as wearable MR technology, improved technology implementation is important, but an understanding of the applied field must first be obtained, and user analysis must first be thoroughly conducted. This study will be a guide to the systematic development process to be followed when applying wearable MR technology to other fields.",

IDN technology provides a means of engagement in cultural heritage sites, a medium for culturally significant stories, and culturally significant story-centric games. While previous work in this space has numerous examples of user experience (UX) evaluations of the interactive narrative works themselves, there is significantly less in terms of evaluation of technology for authoring IDN, creating a UX research space in this area that is focused on the audience and not authors. We propose to balance this focus by considering the UX of authoring tools more closely. In this work, we undertake a review of the state of the art of authoring tools for IDN, such as story-centric games, and report on a rigorous UX evaluation of representative technologies (n = 21). We also address the challenges of UX research for these tools through an original evaluation methodology where authors complete a story composed of representative story features. Our study leads us to conclude seven UX principles for IDN authoring tools that explore both how authors use tools to create story-focused games and how the interface for these tools impacts the creative process.",

    "abstract": "In terms of destination image, museums represent a tourism resource of the first magnitude. However, just as the information available online influences visitors’ decision-making about destinations, the internet is also fundamental in promoting and attracting visitors to museums. For that reason, we sought to analyse the online presence of museums in the seven most visited cities in Spain. To examine the museums’ websites, we developed an integrative model based on web content analysis (WCA ) and the extended model of internet commerce adoption (eMICA) that we applied to 77 publicly and privately run museums in Spain. Both WCA and the eMICA indicated that, despite their great economic and touristic scope, museums in Spain's most visited cities tend to mismanage their online presence and communication. We thus tentatively attributed the online presence of museums in Spain to type of museum management and several city-related parameters as explanatory variables. Multiple linear regressions of the variables revealed that, under public management, museums have had better online presence, while their respective cities have attracted more tourists. Those findings imply that museums still have a long way to go when it comes to facilitating effective communication and interaction with their target public, which we address in relation to the study's limitations and directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Cuneiform tablets appertain to the oldest textual artifacts used for more than three millennia and are comparable in amount and relevance to texts written in Latin or ancient Greek. These tablets are typically found in the Middle East and were written by imprinting wedge-shaped impressions into wet clay. There is an increasing demand in the Digital Humanities domain for handwriting recognition, i.e., machine reading of handwritten script, focusing on historic documents. Current practice in text analysis of cuneiform script relies heavily on transliteration and translation, which are incomplete and influenced by the knowledge and experience of the expert that created them. The development of computational tools for cuneiform analysis presents many opportunities. An efficient and accurate sign spotting enables cross-referencing and statistical analyzes that are infeasible to perform manually. Furthermore, a wedge constellation spotting tool, provides experts with a significantly broader base of references to create more accurate and less time consuming transliterations and translations. Yet, cuneiform script has since resisted efforts to computational processing on basis of its basic constituents, its 3D wedge-shaped impressions and their free-form arrangements into signs. In this work, we review the literature on computational processing and recognition in the domain of cuneiform script. We introduce the different heterogeneous sources of cuneiform script, namely, manual ink-on-paper drawings, digital vector graphics drawings, photographs, and 3D scans of tablets. We describe the development of methods, beginning with the first computational classification using a hybrid manual encoding and computational comparison, to the latest methods making use of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks to recognize characters automatically. Finally, we give an overview of applications of these methods that enable quantitative mining in the small, e.g., patterns of wedge constellations, and in the large, e.g., networks of economic activity.",

    "abstract": "The shrinkage of the sensors installed in unmanned aerial vehicles and the increase in data quality have provided great advantages to UAV users, especially in analysis and interpretation works. Archaeologists, in particular, can take full advantage of new opportunities to research and identify objects and artifacts, using remote sensing methods, by studying the past at excavation sites using modern technologies such as UAVs. These methods enable researchers to discover objects on the ground with the help of sensors. This study includes the UAV monitoring, documentation, and analyses of the excavation works that took place in 2014 (phase 1), 2017 (phase 2- phase 3), and 2020 (phase 4) at the Ancient Theatre of Uzuncaburç built in the Roman Empire. For this purpose, photos were taken with the UAV for each phase, and measurements were made from the excavation site's points with precision gauges (total-station and GNSS). 3D point cloud, orthophoto map, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) map, and 3D models of each phase were produced with the taken pictures. Since UAV photogrammetry was used in this study, each excavation phase was recorded precisely. This, unlike classical documentation techniques, enabled the deformations in the excavation areas to be revealed. The 3D position accuracy calculated for the control point (ChP) used in the four excavation phases ranges from 5.8 mm to 33.5 mm. The most important feature of this study is the sensitive examination of the changes in the excavation area for many years with the UAV photogrammetry technique. At the end of the study, the excavation phases and the determination of the deformation points in the excavation area were recorded digitally.",

To capture the statistical structure of the Mycenaean documents, we present a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network and compare it to the traditionally used n -grams. The model is used to supplement the damaged parts of the Mycenaean texts, namely the incomplete, to a greater or lesser extent, words, which are typically discovered on partially damaged clay tablets. We verify our method experimentally using ground-truth, then we demonstrate our results on real cases and compare with experts’ opinions.

This article compares two technological approaches to communicating Roman archaeology in museums: virtual reality and tangible interaction. Although very different in rationale, design, and implementation, the two explorative studies have the same aim of engaging visitors with important exhibits. The challenge is to effectively communicate the exhibit's original and cultural context. In “Views of the Past,” virtual reality was used to support an environmental narrative experience where fragments of history are found scattered in the 3D reconstructed forum of Augustus in Rome. In “My Roman Pantheon,” a tangible interactive installation, visitors act as Romans living along Hadrian's Wall making offerings to the deities of the Roman pantheon to secure their protection. In both explorative studies the combination of the features (virtual reality + narratives, tangible + acting) make visitors feel “cultural presence,” where the perception of a place is combined with the awareness of the culture and an understanding of the past. Although they work on very different sensorial reaction (sight for virtual reality, touch for tangible interaction), both are promising mechanisms to design effective visitors’ experiences for challenging cultural heritage settings.",

    "abstract": "The Jiangnan region of China boasts a superior natural environment, and the combination of cities and mountains that form its historical landscape give it unique attributes. Local chronicles serve as an abundant source of information for visualizing this historic environment. This study aims to achieve two objectives: (1) to use digital humanities methods to process textual information in local chronicles, and (2) to visualize the historical relationships formed by the mountains and cities. In this study, we chose Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Songjiang in the Jiangnan region during the Qing Dynasty as our research sites. Through textual analysis and data visualization, we classified and reconstructed the historical spatial patterns of cities and mountains. As a result, our study provides a reproduction of the past spatial relationship between cities and mountains in the Jiangnan region during the Qing Dynasty. The research findings indicate that natural mountains play multiple roles in shaping the historical urban environment, particularly in terms of cultural images, notably the symbolic function they hold. The preservation of the urban natural environment, as seen through the vantage point of the historical landscape, is a critical component in contemporary urban development. The digital humanities methodologies utilized within this article can be extended to other cultural heritage research, based on pre-existing local historical literature.",

The paper discusses the concepts underlying such a model, the system implementing it, and two concrete examples: The Orchestra Explorer designed for the Museo degli Strumenti Musicali at Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Roma, Italy, and the interactive dance and music performance The Bow Is bent and Drawn (composer Nicola Ferrari), presented at Casa Paganini, Genova, Italy, in occasion of the opening concert of the 8th Intl. Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME08), June 4, 2008, and in museum interactive experiences at Festival della Scienza, Genova. This work is part of current research at Casa Paganini—InfoMus on embodied social active listening to sound and music content through the analysis and processing of expressiveness in human full-body movement and gesture. A user-centric interactive multimedia system architecture is proposed, operating on prerecorded music. From the perspective of valorization of cultural heritage, this research provides engaging paradigms of interaction with prerecorded music content, enabling a large number of nonexpert users to rediscover the musical heritage (e.g., classical and contemporary music) they may not be familiar with. Research was carried out in the framework of the EU-ICT Project SAME (Sound and Music for Everyone, Everyday, Everywhere, Every Way, www.sameproject.eu, 2008–2010) and has been recently extended to active experience of audiovisual content, and in particular to cultural heritage and museum scenarios: the novel interactive permanent museum exhibition Viaggiatori di Sguardo has been designed and developed at Palazzo Ducale, Genova, enabling visitors to explore virtually the UNESCO Heritage Palazzi dei Rolli in Genova.",

Current argumentation models are either not analytical enough or restricted to formal logic. For that purpose, we seek a model of human argumentation in which reasoning may not only consist of falsification or verification but more generally of strengthening or weakening hypotheses, and a way to connect this model to an ontology of the domain of discourse. We have studied examples of factual argumentation in empirical research in archaeology. Based on this and other empirical material, we propose an innovative integrated model of factual argumentation that includes evolution, composition, and revision of arguments. It makes explicit both the processes of argument-making and the states of belief at a particular point in time in a composite inference, and connects explicitly to a domain ontology, free of tacit background knowledge. We have implemented the model in a more restricted form and tested it with published archaeological examples. Future work may generalize the model to other kinds of argumentation.",

However, unlocking the potential of Web archives for humanities scholars and social scientists requires a scalable analytics infrastructure to support exploration of captured content. We present Warcbase, an open-source Web archiving platform that aims to fill this need. Our platform takes advantage of modern open-source “big data” infrastructure, namely Hadoop, HBase, and Spark, that has been widely deployed in industry. Warcbase provides two main capabilities: support for temporal browsing and a domain-specific language that allows scholars to interrogate Web archives in several different ways. This work represents a collaboration between computer scientists and historians, where we have engaged in iterative codesign to build tools for scholars with no formal computer science training. To provide guidance, we propose a process model for scholarly interactions with Web archives that begins with a question and proceeds iteratively through four main steps: filter, analyze, aggregate, and visualize. We call this the FAAV cycle for short and illustrate with three prototypical case studies. This article presents the current state of the project and discusses future directions.",

    "abstract": "The digitization initiatives in the past decades have led to a tremendous increase in digitized objects in the cultural heritage domain. Although digitally available, these objects are often not easily accessible for interested users because of the distributed allocation of the content in different repositories and the variety in data structure and standards. When users search for cultural content, they first need to identify the specific repository and then need to know how to search within this platform (e.g., usage of specific vocabulary). The goal of the EEXCESS project is to design and implement an infrastructure that enables ubiquitous access to digital cultural heritage content. Cultural content should be made available in the channels that users habitually visit and be tailored to their current context without the need to manually search multiple portals or content repositories. To realize this goal, open-source software components and services have been developed that can either be used as an integrated infrastructure or as modular components suitable to be integrated in other products and services. The EEXCESS modules and components comprise (i) Web-based context detection, (ii) information retrieval-based, federated content aggregation, (iii) metadata definition and mapping, and (iv) a component responsible for privacy preservation. Various applications have been realized based on these components that bring cultural content to the user in content consumption and content creation scenarios. For example, content consumption is realized by a browser extension generating automatic search queries from the current page context and the focus paragraph and presenting related results aggregated from different data providers. A Google Docs add-on allows retrieval of relevant content aggregated from multiple data providers while collaboratively writing a document. These relevant resources then can be included in the current document either as citation, an image, or a link (with preview) without having to leave disrupt the current writing task for an explicit search in various content providers’ portals.",

In this study, we explore virtual heritage environment design features, and cultural information characteristics and presentation formats that are important to facilitate cultural learning, from the casual user's perspective. We conducted experiments that required users to explore virtual heritage environments (focusing on architectural heritage) from selected heritage-related websites, followed by interview sessions. Four contributing factors were identified: information design, information presentation, navigation mechanism, and environment setting. The results suggest the need to reduce users’ cognitive load when exploring virtual heritage environments while simultaneously presenting information that adds value to their understanding. The results also suggest that the inclusion of cultural information in virtual heritage environments is essential for cultural learning to take place.",

This article presents the methodology of 3D scanning and processing of the acquired data on the surface condition of large architectural objects to develop their models and make various variants of their visualization. The developed methodology was divided into many stages and steps. It provides methods, techniques, and recommendations on how to solve specific problems that interfere with the process of data acquisition under typical conditions of continuous access to the objects by tourists and the impossibility of turning the object off from the visitors. The methodology prepared was used and tested during field trips to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in 2018--2019 to prepare digital visualizations of objects belonging to the group of monuments called Timurid architecture. Preparation and in situ verification of 3D data acquisition procedures under different traditions, cultures, religions, customs, administrative procedures, time constraints, technical resources, and climatic conditions is of great importance for effectively equipping research expeditions dealing with the digitization of architecture in different areas of the world.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a multimodal dataset comprising various representations and annotations of Franz Schubert’s song cycle Winterreise . Schubert’s seminal work constitutes an outstanding example of the Romantic song cycle—a central genre within Western classical music. Our dataset unifies several public sources and annotations carefully created by music experts, compiled in a comprehensive and consistent way. The multimodal representations comprise the singer’s lyrics, sheet music in different machine-readable formats, and audio recordings of nine performances, two of which are freely accessible for research purposes. By means of explicit musical measure positions, we establish a temporal alignment between the different representations, thus enabling a detailed comparison across different performances and modalities. Using these alignments, we provide for the different versions various musicological annotations describing tonal and structural characteristics. This metadata comprises chord annotations in different granularities, local and global annotations of musical keys, and segmentations into structural parts. From a technical perspective, the dataset allows for evaluating algorithmic approaches to tasks such as automated music transcription, cross-modal music alignment, or tonal analysis, and for testing these algorithms’ robustness across songs, performances, and modalities. From a musicological perspective, the dataset enables the systematic study of Schubert’s musical language and style in Winterreise and the comparison of annotations regarding different annotators and granularities. Beyond the research domain, the data may serve further purposes such as the didactic preparation of Schubert’s work and its presentation to a wider public by means of an interactive multimedia experience. With this article, we provide a detailed description of the dataset, indicate its potential for computational music analysis by means of several studies, and point out possibilities for future research.",

In this article, we propose a method for matching and assembling pairs of ancient papyrus fragments containing mostly unknown scriptures. Papyrus paper is manufactured from papyrus plants and therefore portrays typical thread patterns resulting from the plant’s stems. The proposed algorithm is founded on the hypothesis that these thread patterns contain unique local attributes such that nearby fragments show similar patterns reflecting the continuations of the threads. We posit that these patterns can be exploited using image processing and machine learning techniques to identify matching fragments. The algorithm and system which we present support the quick and automated classification of matching pairs of papyrus fragments as well as the geometric alignment of the pairs against each other. The algorithm consists of a series of steps and is based on deep-learning and machine learning methods. The first step is to deconstruct the problem of matching fragments into a smaller problem of finding thread continuation matches in local edge areas (squares) between pairs of fragments. This phase is solved using a convolutional neural network ingesting raw images of the edge areas and producing local matching scores. The result of this stage yields very high recall but low precision. Thus, we utilize these scores in order to conclude about the matching of entire fragments pairs by establishing an elaborate voting mechanism. We enhance this voting with geometric alignment techniques from which we extract additional spatial information. Eventually, we feed all the data collected from these steps into a Random Forest classifier in order to produce a higher order classifier capable of predicting whether a pair of fragments is a match. Our algorithm was trained on a batch of fragments which was excavated from the Dead Sea caves and is dated circa the 1st century BCE. The algorithm shows excellent results on a validation set which is of a similar origin and conditions. We then tried to run the algorithm against a real-life set of fragments for which we have no prior knowledge or labeling of matches. This test batch is considered extremely challenging due to its poor condition and the small size of its fragments. Evidently, numerous researchers have tried seeking matches within this batch with very little success. Our algorithm performance on this batch was sub-optimal, returning a relatively large ratio of false positives. However, the algorithm was quite useful by eliminating 98% of the possible matches thus reducing the amount of work needed for manual inspection. Indeed, experts that reviewed the results have identified some positive matches as potentially true and referred them for further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Lublin is a city located in the eastern part of Poland, which is an important place of cultural heritage, being the venue where the Polish-Lithuanian Union was signed 450 years ago in 2019. This article presents “Architectural Jewels of Lublin,” a computerized serious board game for two players. The aim of the game is to collect points for recognizing models of the city's historic architectural objects and their correct position on the board. They represent the landmarks of the historic Old Town quarter. Another point of the game is to answer questions about the cultural heritage of Lublin. 3D models of historic buildings were initially designed manually and then 3D printed in FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) technology. The correct location of the object on the board is identified by sensors working in the RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) technology supported by two microcontrollers of an Arduino platform, which were connected to the software managing the whole game shown on a tablet monitor. The game is used both to promote Lublin at numerous cyclical cultural and science popularization events, and during conferences and seminars organized for circles representing cultural heritage from Poland and abroad. It is aimed at presenting a way to integrate many different contemporary digital technologies that can serve education in the area of cultural heritage. The game, in contrast to popular games using VR and AR technologies, combines in an interesting way physical and digital space using modern computer technologies. The research carried out on the participants of the game has shown its high effectiveness in raising the historical awareness of its participants, as well as the players’ positive attitude toward the game.",

Unfortunately, existing HPE methods do not generalise well across domains resulting in poorly recognised poses. Therefore, we propose a two step approach: (1) adapting a dataset of natural images of known person and pose annotations to the style of Greek vase paintings by means of image style-transfer. We introduce a perceptually-grounded style transfer training to enforce perceptual consistency. Then, we fine-tune the base model with this newly created dataset. We show that using style-transfer learning significantly improves the SOTA performance on unlabelled data by more than 6% mean average precision (mAP) as well as mean average recall (mAR) . (2) To improve the already strong results further, we created a small dataset (ClassArch) consisting of ancient Greek vase paintings from the 6–5th century BCE with person and pose annotations. We show that fine-tuning on this data with a style-transferred model improves the performance further. In a thorough ablation study, we give a targeted analysis of the influence of style intensities, revealing that the model learns generic domain styles. Additionally, we provide a pose-based image retrieval to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and pretrained models can be found at https://github.com/angelvillar96/STLPose .",

In this respect, virtual humans are typically employed to re-enact human motion, executing movements reproduced through predefined animations, or physics simulation engines. In the case of traditional crafts, a defining point is how to model the interaction of virtual humans with craft-related objects and how to transfer it from the physical to the digital world. Toward a more effective and generic modeling and visualization of the interaction of humans with tools and machines utilized in crafts, this article proposes a novel methodology for the modeling and visualization of crafts and presents a platform enabling the authoring and visualization of craft processes. We contribute a way of visualizing craft processes within virtual environments, aiming to increase the usability of craft representation.

    "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) method could be used in the context of being able to provide for the transfer of the architectural and tectonic attributes related to the period to which a historical building belongs, and under conditions where the reconstruction activities could produce damage to the integrity of the building or in situations where the financial resources remain insufficient for making reconstruction. Ayazini Village was selected as the study area. Ayazini Village is connected to Afyonkarahisar Province and is a region that is an extension of the Phrygian Valley, which has a 6,000-year-old past. The Ayazini Region is composed of layers, which produced the First-Degree Archaeological, Urban Archaeological, and First-Degree Natural Site areas. The rock settlements, which form the tectonic structure of Ayazini Village, were produced with the cutting of the tufa rocks that are described as Ayazini rock. The interior spaces and building components of the rock settlements have been damaged or disappeared in time. It is thought from this aspect that there are difficulties in the context of materials, cost, and labor for the reconstruction activities of the areas where these interior spaces were damaged. Within the scope of the research, a virtual restoration model was applied in the interior space of the Virgin Mary Church located in Ayazini Village by using the AR technology. The Virgin Mary Church is a unique historical building remaining from the Byzantine Middle Period when Christianity was accepted. The interior space of the Virgin Mary Church was damaged as the result of natural disasters and human influences over time. In this context, within the scope of the virtual restoration model in this research, the sections of the arches set on the columns in the interior space of the church that were damaged were treated in the integration of the interior space with the sign-based AR technology and reconstruction. The surfaces of the lower parts of the columns that were damaged were mapped with a laser scanner. The parts of the Quick Response (QR) code columns, which were damaged, were presented in simulations. These simulations contain the modeling of the columns from the aspect of shape, color, and fabric. The columns bearing the arches located in the interior space of the church were simulated in a computer environment by determining the colors, fabric, shape, and construction characteristics through the original photographs and based on the data in the literature and with the color pixelization and fabric characteristic mapping of the surfaces. At the conclusion of all these procedures, the data was transferred to the mobile application called Augment. The QR code assigned provided for the aligning under the columns by using the on-site test method and a laser scanner. The smart equipment, through the Augment application, showed the original condition and experienced on-site simultaneously the damaged parts of the column that were completed with the arch by perceiving the QR code.",

They refer to a way in which interacting with computer systems is closer to the way we interact with the real world. Instead of using devices such as a computer or a phone, we interact using seemingly non-technological objects, by moving our bodies or by using gestures. Since the early 2000s, tangible and embodied interactions have been applied and researched also in cultural heritage and museums, in an attempt to overcome issues induced by screen-based devices that may disengage visitors from the objects, their materiality and the physicality of the visit. This article surveys tangible and embodied interactions in museums, over a period of two decades since 2000. More than 120 projects have been researched and analysed thematically to provide a categorization based on cultural communication, interaction features and museological aspects. This categorization offers a conceptualization of tangible and embodied interactions in museums and cultural heritage; it suggests a terminology to describe the design characteristics of tangible and embodied interaction interventions, therefore facilitating the orientation of future research efforts in the field.",

The evaluation involved 239 participants, comprising 184 females and 55 males. The results indicated that the SCHPWA scored above average in attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, and stimulation. However, the dimensions of novelty and dependability scored below average. Therefore, the attributes related to attractiveness, efficiency, stimulation, and perspicuity are grouped using IPA under Quadrant 2 (Possible Overkill), while novelty and dependability fall under Quadrant 3 (Low Priority). The study highlights the benefits of using a combination of UEQ and IPA for evaluating Progressive Web Applications (PWA).

This article presents a unified approach to illustrating four-dimensional data concerning a cultural heritage site. The proposed framework provides a semi-automatic approach to both reconstructing the environment and bringing all the time-dependent models into an intuitive visualization package. For each time period considered for reconstruction, the system requires a set of building footprint maps depicting the layout of the environment plus a few statistics. The statistics govern the construction of three-dimensional building models, allowing each building's architectural style, typical building height, and roof style to be altered. This information is automatically processed and converted into a form that can be visualized. By integrating high quality landmark buildings from laser scanning or interactive modelling packages into the automatically generated scene, the cultural heritage site is realized both in a spatial and temporal context. The visualization is achieved via a 4D navigable movie which is presented using two concrete implementations written using Flash and OpenGL. The OpenGL-based implementation allows a collection of 3DS Max scenes to be automatically visualized requiring only a set of camera paths identified by the user.",

The Internet Archive alone contains over 27,014 texts catalogued as Latin, including classical prose and poetry written under the Roman Empire, ecclesiastical treatises from the Middle Ages, and dissertations from 19th-century Germany written—in Latin—on the philosophy of Hegel. At one billion words, this collection eclipses the extant corpus of Classical Latin by several orders of magnitude. In addition, the much larger collection of books in English, German, French, and other languages already scanned contains unknown numbers of translations for many Latin books, or parts of books. The sheer scale of this collection offers a broad vista of new research questions, and we focus here on both the opportunities and challenges of computing over such a large space of heterogeneous texts. The works in this massive collection do not constitute a finely curated (or much less balanced) corpus of Latin; it is, instead, simply all the Latin that can be extracted, and in its reach of twenty-one centuries (from approximately 200 BCE to 1922 CE) arguably spans the greatest historical distance of any major textual collection today. While we might hope that the size and historical reach of this collection can eventually offer insight into grand questions such as the evolution of a language over both time and space, we must contend as well with the noise inherent in a corpus that has been assembled with minimal human intervention.",

Digitization plays an important role in the process of creating, preserving, and accessing objects in digital space. Up to the present day, industrial scanners are used for this task, which focus mainly on the detailed reconstruction of the object’s geometry only. However, particularly important for a faithful digital presentation of the object is the appearance information—that is, a description of the used materials and how they interact with incident light. Using the world’s first full-spherical scanner, we propose a user-friendly reconstruction process that is specifically tailored to the needs of digitizing and representing cultural heritage artifacts. More precisely, our hardware specifically addresses the problem that invaluable or fragile artifacts may not be turned over during acquisition. Nevertheless, we can digitize the object completely, including its bottom. Further, by integrating appearance information into our digitization, we achieve a far more faithful digital replica with a quality comparable to a real picture of the object. But in contrast to a static picture, our representation allows one to interactively change the viewing and lighting directions freely. In addition, the results are very memory efficient, consuming only several megabytes per scanned object. In cooperation with museums and a private collector, we digitized several cultural heritage artifacts to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed process.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, UV-induced fluorescence (UVIFL) photography has proven to be very effective when studying the surface of historical musical instruments, such as violins. This technique makes it possible to highlight superficial details not clearly perceptible with visible light (e.g., retouchings, superficial distribution of varnishes, or wear). The data retrieved are also an important guide for further noninvasive spectroscopic analyses used when the chemical composition of the surface needs to be investigated. However, UVIFL imagery interpretation of a historical violin is no trivial task. In fact, constant playing and the multiple restorations over the centuries have produced very complex surfaces. This work presents an automatic tool designed to facilitate this kind of analysis. Using a quantized histogram in HSV color space, the distribution of the main fluorescence colors on an instrument’s surface can be highlighted, recurrence of the same color in different areas of the same violin can be detected, or different violins can be compared. UVIFL images of seven Stradivarius violins kept in the Museo del Violino in Cremona, Italy, were used as a test set. The results achieved endorse the validity of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "This article introduces the study contents and some research findings regarding digital preservation methods for Chinese Kunqu opera libretto historical literature, including historical literature electronic libretto transformation, libretto musical score image segmentation, musical information recognition, musical score information representation, musical score information storage, and libretto reconstruction on the Web. It proposes a novel editable text method to represent the multidimensional tree-like information structure of the Kunqu libretto literature and a musical semantic annotation method based on numbered musical notation to accommodate the musical features of Kunqu librettos. To maintain the characteristics of the original Kunqu musical notation, it proposes a method to reconstruct Kunqu libretto on the Web based on scalable vector graphics. Some Kunqu librettos were randomly selected for experiments, and the results demonstrated that the editable text method and the musical semantic annotation method were able to fully represent the effective information of the Kunqu libretto literature and that the method to reconstruct librettos on the Web was able to reflect the writing characteristics of the musical notation in the original librettos. Finally, it discusses the primary future research directions related to digital Kunqu , including Kunqu libretto metadata research, corpus construction for the librettos and Qupai (the unique ancient Chinese tune mode), libretto music information disambiguation research, libretto image segmentation and pattern recognition, digital Kunqu roles, digital Kunqu stages, digital Kunqu costume suitcases, virtual Kunqu , digitization and restoration of Kunqu cultural relics, and Kunqu 's application prospects in conventional media such as animation, anime, and movies.",

    "abstract": "Andean textiles are products of one of the richest, oldest and continuous weaving traditions in the world. Understanding the knowledge and practice of textile production as a form of cultural heritage is particularly relevant in the Andean context due to erosion of clothing traditions, reuse of traditional textiles on commodities targeted at the tourism market, and loss of knowledge embedded in textile production. “Weaving Communities of Practice” was a pilot project that aimed to create a knowledge base of Andean weaving designed to contribute to curatorial practice and heritage policy. The research team gathered data on the chain of activities, instruments, resources, peoples, places and knowledge involved in the production of textiles, relating to over 700 textile samples. A major part of the project has been the modelling and representation of the knowledge of domain experts and information about the textile objects themselves in the form of an OWL ontology, and the development of a suite of search facilities to be supported by the ontology. This paper describes the research challenges faced in developing the ontology and search facilities, the methodology adopted, the design and implementation of the system, and the design and outcomes of a user evaluation of the system undertaken with a group of domain experts.",

    "abstract": "An immersive experience brought about by virtual reality can potentially enhance the appreciation of classical Chinese poetry, which is difficult to describe clearly in everyday language or ordinary media. However, making 3-dimensional illustrations for a 360-degree display in virtual reality is usually a labor-intensive and time-consuming procedure and hard to master for non-professional media creators, such as teachers. Motivated by the homology theory of classical Chinese poetry and painting, we propose an image-based approach of building 2.5-dimensional immersive stories to visualize classical Chinese poetry. Specifically, using Chinese shadow play as a metaphor, we have designed and implemented ShadowPlay2.5D , a sketch-based authoring tool to help novices create 360-degree videos of classical Chinese poetry easily. To ensure coverage of the diverse themes in Chinese poetry and preserve the sense of culture, we build a Chinese ink-painting style image repository of essential poetic elements identified via crowdsourcing. To facilitate construction of 2.5-dimensional scenes, we design features that support puppet-like animation, instancing, and camera organization in a 3-dimensional environment. Through two user studies, we show that ShadowPlay2.5D can help novices make a short 360-degree video in about 10--15 minutes, and the 2.5D stylized illustrations created can bring about a better immersive experience for poetry appreciation.",

    "abstract": "The presence of artificial intelligence in our lives is increasing and being applied to fields such as medicine, engineering, telecommunications, remote sensing and 3D visualization. Nevertheless, it has never been used for the stratigraphic study of historical buildings. Thus far, archaeologists and architects, the experts in archaeology of architecture, have led this research. The method consisted of visually—and, consequently, subjectively—identifying certain evidence regarding the elevations of such buildings that could be a consequence of the passage of time. In this article, we would like to present the results from one of the research projects pursued by our group, in which we automated the stratigraphic study of some historic buildings using multivariate statistic techniques. To this end, we first measured the building using surveying techniques to create a 3D model, and then, we broke down every stone into qualitative and quantitative variables. To identify the stratigraphic features on the walls, we applied machine learning by conducting different predictive and descriptive analyses. The predictive analyses were used to rule out any blocks of stone with different characteristics, such as rough stones, joint ashlars, and voussoirs of arches; these are irregularities that probably show building processes and whose identification is crucial in ascertaining the structural evolution of the building. In supervised learning, we experimented with decision trees and random forest—and although the results were good in all cases, we ultimately opted to implement the predictive model obtained using the last one. While identifying the evidence on the walls, it was also very important to identify different continuity solutions or interfaces present on them, because although these are elements without materiality, they are of great value in terms of timescale, because they delimit different strata and allow us to deduce the relationship between them.",

    "abstract": "The continuous growth of available resources on the web, both in the form of Linked Open Data and on Social Networks, provides an important opportunity to gather information concerning specific kinds of touristic activities like, for example, cultural tourism, eco-tourism, bike-tourism, and so on. Both decision makers and tourists can take advantage from these data, as demonstrated by previous works, with institutional actors foreseeing an increase in the use of this data to substitute other time-consuming and expensive approaches. However, managing multiple sources built with different goals and structures is not straightforward, so specific design choices must be made when assembling this kind of information. Graph databases represent an ideal way to combine multiple-source data but, to be successful, strategies accounting for inconsistencies and format differences have to be defined to support coherent analysis. Also, the continuously changing nature of crowd-sourced data makes it difficult, for the research community, to compare technological approaches to the different tasks that are linked to cultural heritage, from recommendation to management. To support the research effort in this direction, we describe the data ingestion and enrichment procedure we followed to organise knowledge coming from three different sources, namely Wikidata, Wikipedia, and Flickr, into a single, application-oriented, resource organised as a graph database. We present the potential use of this resource to perform multiple source analyses targeting the specific case of cultural tourism on a nationwide scale, and we propose its use as a shared benchmark for technological applications designed to support optimal management of cultural resources.",

These innovations are based on high-precision and high-resolution technologies that allow for the geometric documentation of any object within the fields of history and the arts. Through these techniques, new proposals may be studied and objects can be placed in any historical context. Three-dimensional (3D) digitization allows one to obtain a digital 3D model, which can be handled virtually and recreated at any historical period, enabling the conservation and safeguarding of cultural heritage. Society currently demands new visualization techniques that allow interacting with architectural and artistic heritage, which have been applied in numerous virtual reconstructions of historical sites or singular archaeological pieces. This project allowed us to geometrically document a reused piece with two surfaces (shield and columns) and a plaque of the city of Merida using a structured light scanner from a theoretical-practical perspective. The 3D virtual reconstruction of the pieces was accomplished within this study. The generation of QR codes enabled the interactive display of the heritage pieces. Likewise, a proposal was made to reuse the aforementioned pieces through virtual archaeology. The initial hypothesis is based on the possible existence of a Visigothic niche as an original form. This research reports significant advances in the conservation and exploitation of cultural heritage.",

The authors deliberate how metadata creation and enrichment could be improved through Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and explore the practical applications of AI-reliant tools to analyze a large corpus of photographs and create or enrich metadata. The amount of visual data created by digitization efforts is not always followed by the creation of contextual metadata, which is a major problem for archival institutions and their users, as metadata directly affects the accessibility of digitized records. Moreover, the scale of digitization efforts means it is often beyond the scope of archivists and other record managers to individually assess problematic or sensitive images and their metadata. Additionally, existing metadata for photographic and visual records are presenting issues in terms of outdated descriptions or inconsistent contextual information. As more attention is given to the creation of accessible digital content within archival institutions, we argue that too little is being given to the enrichment of record data. In this article, the authors ask how new tools can address incomplete or inaccurate metadata and improve the transparency and accessibility of digital visual records.",

Quantitative results revealed that HMD VR museums had statistically significantly better immersion and empathy compared to HMD AR museums. Qualitative data indicated HMD-based immersive museums were embraced by most young participants while HMD VR had better user acceptance than HMD AR for immersive museums. The interview also demonstrated that the advantage of the HMD-based immersive museum over the traditional online museum is not only the sensory immersion from the medium itself but also the interactive narrative experience that the HMD medium facilitates, especially the natural interaction with the CG characters and the environment in the story.",

    "abstract": "Flash light of digital cameras is a very useful way to picture scenes with low-quality illumination. Nevertheless, especially in low-end cameras integrated flash lights are considered as not reliable for high-quality images, due to known artifacts (sharp shadows, highlights, uneven lighting) generated in images. Moreover, a mathematical model of this kind of light is difficult to create. In this article we present a color correction space which, given some information about the geometry of the pictured scene, is able to provide a space-dependent color correction for each pixel of the image. The correction space can be calculated once in a lifetime using a quite fast acquisition procedure; after 3D spatial calibration, the obtained color correction function can be applied to every image where flash is the dominant light source. We developed this approach to produce better color samples in the application framework of color mapping on 3D scanned models. The correction space proposed presents several advantages: it is independent from the kind of light used (provided that it is bound to the camera), it gives the possibility to correct some artifacts (for example, color deviation) introduced by flash light, and it has a wide range of possible applications, from image enhancement to material color estimation. Moreover, once that the inverse photo-to-geometry transformation is known, it allows the easy estimation of the flash light position and permits to identify and remove other annoying artifacts, like highlights and shadows. The resulting approach allows to gather in an easy manner a better and more consistent color information and to produce higher-quality 3D models.",

The 3D Semantic Association (3DSA) system enables users to annotate relationships between multiple whole objects, parts of objects, or features on objects (surface features or volumetric segments). The annotations are stored on a server in an interoperable format that can be shared, discovered, browsed, and retrieved through a web browser interface.

It has emerged as a result of technological development, especially in computer applications that have extended our capabilities to cope up with the knowledge systems of increasing broad range and complexity. For most people, including architects, heritage and conservation mean historical buildings and their conservation. However, there is another facet to it that is not well recognized; the area of “literary architectural heritage, ” that is, the literature on historical architecture. In the literary architectural heritage of India, many architectural treatises are available for graphical documentation of the built examples described in them. This article aims to present digital graphical documentation of the pavilions described in the Mayamatam , an architectural treatise of ancient India. Research in this area will enrich the knowledge base of architecture. Having this information in a digital format like CAD drawings, virtual 3D models would result in better communication, storage, and retrieval for editing, modifications, and analysis. This digital documentation and representation provides the possibility of being used as a teaching aid for students and architects and also for recovering lost knowledge in the context of partially destroyed structures. For architects and designers, who constantly search for new ways, the digital presentation of ancient Indian pavilions provide a design tool for discovering new patterns to be used in contemporary architecture.",

This article presents an integrated system that is able to capture and fabricate color, topography and gloss of a painting, of which gloss capturing forms the most important contribution. A 3D imaging system, utilizing stereo imaging combined with fringe projection, is extended to capture spatially varying gloss, based on the effect of specular reflectance polarization. The gloss is measured by sampling the specular reflection around Brewster’s angle, where these reflections are effectively polarized and can be separated from the unpolarized, diffuse reflectance. Off-center gloss measurements are calibrated relative to the center measurement. Off-specular gloss measurements, following from local variation of the surface normal, are masked based on the height map and corrected. Shadowed regions, caused by the 3D relief, are treated similarly. The area of a single capture is approximately 180 × 90 mm at a resolution of 25 × 25 µm. Aligned color, height, and gloss tiles are stitched together off-line, registering overlapping color regions. The resulting color, height, and gloss maps are inputs for the poly-jet 3D printer. Two paintings were reproduced to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system. One painting was scanned four times, consecutively rotated by 90 degrees, to evaluate the influence of the scanning system geometric configuration on the gloss measurement. Experimental results show that the method is sufficiently fast for practical application, i.e., to scan a whole painting within eight hours, during closing hours of a museum. The results can well be used for the purpose of physical reproduction and other applications needing first-order estimates of the appearance (e.g., conservation diagnostics and condition reports). Our method to extend appearance scanning with gloss measurements is a valuable addition in the quest for realistic reproductions, in terms of its practical applicability—number of images needed for reconstruction and speed—and its perceptual added value, when added to color and topography reproduction.",

    "abstract": "We propose an approach for improving the digitization of shape and color of 3D artworks in a cluttered environment using 3D laser scanning and flash photography. To separate clutter from acquired material, semiautomated methods are employed to generate masks used to segment the range maps and the color photographs. This approach allows the removal of unwanted 3D and color data prior to the integration of acquired data in a 3D model. Sharp shadows generated by flash acquisition are easily handled by this masking process, and color deviations introduced by the flash light are corrected at the color blending step by taking into account the geometry of the object. The approach has been evaluated in a large-scale acquisition campaign of the Mont’e Prama complex. This site contains an extraordinary collection of stone fragments from the Nuragic era, which depict small models of prehistoric nuraghe (cone-shaped stone towers), as well as larger-than-life archers, warriors, and boxers. The acquisition campaign has covered 37 statues mounted on metallic supports. Color and shape were acquired at a resolution of 0.25mm, which resulted in more than 6,200 range maps (about 1.3G valid samples) and 3,817 photographs.",

The article will focus on the development and implementation of a viable workflow for the production of high-quality 3D models of museum objects, based on the 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry of selected ancient Egyptian artefacts. The development of a robust protocol for the complete process chain for imaging cultural heritage artefacts, from the acquisition of 2D and/or 3D images to the development of interactive applications for the public audience, was a specific objective of the project. The workflow devised by the university museum team combines reference photography and 3D imaging with a curatorial review of the actual object to its digital counterpart. It also integrates methodologies for managing the accompanying metadatasets to record these activities. As final stage deliverables from the process, the museum is making high-quality 3D images of artefacts from its collection available through creation and dissemination of digital 3D multiplatform interactive applications in order to allow remote access and to enhance the museum's public engagement. This short article concludes with practical considerations for a 3D imaging workflow such as time and skills needed, 3D model quality, and expectation management.",

    "abstract": "Archaeological artifacts are often classified in homogeneous groups, according to either intangible properties (e.g., origin, use, age) or physical features (e.g., color, material, geometric shape, size, style). In particular, a single property is usually not enough to characterize artifacts’ peculiar traits, as most of the objects are affected by degradation or only partially preserved. In this article, we propose a shape analysis and comparison pipeline specifically targeted to the similarity assessment of real-world 3D artifacts. The proposed methodology is able to concurrently evaluate heterogeneous properties, such as geometric (e.g., curvature, size, roundness, or mass distribution) and photometric (e.g., texture, color distribution, or reflectance) aspects. The geometric description is based on a statistical technique to select properties that are mutually independent; the photometric information is handled according to a topological perspective and complemented by the analysis of color distribution. The outcome is a mixed description of each 3D artifact, which is used to derive a similarity measure between objects. The potential of our approach is high because any property representable as real- or vector- valued functions can be easily added in our framework. Experimental results carried on an existing collection of textured triangle meshes are exhibited to show the potentiality of the method in retrieval and classification tasks.",

In this article, we present a novel interactive, low-cost approach to 3D reconstruction and compare it to a standard photogrammetry pipeline based on high-resolution photographs.

While scanning, the user sees a live view of the current reconstruction, allowing the user to intervene immediately and adapt the sensor path to the current scanning result. After a raw reconstruction has been acquired, the digital model is interactively warped to fit a geo-referenced map using a handle-based deformation paradigm. Even large sites can be scanned within a few minutes, and no costly postprocessing is required. The quality of the acquired digitized raw 3D models is evaluated by comparing them to actual imagery, a geo-referenced map of the excavation site, and a photogrammetry-based reconstruction. We made extensive tests under real-world conditions on an archeological excavation in Metropolis, Ionia, Turkey. We found that the reconstruction quality of our approach is comparable to that of photogrammetry. Yet, both approaches have advantages and shortcomings in specific setups, which we analyze and discuss.",

This article studies two types of shape representations in a bag-of-words-based pipeline to recognize Maya glyphs. The first is a knowledge-driven Histogram of Orientation Shape Context (HOOSC) representation, and the second is a data-driven representation obtained by applying an unsupervised Sparse Autoencoder (SA). In addition to the glyph data, the generalization ability of the descriptors is investigated on a larger-scale sketch dataset. The contributions of this article are four-fold: (1) the evaluation of the performance of a data-driven auto-encoder approach for shape representation; (2) a comparative study of hand-designed HOOSC and data-driven SA; (3) an experimental protocol to assess the effect of the different parameters of both representations; and (4) bridging humanities and computer vision/machine learning for Maya studies, specifically for visual analysis of glyphs. From our experiments, the data-driven representation performs overall in par with the hand-designed representation for similar locality sizes on which the descriptor is computed. We also observe that a larger number of hidden units, the use of average pooling, and a larger training data size in the SA representation all improved the descriptor performance. Additionally, the characteristics of the data and stroke size play an important role in the learned representation.",

    "abstract": "In the past 20 years, several methods have been proposed for re-coding 3D models with a low-spatial-frequency 3D representation plus a high-frequency 2D map for recovering the details. This approach has been explored with different kinds of mapping (bump, normal, relief, parallax, displacement), which have been shown to be effective in dramatically reducing model size while still maintaining a good visual appearance. For this reason, these approaches are widely applied in those situations where the rendering time constraints are critical (e.g., real-time rendering of complex models for gaming). However, the significant difference between the original detailed 3D model and the re-coded version has made it impossible to consider the latter as a metrically satisfying substitute for the former. The purpose of this article is to propose a re-coding method based on displaced subdivision surfaces that makes it possible to adapt the re-coded 3D representation to the metrological limitations of the 3D capturing technique used for generating the original mesh. In this way, it is possible to keep the geometric incoherency between the re-coded and the acquired mesh below the threshold determined by the natural capturing technology uncertainty. The resulting re-coded model can be therefore considered as close to the physical object/scenario, as the original acquired mesh, with a great advantage in terms of 3D representation size, UV parametrization, topological coherence, and scalability. The method has been tested on three cultural heritage objects with different complexity: a damaged wooden painting by Leonardo da Vinci (a nearly 2.5D shape), a Roman stone head sculpture (full 3D shape with simple topology), and a full body bronze sculpture by Donatello (full 3D shape with complex topology), demonstrating the coherency between the re-coded models and the originals, with a model size compression depending on the topological complexity that may reach a level of better than 1:25.",

How to determine the era in which a painting was created is a critical problem, since the topic of a painting cannot be used as an effective basis without an era label. To address this problem, this article proposes a novel computational method by using multi-view local color features extracted from the paintings. First, we extract the multi-view local color features for all training images using a novel descriptor named Affine Lab-SIFT. Then we can learn the codebook from all these features by k -means clustering. Afterwards, we create a feature histogram for each image in the form of bag-of-visual-words and use a supervised fashion to train a classifier, which is used for further painting classification. Experimental results from two different datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed classification system and the advantage of the proposed features, especially in the case of small-size training samples.",

More specifically, our analysis has the objective of the dancer assessment with respect to both choreography execution accuracy and the synchronization of the dance movements with the musical rhythm. For this task, we make use of the explicit, expert-provided knowledge on dance movements and their relations to the musical beat. Due to the complexity of this knowledge, the MEBNs were used as the probabilistic ontological framework in which the knowledge is formalized. The reason we opt for MEBNs for this task is that they combine Bayesian and formal (first-order) logic into a single model. In this way, the Bayesian probabilistic part of MEBNs was used to capture, using example data and training, the implicit part of the expert knowledge about dances, i.e., this part of the knowledge that cannot be formalized and explicitly defined accurately enough, while the logical maintains the explicit knowledge representation in the same way ontologies do. Moreover, we present in detail the MEBN models we built for Tsamiko and Salsa, using expert-provided explicit knowledge. Last, we conduct experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MEBN-based methodology we employ to achieve our analysis objectives. The results of the experiments demonstrate the superiority of MEBNs to conventional models, such as BNs, in terms of the dancer assessment accuracy.",

    "abstract": "There is a long history of research exploring how augmented and mixed reality systems can be used to support visitors to cultural heritage locations, but the technological or application specific focus of much of this research means that our understanding of how these experiences work is more of a collection of insights, rather than a coherent theory about how the elements of the experience come together. There is a danger that without developing this knowledge further, our systems will be technologically complex, but experientially simplistic. In this article, we explore how one form of mixed reality experience, digital locative storytelling, can impact the experience of place, and in turn how place impacts the experience of story. We have analyzed 33 interviews, and 25 participant observations from 12 story deployments at 2 different sites. Our findings confirm that locative storytelling experiences not only impart information to readers, but also help them to rediscover familiar places and see hidden relationships—especially through time. But our findings also show how the success of the experience is reliant on the balance of attention between the virtual and real (the story and the place), and that issues with navigation, social interactions, and technology are problematic because they can disrupt this balance. Digital locative experiences therefore need to be designed carefully in order to create a balance of attention (e.g., by aligning the elements of the story with the topology and character of place). We call this a state of Loco-Narrative Harmony, in which place and story are working together and reader attention is balanced, creating an effect that is greater than the sum of its parts.",

Our method converts the hard to solve image-to-geometry registration task in a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) plus a 3D/3D alignment problem. We exploit a SfM framework that, starting just from an unordered image collection, computes an estimate of the camera parameters and a sparse 3D geometry deriving from matched image features. We then coarsely register this model to the given 3D geometry by estimating a global scale and absolute orientation using two solutions: a minimal user intervention or a stochastic global point set registration approach. A specialized sparse bundle adjustment (SBA) step, that exploits the correspondence between the sparse geometry and the fine input 3D model, is then used to refine intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of each camera. Output data is suitable for photo blending frameworks to produce seamless colored models. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on a series of synthetic and real-world 2D/3D Cultural Heritage datasets.",

In this work, we focus on the task of recovering characters and symbols from images of corrupted archaeological artifacts where data is partially erased, occluded, or overwritten by other data. Such phenomena can be widely observed in image datasets of palimpsests and petroglyphs consisting of erased, overwritten, and in general heavily degraded data. Segmentation and binarization are typically applied to such images to detect and recover characters and symbols from their background. However, these methods mainly focus on the visible data while in our case, due to large corruption, both visible and invisible information should be considered. For example, computing the segmentation mask of an occluded character requires also labeling invisible pixels and missing parts. In this work, we introduce a deep neural network that computes character segmentation in palimpsests and petroglyphs while overcoming occlusions, missing parts, and degradation. Our network has inference abilities, thus, not only segmenting the symbol’s foreground pixels but also inferring and completing missing and corrupted parts. Since palimpsests and petroglyphs have very limited annotated ground-truth data, we also introduce data augmentation tools to properly train our network. We demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative performance of our method also including a user study involving expert evaluation.",

The main results obtained in this study are supposed to be the identification of the main areas for creating virtual reality in the activities of contemporary theatres and changes in the work of theatre groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prospects for subsequent academic research in this field are determined by the increasing usage of modern technologies for creating virtual reality within the framework of the modern development of theatrical culture and the need for a deep study of this factor as the one that defines the prospects for the technological development of the contemporary theatre scene.

Virtual learning and performing have become the need of the hour in the field of performing arts as well. The objective of this work is threefold; first, this creates benchmark datasets to be shared to make a beneficial impact and for a meaningful engagement by capturing, recognising, and classifying the multimedia content for hastamudras (hand poses) in Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance form, which plays a significant role in the conservation of intangible cultural heritage, second, as tutoring system to aspiring learners and third, to build video recommendation systems to promote art as a tool for building an international relationship and further elevate the significance of soft-power through performing arts. This article proposes applying the deep-learning techniques of CNNs as a critical technology to recognise the correct mudra. Experimental results on our challenging mudra dataset through the MobileNet architecture show 85%–95% accuracy in real-time, which outperforms the Sebastien-Marcel dataset. The time taken to process an image is 0.172 seconds, and the result is significant considering that the images are dynamic.

    "abstract": "This study developed two distinct types of remote heritage virtual tourism programs, namely VR and AR. We utilized the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model to understand how users’ perceptions of vividness and interactivity in VR and AR influence their sense of presence and perceived authenticity. Furthermore, we explored how the sense of presence and perceived authenticity further impact tourists’ responses, including satisfaction and behavioral intention. The findings indicate differences between VR and AR in several aspects. To elaborate, in the context of VR, vividness significantly influences perceived authenticity, an effect not found within the AR setting. Furthermore, interactivity impacts the sense of presence in AR, but this is not the case in VR. Within an AR setting, a user's sense of presence directly influences their level of satisfaction, yet no corresponding impact was found in VR. Even though the results show varying influences of presence on user intention in VR and AR, no significant differences were discovered. By gaining an in-depth understanding of tourists’ actual perceptions of VR and AR applications, this study provides insights for heritage site managers on how to employ VR and AR to enhance the efficiency of virtual heritage experiences for tourists.",

Specifically, we present the prototype design and evaluation of HeritageSite AR, an AR exploration game for a Chinese heritage site known as the Relics of Arhat Monastery and Twin Pagoda , or Shuangta . To develop the AR game for use in heritage sites, we employed a holistic approach, beginning with a review of technical means for cultural application development. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with domain experts and administered an online survey to identify user requirements and design goals, which informed our prototype design. An evaluation study showed positive feedback regarding the impact of game design on meaningful and playful CH site experience, and identified areas for potential refinements in future iterations. We discuss the implications and lessons learned for our future work, which may also interest researchers and practitioners exploring the use of AR technologies and game design in heritage site contexts.",

    "abstract": "The current methods to describe the shape of three-dimensional objects can be classified into two groups: methods following the composition of primitives approach and descriptions based on procedural shape representations . As a 3D acquisition device returns an agglomeration of elementary objects (e.g. a laser scanner returns points), the model acquisition pipeline always starts with a composition of primitives. Due to the semantic information carried with a generative description, a procedural model provides valuable metadata that make up the basis for digital library services: retrieval, indexing, and searching. An important challenge in computer graphics in the field of cultural heritage is to build a bridge between the generative and the explicit geometry description combining both worlds—the accuracy and systematics of generative models with the realism and the irregularity of real-world data. A first step towards a semantically enriched data description is a reconstruction algorithm based on decreasing exponential fitting. This approach is robust towards outliers and multiple dataset mixtures. It does not need a preceding segmentation and is able to fit a generative shape template to a point cloud identifying the parameters of a shape.",

    "abstract": "Digital gaming and digital technologies have their own unique cultural history while at the same time, the cultural heritage of digital technology is emerging. Digital technology has been understood as merely an apparatus that can be utilized for transferring nondigital historical content to novel digital products. These products, including types such as multimedia shows, games, Web sites, and online course environments, are targeted at juvenile audiences, who are typically considered to be the primary users of such new media forms. For decades, the changes and new continuities in both mediated content and the technology of mediation were mostly hidden in the shadow of educational goal-attainment. This article draws inspiration from ideas on media archaeology and the cultures of history. In this article we suggest an approach of internal and external cultural heritage of games cultures. We introduce a four-fold table regarding the relationship between cultural heritage (or history) and digital technology. The four-fold table consists of the dimension of a researcher's comprehensive/applied goal-attainment and the dimension of the internality/externality of history and cultural heritage in regard to the digital game cultural context. Within these cultures, there are several alternative ways of discussing the relationship between history, cultural heritage, and digital technology, separate from the traditional edutainment perspective. The dimensions are illustrated with practical examples, including a typologization of historiographical computer games, retrogaming, and educational workshops on game classics.",

We also introduce a mechanically moving projection surface that increases the degree of freedom of the projection content. Both geometric and radiometric calibration methods are used to correctly project a high-quality texture onto the moving 3D projection surface without perspective distortion. To evaluate the strength of the system and a potential for deployment in a general museum context, we conduct a user study that includes both the visitors and museum staff. The result shows that the proposed system can enrich the museum exhibition by creating a virtual cultural object with substantial 3D effect and high-fidelity appearance. We also demonstrate various applications of the system that provide dynamic content of a virtual cultural object by changing its appearance as well as the viewpoint.",

With technology resources and the convergence of media such as text, data, maps, charts, pictures, and virtual models, among others, cultural heritage can be celebrated, contemplated, and admired more easily. However, creating an application for reactivation of cultural heritage by citizens remains a challenge because there is no clear methodology to be followed for its development. As far as we know, no one has proposed a methodological framework for applications in this field to determine which aspects should be considered and which tools should be used to successfully develop a cultural heritage application. This article proposes a methodological framework that allows a developer to categorize the type of cultural heritage application to develop and determine which types and quality of resources should be used in the application to provide good usability while fitting project requirements. The methodology is applied for the reactivation of Cisneros marketplace at Medellin, in Colombia, as a case study for testing the framework proposed.

    "abstract": "Munsell Soil Charts are a very common tool used by archaeologists for the color specification task. Charts are usually employed directly on cultural heritage sites to identify color of soils and collected artifacts. However, charts are designed to be used specifying the color through subjective perception of users, by visual mean, in a time-consuming and error-prone procedure. It is likely that two users may estimate different Munsell notations for the same specimen, as colors are not perceived uniformly by different people. Hence, estimation process should be repeated several times and by more than a single expert user to be considered reliable. In this work, we employ our framework, Automatic Recognition of Color for Archaeology (ARCA), specifically designed to provide a method for objective, deterministic, fast, and automatic Munsell estimation. ARCA is a valuable asset for archaeologists as it provides the definition of a smooth pipeline for an affordable Munsell notation estimation: image acquisition of specimens with general purpose digital cameras in an uncontrolled environment, manual sampling of specimen images in the ARCA desktop application, automatic Munsell color specification, and report generation. We further assess our method with improved color tolerance validations and evaluations, introducing a comparison between Δ E 00 , Δ E 76 , Δ L *, Δ a *, and Δ b * differences. One of the main contributions of this article is the extension of our former dataset ARCA108. We gathered two additional sets of images obtaining a new dataset consisting of pictures of Munsell Soil Charts Editions 2000 and 2009 plus images from a real test case with 16 pottery shards. The new dataset counts 56,160 samples and 328 images, so it has been called ARCA328. Experimental results are reported to investigate which could be the best configuration to be used in the acquisition phase.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the digital preservation of cultural heritage materials, multimedia tools (e.g., based on automatic visual processing) considerably ease the work of scholars in the humanities and help them to perform quantitative analysis of their data. In this context, this article assesses three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures along with three learning approaches to train them for hieroglyph classification, which is a very challenging task due to the limited availability of segmented ancient Maya glyphs. More precisely, the first approach, the baseline, relies on pretrained networks as feature extractor. The second one investigates a transfer learning method by fine-tuning a pretrained network for our glyph classification task. The third approach considers directly training networks from scratch with our glyph data. The merits of three different network architectures are compared: a generic sequential model (i.e., LeNet), a sketch-specific sequential network (i.e., Sketch-a-Net), and the recent Residual Networks. The sketch-specific model trained from scratch outperforms other models and training strategies. Even for a challenging 150-class classification task, this model achieves 70.3% average accuracy and proves itself promising in case of a small amount of cultural heritage shape data. Furthermore, we visualize the discriminative parts of glyphs with the recent Grad-CAM method, and demonstrate that the discriminative parts learned by the model agree, in general, with the expert annotation of the glyph specificity (diagnostic features). Finally, as a step toward systematic evaluation of these visualizations, we conduct a perceptual crowdsourcing study. Specifically, we analyze the interpretability of the representations from Sketch-a-Net and ResNet-50. Overall, our article takes two important steps toward providing tools to scholars in the digital humanities: increased performance for automation and improved interpretability of algorithms.",

An effective method to automate these routine phases is presented in this article. The proposed method performs a shape feature segmentation of the sherds, which is fundamental to undertake any further analysis, such as potsherds classification, reconstruction, or cataloging. A set of specific shape features, useful to understand the find properties, is defined and methods for recognizing them are proposed.

Sinn” at the Ruhr Museum in Germany where the games were installed, and from participants in an online course describing the games. From analysing data collected, we outline four factors inhibiting the capacity of AGs to stimulate critical reflection (topic, context, design, and assumptions about games) and propose strategies for overcoming these inhibitors.

An objective of the project A Puzzle in 4D is to digitize the documentation and create metadata for analog and digital resources in order to provide the data to the research community and facilitate future work for this important archaeological site. Using an example of 3D reconstruction of a tomb, we show how the knowledge graph linked to digital resources can be exploited for a specific task to encounter available information that is essential for a virtual reconstruction. Moreover, we show an approach of modeling to represent the interpretations supporting reconstructions as well as relate them to the sources used, thus providing transparency for the model and provenance data. Modeling for excavation documentation as well as virtual reconstruction has been tailored to the large amount of data processed from the project. The goal is to propose a semantic modeling feasible even on a large scale while still preserving the basic underlying ontological structures.",

We represent the objects of interest as a series of registered layers of image-based shape and material data. These layers are represented at different scales and can come out of a variety of pipelines. These layers can include both Reflectance Transformation Imaging representations, and spatially varying normal and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function fields, possibly as a result of fusing multi-spectral data. An overlay image pyramid associates visual annotations to the various scales. The overlay pyramid of each layer is created at data preparation time by either one of the three subsequent methods: (1) by importing it from other pipelines, (2) by creating it with the simple annotation drawing toolkit available within the viewer, and (3) with external image editing tools. This makes it easier for the user to seamlessly draw annotations over the region of interest. At runtime, clients can access an annotated multi-layered dataset by a standard web server. Users can explore these datasets on a variety of devices; they range from small mobile devices to large-scale displays used in museum installations. On all these aforementioned platforms, JavaScript/WebGL2 clients running in browsers are fully capable of performing layer selection, interactive relighting, enhanced visualization, and annotation display. We address the problem of clutter by embedding interactive lenses. This focus-and-context-aware (multiple-layer) exploration tool supports exploration of more than one representation in a single view.

    "abstract": "Fingerprints play a central role in any field where person identification is required. In forensics and biometrics, three-dimensional fingerprint-based imaging technologies, and corresponding recognition methods, have been vastly investigated. In cultural heritage, preliminary studies provide evidence that the three-dimensional impressions left on objects from the past (ancient fingerprints) are of paramount relevance to understand the socio-cultural systems of former societies, to possibly identify a single producer of multiple potteries, and to authenticate the artist of a sculpture. These findings suggest that the study of ancient fingerprints can be further investigated and open new avenues of research. However, the potential for capturing and analyzing ancient fingerprints is still largely unexplored in the context of cultural heritage research. In fact, most of the existing studies have focused on plane fingerprint representations and commercial software for image processing. Our aim is to outline the opportunities and challenges of digital fingerprint recognition in answering a range of questions in cultural heritage research. Therefore, we summarize the fingerprint-based imaging technologies, reconstruction methods, and analyses used in biometrics that could be beneficial to the study of ancient fingerprints in cultural heritage. In addition, we analyze the works conducted on ancient fingerprints from potteries and ceramic/fired clay sculptures. We conclude with a discussion on the open challenges and future works that could initiate novel strategies for ancient fingerprint acquisition, digitization, and processing within the cultural heritage community.",

Public access to the records of their government is thus inhibited by the long backlogs of material awaiting such reviews. This article studies one aspect of that problem by first creating a new public test collection with annotations for one class of exempt material subject to the deliberative process privilege, and then by using that test collection to study the ability of current text classification techniques to identify those materials that are exempt from release under that privilege. Results show that when the system is trained and evaluated using annotations from the same reviewer, even difficult cases can often be reliably detected. However, results also show that differences in reviewer interpretations, differences in record custodians, and differences in topics of the records used for training and testing can pose challenges.",

This 3D modelling work is one of the strategic actions of the recently finished Master Plan for Conservation of Heritage Municipal Buildings (PD-PHiM) for the City of Seville (Spain). This plan deals with the analysis of a group of 115 municipally owned buildings of high heritage interest that include different typologies, chronologies scales, and uses. This investigation has complemented and continued the initial work begun by the Seville Spatial Data Infrastructure (ide.SEVILLA) in the field of 3D mapping of urban environments and its publication as institutional open data. The implemented improvements started on an initial diagnosis of a preliminary urban model, which reached a level of detail (LOD) of 2, as defined by the CityGML standard, in only 20% of the registered assets in the PD-PHiM database. The proposed methodology has achieved the automation of most of the process of building 3D geo-referenced models to increase the percentage of assets that reach the LOD2 to 75%. The initial information comes from the use of institutional spatial data of different types and sources: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Spanish Cadastre Office, and so on. Additionally, the generated entities have been linked to a complex, multidisciplinary and multiscale database, designed within the framework of the strategic actions of the PD-PHiM. The contributions of the proposal, especially in the automation of processes, imply a considerable saving of resources in comparison with other methods in which the modelling is eminently carried out manually. Thus, they are complementary to those that are related to the use of 3D modelling software intended for other purposes, with the consequent incompatibilities and hard interoperability procedures with GIS environments that this implies.",

The project is developing a knowledge graph (KG) to facilitate information retrieval and discovery over the reconstructed items. The project decided to adopt Semantic Web technologies to support its distributed KG and reasoning. In this article, we present our approach to KG generation and management. We elaborate on how we help historians contribute to the KG (via a suite of spreadsheets) and its ontology. We furthermore demonstrate how we use named graphs to store different versions of factoids and their provenance information and how these are serviced in two different endpoints. Modeling data in this manner allows us to acknowledge that history is, to some extent, subjective and different perspectives can exist in parallel. The construction of the KG is driven by competency questions elicited from subject matter experts within the consortium. We avail of CIDOC-CRM as our KG’s foundation, though we needed to extend this ontology with various qualifiers (types) and relations to support the competency questions. We illustrate how one can explore the KG to gain insights and answer questions. We conclude that CIDOC-CRM provides an adequate, albeit complex, foundation for the KG and that named graphs and Linked Data principles are a suitable mechanism to manage sets of factoids and their provenance.",

The project sought to re-think the role of the museum within regional creative economies and to argue for the importance of the regional museum as a hub for digital design and innovation. Through innovative forms of collaborative research practice the project was able to develop new understandings of the ways in which collaborative approaches to the design and development of interactive digital media can be used to build skilled communities of practice around regional museums. The project took a critical stance to the use of immersive media technologies and led to the development of innovative and highly distinctive digital immersive installations which emerged in response to the specific opportunities and design requirements of museums and their audiences. This paper will set out the findings of this project as well as identify new creative directions and new forms of collaborative design practice which can be adopted and adapted for use across the museum sector.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in optical metrology have enabled continuous documentation of dense 3-dimensional (3D) point clouds of construction projects, including cultural heritage preservation projects. These point clouds must then be further processed to generate semantic digital models, which is integral to the lifecycle management of heritage sites. For large-scale and continuous digital documentation, processing of dense 3D point clouds is computationally cumbersome, and consequentially requires additional hardware for data management and analysis, increasing the time, cost, and complexity of the project. Fast and reliable solutions for generating the geometric digital models is, hence, eminently desirable. This article presents an original approach to generate reliable semantic digital models of heritage hemispherical domes using only two images. New closed formulations were derived to establish the relationships between a sphere and its projected ellipse onto an image. These formulations were then utilised to create new methods for: (i) selecting the best pair of images from an image network; (ii) detecting ellipses corresponding to projection of spheres in images; (iii) matching of the detected ellipses between images; and (iv) generating the sphere's geometric digital models. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated under both laboratory and real-world datasets. Laboratory experiments revealed that the proposed process using the best pair of images provided results as accurate as that achieved using eight randomly selected images, while improving computation time by a factor of 50. The results of the two real-world datasets showed that the digital model of a hemispherical dome was generated with 6.2 mm accuracy, while improving the total computation time of current best practice by a factor of 7. Real-world experimentation also showed that the proposed method can provide metric-scale definition for photogrammetric point clouds with 3 mm accuracy using spherical targets. The results suggest that the proposed method was successful in automatically generating fast and accurate geometric digital models of hemispherical domes.",

The purpose of this article is to analyse the use of digital tools in the practice of modern theatre art, which makes theatre in today's realities more demanding. The theoretical analysis of scientific literature, the historical method, the comparative method, the typological and systemic method, and the generalisation of theoretical and practical experience of the modern theatre were chosen as the main methods of cognition in this study. It was concluded that the modern theatre, through the use of digital technology, has been enriched with current technical concepts and formats.

    "abstract": "Since herbarium specimens are increasingly becoming digitized and accessible in online repositories, an important need has emerged to develop automated tools to process and enrich these collections to facilitate better access to the preserved archives. Particularly, automatic enrichment of multi-specimen herbaria sheets poses unique challenges and problems that have not been adequately addressed. The complexity of localization of species in a page increases exponentially when multiple specimens are present in the same page. This already challenges the performance of models that work accurately with single specimens. Therefore, in this work, we have performed experiments to identify the models that perform well for the plant specimen localization problem. The major bottleneck for performing such experiments was the lack of labeled data. We also address this problem by proposing tools and algorithms to semi-automatically generate annotations for herbarium images. Based on our experiments, segmentation models perform much better than detection models for the task of plant localization. Our binary segmentation model can accurately extract specimens from the background and achieves an F1 score of 0.977. The ablation experiments for multi-specimen instance segmentation show that our proposed augmentation method provides a 38% increase in performance (0.51 mAP@0.9 versus 0.37) on a dataset of 1,500 plant instances.",

    "abstract": "Archives are facing numerous challenges. On the one hand, archival assets are evolving to encompass digitized documents and increasing quantities of born-digital information in diverse formats. On the other hand, the audience is changing along with how it wishes to access archival material. Moreover, the interoperability requirements of cultural heritage repositories are growing. In this context, the Portuguese Archives started an ambitious program aiming to evolve its data model, migrate existing records, and build a new archival management system appropriate to both archival tasks and public access. The overall goal is to have a fine-grained and flexible description, more machine-actionable than the current one. This work describes ArchOnto, a linked open data model for archives, and rules for its automatic population from existing records. ArchOnto adopts a semantic web approach and encompasses the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model and additional ontologies, envisioning interoperability with datasets curated by multiple communities of practice. Existing ISAD(G)-conforming descriptions are being migrated to the new model using the direct mappings provided here. We used a sample of 25 records associated with different description levels to validate the completeness and conformity of ArchOnto to existing data. This work is in progress and is original in several respects: (1) it is one of the first approaches to use CIDOC CRM in the context of archives, identifying problems and questions that emerged during the process and pinpointing possible solutions; (2) it addresses the balance in the model between the migration of existing records and the construction of new ones by archive professionals; and (3) it adopts an open world view on linking archival data to global information sources.",

Thus, it’s of utmost importance to preserve them by identifying the existent, or presumptive, defects using novel methods so that renovation processes can be done in a timely manner and with higher accuracy. The main goal of this research is to use new Deep Learning (DL) methods in the process of preserving CHBs (situated in Iran); a goal that has been neglected especially in developing countries such as Iran, as these countries still preserve their CHBs using manual, and even archaic, methods that need direct human supervision. Having proven their effectiveness and performance when it comes to processing images, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a staple in computer vision (CV) literacy and this article is not exempt. When lacking enough CHB images, training a CNN from scratch would be very difficult and prone to overfitting; that’s why we opted to use a technique called transfer learning (TL) in which we used pre-trained ResNet, MobileNet, and Inception networks, for classification. Even more, the Grad-CAM was utilized to localize the defects to some extent. The final results were very favorable, compared to similar articles. We reached 94% in Precision, Recall, and F1-Score with our fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model, which showed a 4%–5% improvement over other similar works. The final proposed model can pave the way for moving from manual to unmanned CHB conservation, hence an increase in accuracy and a decrease in human-induced errors.",

    "abstract": "With increased concerns about data protection and privacy over the past several years, and concomitant introduction of regulations restricting access to personally information (PI), archivists in many jurisdictions now must undertake ‘sensitivity reviews’ of archival documents to determine if they can make those documents accessible to researchers. Such reviews are onerous, given increasing volume of records, and complex, due to how difficult it can be for archivists to identify whether records contain personal information (PI) under the provisions of various laws. Despite research into the application of tools and techniques to automate sensitivity reviews, effective solutions remain elusive. Not yet explored as a solution to the challenge of enabling access to archival holdings subject to privacy restrictions is the application of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) - a class of emerging technologies that rest on the assumption that a body of documents is confidential or private and must remain so. While seemingly being counter-intuitive to apply PETs to making archives more accessible, we argue that PETs could provide an opportunity to protect PI in archival holdings whilst still enabling research on those holdings. In this paper, to lay a foundation for archival experimentation with use of PETs, we contribute an overview of these technologies based on a scoping review and discuss possible use cases and future research directions.",

The validation of the platform was conducted through the development of associated applications (instantiated in the context of the PASEV 1 project) and taking into account its main objectives of dissemination of the cultural heritage of the Portuguese city of Évora and its soundscape. The prototypes, implemented through the platform, take advantage of the two main components of interaction incorporated: the interactive map and augmented reality (AR). Thus, a musical instruments collection game was conceived having a young audience as main target, which incorporates AR technology associated to itineraries.

    "abstract": "Understanding cultural heritage by visiting cultural sites is vital to individuals and communities across the world. It is, therefore, important to create authentic learning situations where students can experience and meaningfully learn about cultural heritage; however, authentic learning in situ can be a challenge. Learning during educational field trips at cultural sites is often not well supported, while students’ interest and motivation to learn are not always activated, which ultimately impacts the learning experience during the visit. Furthermore, students may be distracted with off-task activities and by the novelty effect of the setting during the field trip and may find it difficult to dedicate themselves to the learning activities. Augmented and virtual reality technologies, and approaches such as gamification, have created new contexts for location-based, technology-enhanced learning, which can help address some of the challenges faced during educational field trips. This paper describes the design and validation of CompARe, a gamified augmented reality learning environment (LE) created to support student learning while visiting a cultural heritage site. The CompARe LE is built around an inquiry-based scenario in which students, working in groups, take on the role of art historians and are asked to date an important wall mosaic by visiting four digital hotspots located throughout the site. CompARe was developed and validated using a design-based methodology. We present two case studies of upper elementary students using CompARe and discuss the affordances and challenges of the learning experience. We conclude with lessons learned about the effectiveness of the CompARe learning approach and discuss future steps.",

    "abstract": "ArcheoTUI is a new tangible user interface for the efficient assembly of the 3D scanned fragments of fractured archeological objects. An efficient user interaction for the complex task to orientate or position two 3D objects relative to each other is essential, eventually in addition to automatic matching techniques. Our key idea is to use tangible props for the manipulation of the virtual fragments. In each hand, the user manipulates an electromagnetically tracked prop, and the translations and rotations are directly mapped to the corresponding virtual fragments on the display. For each hand, a corresponding foot pedal is used to clutch the movements of the hands. Hence, the user's hands can be repositioned, or the user can be switched. The software of ArcheoTUI is designed to easily change assembly hypotheses, beyond classical undo/redo, by using a scene graph. We designed ArcheoTUI on the demand of archeaologists and in a direct collaboration with them, and we conducted two user studies on site at their workplace. The first user study revealed that the interface, and especially the foot pedal, was accepted, and that all the users managed to solve simple assembly tasks. In a second user study, we compare a different clutching mechanism with buttons on the props to the foot pedal mechanism. This second user study revealed that the movement of the hands is more similar to real-world assembly scenarios when using the foot pedals, and that the users can keep on concentrating on the actual assembly task. Finally, we show how the virtual assembly is used for a fractured archeological finding.",

    "abstract": "During the construction of an underground museum in the historic city center of Cologne, Germany, large parts of the Roman and medieval city are being excavated. The newly excavated remains as well as remains of the Roman city, which had already been excavated in 1954, exhibit structural damages. While at first deficiencies in the construction were assumed to be the cause of the damages, in 2003 a seismogenic origin was suggested. To further test this hypothesis of seismically induced slope movements and other possible causes, a multidisciplinary project was started. One step in this project is the documentation of the damages using a 3D laser scanner, followed by a quantitative damage analysis. This article presents the 3D documentation and the quantitative damage analysis of a recently excavated medieval cesspit. The 8.3m-deep cesspit was mapped during 11 campaigns using a phase-based 3D laser scanner. Due to the static conditions of the cesspit, the structure could not be excavated in its entirety. After the excavation of every 1-2m-section, restoration work had to be done to avoid a collapse of the construction. The laser scanning technique offered the possibility of working parallel to the excavation so the original conditions of each section could be documented before the restoration. The resulting models were used to identify, classify, and quantify the structural damages of the cesspit.",

Our method does not require meshing or extensive processing of the input model, works on a coarsely spatially reordered point stream, and can adaptively refine point cloud geometry on the basis of image content. Seamless multiband image blending is obtained by using GPU-accelerated screen-space operators, which solve point set visibility, compute a per-pixel view-dependent weight, and ensure a smooth weighting function over each input image. The proposed approach works independently on each image in a memory-coherent manner, and can be easily extended to include further image-quality estimators. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on a series of massive real-world point datasets.",

    "abstract": "DirectorNotation (DN) is a symbolic language intended to express the content of film (motion pictures), much as notes provide a language for the writing of music. It thus constitutes a new approach to the creative process of filmmaking. Musicians, and also choreographers, have long been able to express their creative choices using logical symbolic structures (music notation and dance notation), yet those working in the movie industry have to rely on cartoons and verbal description. Development of a successful notation becomes appropriate today because of its dependence upon the parallel development of effective notation-based software tools such as visualisation (automatic animated storyboard generation), production budget estimation, and automated rough editing of dailies. Directors maintain complete control of their creative decisions when using DN. It is an artistic language supported by technical tools for planning and analysis. The notation is not merely a graphical user interface for these tools, and the tools are never intended to make decisions for the director. This article introduces DN, argues its great cultural significance, provides market research results showing directors' interest in using it, and reports on two controlled experiments confirming its effectiveness—including its usability in a practical context and its ability to represent and communicate the necessary information.",

In particular, the platform enables to perform two actions. First, pictures are added into the database: visitors manually align images to the digital model of the monument and than, by means of automatic procedures, images are enriched with 2D semantic annotations that are projected from the 3D model. Second, the collection of semantically-enriched data can be queried: when visitors select 2D images of the database, these are oriented in the 3D scene and superimposed onto the 3D-model. In this way, this tool provides access to textual and graphic information describing the photographed site (semantic, spatial, temporal features, etc.). Moreover, visitors can interact both with images and the 3D-model to highlight building parts by color. Accessible onsite and online, this tool can create awareness about conservation and is adapted to all kinds of audience: Students involved in educational workshops, visitors needing to extend their visit, and documentalists interested in the consultation of the iconographic corpus.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the preservation of archaeological data has been limited by the cost of materials and the physical space required to store them, but for the last 20 years, increasing amounts of digital data have been generated and stored online. New techniques in digital photography and document scanning have dramatically increased the amount of data that can be retained in digital format, while at the same time reducing the physical cost of production and storage. Vast numbers of hand written notes, grey literature documents, images of assemblages, contexts, and artefacts have been made available online. However, accessing these repositories is not always straightforward. Superficial interaction design, sparsely populated metadata, and heterogeneous schemas may prevent users from working the data that they need within archaeological archives. In this article, we present the work of the Digging into Archaeological Data and Image Search Metadata project (DADAISM), a multidisciplinary project that draws together the work of researchers from the fields of archaeology, interaction design, image processing and text mining to create an interactive system that supports archaeologists in their tasks in online archives. By adopting a user-centred approach with techniques grounded in contextual design, we identified the phases of archaeologists work in online archives, which are distinctive to this user group. The insights from this work drove the design and evaluation of an interactive system that successfully integrates content-based image based retrieval and improved metadata searching to deliver a positive user experience when working with online archives.",

Such interactive technologies act as a hook to attract visitor's attention, but if they do not provide opportunities to engage people in a more personal and meaningful way, they can be soon discarded. Augmented experiences need to be motivating and connect with values and expectations of visitors and institutions. In a world that is becoming more and more connected and moving towards a participatory culture, the need to participate actively to co-produce knowledge and meaning can be exploited as a powerful intrinsic motivator. In this article, we describe how the Social Display Environment (SDE) promotes participation in cultural spaces whilst keeping the physical connection with the exhibition objects. The SDE makes use of Augmented Reality (AR) technology to augment physical artifacts in an exhibition with overlays of digital information that is generated by the end user (e.g., the visitor). The prototype was exhibited in a cultural center over a weekend to investigate different dynamics in terms of content generation, visitors’ interactions and perceptions with respect to the interplay of digital information and physical artifacts. The prototype was assessed as easy to learn and useful and showed potential to promote a number of meaningful social interactions around the objects involved in the exhibition.",

Low-magnification 3D digital microscopy is well suited for analyzing morphologies, depths, and profiles of different punch marks.

The 3D reconstruction of the surface engraved also allowed identifying types of anomalies that could be useful as possible authentication markers.

    "abstract": "This article presents the semiautomatic parametric method we have conceived and developed for the 3D modelling of town parts of physical town scale models. On one hand, most photogrammetric and lasergrammetric methods do not use parametric models to assist the 3D modelling. On the other hand, architectural parametric models do not use automatic photogrammetric and lasergrammetric methods to position and dimension the parametric models. This article brings both techniques together to provide an entirely automatic system for the 3D modelling of the buildings of physical scale models. In a previous experience, our method was not completely automatic and not parametric. This led to a time-consuming process and some difficulties for the handling and adjustments of the buildings arose. Town scale models realised between the 16th and the 19th centuries are used as an application of our method. These physical models are made out of wood and paper with a scale of around 1:600. From textured meshes obtained from pictures with 123D Catch software, we automatically extract the relevant features. We also identify the type of parametric building before determining the parameters' values to be assigned to the building model. Around 95% of the scale model's buildings are of the most common types of building and can be easily modelled with parametric components. The remaining are unique and/or complex cases that can be treated as before or described by a specific parametric model added to the library by the user. Indeed, the parametric models are described by the user in a specific part of the software, so that the library is easily extendable by a non--computer science developer.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of the statistical description of 3D surfaces with the purpose of automatic classification and retrieval of archaeological potsherds. These are particularly interesting problems in archaeology, as pottery comprises a great volume of findings in archaeological excavations. Indeed, the analysis of potsherds brings relevant cues for understanding the culture of ancient groups. In particular, we develop a new local shape descriptor for 3D surfaces, called the histogram of spherical orientations (HoSO), which we use in combination with a bag-of-words approach to compute visual similarity between 3D surfaces. Given a point of interest on a 3D surface, its local shape descriptor (HoSO) captures the distribution of the spherical orientations of its neighboring points. In turn, those spherical orientations are computed with respect to the point of interest itself, both in the azimuth and the zenith axis. The proposed HoSO is invariant to scale transformations and highly robust to rotation and noise. In addition, it is efficient, as it only exploits the information of the position of the 3D points and disregards other types of information like faces or normals. We performed experiments on a set of 3D surfaces representing potsherds from the Teotihuacan civilization and further validations on a set of 3D models of generic objects. Our results show that our methodology is effective for describing 3D models and that it improves classification performance with respect to previous local descriptors.",

Three main aspects of tango argentino are in focus—the music, the dance, and the people—in order to understand what is considered danceable in tango music. The study of all three parts involves computer-aided analysis approaches, and the results are examined within ethnochoreological and ethnomusicological frameworks. Two approaches are illustrated in detail to show initial results of the research model. Network analysis based on the collection of online tango event data and quantitative evaluation of data gathered by an online survey showed significant results, corroborating the hypothesis of gatekeeping effects in the shaping of musical preferences. The experiment design includes incorporation of motion capture technology into dance research. We demonstrate certain advantages of transdisciplinary approaches in the study of Intangible Cultural Heritage, in contrast to conventional studies based on methods from just one academic discipline.",

Discussions in this article are based on our experiences in developing the Mao-Kung Cauldron time perception journey multimedia application. This installation was inspired by the Mao-Kung Cauldron, an ancient bronze cauldron in the collection of the National Palace Museum known for its historical significance. The question, however, lies in how to create an experience in which the audiences can interact with the past. To address this issue, the research team used the Kinect-based breath detection and deterioration/recovery simulation technologies to develop the application. This installation is the first application linked to Kinect-based breath detection and deterioration/recovery simulation technologies. The main contribution of this work is the analysis of design concepts, design decisions, and evaluations in a museum setting. We conduct a control group study to compare the outcomes between the experimental group (Mao-Kung Cauldron time perception journey multimedia application) and control group (asynchronous web-based kiosk). Both the quantitative (questionnaire survey) and qualitative methods (observation) are used to analyze the collected data. This work proposes a feasibility design to let museum audiences experience the features of cultural object by the virtual time perception journey application.",

    "abstract": "Information retrieval in a knowledge rich domain poses challenges that are different from other domains. The domain of fine arts and cultural heritage is an exemplar of such a domain. The many facets of, and complex interrelations between, works of fine art are not easily addressed by conventional keyword-based approaches or even by structured cataloguing systems. Information retrieval challenges in this domain include: the conversion of existing legacy data into knowledge representations that emulate the semantics of the domain's relationships; and easy access to a robust knowledge representation for users unfamiliar with query languages. Our research addresses aspects of both challenges as they are connected and may benefit from being addressed in conjunction. Based on a study on user preferences in art image search and a review of existing structured resources for cataloguing art and heritage information, we have developed two prototypes: Ontology Populator and Artfinder . The first prototype, Ontology Populator , is used to automatically enrich data akin to legacy data kept by heritage institutions and transform it into a knowledge base. The second prototype is a graphical query builder, Artfinder , which interacts with the knowledge base. The Artfinder interface, is constructed dynamically from the structure of the underlying knowledge. A task-based evaluation of Artfinder was carried out with 10 expert and 10 layperson evaluators. Participants reviewed the interface favourably and the evaluation also revealed potential for improvement. Artfinder and its “query logic,” perhaps is a semantically richer mode of accessing knowledge repositories, allowing for logically more complex queries than are currently supported outside the realm of dedicated query languages. We believe that domain experts and perhaps informed laypersons will benefit from this retrieval approach.",

These knowledge and skills constitute intangible cultural heritage and refer to the fruit of diverse expertise founded and propagated over the centuries thanks to the ingeniousness of the gesture and the creativity of the human spirit. Nowadays, this expertise is very often threatened with disappearance because of the difficulty to resist globalization and the fact that most of those “expertise holders” are not easily accessible due to geographical or other constraints. In this article, a methodological framework for capturing and modeling gestural knowledge and skills in wheel-throwing pottery is proposed. It is based on capturing gestures using wireless inertial sensors and statistical modeling. In particular, we used a system that allows for online alignment of gestures using a modified Hidden Markov Model. This methodology is implemented into a human--computer interface, which permits both the modeling and recognition of expert technical gestures. This system could be used to assist in the learning of these gestures by giving continuous feedback in real time by measuring the difference between expert and learner gestures. The system has been tested and evaluated on different potters with rare expertise, which is strongly related to their local identity.",

    "abstract": "This article deals with storage and transportation of fragile heritage objets. The main goal is to create an ad hoc packaging software solution by combining the use of 3D scanning and 3D milling technologies. Traditionally, packaging for this kind of object is made manually, creating custom supports and boxes adapted to the specific needs and particularities of each case. This process is time consuming and fully depends on the conservator’s skills. On the other hand, the proposed solution provides a faster execution and a standard solution adapted to every object. The process starts with the acquisition of 3D digital models of the original artifacts and uses an interactive GPU-accelerated algorithm to assist the conservator in the construction of the package. The final result is a CNC program that is sent to a low-cost milling machine to produce the housing for the selected artifact. Unlike 3D printers, milling machines allow working with lots of different materials, which is a key aspect for this kind of package: chemical stability and shock absorption are mandatory. Given that during the design process original artifacts are only manipulated in the acquisition stage, risks of damaging them are also reduced. Since the whole process is considered in the same application, intermediate calculations are performed considering manufacturing and user-defined restrictions. This way, together with a GPU implementation, achieved results are very fast, providing a real-time application with visual feedback.",

It is an important issue that limits the exploitation of AR technology with a view to hidden cultural heritage promotion. The current study presents a hybrid image recognition technique used in an AR application and its evaluation in the outdoor settings. The hybrid technique is based on an image-based marker and its evaluation mainly aimed to study if and to what extent it is accepted by the users, if it raises aesthetic issues, and if it affects the use and acceptance of the AR in culture field. The evaluation was based on a qualitative research and the results showed that to most participants the used hybrid technique does not create an aesthetical issue.

    "abstract": "Multi-area visitor counting plays a critical role in museum management, which can help administrative staff better study visitor flows and hotspots, so that they can ensure the quality and safety of visits. Internet of Things (IoT) techniques facilitate efficient recording and understanding of visitors’ spatial and temporal distribution in museums, and traditional visitor tracking applications use surveillance cameras or wireless connections with portable smart devices. However, these methods either involve privacy concerns or face the obstacle of getting natural behavioral data of all visitors. This article explores an IoT monitoring methodology in the field of museum studies, proposing a commodity WiFi-based head-counting framework that does not need the visitor to connect with any device. Our system analyzes the Channel State Information amplitude fluctuations at the fixed receiver caused when visitors cross the line-of-sight link. It enables multi-area visitor counting by achieving In-and-Out traffic detection at different sites with a convolutional neural network algorithm. The method also allows for a rough classification of visitor types based on body size, and an extra transfer module is presented to reduce training time for increasing sensing scenarios. Over 2,300 samples at five different sites were collected to test the usability. Experiment 1 implemented in three environments/deployments demonstrated that the proposed approach can be potentially implemented in variable sites of museums. It achieved high up to 95% and 99% accuracies for identifying the number and direction of people crossing, respectively. Experiment 2 sampled adults, children, and adult-child groups at a science museum and achieved approximately 89% classification accuracy of visitor types. Experiment 3 collected data for all cases in which up to three targets entered and exited simultaneously, and reached a recognition accuracy of around 88% for nine different cases. The potential and limitations for the practical application of wireless contactless sensing to cultural spaces are discussed.",

This article reports on the design, implementation, and evaluation of an interactive installation that promotes the heritage of Tinian marble crafts that is included in the representative list of intangible heritage by UNESCO and resides in the Museum of Marble Crafts in Tinos, Greece. The installation puts the museum visitor in the role of a crane operator in a virtual reconstruction of a historic quarry and requires them to operate the crane and move marble volumes with safety in cooperation with non-playable characters (NPCs). Our design approach aimed to engage visitors in a playful learning experience, incorporating aspects of the two museum's exhibits (crane, quarry). The empirical evaluation took place at the lab and the museum with promising results on UX and learning. In addition, we identify and discuss several prospects and drawbacks of designing playful tangible interfaces for other practitioners to consider in similar applications.",

Jewish Responsa literature contains thousands of answers to questions related to Jewish law (Halachah), spanning over 1,300 years by authors from all over the world. This literature is abundant with references, but because of their high lexical and format variability their automatic identification and extraction is very challenging. In this article we present a novel, multi layered approach that splits the reference extraction task into two main subtasks: i) reference boundaries’ identification; ii) reference internal components’ identification. We experimented with several different machine learning models: CRF (Conditional Random Field) model, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, and a combined approach, BERT-CRF. Additionally, we examined the influence of the training corpus on the model’s accuracy by comparing the performance of the models trained on modern Hebrew vs. Rabbinic Hebrew. We found that the best results were achieved by a BERT-CRF model trained on Rabbinic Hebrew. The constructed network can be utilized to build various tools for analyzing trends and influences in the Jewish Halachic corpus, such as the most influencing authors, the authors’ sources of authority, and their evolution over time and place.",

    "abstract": "The integration of photogrammetric modeling with the finite element method has emerged as a valuable approach in the practical analysis and determination of structural behavior. Photogrammetry, a technique that utilizes the analysis and processing of photographs to create three-dimensional models of real-world objects, offers a powerful tool for capturing accurate geometric data. On the other hand, the finite element method provides a numerical framework for the mathematical modeling and analysis of complex structural systems. This article presents a methodology that integrates these two modeling techniques by comparing their performance with integrated and classical models. Classical modelling is a technique performed in a finite element software and has been applied for many years. Accordingly, this study aims to reveal the limitations of photogrammetry, develop solutions to these limitations, and provide integrated model generation. The material definitions and load assignments were kept consistent across both modeling techniques for observing the differences in analysis. The study used SAP2000 and modal analysis was conducted to analyse the behaviour and to compare the geometrical properties of the models independent of region and time. The obtained results reveal a high level of similarity, with the natural vibration periods of the models demonstrating 98%, the stress values exhibiting 90%, and deformation values 90% similarity a result of the dynamic loads applied in the X-Y direction. Consequently, this study highlights the potential for further improvement in the integrated model generation process by identifying the advantages and disadvantages of each modeling technique.",

    "abstract": "Museums are full of beautiful objects with high historical value. Sometimes such objects are static in their nature (e.g., statues), but often they are interactive (e.g., tools or manipulable artifacts). Very often they are accompanied by the classic sign “do not touch, just watch” or are enclosed in glass cases, hindering the full experience of their intended use. Due to high restoration and preservation costs, some of these artifacts are also relegated to storage, limiting access to the public. This poses a dual accessibility issue: the general public cannot interact with these objects as originally intended, and blind or visually impaired individuals must rely solely on textual descriptions or audio guides. Additionally, certain artifacts still hold significant societal value if they could be interactively experienced again. To address this, we propose the SCAMP (Scientific Collections Accessibility Making Process) methodology. By leveraging 3D printing and digital technologies, SCAMP is a robust, generic framework to “make accessible again” interactive museum objects. It creates accurate replicas and a multimodal experience centered around the recreated artifacts. Specific guidelines ensure that the replica and the interactive user experience maintain fidelity to the original objects, enhancing (rather than altering) their characteristics. Unlike many single-case discussions in the literature, SCAMP focuses on a scalable, theoretical basis that can be applied to similar artifacts. Beyond accurately reproducing shapes and colors, SCAMP also emphasizes tactile fidelity, conveying sensations close to those provided by the original item. By applying the SCAMP methodology, interactive objects of high historical value can be made accessible to everyone—both the general public and individuals who are blind or visually impaired. Accessibility in SCAMP is essentially about ensuring an inclusive user experience for the interactive content, for which specific design rules are provided. We demonstrate SCAMP through two Brendel Models from the University of Bologna, concluding with user testing. While there is room for improvement, results show that SCAMP successfully meets its accessibility and fidelity goals, with users expressing enthusiasm for the final outcome.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-five hundred years ago, the “paperwork” of the Achaemenid Empire was recorded on clay tablets. In 1933, archaeologists from the University of Chicago’s Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures (ISAC, formerly Oriental Institute) found tens of thousands of these tablets and fragments during the excavation of Persepolis. Many of these tablets have been painstakingly photographed and annotated by expert cuneiformists, and now provide a rich dataset consisting of over 5,000 annotated tablet images and 100,000 cuneiform sign bounding boxes encoding the Elamite language. We leverage this dataset to develop DeepScribe, the first computer vision pipeline capable of localizing Elamite cuneiform signs and providing suggestions for the identity of each sign. We investigate the difficulty of learning subtasks relevant to Elamite cuneiform tablet transcription on ground-truth data, finding that a RetinaNet object detector achieves a localization mAP of 0.78 and a ResNet classifier achieves a top-5 sign classification accuracy of 0.89. The end-to-end pipeline achieves a top-5 classification accuracy of 0.80. As part of the classification module, DeepScribe groups cuneiform signs into morphological clusters. We consider how this automatic clustering approach differs from the organization of standard, printed sign lists and what we learn from it. These components, trained individually, are sufficient to produce a system that can analyze photos of cuneiform tablets from the Achaemenid period and provide useful transliteration suggestions to researchers. We evaluate the model’s end-to-end performance on locating and classifying signs, providing a roadmap to a linguistically-aware transliteration system, then consider the model’s potential utility when applied to other periods of cuneiform writing.",

    "abstract": "Storage and analysis of large-scale risk-monitoring time series data is essential for the preventive conservation of cultural heritage sites. However, as this monitoring data accumulates to large scales, traditional relational databases can face serious performance bottlenecks, such as high latency when writing data from multiple sensors, and inefficient data retrieval. These problems can significantly hinder analysis of the risk monitoring data. To address these issues, we propose a software architecture for a data management platform geared towards large-scale risk-monitoring data for cultural heritage sites. The architecture includes a data bus layer, computing engine layer, data management and storage layer, data analysis and visualization layer, and a cluster management and high-availability services layer. The function of each layer is described, as well as the strategy for data persistence and key business pipelines. Next as a practical test, we use open-source software to build a pilot risk-monitoring data management system for the Mogao Grottoes, a world heritage site in Gansu, China. We select the system’s parameters based on performance comparisons, and then demonstrate the implementation of its functions such as sensor data integration, risk alerts, and business data interpretation. The results show that the architecture can handle high-volume concurrent data insertion, large-scale data management, and long-term historical data operations. This proposed architecture can serve as a reference for those constructing risk-monitoring data management platforms for other cultural heritage sites and museums.",

    "abstract": "The lack of documentation regarding conservation-restoration works is a critical issue. This paper emphasises the impact of this deficiency on standardisation and awareness of past processes, as well as on the development of new interventions and the implementation of preventive conservation plans; moreover, it sets forth an analysis of the current state, future trends and potential of information management systems within the context of the concerns, needs, and professional practices in conservation-restoration. To achieve this, the work explores the retrieval, classification, contextualization, and interrelation of dispersed documents through the structuring of a database (DB) and proposes a conceptual framework that integrates three tools: a Catalogue of Document Typologies (CDT), a collaborative 3D workplace generated by Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) and the semantic management through knowledge graphs —with a particular focus on how the information is generated as the result of specific actions defined and developed through projects—. Next, it assesses whether the proposed technologies meet current conservation-restoration requirements, their additional features, and the challenges they present. To establish a scenario applicable to a broad range of heritage typologies, the implementation in the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla, de Yuso (UNESCO World Heritage Site) is used as a case study. The results demonstrate the essential role of the CDT in structuring information within a project, the advantages of HBIM in data visualisation and use, as well as in fostering collaboration among diverse disciplines and, ultimately, the advancement in formalising knowledge through semantic management. Despite these favourable aspects, the research also highlights the need to enhance the interoperability, dissemination, and reuse of solutions to ensure their effectiveness. Finally, some training areas for conservation-restoration professionals are identified to leverage the benefits offered by these technological developments.",

However, debates still persist around how to use data models, technical tools and interface design to implement and document such resources so as to make them as replicable and usable as possible. Given these premises, this paper focuses on presenting a semantic digital edition workflow, and, specifically, examines three crucial aspects: the integration of Semantic Web technologies for enriching textual representation; the development of a web-based markup tool that enables domain experts to produce crowdsourced markup; and the production of comprehensive technical documentation to ensure replicability. To do so, the paper details how the workflow was applied to create a digital edition of Aldo Moro’s works within a project funded by the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities and for Tourism. The paper outlines the workflow stages, including survey and transcription, data modeling, markup and metadata insertion, web design, and documentation, underscoring the importance of formalized methods in developing digital scholarly editions. By adhering to established editorial and technological standards, the edition offers a nuanced exploration of Moro’s writings, leveraging semantic technologies to provide a platform for scholarly engagement and exploration on the web.",

While the Optical Music Recognition (OMR) field, which represents the research area devoted to devising methods capable of automatically transcribing music sheets into digital formats, has addressed this issue in a number of music notations from the Western tradition, no previous research has considered the preservation of Jeonganbo scores. In this context, this work presents the following contributions: (i) the first data assortment of real Jeongganbo scores for OMR tasks; (ii) a collection of synthetic data generation and augmentation mechanisms to alleviate the scarcity of manual annotation; and (iii) a neural-based transcription scheme based on state-of-the-art OMR strategies specifically tailored to Jeongganbo scores. The experiments performed prove the validity of the approach—performance rates close to a \\(90\\%\\) of success—and open new research avenues for under-resourced yet challenging music notations.",

Traditionally, paleographers relied on qualitative methods for writer differentiation. However, recent years have seen the integration of computer-based tools, enhancing manual techniques by enabling automated measurement of parameters like letter dimensions, spacing, angles, and abbreviations. This evolution, digital palaeography, represents a transformative shift in palaeography, where digital technologies complement and enhance traditional manual methods. It combines advanced AI algorithms with high-resolution digital imagery, facilitating the extraction of unique manuscript features for writer classification. We characterize a writer’s handwriting by leveraging different image processing methods and the ability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to extract features from images automatically. This underscores the optimization of computational methods and digital imagery in advancing and supporting palaeographical analysis.",

    "abstract": "The deterioration of ancient inscriptions over centuries has resulted in irrevocable loss of vital written records, hampering epigraphic analysis, and creating significant gaps in historical knowledge. Factors such as eroded letters and physical damage often compromise the readability of these inscriptions. We present DeepHadad , a neural network trained on procedurally generated synthetic data that uses displacement maps and image-to-image translation to digitally restore severely damaged ancient inscriptions to a more readable state. The network’s name is derived from the famous Panamuwa (I) inscription on the mid-8th century BCE Hadad statue, where, at certain places, only faint traces of letters remain on the damaged basalt statue. A key challenge in this work is the lack of well-preserved and damaged glyph pairs for training, as each glyph instance is unique and therefore not found in different states of erosion. We address this by generating synthetic training data through simulated erosion processes, enabling our neural network to successfully generalize to real data. By extracting and overlaying completion maps onto the 3D model, we significantly enhance the legibility of the barely recognizable Aramaic inscription on the Hadad statue. Quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that our approach can recover textual content that would otherwise be lost or recoverable only through time-consuming manual work. This research opens a pioneering avenue for employing state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to enrich the readability of ancient textual heritage. Our methodology facilitates a more comprehensive analysis of significant inscriptions and demonstrates the potential of AI-assistive technologies to advance the field of ancient restoration and epigraphic studies.",

Digital sound layers geolocated upon physical landscapes offered a potent alternative to visual methods for creating XR in outdoor settings. Visual XR, albeit more thoroughly studied, had presented obstacles to deployment in outdoor historic landscapes. GPS-triggered sound could potentially bypass these obstacles as well as facilitating curatorial best practices such as multisensory interpretation and polyphonic storytelling. A heritage-themed sonic XR was created within a historic park to test the suitability of geolocated sound against a range of interpretative requirements and technical challenges. It told the park’s origin story through a nonlinear narrative trailscape which comprised audio interviews with communities connected to the park at the time of research, digitized archival oral history recordings of past communities, local music, and historical sound textures. These were deployed as intersecting narrative pathways in order to encourage playful explorative learning by offering multiple potential routes through the history. This design was more or less successful depending on GPS sensitivity versus listener’s trajectory versus size of sound area being activated. Using exclusively sonic XR was found to be limiting from an accessibility standpoint. However, geolocated sound as part of a multisensory framework offered significant potential for augmenting historic environments. The project emerged as a useful pilot for a further study using geolocated sound as a research methodology to analyze relationships between place historicity and place attachment.",

Sixty hypotheses were tested to assess how eight social dimensions and four system-usability factors influence virtual heritage communication that is consisted of the five end-goals of cultural learning, particularly around perceived authenticity, appreciation, and collective knowledge construction in heritage settings. Results reveal key communicative social factors—such as reciprocity (two-way interactive communication), co-presence (affective connectedness), and mutual support and collaboration—that positively impact cultural learning outcomes in virtual heritage communication. Conversely, factors such as cohesive and mutual attention, sense of community, and communicative difficulty can negatively affect the enrichment of cultural learning. The study provides strategic recommendations for designing social VR to enhance virtual heritage communication, supporting meaning-making, reinterpretation, and retention of knowledge in cultural heritage contexts from a multiuser perspective.",

These settlements played a key role in supervising the defense area and deploying troops. Exploring the spatial and temporal distribution of castle-based military settlements is a key link to revealing the in-depth distribution pattern of the M-GWMDS, but most studies have focused on their macroscopic distribution from a qualitative perspective. In this study, castle-based military settlements were selected as the research objects and were combined with architectural, archaeological, geographic, and military information. Their spatial and temporal analysis, including kernel density, slope/aspect conditions, and river systems, was explored based on GIS tools. By illustrating the military distribution nephogram and introducing the reachable spatial-temporal domains and viewshed, the deployment of military troops in this system was interpreted in depth. Taking both geographical and military factors into consideration, the XTENT model was comprehensively established to quantify the sphere of influence of castle-based military settlements, and the ranking and weights of factors influencing their distribution were eventually determined to illustrate the site catchment of these settlements, revealing the layout characteristics of the Ming Great Wall in the spatial and temporal dimensions to further reflect the military wisdom of the ancients. This research presents a new approach to thoroughly reveal the layout characteristics of the Ming Great Wall from a quantitative perspective, which will be beneficial to their subsequent protection and management.",

    "abstract": "The rich and enduring traditional culture cultivated by the Chinese nation over millennia serves as the core and essence of the Chinese heritage. In this intricate tapestry of culture, traditional patterns hold a significant and revered position. These patterns not only reflect the aesthetic values and artistic achievements of ancient Chinese civilization but also carry deep cultural and historical significance. However, the segmentation and recognition of traditional patterns pose significant challenges due to the limited availability of annotated data, the complexity of pattern variations, and the interference of material textures. To address these challenges, this article proposes a traditional pattern segmentation algorithm based on the memory learning model. The memory learning model, as the guiding principle of the algorithm, leverages prior knowledge from related domains to enable the algorithm to generalize effectively with limited annotated data. The algorithm consists of two key components: a saliency prior module and a multi-scale feature matching module. The saliency prior module uses phase spectrum information to generate saliency maps, guiding the model to focus on high-frequency information such as edges and contours. The multi-scale feature matching module captures features at different scales, improving the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation. We construct a traditional pattern dataset by introducing a phase spectrum–amplitude spectrum fusion algorithm, which enhances the model’s ability to focus on phase consistency information. Experimental results on a traditional pattern dataset show that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its superior performance and robustness in handling complex and diverse pattern segmentation tasks.",

This has resulted in discoloration, cracking, and even collapse of rocks, which have severely impacted the inheritance of outstanding traditional cultures. The basis of effective preventive conservation is to determine the nondestructive and accurate detection of key parameters related to the development of biological diseases on stone cultural relics. Therefore, to detect the moss coverage rate and growth rate, we constructed a semantic segmentation model for moss segmentation on rock surfaces. Subsequently, the local and texture information extracted by the shallow structure of the convolutional neural network were combined with Swin Transformer to enhance feature diversity. Next, transfer learning was performed on similar large-scale datasets. The effectiveness of the model was validated using a public dataset and the moss dataset. Our proposed model can accurately identify the moss coverage rate and growth rate on rock surfaces, achieving an average intersection over union of 53.05 and 94.79% on the LoveDA dataset and moss dataset, respectively. The research results provide important support for the preventive conservation of stone cultural relics.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Light Image Collections (MLICs) are stacks of photos acquired with a fixed viewpoint and varying surface illumination. They are typically used to provide rich information to characterize imaged objects. In particular, many simple and sophisticated Photometric Stereo solutions exist to produce detailed per-pixel normal maps that geometrically characterize the imaged model up to the finest details. These maps are commonly employed for per-pixel BRDF fitting to generate easy-to-use general shape and material representations for visual exploration. However, discrepancies between the chosen BRDF space, the complete optical behavior of complex objects, and the presence of non-local lighting effects in measurements may lead to suboptimal visual outcomes even with the most accurate geometric normal recovery. This article introduces a modular component designed to convert the geometric normals into well-behaved shading normals, under the common and general assumption that the reflectance under local illumination must be a monotonic function of the angle between the shading normal and the bisector of lighting and viewing directions. Since it does not require the coupling of shape and material estimation, the module allows seamless integration into existing reconstruction pipelines, supporting the mixing and matching of Photometric Stereo methods, BRDF models, and BRDF fitters. We demonstrate our approach’s efficacy as a versatile solution for enhancing the fidelity of rendered images derived from MLICs through synthetic data, laboratory experiments, and real-world painting measurements.",

    "abstract": "The traditional 3D handicrafts hold immense cultural and artistic value, representing the rich creativity and imagination of the Chinese nation through its vibrant colors and intricate designs. Despite the widespread application of 3D flattening technology in manufacturing and other industries, it is rarely in the cultural heritage domain of traditional crafts. Currently, the technology focuses on surface meshes. To this end, this article introduces a novel surface flattening algorithm of 3D curved patterns for cylindrical porcelain. This algorithm focuses on the deformation of surface meshes and complete patterns. Specifically, this algorithm derives a series of orthogonal projection surface images by rotating the model in situ . These images are then subjected to meshing and affine transformations to approximate non-developable surface as developable one. The developable surface is further unfolded through projection transformations, resulting in a set of developable planes. This array of multi-view planes is utilized for image stitching, accomplished through extracting and matching feature points and image fusion. Sequentially stitching images from the center outward enhances stitching efficiency and mitigates issues such as misalignment. Experimental results affirm the algorithm’s effectiveness in flattening traditional 3D craft pattern surfaces, particularly those with concentric circles in their cross-sections. This algorithm aligns with the 2D images perceived by the human eye and meticulously preserves the original structure and characteristics of the curved surface patterns.",

    "abstract": "The earliest preserved indigenous objects and natural specimens from Western Australia were collected between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries by Western explorers, colonial administrators, and entrepreneurs, as part of the processes of European “discovery”, settlement, and colonization, and are now located in cultural institutions around the world. Collections of the earliest surviving moveable evidence for the cultural heritage of Australia’s largest state cannot be found in Western Australia itself and must be sought out in Britain, Europe, the United States, and the eastern states of Australia. The Collecting the West (CTW) Project has been assembling descriptive data about these items into a single nodegoat database, which can be explored for themes related to the nature of collecting in Western Australia, the exploitative ideology underpinning much of this collecting, and the relationship between colonialism and these collecting practices. This article explains how this database was developed and discusses some of the findings from it relating to the types of items collected, their places of production and cultural associations, their geographical spread in museums today, and the processes by which they were collected. For the first time, this dispersed cultural heritage can be viewed and analysed in a holistic way. The work reported here represents an initial contribution towards a much larger programme aimed at transforming collections infrastructure and rebuilding knowledge systems, especially those connected with indigenous knowledge. Future work building on the CTW Project’s database will include opening up the data to indigenous perspectives, enriching the data from external sources like Wikidata, and reusing the data in emerging knowledge systems.",

    "abstract": "Conventionally, automated poem detection using textual features based on semantic and structural characteristics performs well when accurate machine-readable texts are readily available. However, for digitized historical documents such as historical newspapers that are not born digital, performing OCR to obtain machine-readable texts may lead to significant errors because such documents are inherently noisy. On the other hand, while poems can be detected based on their visual cues in layout structures, some visual cues are not unique to poems, leading to incorrect detection. We propose an integrated poem detection approach that combines conventional textual features with visual features. First, we extract 11 numerical representations of textual features using statistical methods and natural language processing techniques based on OCR-generated texts. Second, we extract 20 numerical representations of visual features based on the margin, jaggedness, stanza, and text line length of the text line layouts that are highlighted using a novel projection-based consolidation strategy. Finally, we use a combined vector of the 11 textual and 20 visual features to train a poem detection classifier using an Artificial Neural Network. To evaluate our proposed approach, we use a dataset consisting of nearly 16,000 historical newspaper document images, originally from the Chronicling America repository. The dataset is accessible at https://doi.org/10.13014/K22N506T . Our investigation evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed poem detection approach, showing it outperforms approaches that use textual or visual features alone. Further, to evaluate our proposed projection-based consolidation, we include a smear-based consolidation approach for highlighting text line layouts. Our investigation shows the classifier trained with visual features extracted using the projection-based consolidation outperforms the one using the smear-based consolidation.",

However, traditional audio guides often isolate users from their surroundings or introduce distractions that detract from immersion. Audio Augmented Reality (AAR) has been proposed as an alternative that offers enriched learning and engagement through non-visual, context-aware auditory cues. In this study, we investigated AAR’s potential for promoting multisensory engagement in outdoor heritage settings, by comparing three information delivery modes: text , audio narration , and audio with contextual sound effects . We developed and deployed a mobile AAR application with 70 participants at the historical Walls of Nicosia. Results indicated that the text-based mode led to the highest level of knowledge recall, while both sound-based modes encouraged more independent exploration of the site. Although participants appreciated the immersive qualities of audio, they also expressed a need for visual aids and adjustable audio settings to better support engagement and retention. These findings suggest that, while AAR could potentially deepen engagement with CH sites, integrating sound effects and visual elements alongside customizable features may be essential for optimizing both cognitive outcomes and user experience in outdoor heritage environments.",

They are suitable environments for the semantic annotation of artifacts and automatic virtual guides. To this end, we identify and compare Traditional (ontology-based), Large Language Model (LLM)-extended, and LLM-pure methods for the semantic information strategies of digital CH. The traditional method is described through an application prototype, while the methods that involve LLM are tested experimentally. To investigate the integral tasks related to LLMs, our experiments include (i) semantic annotation using the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) and Knowledge Graph (KG) generation with LLMs for a painting sample, and (ii) painting ranking relying solely on LLMs using catalog descriptions as input. The experiments demonstrate the potential of these methods to enhance artwork interpretation, description, and refinement of the results. Based on the relevant literature on traditional semantic annotation and conducted experiments with LLMs, a combination of ontologies and LLMs may provide an optimal approach, as it offers the accuracy of structured knowledge while providing a tool that interprets these elements into natural language and vice versa. Relying solely on LLMs may be risky due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge in the training data of LLMs, whereas traditional methods demand expertise in a specific domain and are more time-consuming. Our approach shows potential in use cases such as guiding museum visitors to artifacts that match their interests, assisting museum curators with documentation, or helping CH researchers identify similarities in artifact collections.",

Using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, we find that lexical variation across styles enables to accurately identify distinct palos . More importantly, from an automatic method of word usage, we obtain the semantic fields that characterize each style. Further, applying a metric that quantifies the inter-genre distance we perform a network analysis that sheds light on the relationship between Flamenco styles.

    "abstract": "The interest of human beings in artistic creation, and its preservation, has been a constant throughout history. Thanks to this, today we can enjoy works from various moments and origins. However, not all works have been so fortunate, and many have disappeared for various reasons. To mitigate this loss, the virtual recreation of lost works of art is an open topic of interest for the computer graphics and cultural heritage communities. In the literature, we can find works along this line that are based on manual modeling or the use of numerous modern photographs. In this interdisciplinary work, however, we present a new methodology for reconstructing destroyed altarpieces for which only a single historical image is preserved, leveraging modern techniques of differentiable rendering. Additionally, we test our methodology in the reconstruction of the altarpiece of Sant Joan Baptista (Valls, Spain) destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. Our approach results in the partial 3D reconstruction of the main reliefs of the altarpiece. These results are truly useful, both for experts and for the public, as they allow for a better understanding of its volumetrics and its relationship with space, representing an important step forward in the virtual recovery of lost artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Procedural modeling has become increasingly applied in the architecture field to address the high costs of manual methods in digitalizing architectural heritage. However, traditional procedural modeling faces challenges with complex and difficult-to-adjust parameters. Therefore, this study introduces a hybrid procedural modeling system using Lingnan ancestral halls as a case study. Lingnan ancestral halls, with their intricate architectural styles, present challenges for traditional modeling methods. Our system combines digital image processing with procedural modeling, utilizing an improved segmentation algorithm based on down-sampling to process floor plans and record room dimensions and locations. A K-means clustering algorithm classifies identified rooms to determine key features such as roads and entries, guiding courtyard layout generation. Based on these layouts, the system procedurally generates the ancestral hall model, allowing users to fine-tune parameters for accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that this system effectively addresses the complexity and inflexibility of parameter adjustments in traditional methods, making it a valuable tool for the digital preservation and reproduction of Lingnan ancestral halls.",

Specifically, our method directly models the boundaries of Dongba characters and consists of a feature extraction backbone similar to an FPN, an initial boundary proposal module, and a GCN-based boundary iterative refinement module. The boundary proposal module generates initial Dongba character boundary proposals by extracting feature semantic information, and then the boundary iterative refinement module progressively refines these proposals until the boundaries can accurately locate and cover individual Dongba characters. Additionally, we conducted comparative experiments with other state-of-the-art text detection models, and our method achieved the best performance in the Dongba character detection task.",

To address these challenges, this paper introduces an autonomous scanning pipeline for accurately digitizing transparent objects, utilizing direct camera pose access during image acquisition through precise hand-eye calibration of a mechatronic system. This enables clean neural surface and Gaussian Splat reconstructions with implicit geometry estimation. The paper explores input datasets under varying lighting conditions and employs various 3d reconstruction methods to evaluate transparent 3d printed objects and vintage drinking glasses. We demonstrate that the proposed scanning process, combined with optimal lighting, enables accurate training and extraction of 3d reconstructions for transparent objects, without the need for specialized neural surface network structures.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the implementation of the CIDOC CRM in cultural heritage by performing a systematic review of the literature. We have analysed publications that describe one or more case studies, collections, archives, etc. concerning the implementation of the CIDOC CRM. Among other aims, the review sought to identify the heritage categories in which the CIDOC CRM is usually implemented; the degree to which the studies are accessible to humanist readers; whether extensions or new ontologies models have been proposed; whether new tools have had to be created for the implementation; and whether the published studies have included a quantitative or qualitative analysis of the implementation. The results suggest a much greater degree of implementation in movable heritage and low application in intangible heritage. They also suggest that most of the published studies demand an advanced level of computer literacy from readers, which somewhat hinders access by humanist professionals and researchers, thus deterring their collaboration and/or interest. Furthermore, the results indicate that one third of the studies developed a full or complete extension to the CIDOC CRM, and that in approximately half of the studies a new tool was developed and created for the purpose pursued in a specific project or by a specific institution. Following a review of the literature, the article presents a series of considerations and recommendations for future lines of work with a view to extending the implementation of the CIDOC CRM in the cultural heritage sector and contributing to the construction of a more integrated information infrastructure ecosystem.",

Using monocular depth estimation, a single old photograph with pre-damage information can be utilized to restore the lost areas in the reliefs. However, reconstructing intricate features along low-curvature edges is challenging due to depth value compression. To address this problem, we propose a novel edge-matching module that constrains the depth estimation task in the edge regions and that is trained jointly with depth estimation in a multitask learning framework. This module enables the network to focus on the three-dimensional (3D) structural details of the damaged relief areas, thereby achieving more refined 3D reconstructions. We evaluate the effectiveness and zero-shot generalization performance of our method on four cultural heritage sites. The sites differ in damage severity, stylistic characteristics, and the age and quality of the old photographs used for inference. In addition, to increase the generalization ability of the proposed model, we introduce a patch-voting algorithm that enables the network to handle old photographs of varying scales, which slightly improves the relief reconstruction accuracy.",

With advancements in information technology, machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to the design of ethnic clothing. However, existing color transfer techniques often focus on single-color blocks, overlooking the complexity of color layering and proving inadequate for large-scale image colorization. To address these challenges, we propose an automatic colorization method guided by a color palette. The generative network is enhanced by incorporating a primary coloring network and a conditional network based on Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) principles. The conditional network integrates color palette inputs, while the primary network processes image data, enabling palette-guided colorization of non-colored patterns. Huber loss is introduced to the generator’s loss function to improve colorization precision. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses existing methods in SSIM and PSNR values, with an average colorization time of less than 0.2 seconds per pattern. The proposed solution effectively supports the digital, intelligent mass design of ethnic clothing coloration, ensuring interactivity and style consistency, and offers valuable insights for fashion product colorization.",

In addition, the wind-driven sand was considered for the same cases. Particular attention was paid to the Great Sphinx and the Pyramids to investigate their parts most vulnerable to the wind, which is contributing to the erosion of these monuments. The Great Sphinx was buried by sand and it was cleared several times throughout its history. In this study, we also address the less understood, yet important, burial mechanism of the Great Sphinx.

Then, we use geometric analysis algorithms to study the shapes and contacts of those fragment boundaries, producing statistical distributions of lengths, angles, areas, and adjacencies found in assembled paintings. The result is a statistical model that suggests a hierarchical fracture pattern where fragments break into two pieces recursively along cracks nearly orthogonal to previous ones. This model is tested by comparing it with simulation results of a hierarchical fracture process. The model could be useful for predicting fracture patterns of other wall paintings and/or for guiding future computer-assisted reconstruction algorithms.",

The Last House on the Hill brings together the published text, complete project database (including all media formats such as photographs, videos, maps, line drawings), related Web sites, data and media outside the direct domain of the BACH project, and recontextualized presentations of the data as remixes, movies, and other interpretive works by BACH team members and many others. We are achieving this through an event-centered, CIDOC-CRM-compatible implementation ontology, expressed through an open-source Web publishing platform, providing open access, transparency and open-endedness to what is normally the closed and final process of monograph publication. The idea of embedding, interweaving, entangling, and otherwise linking the data and media from archaeological excavations with their interpretation and meaningful presentation in an open access sharable platform has long been an ambition of those of us working in the digital documentation of archaeological research and the public presentation of cultural heritage. Formidable barriers still exist to making it possible for projects to achieve these aims, ranging from intellectual property concerns to providing commitments to the long-term sustainability of the digital content. We believe that our event-centered implementation ontology will make it far easier for archaeologists and researchers in other disciplines to organize, manage, and share their data while gaining the significant benefits of the CIDOC-CRM framework. This article describes the strategy, goals, architecture, and implementation for the project, emphasizing the novel and innovative approaches that were required to make the project successful.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a study of a digital multimedia system that allows people to enjoy a narrative experience focusing on food and gastronomic culture. With this multimedia application, termed di Piazza in Piazza , people have gotten in contact with several types of digital content about culinary traditions and local Italian products, simply using their hands. This design decision came after the acknowledgment that hands play a prominent role in the relationship between humans and food (think, for example, about the activities of eating and cooking). Studies of di Piazza in Piazza users have basically unveiled two results: (a) it was a really funny experience using hands and (b) narrations focusing on local products and traditions have mostly captivated the interest of visitors, thus confirming the strong cultural relationship among people, culinary traditions, and regional foods.",

The survey, modelled upon a detailed analysis of 242 projects, recorded 218 complete responses, shedding light on user requirements of digital editions. Specifically, the survey indicates that issues of data reuse, licensing, image availability, and comprehensive documentation are the most requested features of digital editions, although ones which seldom are provided. This analysis feeds into previous studies on good practice in building Digital Humanities resources and puts forward practical recommendations for both creators and funders of digital editions in an effort to promote a stronger consideration of user needs. This survey will be of interest to those who produce digital editions of texts, including developers and engineers, and will also be of interest to those who commission and fund these projects, such as universities, libraries, and archives, whose documentary collections are often showcased in digital editions.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of quasi-crystals has led to a great debate about their unusual structure. The big surprise is that these structures were found in Islamic art several centuries ago. This latest discovery drew the attention of scientists to propose several approaches for the comprehension of these structures by analyzing several quasi-periodic patterns spread around the Islamic world. In this article, we propose a systematic method for generating new quasi-periodic patterns inspired by existing Islamic historical patterns. The method builds Islamic quasi-periodic patterns based on a quasi-periodic tiling and a few intuitive parameters. Given a quasi-periodic tiling, the method divides its tiles (rhombs) into symmetric right triangles and constructs their template motifs. The construction of these template motifs is achieved by a systematic and well-organized process. The content of the tiles is obtained by applying mirror reflections to the constructed template motifs. Finally, the pattern is drawn by putting the content of the constructed tiles in the tiling. To show the effectiveness of this generative method, examples of new quasi-periodic patterns will be presented.",

The system contains detailed information about some 40,000 deaths extracted from several data sources and data about over 1,000 battles of the Civil War. A key novelty of WarVictimSampo 1914–1922 is the integration of ready-to-use Digital Humanities visualizations and data analysis tooling with semantic faceted search and data exploration, which allows, e.g., studying data about wider prosopographical groups in addition to individual war victims. The article focuses on demonstrating how the tools of the portal, as well as the underlying SPARQL endpoint openly available on the Web, can be used to explore and analyze war history in flexible and visual ways. WarVictimSampo 1914–1922 is a new member in the series of “Sampo” model-based semantic portals.

However, conventional methods of visitor studies do not consider the characteristics of SNSs. Even when a museum uses a SNS as a marketing tool, it cannot sufficiently analyze the data to understand the visitor. Additionally, linking the SNS analysis content with the actual visitor in the museum requires an application to identify visitor types. Therefore, we extracted communities through a social network analysis of museum followers, analyzed the characteristics for specific groups, and designed a web-based, visitor-type analysis application for art museums based on text-similarity measurements. The experimental results demonstrated that followers of each art museum on a SNS form a community with similar characteristics or interests. Furthermore, our developed application provides a new way to analyze the type of visitors in an art museum. Consequently, because it can automatically identify visitor types, it improves the exhibition experience of visitors by linking them with the exhibition contents or guide services and is a new attempt to connect a SNS with the museum visitor.",

Imaging was carried out using a consumer RGB digital camera paired with either (1) colored glass filters and a broadband source or (2) optimized multichannel LED illumination, yielding five or six spectral image bands, respectively. Color targets were used to develop and verify profiles for transforming between the multiband camera signals and final color managed images. The filter-based and LED-based profiles were assessed quantitatively for color accuracy using color difference statistics, and several paintings were imaged and rendered using the profiles as a visual demonstration of the differences. While both were superior to conventional RGB imaging, the LED-based method outperformed the filter-based method for accurate reproduction of independent data. This supplements practicality and cost considerations that are informing the development of accessible spectral imaging strategies for highly color accurate museum studio photography.",

    "abstract": "Digital tools, technologies, and infrastructures have increasingly shaped how knowledge is understood, created, managed, maintained, and shared. In sectors such as cultural heritage, for example, curators and scholars now widely apply computer science approaches to their collections for tasks such as enriching content and providing users with visual access. Although there has been an increasing interest in critical digital visual design and cultural heritage, what still seems to be largely missing is a problematised and critical approach to the application of these techniques. Drawing on critical posthumanities, in this article I propose a new critical framework, the post-authentic framework to digital objects and cultural heritage. The framework advocates transparency and openness as well as the active and reflexive participation of the scholar/curator in the process of knowledge production. To exemplify how the post-authentic framework may be applied to digital research, I explore two use cases: critical visualisation design and critical digital heritage research. For the first use case, I examine the design choices for developing the tool DeXTER, an interactive visualisation app that allows users to explore enriched cultural heritage material interactively. I specifically emphasise the challenges facing product design, with a focus on visualising the ambiguities and uncertainties of Network Analysis and Sentiment Analysis. For the second use case, I explore the potential of DeXTER for testing hypotheses on large textual collections, for example by accessing the layers of meaning attached to referential entities. The use case is the Italian American labour movement from 1898 to 1936. The article concludes with key concepts and methods for applying the post-authentic framework to digital heritage practices and knowledge creation more widely.",

Although no structural damage was found on the bridge, which is still open to pedestrian traffic, it is very important to determine the seismic behaviour of the bridge considering the possible earthquakes to which the structure will be exposed. This article presents the seismic response of the historical Yılanlı (Leylekli) Bridge, which has been subjected to unfavourable human-made changes in geometric shape over time. The original and modified shapes of the bridge were modelled using the macro modelling approach in ANSYS finite element software. The structural performance of the models was evaluated in terms of stresses, deformations, and especially cracks on the arch and spandrel walls using nonlinear static and time history analyses. The results of the analysis show that the change in shape, which is not desirable from an architectural and aesthetic point of view, adversely affects the seismic performance of the historical bridge and makes it more vulnerable to possible earthquakes. In addition, the analyses clearly showed that both models are subject to serious structural damage that could lead to a collapse in the event of a potential large magnitude earthquake.",

    "abstract": "Linked Data is used in various fields as a new way of structuring and connecting data. Cultural heritage institutions have been using linked data to improve archival descriptions and facilitate the discovery of information. Most archival records have digital representations of physical artifacts in the form of scanned images that are non-machine-readable. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) recognizes text in images and translates it into machine-encoded text. This paper evaluates the impact of image processing methods and parameter tuning in OCR applied to typewritten cultural heritage documents. The approach uses a multi-objective problem formulation to minimize Levenshtein edit distance and maximize the number of words correctly identified with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to tune the methods' parameters. Evaluation results show that parameterization by digital representation typology benefits the performance of image pre-processing algorithms in OCR. Furthermore, our findings suggest that employing image pre-processing algorithms in OCR might be more suitable for typologies where the text recognition task without pre-processing does not produce good results. In particular, Adaptive Thresholding, Bilateral Filter, and Opening are the best-performing algorithms for the theatre plays' covers, letters, and overall dataset, respectively, and should be applied before OCR to improve its performance.",

    "abstract": "Museums, heritage agencies and other institutions responsible for managing archaeological cultural heritage across Europe are engaged in developing digital platforms to better open their collections to the public as a common resource for the purposes of discovering, learning about, and sharing our common past. This paper explores the potential of new semantic computing technologies in democratizing not only public access to digital cultural heritage records, but also to computational and Linked Open Data -assisted data analysis and knowledge discovery. As a case study, we consider archaeological and numismatic Open Data services in Finland, and discuss the research results obtained during the ongoing development work for the CoinSampo framework for opening Finnish and international numismatic data. Existing digital cultural heritage services are often built with the needs of professional collections management in mind. The presentation of the records is typically structured after the familiar format established for the printed catalogues of yesteryear, with few analytical tools that would take advantage of the potential of digital data to probe and visualize internal relationships and patterns within the full body of the opened material. CoinSampo, however, will provide scientific tools to new audiences among the non-professional public who have not enjoyed such a level of access to numismatic data. The broad range of target audiences we envisage includes collections managers, who will benefit from enhanced access to their own data for updating records and for error detection and correction, as well as academic researchers interested in using the material in scientific analysis. Importantly, it also includes non-professional groups such as coin collectors, educators, local historians, and the archaeological hobby metal-detectorists who produce most of the new coin finds entering the national collections in Finland and in other European countries where detecting is legal. By adopting a citizen science and participatory heritage approach in the development of Open Data services, we aim to promote a technological model for cultural heritage dissemination that addresses the needs of a wide spectrum of different user audiences inside and outside the professional sphere.",

    "abstract": "Audiovisual (AV) archives, as an essential reservoir of our cultural assets, are suffering from the issue of accessibility. The complex nature of the medium itself made processing and interaction an open challenge still in the field of computer vision, multimodal learning, and human-computer interaction, as well as in culture and heritage. In recent years, with the raising of video retrieval tasks, methods in retrieving video content with natural language (text-to-video retrieval) gained quite some attention and have reached a performance level where real-world application is on the horizon. Appealing as it may sound, such methods focus on retrieving videos using plain visual-focused descriptions of what has happened in the video and finding videos such as instructions. It is too early to say such methods would be the new paradigms for accessing and encoding complex video content into high-dimensional data, but they are indeed innovative attempts and foundations to build future exploratory interfaces for AV archives (e.g., allow users to write stories and retrieve related snippets in the archive, or encoding video content at high-level for visualisation). This work filled the application gap by examining such text-to-video retrieval methods from an implementation point of view and proposed and verified a classifier-enhanced workflow to allow better results when dealing with in-situ queries that might have been different from the training dataset. Such a workflow is then applied to the real-world archive from Télévision Suisse Romande (RTS) to create a demo. At last, a human-centred evaluation is conducted to understand whether the text-to-video retrieval methods improve the overall experience of accessing AV archives.",

    "abstract": "The Longmen Grottoes, a renowned World Heritage site, features a relief carving of the Imperial Couple’s worship scene in the Binyang Central Cave during the reign of Emperor Xuanwu of the Northern Wei Dynasty in China. Portraying the religious activities of the Northern Wei imperial family, these reliefs hold substantial historical and artistic values. However, the reliefs have suffered severe damage because of both natural and human-induced factors. Although initial restoration efforts have taken place in museums, a considerable portion remains irrecoverable, with the facial features of the figures presenting the most formidable challenge for reconstruction. The precise and objective restoration of the missing facial portion in the reliefs is crucial. Although facial three-dimensional reconstruction techniques from a single photograph exist, their stability and accuracy under complex imaging conditions often lack practical requirements. To enhance portrait relief restoration, we propose a method based on the Gaussian process model. Our approach leverages the surviving samples to learn prior shape knowledge, thereby establishing a Gaussian process model. Subsequently, observations from historical photographs and surviving fragments were used as input data to predict the damaged shape. Experimental validation via cross validation confirms the high precision and robustness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Data of historical and ideographic sciences, such as cultural heritage studies, geography, geological evolution, biodiversity, but also experimental data of nomothetic natural sciences, are increasingly documented and published in information systems compatible with predicate-logic that refer to things in reality by unique identifiers (or “keys” most likely to be unique in some context). This can only work as a method of sharing and integrating knowledge beyond the spatial and temporal context of local projects, if the referred features or phenomena of reality are distinct and can diachronically be identified by independent observers in the same way and without a clarifying dialogue between them. In this paper, we argue that only a smaller part of the features in our environment are sufficiently distinct over a useful time-span in order to form such “identifiable individuals”. Ontological categories should each provide specific criteria for the so-called ontological individuation, i.e., about how parts of reality can be subdivided into identifiable individuals that are useful for modelling their behaviour and interactions in reality for answering specific scientific questions, obeying evidential constraints as a result of applying these criteria in observations. We motivate by several examples that there are always cases in which the individuality of such an instance may be undecidable basically within all such ontological categories and that all ontological categories are more or less effective approximations of reality. We argue that effective knowledge sharing by information systems using formal ontologies is only possible if these limitations of applicability and precision to real world phenomena are well understood and taken into account.",

However, nowadays, the research of on metaverse technology in the field of ICH needs to be more cohesive. Therefore, a comprehensive systematic review was conducted through an extensive search of ICH and metaverse-related technologies. The scope of the search is based on the studies from January 2019 to September 2023 of the three major databases of Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus covering the keyword. This paper provides a general overview of the use of metaverse technologies in ICH and its categories over five years. It explains the characteristics, features, and scope of varying metaverse technologies applied to different ICHs in detail. It also explores the prospects of using metaverse to empower ICH and finally discusses the effectiveness of using metaverse technologies to empower ICH and presents the current resistance. In this way, it provides a new direction for the intangible cultural heritage in meeting and integrating into the new era of the metaverse.",

In this context, Augmented Reality (AR) has been adopted in cultural venues to break the passive watching experience, turning the audience into active participants. In this paper, we present an exploratory case study of LanternOperAR, a hybrid cultural gift to promote Yue Opera with the Chinese philosophy of Yangmingism. We incorporate the tangible interface and virtual content to create an interactive cultural experience. Specifically, we conducted a fieldwork study to investigate the promises and challenges of promoting Yue Opera. Based on expert interviews and an online survey with the public, we derived a set of design goals to guide the design and development process. Our approach incorporates the application of artificial intelligence (AI) image processing, generative AI, information visualization, and gamification with AR technology to generate and visualize cultural knowledge in AR-based narratives and interactions. We evaluated LanternOperAR with 20 participants and acquired some positive feedback on system usability and overall experience, as well as some suggestions for further improvements. Our findings provide insights into the design of cultural products and cultural applications as guidance for cultural researchers and practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Museums create unique spaces filled with wondrous artifacts, witnesses to the history of nature and human civilization. Recent advances in spatial sensing, computing, and immersive displays are enabling numerous new possibilities to extend and interact with these museal spaces. An increasing number of works exploring such mixed realities reflect these developments; typically, their description entails the application of specific immersive technologies to a concrete exhibit. We propose Miremus theory that abstracts and unifies the formation of mixed reality museal spaces. Spatial immersion and the process of cultural heritage communication are coalesced into one concise design space. We start by characterizing the flow of information utilizing a graph consisting of spatio-temporal locations and directed operations carrying information from one location to another. Then, we describe how spatial parts of information that are communicated from these locations can be mixed to form any museal space. The composition of such museal spaces can be distributed as well; tele-immersion concepts integrate seamlessly into the theory. Our exposition is focused on archaeological museums. To this end, the communication of uncertainty, which is inherent to these and similar types of museums, is a direct part of proposed abstractions. The theory ties into and interconnects existing work; we provide a discussion of various aspects of mixed reality museal space, which is structured along functional components such as organization, narration, interaction, and analysis.",

    "abstract": "‘Good data in, good data out’ is a well-known adage, often used to consider the ‘precision’ of data entry rather than other human activity when inputting information into a database. These could be omissions or errors, but are just as likely to be inconsistencies in data recording. This is especially relevant when thinking about the efficiencies that recorders might make (i.e., to make their work easier) and what this could mean for end users (e.g., researchers). For example, a recorder of an archaeological object might do things differently based on their knowledge or understanding of the value of recording certain types of data (e.g., the various characteristics of the object) and how this information is likely to be used by others. With this in mind, this paper will consider the research question ‘how can advancing FAIR principles be used to contextualize the impact of human decision-making on the research value of archaeological data?’, taking (as a test case) the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) database of archaeological finds from England and Wales. The methodology used here examines data recorded within the PAS database directly and through a separate web application demonstrator (PASampo) that is being developed. The latter, in particular, enables ease-to-use visualization of the data to provide an analytical evaluation of how data is inputted into the PAS database and, more significantly, how the researcher might extract this data. Through a series of case studies exploring aspects of material culture, we will highlight how data quality is affected by human decision-making alongside elements of the database framework. We will then argue that this provides the basis for new learning alongside adopting FAIR principles that could benefit the development of a wide range of future archaeological and cultural heritage databases, including the PAS database itself.",

Users can add customised layers, as well as elements such as tracks, lines, areas, media, and location points to the map. This system includes features found in other geospatial information and mapping applications but with a lower learning curve, as well as features that are missing from some applications. It will be especially useful for research teams with limited budgets and less expertise in geographic information systems (GIS) who aim to develop and share geographic datasets. The applications of the system include, but are not limited to, mapping historical heritage, comparing maps from different periods, assembling place-based collections, and gathering cultural and geospatial information from communities.

This study investigates the factors that influenced the extent of flood damage to these structures using a dataset of impacted buildings in Kherson, Ukraine. The dataset included architectural, structural, and geographical attributes, which were analyzed using different machine learning algorithms. Our approach achieved over 90% accuracy in predicting damage levels. This work is novel as it is the first to analyze the attributes influencing the vulnerability of URM buildings to flood damage. Key building attributes identified as influencing damage levels include duration of impact, proximity to the dam breach, foundation type, year built, social occupancy, maintenance condition, building orientation, and raised floors. The results of this study can help engineers, architects, and urban planners in Ukraine to develop targeted strategies to enhance the flood resilience of historic masonry buildings. As the nation prepares for post-war reconstruction, these insights can inform future retrofitting and rebuilding efforts, contributing to a more resilient future for Ukraine's cultural heritage.",

    "abstract": "One of the important tasks outlined in the Davos Declaration is the inclusive transformation of city centres. Striving for balance requires experts to encourage societies to become actively involved in heritage management. Transparency in the design process is paramount, ensuring that each activity undertaken is efficient and accountable. Diagnosis methods need to be improved, project development and implementation processes need to be streamlined. One idea that combines: new technologies, care for monuments and cooperation; is the use of eye-trackers (ET). Tracking users' visual behaviors in a cultural context has dual pro-social significance. Firstly, it gathers data based on everyday user interactions, enabling an objective description of a given phenomenon. Secondly, ET research results should be presented to residents to justify official decisions or explain issues requiring intervention. ET data can be used for the protection of cultural landscapes or for managing areas with high tourist traffic or those under economic pressure. Despite ET development this social aspect is still rarely publicly discussed. One reason for this may be that expert methods of presenting ET results are difficult for non-professionals to understand. In the course of the research, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of a number of imaging techniques applied to architecture was undertaken. The diagnosing of their nature has made it possible to identify aspects that support or undermine the effectiveness of the message. New proposal for presenting ET data combines the advantages and eliminates the disadvantages of the two methods of presenting. The new method was validated in an experiment with 446 participants, demonstrating significant enhancements in message quality and research comprehension.",

    "abstract": "The Observatorio Astronómico de La Plata from the Facultad de Ciencias Astronómicas y Geofísicas (FCAG) of the Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP) is one of the oldest observatories in South America. It has an enormous collection of observations, including thousands of spectroscopic and photographic glass plates. These observations were taken between the 1900s and the 1980s by renowned Argentine astronomers and constitute unique and unpublished records. Since 2019, the Recuperation of Historical Observational Work (ReTrOH, for its initials in Spanish) project has begun digitizing the 15,000+ samples of the spectroscopic plate collection. The digitization process for each plate is a complex, error-prone, multi-stage procedure requiring several person-hours. Consequently, a multidisciplinary team of astronomers and computer scientists was formed to develop the first system capable of assisting the user in this process. This system, designated PlateUNLP , employs signal processing algorithms and computer vision models to accelerate the process, reduce error rates, and standardizes data formats and processes. A key feature of PlateUNLP is its ability to automatically detect and record each spectrum recorded on the plates, along with the corresponding metadata, thus minimizing the need for user intervention. The developed system is publicly available under an open source license. Furthermore, while the system was developed with the ReTrOH project's requirements in mind, it could be adapted and used to assist with the digitization of thousands of other plates available around the world. PlateUNLP is therefore a first step towards making possible and practical the recovery of historical astronomical observations. Digitizing and exploiting these observations can provide a unique window into the past of our universe.",

We extensively evaluated the algorithms on 1,771 images of pages of six different publicly available historical manuscripts, which differ significantly from each other in terms of layout structure, acquisition resolution, writing style, and so on.

First, we propose an automatic method for the extraction of stroke contours in line drawings, relying on a filtering of the level lines of images. Next, the radius of the drawing tool is estimated from these segmented strokes. This information then efficiently tunes the extraction of several geometric features, including the distribution of curvature, endpoints, junctions and corners of strokes. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated with several experiments on two classified databases of artistic line-drawings, and compared with an approach based on the curvature scale space (CSS). Retrieval experiments suggest that the proposed framework is able to handle the pictorial effect delivered by line drawings to a human observer.",

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to label each super-pixel region with a probability to belong to foreground glyph strokes. Pixelwise probability maps from multiple super-pixel resolution scales are then aggregated to cope with various stroke widths and background noise. A fully connected Conditional Random Field model is then applied to improve the labeling consistency. Segmentation results show that our system preserves delicate local details of the historic Maya glyphs with various stroke widths and also reduces background noise.

A growing number of people start to use route-planning services to prepare, ride, explore, and log their activities, with a particular focus on where they want to ride and what they want to see. In the context of cultural heritage, however, route planners still suffer from lack of data and route weighting/scoring mechanisms to achieve end-user satisfaction. In this article, we take advantage of mobile sensing and geotagging (r)evolution to tackle both issues and propose a novel framework for cultural heritage routing on top of RouteYou’s existing recreational navigation platform. Our first improvement focuses on the automatic collection and multimodal enrichment of thematic cultural heritage points of interest. Second, we introduce a weighting procedure for these points of interest and analyze their meta(data) quality and spatial coverage in our route databases. Finally, we present a novel routing algorithm targeted to cultural heritage exploration. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves cultural heritage POI coverage and quality with respect to traditional recreational navigation routing algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed framework can easily be used in other thematic routing applications due to its generic architecture, making it a widely applicable approach.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) puzzles of heritage artefacts are typically used to engage audiences in the interpretation of archaeological objects in a museum gallery. The reason for this is that a puzzle can be seen as an enjoyable educational activity in the form of a game but also as a complex activity that archaeologists undertake when re-assembling fragments, for instance, of broken pottery. Until now the creation of this type of experiences is mostly a manual process and the artefacts used rarely reflect those in the collection due to the complex nature of the process. The contribution of this article is a novel digital worfklow for the design and fabrication of 3D puzzles that overcomes these limitations. The input to the workflow is an authentic artefact from a heritage collection, which is then digitised using technologies such as 3D scanning and 3D modelling. Thereafter, a puzzle generator system produces the puzzle pieces using a cell fracture algorithm and generates a set of puzzle pieces (female) and a single core piece (male) for fabrication. Finally, the pieces are fabricated using 3D printing technology and post-processed to facilitate the puzzle assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed novel workflow, we deployed it to create a puzzle activity of the Saltdean urn, which is exhibited at the Archaeology Gallery of the Brighton Museum and Art Gallery. The workflow is also used with further artefacts to demonstrate its applicability to other shapes. The significance of this research is that it eases the task of creating puzzle-like activities and maintaining them in the long term within a busy public space such as a museum gallery.",

    "abstract": "This article reports on a heritage engagement project called Skullduggery at Old Government House. It offers an approach to augmented reality design based on adventure games as a solution to the problem of “empty rooms” encountered by casual visitors to cultural heritage sites such as historic buildings. Many cultural heritage sites depend on didactic panels and perhaps a few tangible items to communicate the history of a heritage location to casual visitors, however, providing a sense of the “spirit” of a site is harder to present to visitors who may only be passing through. The project is a response to this problem in Old Government House, Brisbane. It is inspired by a theatrical tour of the house and the potential of narrative games to re-create the tour's experiential aspects and engagement with a sense of history and place for casual visitors.",

    "abstract": "It has become almost standard practice that archaeological research on cemeteries is published in a similar fashion, specifically when primary sources supplement the data presented. Aside from the interpretative part, a catalog of all graves, buried individuals, and finds is published along with a map of the site and graphical depictions of the various entities. This is mostly structured within a four-level hierarchy beginning with the cemetery, the contained graves, the burials from each grave, and the finds associated with the burial. Today, even though many publications and their catalogs are based on or derived from digital data and published as open access, the outcome is often printed text such as a pdf file. Digital data that is properly structured and can be used out of the box for further analyses is rarely available. The presented article discusses how to digitize data on burials and how to provide them to the public in sustainable and comprehensible ways. Within previous and ongoing projects, the author and his team have developed a database system (OpenAtlas) that is used for the data acquisition of archaeological and anthropological research data that also maps information directly to the CIDOC CRM. Temporal and spatial fuzziness are dealt with following various concepts such as GeoJSON-T. For providing the data as Linked Open Data, the “linked places” format is used and an API provides a JSON-LD representation of each entity. Due to the “standard” approach implemented when publishing cemeteries, the data acquisition is mostly achieved by manually recording the published information in the database. In the following projects, data from several hundred Early Medieval Austrian and Czech burial sites with several thousand graves and finds have been digitized. To publicize the information, an online web application (https://thanados.net) has been developed to present and disseminate this data.",

    "abstract": "Masses of fragile cultural relics are dug out in fragments due to long-standing burying and their fragility, which must be reassembled to play a role in cultural heritage study. However, it is very challenging to automatically reassemble a large collection of fragments of unknown geometric shapes. In this article, a novel probabilistic method for fractured cultural relics automatic reassembly is proposed to solve the problem in terms of good accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. First, a set of matching units are detected and described by the 2D Link-Chain Descriptors (LCD) and the 3D Spatial-Distribution Descriptors (SDD). Second, the pairwise reassembly probability is calculated by combining the similarities of LCD and SDD descriptors, then the collision detection is conducted to eliminate the incorrect overlapping pairs. Finally, a global optimal reassembly solution is obtained by iterative graph optimization with the constrains of the loop-closures and overlap restrictions. Comprehensive experiments with eight challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieved good performance in terms of minor reassembly errors, efficiency and robustness to noise, varying point density and completeness.",

The workflow described here details the process from the initial aims of the project, designed to integrate heritage and STEM education; through the processing of lidar data to create the topography of the world; through the archaeological reconstruction; and then final release. An understanding of the workflow is particularly important for researchers and educators because the successful delivery of our aims resulted in a number of technical obstacles inherent in creating a Minecraft world when a designer is required to navigate several versions of the program—Java architecture, C++ architecture, and the Education Edition—and explains workarounds developed to overcome these issues.

    "abstract": "Coin classification is one of the main aspects of numismatics. The introduction of an automated image-based coin classification system could assist numismatists in their everyday work and allow hobby numismatists to gain additional information on their coin collection by uploading images to a respective Web site. For Roman Republican coins, the inscription is one of the most significant features, and its recognition is an essential part in the successful research of an image-based coin recognition system. This article presents a novel way for the recognition of ancient Roman Republican coin legends. Traditional optical character recognition (OCR) strategies were designed for printed or handwritten texts and rely on binarization in the course of their recognition process. Since coin legends are simply embossed onto a piece of metal, they are of the same color as the background and binarization becomes error prone and prohibits the use of standard OCR. Therefore, the proposed method is based on state-of-the-art scene text recognition methods that are rooted in object recognition. S ift descriptors are computed for a dense grid of keypoints and are tested using support vector machines trained for each letter of the respective alphabet. Each descriptor receives a score for every letter, and the use of pictorial structures allows one to detect the optimal configuration for the lexicon words within an image; the word causing the lowest costs is recognized. Character and word recognition capabilities of the proposed method are evaluated individually; character recognition is benchmarked on three and word recognition on different datasets. Depending on the S ift configuration, lexicon, and dataset used, the word recognition rates range from 29% to 67%.",

    "abstract": "Intangible cultural heritage represents the cultural identities and diversity of mankind, and should be preserved and passed on to the current and future generations. However, in digital cultural heritage research, intangible cultural heritage has been relatively less studied, and the focus has been placed on creating tools and applications for professionals rather than for the general public. In this paper, we present our research effort on creating an interactive system for conveying traditional Chinese culture through natural language conversation. We propose a systematic method for the domain experts to construct, with minimal effort, the knowledge base from a set of unstructured philosophy texts, and we design an algorithm to build a conversational agent emulating the conversation ability of a famous Chinese philosopher. We also report two evaluation studies on the prototype we developed, showing encouraging results on the feasibility and benefits of our approach. By automating part of the answer-finding task using natural language processing and information retrieval technology, the system is able to find answers dynamically, without the need to manually author large amounts of question and answer pairs. Our proposed method could potentially be used to create other conversational agents for educating and promoting cultural values to the general public in a natural and appealing way.",

    "abstract": "Built between 1911 and 1914 by architect Francisco Izidoro Monteiro, the former neoclassical building of the Belo Horizonte School of Medicine (BHSM) was located in a central area of the city. Its design, inspired by the European precepts at the time, was embedded in the same architectural language that characterized the cityscape of the capital of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The original building was gradually dismantled and completely demolished in 1960 to make way for the present headquarters. Few records of its existence remain. In order to contribute to the construction of the digital heritage of the old BHSM building, this article presents its virtual reconstruction, and demonstrates and analyzes the application of Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) for this purpose. Based on data collection and the organization of numerous references (historical photographs, former students’ recollections, magazine articles, books, minutes, and photogrammetry of the remains), a hypothetical model of the building was developed to represent its condition as built and prior to demolition. Despite the difficulties in modeling, it was possible to perform a virtual historical reconstruction of the building, providing a better understanding of the building that does not currently exist. The preservation of the digital heritage of the demolished building aims to raise public awareness of its memory, which is consistent with the collection of the Memory Center of the UFMG School of Medicine (CEMEMOR).",

    "abstract": "Cultural sites such as museums and monuments are popular tourist destinations worldwide. Visitors come to these places to learn about the cultures, histories, and arts of a particular region or country. However, for many cultural sites, traditional visiting approaches are limited and may fail to engage visitors. To enhance visitors’ experiences, previous works have explored how wearable devices can be exploited in this context. Among the many functions that these devices can offer, understanding which artwork or detail the user is attending to is fundamental to provide additional information on the observed artworks, understand the visitor’s tastes, and provide recommendations. This motivates the development of algorithms for understanding visitor attention from egocentric images. We considered the attended object detection task, which involves detecting and recognizing the object observed by the camera wearer, from an input RGB image and gaze signals. To study the problem, we collect a dataset of egocentric images collected by subjects visiting a museum. Since collecting and labeling data in cultural sites for real applications is a time-consuming problem, we present a study comparing unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised approaches for attended object detection. We evaluate the considered approaches on the collected dataset, assessing also the impact of training models on external datasets such as COCO and EGO-CH. The experiments show that weakly supervised approaches requiring only a 2D point label related to the gaze can be an effective alternative to fully supervised approaches for attended object detection. To encourage research on the topic, we publicly release the code and the dataset at the following url: https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/EGO-CH-Gaze/ .",

The tool is built upon a novel geometric analysis approach specifically tailored for Anatolian Seljuks muqarnas, drawing inspiration from Ammann-Beenker tiling and supertiles. Users of Anatolian Muqarnas can easily simulate existing or new designs by following predetermined rules. This contribution is expected to enhance discussions regarding the geometric analysis of muqarnas and the interplay between computing and cultural heritage at large.",

Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies evaluating the actual benefits of such technology on visitors’ experiences, which is crucial to improve the IoT adoption in this field. To address this issue, we present an exploratory study we performed to understand whether and how an IoT-based game affects the experience of museum visitors. The game is played after a traditional guided tour; it was created following a meta-design approach to enable domain experts, such as museum professional guides, to adapt the game to specific visitors and/or situations. The study involved a total of 18 participants who took a guided tour of the Museum of Natural Sciences of the University of Bari and played the game afterward. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The study results show that playing the IoT-based game positively affects the experience of visitors and, in particular, their emotions. Visitor workload was also found to be greater than that of a guided tour, but this had no negative impact on visitor experience. The study findings have implications for the design and development of future IoT games to enhance engagement and to improve the experience of visitors at cultural heritage sites.",

    "abstract": "Interactive multimedia art shows a complex nature as it is time- and process-based, interconnected with technology, derived by the participation of several authors (artists, technicians, performers, to name a few) and an audience, and it is strongly tied to the moment and space of the original exhibition. These characteristics make the preservation of these artworks a multifaceted process. Building on the foundations developed since the 2000s by international projects focused on preserving and restoring these new art forms, the paper proposes an original model for achieving dynamic preservation, called “the multilevel preservation model”. Since it is no longer possible to guarantee physical integrity for interactive multimedia artworks, dynamic preservation involves recording all the changes that occur to display the artworks in the future. In other words, it makes it possible to record the dynamic authenticity of artworks. The model proposes two fundamental properties: multiple layering, which allows to handle different levels of information about the artwork; multiple belongingness , which allows to represent the dynamic authenticity of the artwork at the archival level and achieving dynamic preservation. The paper demonstrates the high-level implementation of the model by presenting a case study: the reactivation and preservation of an analog video art performance from the 1970s. This case study proposes an interesting real scenario for testing the model, as the reactivation process involved the migration of the entire analog technological apparatus of the artwork into the digital domain.",

The demands of the DM process for information organization and management have raised issues that the CnR community attempts to solve by creating DM-support tools and systems, which, among others, exploit Semantic Web (SW) technologies. Regarding the tools and systems that focus on the DM process of selecting an intervention option (CnR-DM-I), they present benefits, as well as limitations, regarding the (1) completeness of representation of the relevant knowledge in a unified manner, (2) facilitation of recording the CnR-DM-I process per se , in terms of the problem at hand as well as the intervention parameters, requirements, and criteria, and (3) recommendation and further exploration of CnR intervention options in a systematic manner. This work proposes an ontology-based framework as a means to overcome those limitations. The proposed framework (DS-CnRI) sets at its core a formal ontology which provides the necessary entities to represent expert knowledge related to CnR-DM-I. The ontology also includes rules which provide useful inferences to assist the CnR-DM-I process. The proposed framework has been deployed and evaluated in collaboration with conservators. Initial evaluation results show that the framework assists conservators in CnR-DM-I to detect and select the most suitable intervention options, to better understand the limitations of different options, and to document the process of reaching their decision.",

Salient examples are Pointillism and Impressionism, having both distinguishable brushstroke characteristics which are small, rounded of clear color, repetitive dots for Pointillism style and visible, elongated and slanting, repetitive touches for Impressionism style. As Impressionism is the ancestral style of Pointillism, the two styles have many elements in common and distinguishing them is difficult. In this article, specific texture features are investigated for the classification of the two styles, focusing mainly on small differences in their brushstrokes. The texture features adopted are Granulometric features, gray-level co-occurrence matrix features, and run length features. It is shown experimentally that the run length method outperforms the other features and can efficiently (up to 95%) discriminate the two textured styles since it incorporates information about size, direction, and intensity of brushstrokes.",

    "abstract": "Digitising The Deep Past (DDP) is an interdisciplinary project based at Griffith University, Australia, that innovates in three areas: Indigenous cultural heritage, Indigenous education, and Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The project investigates the use of a purpose-built citizen science application that engages Indigenous youth in educational exercises rooted in local cultural heritage, specifically rock art, making learning more engaging and exposing them to digital technologies. Furthermore, ML models trained with the data gathered through these educational activities can then assist with classifying new rock art images and assisting rangers and archaeologists with site archiving and conservation efforts. This paper discusses the project's significance in enhancing Indigenous science and technology education and outlines its results in utilising ML for rock art classification. Adopting deep learning in rock art classification offers a compelling avenue for the automated analysis and interpretation of heritage objects and places. However, training deep neural networks from scratch often requires enormous datasets and computational resources, posing challenges for domain-specific applications with smaller datasets. With a dataset comprising approximately 3,100 labelled rock art images, we evaluated various tools within the transfer learning toolbox using three prominent pre-trained architectures: VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNet V2 S. Through the collaborative efforts of Indigenous students and ML, we demonstrate that even with limited training resources, using transfer learning to re-purpose an existing model can achieve motif classification Top-1 accuracy of 79.76% and Top-5 of 94.56%. The project ran from 2021 to 2023, including three week-long sessions with students of Laura State School to trial the citizen science app and the evaluation, development and refinement of the ML models. The DDP project not only serves as a beacon for community-centric research but also forges a new frontier in integrating Indigenous cultural heritage with modern technology. The impact reaches beyond academia, directly enriching the educational experience for Indigenous students in Laura and equipping local rangers and archaeologists with advanced tools for rock art conservation.",

To address this gap, we aim to explore the classification of thematic categories within this literary domain. We curate a dataset of 2,918 annotated poems spanning seven common themes and propose a BERT-based ensemble learning approach for effective classification. Although this method integrates existing models, it achieves an accuracy and F1 score of over 72% in the 7-class task, surpassing established baselines, and providing a baseline for future research. The experimental findings reveal the effectiveness of ensemble strategies in improving individual base model performance and highlight the potential of the MLP-based ensemble technique. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of thematic categories and textual features in classical Chinese poetry, and offers an automated classification system for classical Chinese poems.",

The department establishes long-term cooperations with various focus groups and partner institutions. These are particularly valuable for the continuous improvement of our digital infrastructures. At the heart of our participatory work lies a Goal-Directed Design approach, which focuses on understanding user needs and motivations. This approach helps us to maintain clarity in complex and heterogeneous projects and to communicate with non-technical users, enabling them to participate in the discussion of future use scenarios. In such co-creative processes, we have found web-based applications—especially Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)—to be particularly valuable due to their accessibility and flexibility. This paper illustrates our interdisciplinary design-led working process through a case study in school education. Additionally, it explores how the German Maritime Museum as a whole has developed further through increased participation: close transdisciplinary collaboration allows us to embed our practical methodological knowledge across the organization. This consistent commitment to participation is already reshaping the museum, giving it new citizen-centered roles.",

Kasos is an isolated island of the Dodecanese, Greece, preserving interesting elements of the authentic agricultural practices and architecture like terraces serving the island’s agricultural cultivation, mills and mitata, small stone- built creameries. Kasos served as a case study of AEI program (Sustainable Development of Less Developed Regions and Isolated Areas by Creating New Touristic Resources and Products through Analysis, Documentation and Modelling of Cultural Assets using Innovative ICT Applications, project code:T2EDK- 01278). For thιs island that lies within the wider region of Rhodes, it is possible with the appropriate development of new touristic resources and products through the advancement of the unique architectural, cultural and environmental assets to orient towards them special parts of the touristic flow from Rhodes, creating new touristic activity by increasing the residence beyond the daily or short time tourism, as it stands for now. For the analysis of the study area, research in local archives and communication with the municipality and local stakeholders was conducted. Thus, both the special features of the island and the needs of the local community were identified, organized, classified and presented in GIS maps. The implementation of a GIS for Kasos Island aims to provide a comprehensive representation of the different aspects of the island, providing useful information for policy-making and the development of strategic cultural and agrotourism plans to the local authorities and stakeholders. According to the integrated plan for Kasos by AEI program, the island could preserve its special rural identity while revealing its cultural and environmental assets and attracting external economies within an agritourism model. In this work, we present AEI’s integrated plan for Kasos that refers to the island’s agricultural character, to the existing trail network as well as to the restoration and adaptive reuse of important architectural assets that could serve to the overall revealing of Kasos history and cultural reserve.",

However, the creation of such outputs has not always been accompanied and informed by design theory and practices. Design – used in its broadest definition as a process of conceptual making - is an integral, if often implicit, part of archaeological practices and it is through design that we develop and share our work – from data collection and analysis to interpretation and dissemination – and engage with our stakeholders. Engaging with core design practices offers meaningful opportunities for generating new forms of archaeological knowledge production and sharing, as well as creating digitally mediated experiences that are not guided by our own assumptions about our stakeholders’ needs and can really affect people’s engagement with the past. In this paper, I investigate the benefits of embedding Human-Centred and Participatory Design into the archaeology and heritage sectors to create more critically engaged digital encounters with the past.",

    "abstract": "Notwithstanding the increasing efforts to conserve and archive historical artefacts, comprehensive documentation employing various technologies remains crucial. Comprehensive documentation will facilitate relaying information about these locations to future generations, ensuring their complete conservation by inspecting their present state. Furthermore, in addition to digital documentation for the conservation of historic buildings, creating an audit that will contribute to future evaluations and interventions is of the utmost importance. As a result, an alternative method is suggested for automatic detection of structural cracks instead of costly on-site inspections. Growing interest has been in developing digital twins (DT) for accurate detection. Three-dimensional (3D) geometric documentation represents the initial phase in DT development, and diverse instruments and procedures have been designed to support this process. Accurate 3D geometric documentation is achieved by integrating photogrammetry and geodetic methods. The proposed methodology underwent testing on a modern beam structure before being applied to a complex historical structure. The study compared the findings of modern measurement techniques with traditional methods for analyzing automatically detected cracks. The accuracy of modern techniques resulted in a success rate of 78.25%.",

Information is modeled here with an ontology based on the CIDOC-Conceptual Reference Model (ISO 21127). When instantiated with some realistic examples taken from the field of biodiversity (collecting, determination, type creation, expedition, and observation events), the formal specification of semantic concepts makes scientific activities commonly understandable. Ontologies not only allow one to describe the results of scientific activities, such as a description of a biological species, but they can help to clarify the path by which the goal was reached. In particular, they provide a high-level uniform representation of transdisciplinary research activities and results. Ontologies as knowledge representation tools will therefore have strong impact on methodological questions and research strategies for different domains such as biology, archaeology, art history, and socio-economy. They can be regarded as semantic glue between and within scientific and scholarly domains as demonstrated in a series of examples. Following this approach, some requirements for research and development of integrated IT environments between memory instutions are derived.",

The photo-realistic presentation of interactively inspectable virtual surrogates is one of the most challenging problems in this field. For this purpose, we seek to employ not only a 3D geometry but also a powerful material representation capable of reproducing the full visual appeal of an object. In this article, we propose a WebGL-based presentation framework in which reflectance information is represented via Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF). Our approach works out-of-the-box in modern Web browsers and allows for the progressive transmission and interactive rendering of digitized artifacts consisting of 3D geometry and reflectance information. We handle the huge amount of data needed for this representation by employing a novel progressive streaming approach for BTFs, which allows for the smooth interactive inspection of a steadily improving version during the download. We demonstrate an interesting use-case of this technique at a cross section of Cultural Heritage, medical education, and research and provide an evaluation of the capabilities of our framework in the scope of BTF compression and transmission.",

The proposed method is based on the symmetry-based approach and the shape grammar formalism. The symmetry-based approach consists of constructing a periodic pattern by using isometric transformations of its template motif. The main contribution of this article is to propose a parametric shape grammar method to generate the template motif. The process used consists first in identifying the shapes vocabulary characterizing the Moorish style. By identifying its common features by the analysis of a dataset of historical Moorish patterns, parametric shape grammar (PSG) rules are then determined. Furthermore, the use of PSGs implies additional mechanisms, such as the consideration of suitable constraints and goals. These mechanisms are imposed by the grid, which is the underlying geometric structure used traditionally by artisans to design sophisticated geometric patterns. The performance of the proposed method is measured by its capability to create original and new motifs of periodic Moorish patterns. This method preserves the authenticity of the style considered, because the generated patterns follow a parametric shape grammar based on a priori domain knowledge and extract one from representative images of Moorish style.",

    "abstract": "Annotations provide a valuable perspective on the semantic information present in digital heritage collections, and in recent years they've been employed in a number of innovative, user-centric techniques that can personalise a user's experience of heritage materials, such as by actively adapting exhibits as a user reveals their interests, or by guiding users to explore collections which are meaningfully linked to what they have previously encountered. Despite the captivating opportunities offered by these techniques, collecting annotations for a large heritage collection is no trivial task. A significant amount of work is required to manually annotate large quantities of heritage materials, and automated, computational approaches leave much to be desired regarding the level of insight and semantic richness that they can currently provide. By analysing the emergent relationships between the initial annotations in a collection, we propose a metadata-driven algorithm for assisting and augmenting the annotation process. This algorithm, called SAGA (Semantically-Annotated Graph Analysis), allows for semi-automatic annotation, which balances the value of the contributions of human annotators with the time and effort-saving benefits of an automatic, suggestion-driven process. SAGA uses an entity relationship-driven approach to make annotation suggestions. It is used in the context of a web-based infrastructure called SAGE (Semantic Annotation by Group Exploration), a multiagent environment which assists groups of experts in creating comprehensive annotation sets for heritage collections. SAGA and SAGE are evaluated from the perspectives of suggestion accuracy, explicit user acceptance and implicit user acceptance, and demonstrate strong results in each evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Archaeological data are characterized by both spatial and temporal dimensions that are often related to each other and are of particular interest during the interpretation process. For this reason, several attempts have been performed in recent years to develop a geographical information system (GIS) tailored for archaeological data. However, despite the increasing use of information technologies in the archaeological domain, the actual situation is that any agency or research group independently develops its own local database and management application that is isolated from the others. Conversely, the sharing of information and the cooperation between different archaeological agencies or research groups can be particularly useful to support the interpretation process by using data discovered in similar situations with respect to spatio-temporal or thematic aspects. In the geographical domain, the INSPIRE initiative of the European Union tries to support the development of a spatial data infrastructure (SDI) through which several organizations, such as public bodies or private companies, with overlapping goals can share data, resources, tools, and competencies in an effective way. The aim of this article is to lay the basis for the development of an archaeological SDI starting from the experience acquired during the collaboration among several Italian organizations. In particular, the article proposes a spatio-temporal conceptual model for archaeological data based on the ISO Standards of the 19100 family and promotes the use of the GeoUML methodology to put into practice such interoperability. The GeoUML methodology and tools have been enhanced to suit the archaeological domain and to automatically produce several useful documents, configuration files, and code base starting from the conceptual specification. The applicability of the spatio-temporal conceptual model and the usefulness of the produced tools have been tested in three different Italian contexts: Rome, Verona, and Isola della Scala.",

Moreover, it requires only a uniform background and an approximate north--south projectile point orientation. The principal computer methods that compose the algorithm are the curvature scale space map (CSS-map), the gradient contour on the projectile point, and the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm.

    "abstract": "Digital technology in museum practice provides new means of interaction with artifacts and collections. In particular, we need interactive installations in order to encourage and stimulate visitors to learn and understand archaeological musical instruments through engagement and active participation: these instruments (i.e., interactive artifacts per se ) are de facto unplayable and inaccessible to visitors, as a consequence of their preservation issues. However, presenting artifacts to the general public is a complex task for their multifaceted nature, and digital technology must not sacrifice accuracy or depth of information for the sake of entertainment. Moreover, deploying digital technology is a multidisciplinary effort that requires an interplay among different fields, from history and archaeology to information engineering and craftsmanship. In this article, we present a methodology to relate such disciplines in order to design a digital multimedia installation that promotes archaeological musical instruments in a museum. In defining the problem, we identify four different aspects to consider: the museum collection, the museum environment, the manufacturing opportunities for the installation, and the user experience. Such aspects are integrated in a design approach that is centered on Design Thinking . The proposed methodology is exemplified in the designing and manufacturing of an installation for a Pan flute from Egypt dated back to 700 A.D., a case in which multisensory interaction is particularly important to convey the lost sound of the instrument. We describe in detail an installation (exhibited at the Museum of Archaeological Science and Art at the University of Padova), which virtually recreates the Pan flute and communicates information related to its history, iconography, acoustics, and musicology. Just after the deployment of the installation, we also carried out an assessment with a group of experts in the fields of information engineering, music, musicology, and archaeology. The good results obtained demonstrate that the installation is a convenient way of interaction, simple to use and aesthetically integrated in the museum context.",

Numerically prepared data are used here, although the method can be used with experimental data as well. In this case, the need for a constitutive description of the fine scale is bypassed. Extraction of material properties from the database, required by the upper-level finite element analysis, is based on backpropagation artificial neural networks. The method is applicable to monuments and masonry structural systems. We investigate this approach here for the analysis of masonry structures with elastoplastic behavior.

To ensure the quality of the results, we developed a methodology under a social innovation paradigm that enabled the co-creation of the game. The methodology was driven by a series of three workshops, during which we adopted several different gamification strategies to support a Participatory Design (PD) process with the stakeholders, a group of local pre-teen and teen girls at social risk (N = 22). Captured requirements materialized into intermediate prototype evaluations that motivated a progressive refinement of the game.",

    "abstract": "The Cultural Heritage (CH) sector and its associated tourism services have been affected notably by the advancement of the Internet as well as the explosive growth of smartphones and other handheld devices. These days, visitors can access reliable CH content using Web and mobile-based interfaces. However, conventional CH systems still lack the ability to provide meaningful semantically overt results that precisely meet user information needs in this domain. In addition, they often ignore the user search context and experience, which hinders their ability to adapt their behavior to the preferences, tasks, interests, and other user functionalities. In this article, we aim to address the issue of designing a precision-oriented multilingual and multi-criteria semantic-based mobile recommender system specifically targeting Palestine's CH, a country with great historical and cultural importance. We aim to better facilitate users’ access to CH content by providing them with multiple search functionalities. In this context, a user can search for relevant information using keywords (a.k.a. tags) or sentence-like queries and the system retrieves all relevant documents based on their semantic similarity. A second option is to search using current location information to retrieve correlated historical places and events. Finally, starting from a picture of interest, a third option makes it possible to extract captions describing its content that can be used to search for additional contextually relevant information. Additionally, the proposed system aims at personalizing users’ experience through progressively delivering output that meets their information needs based on a number of parameters such as users' logging data, interests, previous searches, and location-based information. A prototype of the proposed system has been developed and tested using Android smartphones and a manually constructed ontology enriched with CH links to the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) and DBpedia. By comparing our system with similar systems in this domain, findings demonstrate that it provides additional search features and functionalities to users. The proposed Holy-Land ontology is the first of its kind attempting to encode knowledge about Palestine's CH. It plays a crucial role in our proposal, serving as a pivotal entity in the combination of language-based, location-based, and visual-based retrieval strategies.",

    "abstract": "Rephotography is the process of recapturing the photograph of a location from the same perspective in which it was captured earlier. A rephotographed image is the best presentation to visualize and study the social changes of a location over time. Traditionally, only expert artists and photographers are capable of generating the rephotograph of any specific location. Manual editing or human eye judgment that is considered for generating rephotographs normally requires a lot of precision, effort and is not always accurate. In the era of computer science and deep learning, computer vision techniques make it easier and faster to perform precise operations to an image. Until now many research methodologies have been proposed for rephotography but none of them is fully automatic. Some of these techniques require manual input by the user or need multiple images of the same location with 3D point cloud data while others are only suggestions to the user to perform rephotography. In historical records/archives most of the time we can find only one 2D image of a certain location. Computational rephotography is a challenge in the case of using only one image of a location captured at different timestamps because it is difficult to find the accurate perspective of a single 2D historical image. Moreover, in the case of building rephotography, it is required to maintain the alignments and regular shape. The features of a building may change over time and in most of the cases, it is not possible to use a features detection algorithm to detect the key features. In this research paper, we propose a methodology to rephotograph house images by combining deep learning and traditional computer vision techniques. The purpose of this research is to rephotograph an image of the past based on a single image. This research will be helpful not only for computer scientists but also for history and cultural heritage research scholars to study the social changes of a location during a specific time period, and it will allow users to go back in time to see how a specific place looked in the past. We have achieved good, fully automatic rephotographed results based on façade segmentation using only a single image.",

    "abstract": "Computational technologies have revolutionized the archival sciences field, prompting new approaches to process the extensive data in these collections. Automatic speech recognition and natural language processing create unique possibilities for analysis of oral history (OH) interviews, where otherwise the transcription and analysis of the full recording would be too time consuming. However, many oral historians note the loss of aural information when converting the speech into text, pointing out the relevance of subjective cues for a full understanding of the interviewee narrative. In this article, we explore various computational technologies for social signal processing and their potential application space in OH archives, as well as neighboring domains where qualitative studies is a frequently used method. We also highlight the latest developments in key technologies for multimedia archiving practices such as natural language processing and automatic speech recognition. We discuss the analysis of both visual (body language and facial expressions), and non-visual cues (paralinguistics, breathing, and heart rate), stating the specific challenges introduced by the characteristics of OH collections. We argue that applying social signal processing to OH archives will have a wider influence than solely OH practices, bringing benefits for various fields from humanities to computer sciences, as well as to archival sciences. Looking at human emotions and somatic reactions on extensive interview collections would give scholars from multiple fields the opportunity to focus on feelings, mood, culture, and subjective experiences expressed in these interviews on a larger scale.",

The merging process is based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which enables calculation of the geometric transformation between point clouds based on a set of interest points that includes incorrect samples, called outliers. The proposed processing path is designed to integrate many directional measurements, which are acquired with a 3D scanner and are represented as unsorted point clouds (x, y, z) with color information (R, G, B). Exemplary measurements shown in this article represent sections of ceiling in the King's Chinese Cabinet of the Museum of King Jan III's Palace at Wilanow in Warsaw, Poland, as well as some more complex objects. Experimental verification confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method in integrating directional measurements of objects with detailed texture, particularly if they have no unique geometric features.",

This virtual museum integrates the virtual tours of historical monuments, 3D models of museum objects, images, and videos introducing cultural heritage objects. Moreover, with all types of data stored on it, the museum can be useful for the public, researchers, and experts in various fields, improving cultural heritage conservation.

    "abstract": "Mobile technology offers new opportunities to enhance the visitor experience in museums. Mobile serious games can support experiential learning with authentic exhibits in an authentic museum environment based on the contextual learning model with the interaction between the personal, socio-cultural, and physical context. In developing the game, we wondered whether it could appropriately motivate and engage different age groups in the museum experience with its challenges of different difficulty levels; whether a mobile game could, through its challenges interacting with the museum environment, prevent “head-down” behavior; and whether museum exhibits could be better recalled by visitors participating in a tour with a mobile game than in two other traditional tours (i.e., guided tours, tours with museum brochures). The results of the study showed that a tour with a mobile serious game with challenges of different difficulty levels is suitable for visitors of two target groups (i.e., families and students). Since each challenge encourages interaction with the museum environment, it could largely prevent “head-down” behavior. The results also show that a tour with appropriately planned multisensory challenges motivates visitors to actively engage with the museum environment, resulting in slightly better recall of exhibits compared to other tour types. The results of this study can help bring museums and the history they represent closer to digital generations, 1 and popularize modern informal learning methods associated with incidental and experiential lifelong learning that can take place anytime, anywhere, and help achieve higher taxonomic knowledge levels.",

    "abstract": "One of the key AI tools for textual corpora exploration is natural language question-answering (QA). Unlike keyword-based search engines, QA algorithms receive and process natural language questions and produce precise answers to these questions, rather than long lists of documents that need to be manually scanned by the users. State-of-the-art QA algorithms based on DNNs were successfully employed in various domains. However, QA in the genealogical domain is still underexplored, while researchers in this field (and other fields in humanities and social sciences) can highly benefit from the ability to ask questions in natural language, receive concrete answers and gain insights hidden within large corpora. While some research has been recently conducted for factual QA in the genealogical domain, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous research on the more challenging task of numerical aggregation QA (i.e., answering questions combining aggregation functions, e.g., count, average, max). Numerical aggregation QA is critical for distant reading and analysis for researchers (and the general public) interested in investigating cultural heritage domains. Therefore, in this study, we present a new end-to-end methodology for numerical aggregation QA for genealogical trees that includes: 1) an automatic method for training dataset generation; 2) a transformer-based table selection method, and 3) an optimized transformer-based numerical aggregation QA model. The findings indicate that the proposed architecture, GLOBE, outperforms the state-of-the-art models and pipelines by achieving 87% accuracy for this task compared to only 21% by current state-of-the-art models. This study may have practical implications for genealogical information centers and museums, making genealogical data research easy and scalable for experts as well as the general public.",

    "abstract": "Iconclass is an iconographic thesaurus, which is widely used in the digital heritage domain to describe subjects depicted in artworks. Each subject is assigned a unique descriptive code, which has a corresponding textual definition. The assignment of Iconclass codes is a challenging task for computational systems, due to the large number of available labels in comparison to the limited amount of training data available. Transfer learning has become a common strategy to overcome such a data shortage. In deep learning, transfer learning consists in fine-tuning the weights of a deep neural network for a downstream task. In this work, we present a deep retrieval framework, which can be fully fine-tuned for the task under consideration. Our work is based on a recent approach to this task, which already yielded state-of-the-art performance, although it could not be fully fine-tuned yet. This approach exploits the multi-linguality and multi-modality that is inherent to digital heritage data. Our framework jointly processes multiple input modalities, namely, textual and visual features. We extract the textual features from the artwork titles in multiple languages, whereas the visual features are derived from photographic reproductions of the artworks. The definitions of the Iconclass codes, containing useful textual information, are used as target labels instead of the codes themselves. As our main contribution, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin. In addition, our approach is superior to the M 3 P feature extractor and outperforms the multi-lingual CLIP in most experiments due to the better quality of the visual features. Our out-of-domain and zero-shot experiments show poor results and demonstrate that the Iconclass retrieval remains a challenging task. We make our source code and models publicly available to support heritage institutions in the further enrichment of their digital collections.",

    "abstract": "The destruction of archaeological sites and the loss of archaeological landscapes remains a global concern as populations and urban areas continue to expand. Archaeological sites are not only significant to local communities, national identities, and modern tourist economies but also provide critical knowledge of past sociocultural interactions, settlement patterns, human-environment relationships, and risk mitigation strategies. While archaeological landscapes and site destruction have remained outside of traditional land use land cover change (LULCC) studies, they are a form of urban and agricultural land use. By conceptualizing archaeological site destruction within land change science, this study provides an innovative approach for assessing “what's left” of historically surveyed archaeological landscapes. Using a Random Forest algorithm and Landsat satellite data, this study quantifies archaeological site destruction attributed to LULCC in Peru's lower Moche Valley between 1985 and 2020. More than 400 archaeological sites previously recorded during the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project (CCMVP, 1969–1974) are analyzed. Results indicate that less than a quarter of the original CCMVP sites remain on the landscape. The primary drivers of LULCC in the lower Moche Valley include population growth, migration, and government policies, while secondary drivers include heritage values. Positioning archaeological survey data within land change science and integrating machine learning techniques can benefit historic survey reassessments globally and provides significant knowledge of archaeological site destruction and the socioeconomic conditions that underly dynamic landscape changes.",

    "abstract": "Conventional studies on the satisfaction of museum visitors focus on collecting information through surveys to provide a one-way service to visitors, and thus it is impossible to obtain feedback on the real-time satisfaction of visitors who are experiencing the museum exhibition program. In addition, museum practitioners lack research on automated ways to evaluate a produced content program's lifecycle and its appropriateness. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel multi-convolutional neural network, called VimoNet, which is able to recognize visitors emotions automatically in real-time based on their facial expressions and body gestures. Furthermore, we design a user preference model of content and a framework to obtain feedback on content improvement for providing personalized digital cultural heritage content to visitors. Specifically, we define seven emotions of visitors and build a dataset of visitor facial expressions and gestures with respect to the emotions. Using the dataset, we proceed with feature fusion of face and gesture images trained on the DenseNet-201 and VGG-16 models for generating a combined emotion recognition model. From the results of the experiment, VimoNet achieved a classification accuracy of 84.10%, providing 7.60% and 14.31% improvement, respectively, over a single face and body gesture-based method of emotion classification performance. It is thus possible to automatically capture the emotions of museum visitors via VimoNet, and we confirm its feasibility through a case study with respect to digital content of cultural heritage.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present the results of the photogrammetric surveys of two important monuments, the Roman Theatre in Sabratha, Libya, and San Galgano Abbey, in Italy. The surveys were performed with a new photogrammetric technique, Spherical Photogrammetry, developed by Gabriele Fangi [2007, 2008, 2009, 2010]. The method is based on so-called spherical panoramas. These are obtained by stitching together several pictures taken from the same point and covering 360°, which are then mapped in a plane with an equi-rectangular projection. This technique is normally used to produce QuickTime movies which have already proven to be very useful for the documentation of cultural heritage. One panorama can replace many normal photographic images. Ease, rapidity, low cost, and completeness of the documentation are the main advantages of this technique. The Abbey of San Galgano is an important example of Gothic architecture in Italy. The church is empty and without its roof, which fell towards the end of the 18 th century. The photogrammetric survey was done in November 2009. Thirty-four panoramas were taken outside, around the perimeter of the complex, and 22 were taken inside the church. The Roman theatre of Sabratha, built in the 2 nd century AD, was rebuilt in the years between 1930-1940 at the command of the Italian governor of Libya, Italo Balbo, as a rememberance of the past Roman Empire. The project was handled by two Italian archaeologists Caputo [1953] and Guidi [1935]. The photogrammetric survey was done in August 2009 with 22 panoramas taken around and inside the monument. These two projects are limited in their scope, not covering the geometry of the entire monuments. The time and the available resources did not permit a complete survey. The purpose of the two projects was not to satisfy the needs of a client, but only to demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of the approach. In these two projects accuracy tests were not made, but in other projects accuracy was found to be on the order of 1/1000 the object distance, say one centimeter every ten meters of distance from the object [Fangi 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, 2009, 2010].",

    "abstract": "Over the course of the past century, there have been significant changes in the practices of archives driven by the massive increase in the volume of records for archiving, a larger and more diverse user base, and the digital turn. This paper analyses work undertaken by the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure project (EHRI) to develop heritage archives into research infrastructures by connecting their knowledge and making it relevant for research. In the article, we focus on EHRI’s work on an integrated collection portal, acting as a central gateway to the rich information on Holocaust-related sources. At the time of writing, the portal contains over 150,000 descriptions of over 1,850 institutions that hold Holocaust-related archival material in 51 countries. In addition, it hosts concise reports that provide in-depth per-country information about the Holocaust history and archival situation in 47 countries, topic-focused research guides, and a range of other services. The article presents how the EHRI portal work connects to the state of the art of heritage portals and the novel solutions we had to develop to align the portal with the requirements of a research infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "It is of great interest to researchers and scholars in many disciplines (particularly those working on cultural heritage projects) to study parallel passages (i.e., identical or similar pieces of text describing the same thing) in digital text archives. Although there exist a few software tools for this purpose, they are restricted to a specific domain (e.g., the Bible) or a specific language (e.g., Hebrew). In this article, we present in detail how we build a digital infrastructure that can facilitate the search and discovery of parallel passages for any domain in any language. It is at the core of our Samtla (Search And Mining Tools with Linguistic Analysis) system designed in collaboration with historians and linguists. The system has already been used to support research on five large text corpora that span a number of different domains and languages. The key to such a domain-independent and language-independent digital infrastructure is a novel combination of a character-based n -gram language model, space-optimized suffix tree, and generalized edit distance. A comprehensive evaluation through crowdsourcing shows that the effectiveness of our system’s search functionality is on par with the human-level performance.",

    "abstract": "RGB-D cameras have a great potential to solve several problems arising during the digitization of objects, such as cultural heritage. Three-dimensional (3D) digital preservation is usually performed with the use of high-end 3D scanners, as the 3D points generated by this type of equipment are in average millimeter up to sub-millimeter accurate. The downside of 3D scanners, in addition to the high cost, is the infrastructure requirements. It requires its own source of energy, a large workspace with tripods, special training to calibrate and operate the equipment, and high acquisition time, potentially taking several minutes for capturing a single image. An alternative is the use of low-cost depth cameras that are easy to operate and only require connection to a laptop and a source of energy. There are several recent studies showing the potential of RGB-D sensors. However, they often exhibit errors when applied to a full 360 degrees 3D reconstruction setup, known as the loop closure problem. This kind of error accumulation is intensified by the lower accuracy and large volume of data generated by RGB-D cameras. This article proposes a complete methodology for 3D reconstruction based on RGB-D sensors. To mitigate the loop closure effect, a pairwise alignment method was developed. The proposed approach expands the connectivity graph connections in a pairwise alignment system, by automatically discovering new pairs of meshes with overlapping regions. Then the alignment is more evenly distributed over the aligned pairs, avoiding the loop closure problem of full 3D reconstructions. The experiments were performed on a collection of 30 artworks made by the Baroque artist Antonio Francisco Lisboa, known as Aleijadinho, as part of the Aleijadinho Digital project conducted in partnership with IPHAN (Brazilian National Institute for Cultural and Artistic Heritage) and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Experimental results show 3D models that are favorably compared to state-of-the-art methods available in the literature using RGD-D sensors. The main contributions of this work are: a new method for 3D alignment dedicated to attenuate the RGB-D camera loop closure problem; the development and disclosure of a complete, practical solution for 3D reconstruction of artworks; and the construction of 3D digital models of an important and challenging collection of Brazilian cultural heritage, made accessible by a virtual museum.",

    "abstract": "Many historical monuments were originally vividly painted (polychromatic), and researchers have been able to reach consensus on this even for monument classes in which only indirect evidence of painting survives. However, academic caution has led to an understandable reluctance to pass this knowledge to the public through use of reconstructions showing the colour schemes of these monuments. As a result, use of polychromatic reconstruction has been very limited and has made a significant impact on public perception for the classical period, with insignificant progress for many other important monument classes. We argue that large-scale projects to create digital reconstructions are inevitable but that adoption of open workflows is vitally important to achieve the objectives of the London Charter. We demonstrate a practical workflow with two medieval stone crosses.",

    "abstract": "The preservation of architectural heritage represents a major asset for economic development in several countries. Nevertheless, its protection remains a complex task due to its high vulnerability, especially in seismic zones. The intervention on the historical buildings requires the creation of a numerical and digital support shared by the different building specialists (architects, conservators, engineers, designers), which can contain all of the data relating to the construction. This will allow to ensure not only a better interchangeability between the different disciplines but also a correct and coherent conception and execution of the interventions. The introduction of 3D digitization tools, particularly the 3D laser scanner, plays a major role during the realization of the architectural survey. Indeed, the use of the architectural modeling software based on Building Information Modeling and Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline allows first of all to move from the point cloud to an accurate 3D numerical model exploitable for various types of analysis, such as structural analysis, building archeology analysis, and thermal analysis. We propose through this article an unprecedented application of the 3D laser scanner on an example of vernacular architecture, constituting a truly unique type of “Medina.” The object of the study is an aggregate composed of five houses, falling inside the Kasbah of Algiers, which since 1992 has been classified as “universal heritage” by UNESCO. The architectural survey is followed by a demonstration of numerical modelling based on 10 grades of generation using two categories of software founded mainly on Building Information Modeling and Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline. Two kinds of numerical models are obtained: a first architectural model will be exploited during the building archaeology principally based on the 3D scanning results and a second structural model that will be used for structural analysis through a Finite Element Analysis software.",

Our research proposes a novel approach to visibility studies, based on visual acuity and its related pipeline, which integrates qualitative and quantitative aspects such as the cultural background of viewers, the illumination values of space, contrast, and size of objects of interest as well as their meaning and context. The proposed pipeline relies on 3D documentation of the investigated space, light measurements, research in optics, trigonometry calculations, and 3D GIS set against images and architectural space. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated in the study of the iconography of the Cathedral of St. John the Theologian in Nicosia, Cyprus, the work hypothesis being that the church's spatial organization, choice of scenes, and level of detail were carefully planned to establish visual narratives with strong political and religious connotations and to overall dictate the ways the building was accessed and experienced. The method can be broadly applied for visibility analyses in a variety of case-studies in closed spaces.",

The installation is set up in a center for architecture, and invites visitors to explore its facade while playing with vertigo, in a visual virtual reality environment that replicates the surrounding physical space of the installation. Drawing on an ethnographic approach, including observations and interviews, we researched the exhibit from its opening, through the initial months plagued by technical problems, its subsequent success as a social and playful installation, on to its closure, due to COVID-19, and its subsequent reopening. Our findings explore the challenges caused by both the hybrid nature of the installation and the visitors’ playful use of the installation which made the experience social and performative—but also caused some problems. We also discuss the problems We Dare You faced in light of hygiene demands due to COVID-19. The analysis contrasts the design processes and expectations of stakeholders with the audience’s playful appropriation, which led the stakeholders to see the installation as both a success and a failure. Evaluating the design and redesign through use on behalf of visitors, we argue that an approach that further opens up the post-production experience to a process of continuous redesign based on the user input—what has been termed design-after-design—could facilitate the design of similar experiences in the museum and heritage sector, supporting a participatory agenda in the design process, and helping to resolve the tension between stakeholders’ expectations and visitors’ playful appropriations.",

    "abstract": "Historical Islamic ornaments include a fantastic treasury of geometric and mathematical algorithms. Inevitably, restoration of these ornaments in periodic patterns consisting of repeated elements has been faced following and substituting the other available similar ingredients instead of vanished parts. Still, the prediction of parametric, quasi, or non-periodic patterns, where components are not identical, needs to be carried out in a more challenging process than the periodic ones due to shape, scale, or angle of rotation alteration. Intelligent restoration could facilitate the forecasting of damaged parts in such geometric patterns that an algorithm has changed their geometric characteristics. In some architectural heritage, geometric patterns include a parametric algorithm like parametric patterns in the ceiling of Sheikh Lotfollahmosque in Isfahan, Iran, and the dominant structure of Persian domes Karbandi. In this article, the aim is to propose a new method for the smart restoration of the parametric geometric patterns in which, by having access to the image of the existing patterns, the vanished parts could be reconstructed spontaneously. Our approach is based on image processing by detecting boundaries of deterioration, finding every individual element, and extracting features of detected individual patterns via Zernike moments. The order of individual patterns starts from the farthest pattern to detected deterioration. Then by creating a time series, the Back-propagation neural network would be trained by extracted features, and the vanished patterns’ features could be predicted and reconstructed. Eventually, the reconstructed and real patterns are compared to determine differences between them by mean-squared error and to evaluate the performance of our method. To validate the process, a parametric geometric pattern is designed by the assumption that some parts are disappeared. The proposed method’s results, in this case, hold an efficient performance with the accuracy of 92.99%. Furthermore, Sheikh Lotfollah’s patterns and Naseredin Mirza mansion’s patterns as two real cases are tested by the proposed method, representing reliable and suitable performance results.",

Given the ontological foundations of the Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), a graph database or a triplestore was seen as the best candidate to represent a CRM-based data model for the new software. We thus decided to compare several of these databases, based on their maturity, features, performance in standard tasks and, most importantly, the Object-Graph Mappers (OGM) available to interact with each database in an object-oriented way. Our conclusions are drawn not only from a systematic review of related works but from an experimental scenario. For our experiment, we designed a simple CRM-compliant graph designed to test the ability of each OGM/database combination to tackle the so-called “diamond-problem” in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to ensure that property instances follow domain and range constraints. Our results show that (1) ontological consistency enforcement in graph databases and triplestores is much harder to achieve than in a relational database, making them more suited to an analytical rather than a transactional role; (2) OGMs are still rather immature solutions; and (3) neomodel, an OGM for the Neo4j graph database, is the most mature solution in the study as it satisfies all requirements, although it is also the least performing.",

It was an arsenal building used for the production of cannons and cannon balls. An ambient vibration survey was conducted with the Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition method to identify the dynamic characteristics of the structure. Later, a finite element model of the structure was constructed and numerical dynamic identification was pursued. The obtained experimental and numerical results have been compared and the finite element model of the structure has been tuned to obtain a validated tool to represent the real dynamic behavior of the structure. While the tuned model of the structure is intended to contribute to understanding its structural behavior and evaluate the mechanical properties of masonry, it has also been used for the evaluation of its seismic vulnerabilities. For this purpose, the structure has been analyzed under maximum considered earthquake response spectrum, and stress concentration regions have been determined. The results also serve as data for future structural health monitoring studies related to the structure.",

Unfortunately, this broadly used technology is error-prone, especially when an OCRed document was written hundreds of years ago. Neural networks have shown great success in solving various text processing tasks, including OCR post-correction. The main disadvantage of using neural networks for historical corpora is the lack of sufficiently large training datasets they require to learn from, especially for morphologically-rich languages like Hebrew. Moreover, it is not clear what are the optimal structure and values of hyperparameters (predefined parameters) of neural networks for OCR error correction in Hebrew due to its unique features. Furthermore, languages change across genres and periods. These changes may affect the accuracy of OCR post-correction neural network models.

    "abstract": "In Architectural Heritage, the masonry’s interpretation is an essential instrument for analysing the construction phases, the assessment of structural properties, and the monitoring of its state of conservation. This work is generally carried out by specialists that, based on visual observation and their knowledge, manually annotate ortho-images of the masonry generated by photogrammetric surveys. This results in vector thematic maps segmented according to their construction technique (isolating areas of homogeneous materials/structure/texture or each individual constituting block of the masonry) or state of conservation, including degradation areas and damaged parts. This time-consuming manual work, often done with tools that have not been designed for this purpose, represents a bottleneck in the documentation and management workflow and is a severely limiting factor in monitoring large-scale monuments (e.g., city walls). This article explores the potential of AI-based solutions to improve the efficiency of masonry annotation in Architectural Heritage. This experimentation aims at providing interactive tools that support and empower the current workflow, benefiting from specialists’ expertise.",

    "abstract": "The interpretation process is one of the main tasks performed by archaeologists who, starting from ground data about evidences and findings, incrementally derive knowledge about ancient objects or events. Very often more than one archaeologist contributes in different time instants to discover details about the same finding and thus, it is important to keep track of history and provenance of the overall knowledge discovery process. To this aim, we propose a model and a set of derivation rules for tracking and refining data provenance during the archaeological interpretation process. In particular, among all the possible interpretation activities, we concentrate on the one concerning the dating that archaeologists perform to assign one or more time intervals to a finding to define its lifespan on the temporal axis. In this context, we propose a framework to represent and derive updated provenance data about temporal information after the mentioned derivation process. Archaeological data, and in particular their temporal dimension, are typically vague, since many different interpretations can coexist, thus, we will use Fuzzy Logic to assign a degree of confidence to values and Fuzzy Temporal Constraint Networks to model relationships between dating of different findings represented as a graph-based dataset. The derivation rules used to infer more precise temporal intervals are enriched to manage also provenance information and their following updates after a derivation step. A MapReduce version of the path consistency algorithm is also proposed to improve the efficiency of the refining process on big graph-based datasets.",

    "abstract": "Disorganised and self-organised crowdsourcing activities that harness collective behaviours to achieve a specific level of performance and task completeness are not well understood. Such phenomena become indistinct when highly varied environments are present, particularly for crowdsourcing photogrammetry-based 3D models. Mass photogrammetry can democratise traditional close-range photogrammetry procedures by outsourcing image acquisition tasks to a crowd of non-experts to capture geographically scattered 3D objects. To improve public engagement, we need to understand how individual behaviour in collective efforts work in traditional disorganised crowdsourcing and how it can be organised for better performance. This research aims to investigate the effectiveness of disorganised and self-organised collaborative crowdsourcing. It examines the collaborative dynamics among participants and the trends we could leverage if team structures were incorporated. Two scenarios were proposed and constructed: asynchronous crowdsourcing, which implicitly aggregates isolated contributions from disorganised individuals; and synchronous collaborative crowdsourcing, which assigns participants into a crowd-based self-organised team. Our experiment demonstrated that a self-organised team working in synchrony can effectively improve crowdsourcing photogrammetric 3D models in terms of model completeness and user experience. Through our study, we demonstrated that this crowdsourcing mechanism can provide a social context where participants can exchange information via implicit communication, and collectively build a shared mental model that pertains to their responsibilities and task goals. It stimulates participants’ prosocial motivation and reinforces their commitment. With more time and effort invested, their positive sense of ownership increases, fostering higher dedication and better contribution. Our findings shed further light on the potentials of adopting team structures to encourage effective collaborations in conventionally individual-based voluntary crowdsourcing settings, especially in the digital heritage domain.",

    "abstract": "The wide adoption of digital technologies in the cultural heritage sector has promoted the emergence of new, distributed ways of working, communicating, and investigating cultural products and services. In particular, collaborative online platforms and crowdsourcing mechanisms have been widely adopted in the effort to solicit input from the community and promote engagement. In this work, we provide an extensive analysis of the Wiki Loves Monuments initiative, an annual, international photography contest in which volunteers are invited to take pictures of the built cultural heritage and upload them to Wikimedia Commons. We explore the geographical, temporal, and topical dimensions across the 2010–2021 editions. We first adopt a set of CNN-based artificial systems that allow the learning of deep scene features for various scene recognition tasks, exploring cross-country (dis)similarities. To overcome the rigidity of the framework based on scene descriptors, we train a deep convolutional neural network model to label a photo with its country of origin. The resulting model captures the best representation of a heritage site uploaded in a country, and it allows the domain experts to explore the complexity of cross-national architectural styles. Finally, as a validation step, we explore the link between architectural heritage and intangible cultural values, operationalized using the framework developed within the World Value Survey research program. We observe that cross-country cultural similarities match to a fair extent the interrelations emerging in the architectural domain. We think this study contributes to highlighting the richness and the potential of the Wikimedia data and tools ecosystem to act as a scientific object for art historians, iconologists, and archaeologists.",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, the number of projects involving historical reconstruction has increased significantly. Recent technologies have proven a powerful tool for a better understanding of our cultural heritage through which to attain a glimpse of the environments in which our ancestors lived. However, to accomplish such a purpose, these reconstructions should be presented to us as they may really have been perceived by a local inhabitant, according to the illumination and materials used back then and, equally important, the characteristics of the human visual system. The human visual system has a remarkable ability to adjust itself to almost all everyday scenarios. This is particularly evident in extreme lighting conditions, such as bright light or dark environments. However, a major portion of the visible spectra captured by our visual system cannot be represented in most display devices. High dynamic range imagery is a field of research which is developing techniques to correct such inaccuracies. This new viewing paradigm is perfectly suited for archaeological interpretation, since its high contrast and chromaticity can present us with an enhanced viewing experience, closer to what an inhabitant of that era may have seen. In this article we present a case study of the reconstruction of a Roman site. We generate high dynamic range images of mosaics and frescoes from one of the most impressive monuments in the ruins of Conimbriga, Portugal, an ancient city of the Roman Empire. To achieve the requisite level of precision, in addition to having a precise geometric 3D model, it is crucial to integrate in the virtual simulation authentic physical data of the light used in the period under consideration. Therefore, in order to create a realistic physical-based environment, we use in our lighting simulations real data obtained from simulated Roman luminaries of that time.",

The results show how such reconstructions may aid both a general and an expert understanding of the three designs. It is proposed that by formalizing the facade description into a shape grammar with procedural modeling, a systematized approach to a stylistic analysis is possible. It is also asserted that such an analysis is still best understood within the historical context of what is known about the contemporary design intentions of the building creators and commissioners.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses the problem of automatic reconstruction of a 3D relief object from a line drawing. Our main application is reconstruction of archaeological artifacts based on line drawings. The problem is challenging due to five reasons: the small number of orthogonal views of the object, the sparsity of the strokes, their ambiguity, their large number, and their interrelations. We partition the reconstruction problem into two subproblems. First, we reconstruct the underlying smooth base of the object from the silhouette. Assuming that the variation of bases belonging to the same class of objects is relatively small, we create the base by modifying a similar base retrieved from a database. Second, we reconstruct the relief on top of the base. Our approach can reconstruct the relief from a complex drawing that consists of many interrelated strokes. Rather than viewing the interdependencies as a problem, we show how they can be exploited to automatically generate a good initial interpretation of the line drawing. Even though our algorithm is generic, its strength is demonstrated by the reconstruction of artifacts from manual drawings taken from real archaeological reports. These drawings are highly challenging, since artists created very complex and detailed descriptions of artifacts regardless of any considerations concerning their future use for shape reconstruction.",

After reviewing current methods for enhancing incisions, a hybrid approach is adopted that combines advantages of 2D and 3D analytical techniques. A photogrammetric point cloud of an inscription is projected orthographically from an ideal vantage point, generating a 2.5D raster, including channels describing depth and surface derivatives. The next consideration is the obstacle to legibility posed by breaks in the ancient surface, which motivates the development of a new segmentation algorithm based on SLIC superpixels with region-merging adapted to operate on the geometry of the inscribed surface instead of color or intensity values. The algorithm classifies surface points by their likelihood of belonging to the uninscribed original plane, deliberate strokes, or breaks. Results are visualized in a manner suited for epigraphical analysis and publication through static images. Two case studies demonstrate the power and flexibility of this method, which has indicated changes to the reading of IG XIV 1, an early Greek text that has been debated for more than 150 years.",

While some of them help the players to understand the war, appealing to the hyper-realistic simulation, others are entertainment artifacts that banalize it. This research seeks to determine the edu-communicative potential of war video games, understood as the ability to drive critical thinking towards war. To do this, we adopt a qualitative methodology based on the study of 10 cases, using the WarVG-A (War video game evaluation) instrument to perform the content analysis, based on six dimensions (cognitive, personal-attitudinal, ethical, logical, argumentative, and expressive-communicative) with different indicators and categories. The results of the analysis indicate that these primary games terrorist tactics and historical adaptation, addressing war from a critical approach. Most evidence ethical dilemmas such as child soldiers, the economics of war (arms sales and conflict perpetuation). Economic and geo-political interests are the engines that drive wars, considered inevitable to defend themselves. The stereotypes that abound are gender and ethnic warmongers represented by photorealistic and cinematographic aesthetics. Only four of the selected playful artifacts can identify tools capable of driving critical thinking, inviting players to reflect on war from a more realistic position and emotionally involving them. However, the explicit representation of violence limits its use in school contexts.",

    "abstract": "Personalising museum mobile guides is widely acknowledged as being important for enhancing the visitor experience. Due to the lack of information about an individual visitor and the relatively limited time of his or her visit, adapting the user interface based on a museum visitor's type is a promising approach to personalisation. This approach first requires a mechanism to identify the visitor type (‘persona’) and, second, knowledge of the preferences and needs of different types to apply personalisation. In this article, we report a face-to-face questionnaire study carried out with 105 visitors to Scitech, a science and technology visitor centre. The study aims to investigate the main facts required to identify a visitor persona and to explore the preferences of different visitor personas for particular mobile guide features. We limited our concern to the user interface features of the guide (e.g., whether it provides recommendations for related items to view) rather than what content and services the guide provides (e.g., what related items are recommended). We found that we can reliably identify the visitor persona using two multiple choice questions about visit motivation and perceived success criteria. In addition, we found that visitors have significant preferences for particular features such as presentation media, venue navigation tool, object suggestions, details level, accessing external links, exhibit information retrieval method and social interaction features such as voice communication, instant messaging, group games and challenges. Some features were found to be preferred differently by different personas such as the challenges feature, some were found to be preferred by personas differently to the overall preference such as in presentation media, and some were found to be preferred by some personas with no particular preference for others such as a venue navigation tool. Instant messaging was found to be significantly not preferred by all personas. The results provide a basis for personalisation of museum guides and services using a personas approach, which is a solution where data about individual users may be limited and where the individual configuration of a user interface may not be practical or warranted.",

While a complete text can be found in the 10th-century “Vercelli Book,” the poem is considerably older, and its oldest occurrence is carved (in runes) on the 7- to 8th-century Ruthwell Stone Cross. In this article, we present the work done in the framework of the “Visionary Cross” project, starting from the digitization of the Ruthwell Cross to the creation of a web-based digital edition of The Dream of the Rood , as it is carved on the Cross. The 3D data has been collected and processed with the explicit aim of creating a multimedia framework able to present the highly detailed digital model acquired with 3D scanning technology, together with the transcription and translation of the runes that can be found on its surface. The textual and spatial information are linked through a system of bidirectional links called Spots, which allow the users to navigate freely over the multimedia content, keeping the 3D and textual data synchronized. The present work discusses the different issues that arose during the work, from digitization and processing to the design of a tool for the integration of three-dimensional content in the context of the presentation on the web platform of heterogeneous multimedia data. We end with the difficulties involved in the creation of an XML encoding that could account for the necessities of the visualization system but remain within the scholarly encoding standards of the relevant disciplinary community.",

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades, the introduction of digital technologies in the field of architectural documentation has profoundly changed tools and acquisition techniques. Most of the developments concern metrical and colorimetric characteristics of the objects studied. These developments, surrounding the practice of architectural survey, tend to respond primarily to the requirements of completeness. In this context, it seems necessary to assess the impact of these instruments on the cognitive value of architectural representation. With a strong technological presence, the study of the built heritage is facing a problem of “information overload.” Indeed, this strong technological presence fails to strengthen representation in its role as a vehicle of knowledge. Confronted with the intelligibility deficit, this article proposes an original approach for reading morphological features of an artifact by using a bottom-up approach: the meaning of elements (i.e., their semantic layouts) come from a statistical analysis of the major shape discontinuities of a collection of instances. The idea is to rely on data accumulation to render apparent high-level semantic structures from the comparative analysis of common low-level geometric features. The principles introduced are illustrated by the study of 31 columns of the cloister of the abbey of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa. To summarize, the first objective is to understand how digital technologies can help us in the analysis of artistic and technical production of Romanesque columns. The second objective is to automatically identify the common semantic articulations of the entire collection to build a reference model for the future assessment of each artifact.",

    "abstract": "Western thought in European history was mainly affected by the image of the world created during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The most popular reason to travel during the Middle Ages was taking a pilgrimage. Jerusalem, Rome, and Santiago de Compostela were the most popular destinations. It is not surprising that a lot of works written by travellers as guides for pilgrims exist. By the beginning of the Renaissance, a more precise image of the world was defined, thanks to the discovery of ancient geographical models, especially the work of Ptolemy. The Italian National Research Project (PRIN) IMAGO --- Index Medii Aevi Geographiae Operum --- (2020-2023) aims to provide a systematic overview of the medieval and renaissance Latin geographical literature using the Semantic Web technologies and the LOD paradigm. Indeed, until now, this literature has not been studied using digital methods. In particular, this article presents how we formally represented the knowledge about the toponyms, or place names, in the IMAGO ontology. To maximise the interoperability, we developed the IMAGO ontology as an extension of two reference vocabularies: the CIDOC CRM and its extension FRBRoo, including its in-progress reformulation, LRMoo. Furthermore, we used Wikidata as reference knowledge base. As case study, we chose to represent the knowledge related to the toponyms cited by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri in his Latin works. We carried out a first experiment for visualising the knowledge about these toponyms on a map and in the form of tables and CSV files.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning (DL) has achieved impressive successes in many application domains, including Handwritten-Text Recognition. However, DL methods demand a long training process and a huge amount of human-based labeled data. To address these issues, we explore several label-free heuristics for detecting the early-stopping point in training convolutional-neural networks: (1) Cumulative Distribution of the standard deviation of kernel weights (SKW) ; (2) the moving standard deviation of SKW, and (3) the standard deviation of the sum of weights over a window in the epoch series. We applied the proposed methods to the common RIMES and Bentham data sets as well as another highly challenging historical data set. In comparison with the usual stopping criterion which uses labels for validation, the label-free heuristics are at least 10 times faster per epoch when the same training set is used. The use of alternative stopping heuristics may require additional epochs, however, they never require the original computing time. The character error rate (%) on the test set of the label-free heuristics is about a percentage point less in comparison to the usual stopping criterion. The label-free early-stopping methods have two benefits: They do not require a computationally intensive evaluation of a validation set per epoch and all labels can be used for training, specifically benefitting the underrepresented word or letter classes.",

Furthermore, the effect of different muqarnas configurations on acoustic quality of the interior space has been tested via optimisation simulations. With the use of optimisation model, a form of parametric muqarnas in the selected interior space was optimised according to the acoustic objectives. The optimisation tests were conducted with the objectives of increasing C 50 (Clarity), C 80, Reverberation Time (RT), Speech Transmission Index (STI), and decreasing RT.

    "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) provides curators with the tools to design immersive 3D exhibition spaces. However, manually positioning artworks in VR is labor-intensive, and most existing automated methods are limited in considering both artwork content and spatial characteristics, as well as accommodating curators’ design preferences. To address these challenges, we present a virtual exhibition authoring system that automatically generates optimized artwork placements for thematic space layouts, where exhibits are grouped by conceptual themes and arranged as clusters. Our approach clusters artworks based on five content similarity factors—color, material, description, artist, and production date—and allows curators to adjust the importance of each factor and set limits on cluster sizes according to their design goals. A genetic optimization algorithm is employed to determine the placement of artworks, using four cost functions—intra-cluster distance, inter-cluster distance, intra-cluster intervisibility, and occupancy—to evaluate the arrangement with respect to spatial characteristics. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a series of practical scenarios and an expert evaluation with curators.",

The knowledge graph is also gradually applied as a particular data structure in the cultural area. Based on the domain knowledge graph data of the Beijing Municipal Social Science Project “Mining and Utilization of Cultural Resources in the Ancient Capital of Beijing,” this article proposes a graph representation learning model CR-TransR that integrates cultural attributes. Through the analysis of the data in the cultural field of the ancient capital of Beijing, a cultural feature dictionary is constructed, and a domain-specific feature matrix is constructed in the form of word vector splicing. The feature matrix is used to constrain the embedding graph model TransR, and then the feature matrix and the TransR model are jointly trained to complete the embedded expression of the knowledge graph. Finally, a comparative experiment is carried out on the Beijing ancient capital cultural knowledge graph dataset and the effects of the classic graph embedding algorithms TransE, TransH, and TransR. At the same time, we try to reproduce the embedding method with the core idea of neighbor node information aggregation as the core idea, and CRTransR are compared. The experimental tasks include link prediction and triplet classification, and the experimental results show that the CRTransR model performs better.",

    "abstract": "Many Western-style paintings by Japanese artists in the early 1900s, though maintaining a unique quality, were greatly inspired by the works of Western artists. In this article, we employ machine learning to identify relationships and classify the works of Japanese and Western artists. The relationships are of significant interest to numerous art historians, as they can reveal how Western art was introduced to Japan. Historically, art historians have manually annotated these correspondences, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this article, we introduce a new method for finding correspondences between related artworks by comparing their overall outline information. This technique is based on Siamese neural networks (SNNs) and a self-supervised learning approach. Additionally, we have compiled a dataset of illustrations from Japanese artists such as Seiki Kuroda and Western artists such as Raphaël Collin, complete with correspondence annotations. However, to exhibit the unique quality of works by Japanese artists, we demonstrate that machine learning can classify between artworks created by Japanese artists and those created by Western artists.",

    "abstract": "As digital cultural collections become increasingly sophisticated in their scope and functionality, there is a need to build an in-depth understanding concerning the information behaviors of users in this new domain. Research has demonstrated that many digital museum visitors are engaged in casual leisure during exploration of a collection, suggesting that they do not have an inherent information goal but rather seek new experiences or learning opportunities based on personal curiosity and moments of discovery. Consequently, understanding how to translate casual leisure contexts into meaningful interaction design may play a critical role in designing engaging digital collections. Our study reports on the user experience of a largely unexplored user interface design framework called rich-prospect , which was originally developed to enhance browsing and discovery for complex visual collections. We performed a mixed-method, within-subjects study (N=30) that simulated a casual leisure approach to information browsing and retrieval across three different rich-prospect interfaces for digital cultural heritage. Our results show that rich-prospect scores well in the hedonic facets of its user experience, whereas pragmatic aspects have room for improvement. Additionally, through our qualitative analysis of participant feedback, we derived salient themes relating to the exploratory browsing experience. We conclude with a series of design implications to better connect interactive elements with casual leisure contexts for digital cultural collections.",

Specifically, the article deals with paintings that initially decorated the internal walls of the highest floor of a building, called “Xeste 3”, at Akrotiri of the Greek island of Thera circa. 1650 B.C. It is argued that these wall-paintings could had been drawn while the brush was guided by an apparatus, which corresponds to advanced for the era of geometric prototypes with impressive precision. A set of assumptions concerning the actions the artists might have taken in order to create the spiral themes is stated and supported. These assumptions refer to the existence of a draft plan, the sequence of brush strokes, the placement of the brush on the wall, as well as the possible form of the apparatus. These conjectures are evaluated and tested by means of curve fitting and image analysis methods developed by the authors. The results indicate that all drawn contour parts optimally fit along a single prototype linear spiral with fitting error of less than 0.4mm, supporting existence of a very advanced culture for the era of geometric guide. It is statistically rejected that this guide could have the form of a stamp. Moreover, there is strong evidence that the painter might have used a draft plan of the spiral themes to prepare the final drawing and that the linear spiral guide has been used by alternating its placements in order to form the internal and external spiral contour.",

Nevertheless, to provide access to and enable the creative use of this content, it is necessary to address the challenges to its access. These include the automatic enrichment of 3D content with suitable metadata so that content does not get lost. To address these challenges, this article presents research on developing technologies to support the organization and discoverability of 3D content in the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain. This research takes advantage of the fact that heritage artifacts have been designed throughout the centuries with distinctive design styles. Hence, the shape and the decoration of an artifact can provide significant information on the history of the artifact. The main contributions of this article include an ontology for documenting 3D representations of heritage artifacts decorated with ornaments such as architectural mouldings. In addition, the article presents a complementary shape retrieval method based on shape saliency to improve the automatic classification of the artifact’s semantic information based on its 3D shape. This method is tested on a collection of Regency ornament mouldings found in domestic interiors. This content provides a rich dataset on which to base the exploration of issues common to many CH artifacts, such as design styles and decorative ornament.",

Text classification is a promising alternative now that the records themselves are machine readable. In this study, the performance of traditional text classification techniques was compared to newer natural language processing technologies in a series of experiments using authentic records data. While the latest Transformer language models showed superior classification skill, traditional methods still perform well. These results were discussed by a focus group of record managers, who believe that text classification can help them manage risk and meet compliance obligations.

    "abstract": "Epistolary data about historical letters are typically distributed in different archives depending on where the letters were sent to and received, and the data are represented using local heterogeneous data models and different natural languages. To study such letter data on a global level, the heterogeneous, distributed data in local siloes need to be aggregated and harmonized into larger services where local metadata can enrich each other to complement missing information. This article presents a new framework, LetterSampo, for representing, publishing, and using epistolary data as Linked Open Data (LOD) on the Web for Digital Humanities (DH) research. The framework is used for creating LOD services and for building individual LetterSampo portals on top of them. To test and demonstrate the framework, it has been applied to the epistolary CKCC dataset of ca. 20,000 letters of the Huygens Institute, the Netherlands, to the correspSearch dataset of ca. 151,000 letters aggregated by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and to the Early Modern Letters Online (EMLO) data of ca. 170,000 letters published by the University of Oxford. The CKCC and correspSearch datasets were published as LOD services, SPARQL endpoints, and as data dumps at Zenodo.org for re-use, and a demonstrational portal LetterSampo: Historical Letters on the Semantic Web was created based on this data. A novelty of the LetterSampo portals is to use faceted semantic search for filtering data of interest in flexible ways from multiple perspectives on two conceptual levels, and then visualize and analyze the results and data by seamlessly integrated data analytic tools—programming skills are not needed for using the portal. In addition to using the tools of the portal, the SPARQL endpoints can be used with modest knowledge about programming for DH research.",

This system aims to simplify the use of augmented reality by allowing (non-computer) users to define content and place it in 3D around an artwork. VISIT is composed of two main generic elements with respect to historical or artistic content: a Web interface allows to represent in a cloud all the necessary information (sites, areas, artworks, media) to define the augmented reality content that visitors will see. Its use is simple and accessible to non-computer specialists and does not require additional software development or special hardware. A mobile augmented reality application under Android will use this content and deliver it to the visitor on his/her smartphone. The application automatically detects the presence of the artworks and then places the 3D content as specified in the Web interface. The visitors can choose the elements that interest them. The user’s actions are recorded and allow site managers to analyze their behavior. VISIT is operational and we tested it in the context of a large-scale exhibition at the Château d’Azay-Le-Rideau in France.

    "abstract": "Investigating the intangible nature of a cultural domain can take multiple forms, addressing, for example, the aesthetic, epistemic, and social dimensions of its phenomenology. The context of Southern Chinese martial arts is of particular significance, as it carries immaterial components of all these aspects: The technical and stylistic framework of a martial art system; the imagery associated to movements; and the transmission of knowledge orally, practically, or through influence, are but examples of intangible characteristics that can and should be captured, not unlike cultural artifacts. The latter case—the one of formalizing cultural influence through its various forms of evidenceis emblematic as well as largely untrodden ground. A previous attempt at detecting cultural influence computationally was made in the context of Roman archaeology, though the binding of that early effort with the domain model was tight; also, there has hardly been any prior dedicated effort to model the martial arts domain through ontologies. In this article, we present the realization of the full cycle of a computational approach to investigating cultural contact in Southern Chinese martial arts. The entire approach is predicated upon the usage of standards and techniques of the Semantic Web and formal knowledge. Starting from a modular domain ontology, which models martial arts independently of the goal of capturing cultural influence, we perform knowledge extraction from archival material from the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive and generate a dataset of the results modeled after said ontology. Then, we combine the resulting knowledge base with a rule model that represents ways to infer knowledge of potential contact between cultures based on the evidence present in the knowledge base. The results offer an insight into how an inference-based computational model can be applied to detect interesting facts even in the as-yet underexplored domain of intangible cultural heritage. The implemented workflow shows that the full-cycle employment of semantic technologies can offer the ground truth required for largely different approaches, such as statistical and machine learning ones, to operate.",

A major part of the project has been the design of computational techniques to provide the project’s museum studies experts with appropriate data and tools for undertaking this research, leveraging web analytics, natural language processing and machine learning. In this methodological contribution, firstly, we developed techniques to retrieve and identify museum official websites and social media accounts (Facebook and Twitter now X). This supported the automated capture of large-scale online data about the entire UK museum sector. Secondly, we harnessed convolutional neural networks to extract activity indicators from unstructured text to detect museum behaviours, including openings, closures, fundraising and staffing.

This article focuses on the mediating role of digital screens in the museum space, examining visitors’ activity and experience through their encounters with touchscreens at the Frederic Chopin's Museum in Warsaw, Poland. This article presents and makes use of a recent approach in the philosophy of technology, initiated by the American philosopher Don Ihde, called postphenomenology, as well as the theory of affordances. By conducting observations and interviews with museum visitors, the study shows that touchscreens, and digital technologies themselves, are not only functional but also shape the visitor's perception and expectations.

    "abstract": "This study examines the longstanding need and challenge of providing contextual analysis of historical images stored in digital visual archives and the accessibility of retrieving contextual information from these historical archives. Contextual analysis is essential for disciplines such as history and art history, as it allows for the contextualization of artwork and historical sources with historical narratives, which, in turn, enhances understanding of the artistic or political expression in the contents of cultural products. To address this challenge, a novel approach is proposed utilizing computer vision to trace the circulation and dissemination of historical photographs in their original contexts. This method involves first using YOLO v7 to crop historical images from pictorial magazines, then training machine learning models on the cropped printed images plus another large dataset of original historical photographs, and comparing the similarity of images between the datasets of printed images and original photographs. To ensure accuracy of image similarities between the two subsets with distinct image qualities, an ensemble of three machine learning models—Vision Transformer, EfficientNetv2, and Swin Transformer—was developed. Through this system, contexts in the circulation of historical photographs were discovered and new insights regarding the editing strategies of propaganda magazines in East Asia during WWII were uncovered. These outcomes offer supporting evidence for previous research in the history and art historical disciplines, and demonstrate the potential of computer vision for uncovering new information from digital visual archives. Our model achieves a 77.8% top-15 retrieval accuracy on our evaluation dataset.",

    "abstract": "Manora or Nora has been added to the heritage list of UNESCO as Thailand's intangible cultural heritage since 2021. This performance has been presented as a regional form of entertainment and traditionally passed down through generations within certain families. Nowadays, young people are able to learn and practice Manora instructed by their masters or their successors. However, there is currently no digital content of Manora that could support awareness and enrichment of cultural safeguarding, so this article proposes the design and development of a mobile 3D game representing Manora, which is Southern Thai dance-drama performing art. The aim of this game is to increase citizens’ engagement with their intangible cultural heritage and preservation by delivering novel digital heritage content specifically designed for a role-playing mobile game called Nara. The Nara game is used to enhance the perception of Manora dance and provide new experience of playing a culture-based game through costume and its material items. The game design process takes Manora's significant identities, including the costume, dance postures, and music along with players’ requirements to create a game player character, non-player characters, storytelling, challenges, and level design. The development of the game is done on Unity game engine, which provides a mobile 3D game platform to integrate all the designed content and generate the interactive Nara game. The experimentation results conclude that utilizing the unique identity of Manora in gameplay successfully enhances the audience's experience and recognition. This result indicates the effective use of creativity and interactive multimedia technology to create attractive content and enjoyment that can encourage intangible cultural heritage preservation in an innovative manner.",

Historic house museums often hold back on utilizing digital communication tools inside the houses, since a central purpose of this type of museum is to preserve an original environment. Digital communication tools, however, hold great potential for facilitating rich encounters with cultural heritage and in particular with the immaterial aspects of museum collections and their histories. In this article, we present our design steps and choices, aiming at subtly and seamlessly adding a digital dimension to a historic house. Based on qualitative interviews, we evaluate how the sound installation at Bakkehuset is sensed, interpreted, and used by visitors as part of their museum experience. In turn, we shed light on the historic house museum as a distinct design context for designing hybrid visitor experiences and point to the potentials of digital communication tools in this context.",

Our procedural approach, therefore, captures the style differences of Second Empire houses with a relatively few number of parameters. Using our interface, we are able to generate virtual houses in a wide variety of styles of American Second Empire architecture. We have also developed a method to break up these virtual models into slices in order to efficiently and economically 3D-print them. Using this method, we have printed miniatures of two landmark buildings in Savannah, GA and Baltimore, MD: The Hamilton-Turner Inn and Enoch Pratt House, respectively. We observe that the virtual models still provide more details because of the limited resolution of the 3D printing process as shown in Figures 1 and 2.",

    "abstract": "Historical archives represent an immense wealth, the potential of which is endangered by the lack of effective management and access tools. We believe that this issue can be faced by providing archive catalogs with a semantic layer , containing rich semantic metadata, representing the content of documents in a full-fledged formal machine-readable format. In this article, we present the contribution offered in this direction by the PRiSMHA project , in which the conceptual vocabulary of the semantic layer is represented by computational ontologies. However, acquiring semantic knowledge represents a well-known bottleneck for knowledge-based systems; to solve this problem, PRiSMHA relies on a crowdsourcing collaborative model , i.e., an online community of users who collaborate in building semantic representations of the content of archival documents. In this perspective, this article aims at answering the following research question : Starting from the axioms characterizing concepts in the computational ontology underlying the system, how can we derive a user interface enabling users to formally represent the content of archival documents by exploiting the conceptual vocabulary provided by the ontology? Our solution includes the following steps: (a) a manually defined configuration, acting as a pre-filter, to hide “unsuited” classes, properties, and relations; (b) an algorithm, combining heuristics and reasoning, which extracts from the ontology all and only the “compatible” properties and relations, given an entity (event) type; and (c) a set of strategies to rank, group, and present the entity (event) properties and relations, based on the results of a study with users. This integrated solution enabled us to design an ontology-driven user interface enabling users to characterize entities, and in particular (historical) events, on the basis of the vocabulary provided by the ontology.",

Then the collected photos can be used for an accurate 3D reconstruction of the site of interest. The HeGO platform can be used to implement a social media game, where players get a score for each photo they take and send to the HeGO web server. We also present the case study of the Atina historical center, where we simulated the usage of the HeGO platform for the 3D reconstruction of portions of the urban fabric of its historical center.

Nowadays, information and communication technologies are ubiquitous and pervasive and have greatly promoted the development of cultural tourism. Cultural tourism should utilize these technologies to improve a sense of participation and experience for cultural tourists by sorting out domain-specific cultural knowledge from tourism attractions systematically, building bridges between tourism resources and cultural connotation naturally and presenting the cultural changes behind tourism resources vividly. To the end, we present a complete framework that is suitable to event retrieval of cultural tourism, helping cultural tourists learn culture in all directions and in depth quickly and easily before their cultural tours, and local government create tourism cards through the dissemination of culture connotation as well. Our main inspiration is that story-telling would be an effective form of acceptance by cultural tourists to spread the culture behind tourism resources. Concretely, our framework includes data acquisition and preprocessing, data organization and processing, and data visualization components. The data acquisition and preprocessing component is responsible for collecting historical event texts and fusing text knowledge. The data organization and processing component enables an intuitive view on properties and relations of the event elements in terms of defined event ontology for cultural tourism and supports event semantic retrieval. The data visualization component provides a knowledge navigation through dynamic display and an interactive interface with modification function. We have conducted event semantic retrieval of Minnan culture and verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the framework.",

    "abstract": "Digital games have been used in the context of a cultural experience for several reasons, from learning to socialising and having fun. As a positive side effect, using digital games in a GLAM environment contributes to increasing the visitors’ engagement and making the collections more popular. Along this line, we present in this article an online game for museum environments that serves two goals: asking users to engage with the artworks in a collection in a playful environment, and collecting their feedback on artwork similarity, which may be used by curators to rethink the organisation of digital exhibitions and in general to better understand how visitors perceive artworks. The game is called PAGANS ( Playful Art: a GAme oN Similarity ), and is designed to collect similarity judgements about artworks. The software was implemented following some principles of gamification in order to quickly leverage similarity information in the cultural heritage domain while increasing user engagement and fun. The game, involving pairs of players, was used during two large public events to collect different data about the players’ behaviour and to investigate how these dimensions correlate with aesthetic perception. A thorough statistical analysis shows that age and (self-declared) gender correlates with the time and the number of moves needed to complete a session. These dimensions also link to the relevance of colour and shape in judging similarity. These findings suggest that, although artwork similarity is very subjective and may vary based on a person’s background, some trends can be identified when considering the subjects’ gender and age. This could have some practical implications; for example, it could be used to support art curators in creating digital exhibitions by grouping artworks in novel, user-centred ways.",

    "abstract": "Iconography in art is the discipline that studies the visual content of artworks to determine their motifs and themes and to characterize the way these are represented. It is a subject of active research for a variety of purposes, including the interpretation of meaning, the investigation of the origin and diffusion in time and space of representations, and the study of influences across artists and artworks. With the proliferation of digital archives of art images, the possibility arises of applying Computer Vision techniques to the analysis of art images at an unprecedented scale, which may support iconography research and education. In this article, we introduce a novel paintings dataset for iconography classification and present the quantitative and qualitative results of applying a Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) classifier to the recognition of the iconography of artworks. The proposed classifier achieves good performances (71.17% Precision, 70.89% Recall, 70.25% F1-Score, and 72.73% Average Precision) in the task of identifying saints in Christian religious paintings, a task made difficult by the presence of classes with very similar visual features. Qualitative analysis of the results shows that the CNN focuses on the traditional iconic motifs that characterize the representation of each saint and exploits such hints to attain correct identification. The ultimate goal of our work is to enable the automatic extraction, decomposition, and comparison of iconography elements to support iconographic studies and automatic artwork annotation.",

    "abstract": "We describe a common problem in the curation and analysis of archaeological materials: restoring the orientation and dimensions of damaged objects. Our focus is a common architectural type in Mediterranean sites, the Doric column drum, which we investigate at one of the earliest Doric temples in the Greek world, the Hera temple at Olympia. The 3D modeling and analysis of this building by the Digital Architecture Project since 2013 has revealed new insights into the construction history of its stone colonnades. This paper concerns the analysis of the 3D models of the in situ material, using the almost 100 fallen drums and capitals to reconstruct the colonnade digitally. In order to accomplish this, we propose two novel methods for training the machine to estimate the dimensions of a fragmentary column drum. One approach is a modification of ICP, where the fragment is compared to an ideal model of an intact drum, which is resized iteratively until concluding with a satisfactory fit. Another approach recasts the scan data into polar coordinates and uses RANSAC to identify the exterior profiles of the piece and remove points likely to belong to damaged areas. The filtered points are then examined by the algorithm to estimate the radii and taper of the drum. Besides saving a great deal of time in the field, these methods are also accurate to within 0.2% of the total radius for well-preserved material, and 1% for even the most fragmentary drums at Olympia. These data have allowed the digital reconstruction of 80% of the displaced drums and all of the capitals from the temple. Our algorithms can be used to measure any fluted column drums, and we discuss the potential value of our approach for other categories of archaeological artifacts.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we address the problem of 3D inpainting using an exemplar-based method for point clouds. 3D inpainting is a process of filling holes or missing regions in the reconstructed 3D models. Typically, inpainting methods addressed in the literature fill missing regions due to occlusions or inaccurate scanning of 3D models. However, we focus on scenarios involving naturally existing damaged models, which are partly broken or incomplete in the artifacts at cultural heritage sites. We propose an exemplar-based inpainting technique using the region of interest (ROI)-based method to inpaint the missing regions of the damaged model. The ROI of a 3D model is represented as a set of Riemannian manifolds, and metric tensor and Christoffel symbols are used as geometric features to capture the inherent geometry. We then decompose the ROI into basic shape regions, namely, spherical, conical, and cylindrical components, and identify the best-fit match for inpainting. Instead of using a single similar exemplar for inpainting, we select the most relevant best-fit region to fill the missing region from the basic shape regions library obtained from n similar exemplars. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed inpainting method on artifacts at UNESCO World Heritage site Hampi temples, India with varying complexities and sizes for both synthetically generated holes and real missing regions in 3D objects.",

In classical scientific literature, the structural features and mineralogical composition of pottery are carried out on thin sections by means of transmitted polarized light microscope. The determination were obtained through observations with and without cross polarizator (nicols). The quantitative measurements are normally achieved with tedious and time consuming table with point counter. In this article the attention has been focused on the automatic identification of structural and textural components of the potteries through optical microscopy. Image analysis techniques have been then used to automatically classify the image components. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach: petrographic data collection becomes faster with respect to the traditional method providing also quantitative information useful for fabric recognition.",

    "abstract": "Today’s information society needs efficient and economic solutions for the digital restoration of the photographic heritage. Different methods have been adopted up to now for the automatic detection of dust and scratches; each method has pros and cons, and a limited field of effectiveness. The use of infrared radiation and the spatiotemporal image analysis are among the most effective methods, although they have their limits. The infrared radiation only works for dye-based material, while the spatiotemporal image analysis is not applicable for still images and is limited due to motion in the scene. The present work defines in detail a set of methods for optical dust and scratches detection applicable on any type of transparent photographic material (silver-based as well as dye-based material, still images as well as moving images). The term “optical” refers to the fact that the considered methods seek physical evidence of the presence of foreign bodies or irregularities on the film; this allows avoiding the typical digital artifacts produced by “nonoptical” methods, for which certain elements of the scenes are erroneously obliterated because they resemble dust grains or scratches. “PDD” (Polarized Dark-field Detection) detects the flaws using an image acquired in a polarized dark-field setup; “DCD” (Dual Collimation Detection) takes advantage of the Callier effect to locate the flaws; “ n -MDD” (Multiple Direction Detection) entails the acquisition of n images in dark-field setups with different directions of illumination, and the extraction of the differences between the images through multivariate analysis. A numerical evaluation of the performances of the MDD method with an eightfold acquisition (8-MDD) is carried out by comparing its flaw detection with the flaw detection provided by commercial software based on spatiotemporal image analysis.",

    "abstract": "Despite their temporal proximity, the technologies of the early computers are far from us. Yet, they are part of the history of science and technology, and they deserve to be studied and popularized. Being machines made to run software programs, they should be exhibited running. Unfortunately, old machines still in working condition are extremely rare. Restoring or rebuilding an old computer is a hard, expensive task: the original components are rare, and the technology is forgotten and sometimes lost. The research needed to re-understand those computers has to adopt experimental archaeology methods: rebuilding old hardware/software requires proceeding by hypotheses and experiments. However, a rebuilt or restored computer is a unique exemplar and a precious specimen: it is not suitable to let people interact with it. A more flexible solution is to use software simulations. First of all, simulation is a valuable tool to carry out the experiments needed to study past technology. Second, the simulators are virtual replicas that let people fully understand the old machines by interacting with them without jeopardizing those precious relics of the past. This article presents the virtual rebuilding of the first computer made in Italy: the Macchina Ridotta (MR) of the University of Pisa. The MR was dismantled after few months of intensive usage to cannibalize the materials for a second computer. As a consequence, the MR disappeared from later chronicles and for many years was ignored by historians. When we attempted to reconstruct the MR history, we found that the survived documentation was far from complete. Simulation proved to be the key tool to support the experimental approach adopted for understanding the MR technology, rebuilding it, and assessing its achievements. The MR simulator is now used at the Museum of Computing Machinery of Pisa as a mean to truly experience a working session on the MR—a typical computer from the 1950s. The exhibit and the workshops, by exploiting the accurately reproduced characteristics of the MR, address popularization of computer science from several perspectives: from technological mechanisms to scientific foundations, passing through the representation of computers in popular culture.",

    "abstract": "Studying Greek and Latin cultural heritage has always been considered essential to the understanding of important aspects of the roots of current European societies. However, only a small fraction of the total production of texts from ancient Greece and Rome has survived up to the present, leaving many gaps in the historiographic records. Epigraphy, which is the study of inscriptions (epigraphs), helps to fill these gaps. In particular, the goal of epigraphy is to clarify the meanings of epigraphs; to classify their uses according to their dating and cultural contexts; and to study aspects of the writing, the writers, and their “consumers.” Although several research projects have recently been promoted for digitally storing and retrieving data and metadata about epigraphs, there has actually been no attempt to apply data mining technologies to discover previously unknown cultural aspects. In this context, we propose to exploit the temporal dimension associated with epigraphs (dating) by applying a data mining method for novelty detection. The main goal is to discover relational novelty patterns—that is, patterns expressed as logical clauses describing significant variations (in frequency) over the different epochs, in terms of relevant features such as language, writing style, and material. As a case study, we considered the set of Inscriptiones Christianae Vrbis Romae stored in Epigraphic Database Bari, an epigraphic repository. Some patterns discovered by the data mining method were easily deciphered by experts since they captured relevant cultural changes, whereas others disclosed unexpected variations, which might be used to formulate new questions, thus expanding the research opportunities in the field of epigraphy.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the outstanding performance of sparse representation (SR) in a variety of image/video relevant classification and identification tasks, we propose an adaptive SR method for painting style analysis. Significantly improved over previous SR-based methods, which heavily rely on the comparison of query paintings, our method is able to authenticate or classify a single query painting based on the estimated decision boundary. Specifically, discriminative patches containing the most representative characteristics of the given samples are first extracted via exploiting the statistics of their representations on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis. Then, the strategy of adaptive sparsity constraint is enforced to make the dictionary trained on such patches more adaptive to the training samples than via previous SR techniques. Applying the learned dictionary, the query painting can be authenticated if both better denoising performance and higher kurtosis are obtained compared to the baseline estimated via applying the DCT basis; otherwise, it should be denied. Extensive experiments on our dataset comprised of paintings from van Gogh, his contemporaries, the Wacker forgery, and Monet demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

Formal ontologies allow structuring and integrating information from heterogeneous sources without loss of semantic information. In the field of Cultural Heritage (CH), the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) ontology is well known and widely accepted as it provides definitions and a formal structure to describe the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in the CH documentation. One of its extensions, the CRMba model, has been specifically designed to document information on a built structure and its components. In this work, we have applied the CRMba model to the documentation of Roman architectures, in particular, Roman amphitheatres, demonstrating how the semantic model allows encoding information about the structure of the building and its evolution over time and space, stressing on the concepts of “empty spaces” and “functional spaces” defined by form, and focusing on the relationship between form and function. The aim of the work is to explore the potentiality of the model and to provide, through a series of examples supported by graphs, standard encoding procedures to be reused by scholars dealing with similar case studies.",

    "abstract": "Three-voiced funeral songs from Svaneti in North-West Georgia (also referred to as Zär) are believed to represent one of Georgia’s oldest preserved forms of collective music-making. Throughout a Zär performance, the singers often jointly and intentionally drift upwards in pitch. Furthermore, the singers tend to use pitch slides at the beginning and end of sung notes. Musicological studies on tonal analysis or transcription have to account for such musical peculiarities, e.g., by compensating for pitch drifts or identifying stable note events (located between pitch slides). These tasks typically require labor-intensive annotation processes with manual corrections executed by experts with domain knowledge. For instance, in the context of a previous musicological study on pitch inventories (or pitch-class histograms) of Zär performances, ethnomusicologists tediously annotated fundamental frequency (F0) trajectories, stable note events, and pitch drifts for a set of 11 multitrack field recordings. In this article, we study how musicological studies on field recordings can benefit from interactive computational tools that support such annotation processes. As one contribution of this article, we compile a dataset from the previously annotated audio material, which we release under an open-source license for research purposes. As a second contribution, we introduce two computational tools for removing pitch slides and compensating pitch drifts in performances. Our tools were developed in close collaboration with ethnomusicologists and allow for incorporating domain knowledge (e.g., on singing styles or musically relevant harmonic intervals) in the different processing steps. In a case study using our Zär dataset, we evaluate our tools by reproducing the pitch inventories from the original musicological study and subsequently discuss the potential of computer-assisted approaches for interdisciplinary research.",

Based on factors such as propagation force, guiding force, and influence, this article crawled 78,140 pieces multi-source heterogeneous of nine Altmetrics index data from Sina Weibo, Baidu, Sogou, Bilibili, and other platforms, constructs the evaluation index system of public culture network communication effect under the background of new media, and quantifies and analyzes the network communication effect of red public culture in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. On this basis, the time-series evolution of communication effect is modeled and analyzed, and the law of communication is found systematically. The study finds that the communicating effect of red public culture varies significantly and has a large room for improvement overall; the communicating effect improves steadily with seasonal changes, and the communicating effect in summer and autumn is better than the other two seasons; the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (1,1,1) model can better present the dynamic changes of cultural communication system after the first-order difference of the time-series data. This article innovatively embeds the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei red culture in the public cultural construction system and research system, and a comprehensive communication effect evaluation index system is constructed to measure the effect of public culture network communication under the background of new media and analyze its dynamic evolution.",

Using ceramics as an example, we tracked the eye movement of subjects under different display forms and tested whether they obtained the relevant information. Experiment 1 (N = 48) adopted a 2 (integrated/separate display) × 2 (with/without background information) design and Experiment 2 (N = 93) investigated distinct types of annotation (no annotation, indicative/direct/picture/contour shape annotation). We found that the following. (1) In the segmented relic display, the usage time, fixation count, and total fixation duration of relic names were lower than those in the integrated case. The probability that subjects would learn comparatively was also lower in the separate display. However, the performance on retention or transfer tests did not differ depending on the integrated/separate display. After reading the background information, subjects paid less attention to relic names but had better knowledge transfer performance. (2) The viewers’ attention allocation to the materials was not significantly influenced by the annotations. Mere visual annotations did not provide an advantage for information acquisition. By contrast, indicative verbal annotation required relatively more time for better target information memory, and the direct verbal cue consumed the least time. Based on the results, we discussed the application scenario of multimedia learning principles and potential recommendations for designing online relic displays.",

    "abstract": "Archives Portal Europe (APE, www.archivesportaleurope.net ) is the portal of European archives, an aggregator that connects on a single research point the catalogues and digitised archival material of all archives in and about Europe. It currently hosts material from more than 30 countries and from a variety of archival institutions (such as State archives, city archives, university and parish archives, private institutions, and more). It is maintained by the Archives Portal Europe Foundation, an international consortium of State archives and other archival institutions that aim to connect the archival material of single institutions into one digital repository to allow universal access to the archival heritage of Europe, promoting new forms of archival research beyond national or local boundaries. One of the research tools made available by Archives Portal Europe is by topics; however, these are currently maintained manually by the archivists, and the vast amount of archival material ingested in the portal makes it impossible to have a comprehensive body of topics that describe the whole of the APE repository. Archives are traditionally not organised by their subject content, but around the entity (person, organization, body) that created and/or collected the documents in the course of their activities. While this is an undisputed pillar of archival management, the availability of online digital repositories for archival research requires new tools for digital archival research, particularly when different archival traditions from different countries and different types of institutions are merged into a unique research portal. Topic detection becomes a fundamental tool to guide archival research and to allow archives to be accessible to potentially world-wide users in a situation where national and linguistics barriers blur or are re-defined. This article presents the preliminary results and plan for future iterations of an AI tool for automated topic detection in a multi- lingual environment, where human-created taxonomies act as bases for the algorithms to aggregate relevant material around a specific topic. The development is based on supervised machine learning, with a combination of human inputs in different languages, and of the usage of Wikipedia pages to model the relevant vocabulary and entities.",

    "abstract": "Weathering effects caused by physical, chemical, or biological processes result in visible damage that alters the appearance of stones’ surfaces. Consequently, weathered stone monuments can offer a distorted perception of the artworks to the point of making their interpretation misleading. Being able to detect and monitor decay is crucial for restorers and curators to perform important tasks, such as identifying missing parts, assessing the preservation state, or evaluating curating strategies. Decay mapping, the process of identifying weathered zones of artworks, is essential for preservation and research projects. This is usually carried out by marking the affected parts of the monument on a two-dimensional (2D) drawing or picture of it. One of the main problems of this methodology is that it is manual work based only on experts’ observations. This makes the process slow and often results in disparities between the mappings of the same monument made by different experts. In this article, we focus on the weathering effect known as “scaling,” following the International Council on Monuments and Sites, International Scientific Committee for Stone (ICOMOS ISCS) definition. We present a novel technique for detecting, segmenting, and classifying these effects on stone monuments. Our method is user-friendly, requiring minimal user input. By analyzing 3D reconstructed data considering geometry and appearance, the method identifies scaling features and segments weathered regions, classifying them by scaling subtype. It shows improvements over previous approaches and is well received by experts, representing a significant step toward objective stone decay mapping.",

    "abstract": "An important challenge of Digital Cultural Heritage is to contribute to the recovery of artworks with their original shape and appearance. Many altarpieces, which are very relevant Christian art elements, have been damaged and/or partly or fully lost. Therefore, the only way to recover them is to carry out their digital reconstruction. Although the procedure that we present here is valid for any altarpiece with similar characteristics, and even for other akin elements, our test bench is the altarpieces that were damaged or destroyed or that disappeared during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) in Catalonia, where most suffered these effects. The first step of our work has been the classification of these artworks into different categories on the basis of their degree of destruction and of the available visual information related to each one. This article proposes, for the first time to our knowledge, a workflow for the virtual reconstruction, through photogrammetry, digital modeling, and digital color restoration, of whole altarpieces partially preserved with very little visual information. Our case study is the Rosary’s altarpiece of Sant Pere Màrtir de Manresa church. Currently, this altarpiece is partially preserved in fragments in the Museu Comarcal de Manresa (Spain). But it cannot be reassembled physically owing to the lack of space (actually the church does not exist anymore) and the cost of such an operation. Thus, there is no other solution than the digital one to contemplate and study the altarpiece as a whole. The reconstruction that we provide allows art historians and the general public to virtually see the altarpiece complete and assembled as it was until 1936. The results obtained also allow us to see in detail the reliefs and ornaments of the altarpiece with their digitally restored color.",

Our analysis shows that, while these techniques make important first steps towards XAI, more work remains to be done to provide tools that can be profitably integrated into the workflows of scholars.",

    "abstract": "There are a large number of rammed earthen sites in northwest China. For thousands of years, earthen sites have developed a series of deterioration types that include surface weathering, sapping, cracks, collapses, gullies, and so on. Surface weathering is a highly destructive type of soil deterioration which erodes the sites all the time. Flake peeling (flaking) is one of the main manifestations of weathering. In order to prevent flaking more scientifically and efficiently, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate its development stage and degree. In this article, the Vajra Pagoda of Jiaohe Ruins was selected as the research area, and we explored how to use GIS to analyze the surface topography of 3D scanning data. Meanwhile, using the sequential minimum optimization (SMO) algorithm, the authors effectively identify the crust and original wall (wall outcroppings following the detachment of crust) in the evolution of flaking. Finally, the 3D roughness of the four facades was calculated. The calculations show that the roughness parameters D and R s can well characterize the development of flaking. In a period of flaking development, the change rule of D and R s first increases and then decreases. This study proves that it is feasible to quantify the development degree of flaking employing morphological characteristic parameters. Furthermore, the results of the study provide a basis for determining the degree of deterioration of the sites in future heritage management efforts, leading to more rational and efficient conservation.",

Object identification is a well researched problem for modern photographs, however, for historical material annotations are often necessary. We present a solution for finding objects without manual work. The method consists of a style transfer of images from the COCO dataset into the domain using CycleGAN and training with items obtained through pseudo labelling on the original and the additional transferred COCO images. Different strategies to assemble the dataset are compared. The best method obtains a F1 score of 0.58 for 15 object types without any labelling.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a literature review on the domain of dance research that exploits ontology artifacts to manage their domain knowledge. Any dance form around the world is rich in knowledge because of its historical and geographical diversity, movement rules, and interpretive aspects. Researchers found various approaches to manage this knowledge base, among which the ontology development process is preferred by most people owing to its superficial and easy-to-manage characteristics. However, the heterogenic use of ontology in different dance research aspects demands an organized study to understand its contributions to the domain. Our survey approach towards this objective starts with a systematic literature selection and further grouping them into four categories based on ontology involvement. Second, we discuss each group of articles by their contributions and the level of ontology involvement. Third, a novel evaluation framework is proposed, which assesses each selected article based on nineteen attributes from ontology quality, development, and applications perspectives. We rank each article into three qualitative measures, i.e., High(H), Medium(M), and Low(L), for our attribute set based on our understanding. Finally, We comprehensively analyze the outcomes of our qualitative assessment to present the current research status and their limitations in the candidate domain. This review aspires to be a cornerstone resource, enlightening researchers about the current landscape and future prospects of ontological involvement in dance research.",

    "abstract": "The collection, detection, and statistical analysis of massive damage information from large cultural heritage sites is an important issue that affects the progress, depth, and quality of cultural heritage protection efforts. The Ming Great Wall of China, known for its vast size, poses a significant challenge to protection efforts. Conventional methods for collecting and recognizing damage information from the wall are nearly impossible due to its scale. The limitation has significantly hindered efforts to safeguard the vulnerable rammed-earth walls of the Ming Great Wall. To address this issue, we developed new technical schemes that combine the efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for low-altitude surveying and mapping with the accuracy of artificial intelligence detection. This enables the efficient collection, detection, and statistical analysis of a massive amount of damage data from the Great Wall sites. The system achieved an average damage detection accuracy of 0.838, as measured by the average precision (AP). Additionally, the system's average effective detection range exceeded 91.5%, while reducing manual labor time by about 95%. These results provide accurate, efficient, and timely data and technical support for efforts such as status investigation, condition evaluation, protection and maintenance, and budgeting for the Great Wall sites. Furthermore, this research proposes a potential approach for gathering and analyzing data from other large-scale cultural heritage sites.",

Urban residents develop close connections with nature, culture, and historical elements through landscape perception behavior in their daily activities, leading to different preferences and value judgments. However, it is still necessary to conduct in-depth research to explore whether there are differences in cultural perception and preferences between historical gardens and newly built parks during residents’ daily visits. To fill these gaps, this research utilized user-generated contents and natural language processing method, focuses on a sample of 40 historical gardens and newly built parks in Suzhou, China, to address the following three research questions: (1) Which elements do park visitors perceive more strongly in historical gardens and new parks?(2) Is there a correlation between the cultural perception preferences and the attributes of the gardens and parks?(3) What are the sentimental preferences of visitors between historical gardens and new parks? The research findings reveal that cultural and aesthetic perception is more pronounced in historical gardens compared to newly built parks, while the latter place greater emphasis on the perception of natural features. Additionally, attribute features of parks, such as area, perimeter, and public transportation facilities, equally impact visitors’ landscape perception. This study distinguished the cultural perception and preference characteristics of urban residents in historical gardens and new parks, providing urban managers and urban green space planning and design professionals with more experience in areas such as the preservation and renovation of urban historical landscapes.",

Since they refer to such different contests, they are a valid test field to bring into the discussion methods and techniques for: — the digitization and interactive representation of multicomponent finds; — a reliable visualization of pictorial works with complex optical behaviors; — a cost-effective, rapid digitization of extensive collections with non-cooperating materials. The article outlines a pipeline from accurate digitization to 3D modeling, texturing, and optimization, culminating in the production of interactive experiences. The aim is the introduction of our experience in authoring high-resolution digital surrogates for scholars and museum visitors, to be explored in museums and cultural institutions through conventional devices or digital interactive kiosks. It emphasizes logistical challenges in photogrammetry for acquiring artifacts, including 3D or 2D objects, paleontological finds, and optically non-cooperating items, with a focus on accurate color acquisition and rendering.

However, the audio is not intended to be background or supplementary informative material. It is a music song that somehow relates to the visual artwork, and the stories tell you how. First, we describe our content creation process along with the design of the mobile application. Then we present the results from a qualitative user study with 15 participants, investigating the role and effects of music over several dimensions: overall experience, user satisfaction, and most notably, cultural engagement. The outcomes of the study reveal the potential of the approach to foster curiosity, capture the user's attention and support a deeper, reflective connection of the user with the combined artworks.

Since CIDOC-CRM is an event-based model, usually we have to follow long paths for answering a question, thereby, the challenge is how to construct the prompt for aiding the LLM to produce the right SPARQL query. We propose and comparatively evaluate methods based on the creation of ontology path patterns of a configurable path radius (or length). Then, we construct a new dedicated benchmark that includes 100 natural questions and the corresponding SPARQL queries over two real KGs from the cultural domain describing artworks. Finally, we present comparative results about the effectiveness and efficiency over the benchmark by using ChatGPT-3.5. The most effective method follows a two-stage process that predicts and uses the most appropriate path patterns of \\(r\\leq 4\\) . This method achieves 3.5 \\(\\times\\) higher accuracy than the baseline method (0.66 versus 0.19), that includes in the prompt only the list of properties and classes of the KG.

    "abstract": "Labanotation is one of the most used systems for notating, analysing, and preserving movement and dance, an important part of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Labanotation consists of a powerful expressive symbolic language for documenting movement with a long history in dance research, history, and anthropology since its introduction by Rudolf von Laban in the beginning of the 20th century. A number of valuable scores in this language are curated in both physical and digital archives throughout the world, describing both traditional dances and works of historical choreographers. Nevertheless, while Labanotation is considered the official language of dance scholars, it is not at all popular among dance educators, students, practitioners, and choreographers. In fact, few people of the dance community are familiar with it. One of the reasons is that it is considered a quite difficult symbolic system with a long learning curve, and practitioners are not easily motivated to learn it. Together with dance experts, we co-designed a movement-based experience in Kinect, based on the principles of playful design, to introduce dance and non-dance experts to Labanotation introductory concepts and symbols. We evaluate the experience with both people that have experience in dance or other movement practices, as well as participants with no expertise in movement or dance. The results show promising findings toward changing the attitude of the participants toward Labanotation, and all participants seemed to memorize or start learning the logic of this symbolic language for movement. We discuss the results of the evaluation on the whole experience and the potential of this symbolic language in the digital environment, as well as the potential and challenges that arise from this experiment based on the background of the participants, the limitation of the applied technology and interaction, as well as feedback on the introduced symbolic language.",

    "abstract": "Original hand drawings by Leonardo are astonishing collections of knowledge, superb representations of the artist's way of working, which proves the technical and cultural peak of the Renaissance era. However, due to their delicate and fragile nature, they are hard to manipulate and compulsory to preserve. To overcome this problem we developed, in a 10-year-long research program, a complete workflow to produce a system able to replace, investigate, describe and communicate ancient fine drawings through what Leonardo calls “ the best sense ” (i.e., the view), the so-called ISLe ( InSightLeonardo ). The outcoming visualization app is targeted to a wide audience made of museum visitors and, most importantly, art historians, scholars, conservators, and restorers. This article describes a specific feature of the workflow: the appearance modeling with the aim of an accurate Real-Time Rendering (RTR) visualization. This development is based on the direct observation of five among the most known Leonardo da Vinci's drawings, spanning his entire activity as a draftsman, and it is the result of an accurate analysis of drawing materials used by Leonardo, in which peculiarities of materials are digitally reproduced at the various scales exploiting solutions that favor the accuracy of perceived reproduction instead of the fidelity to the physical model and their ability to be efficiently implemented over a standard GPU-accelerated RTR pipeline. Results of the development are exemplified on five of Leonardo's drawings and multiple evaluations of the results, subjective and objective, are illustrated, aiming to assess potential and critical issues of the application.",

It is this creative, largely subjective, controversial dialogue between the museum and dance, accompanied by comments of art historians, choreographers, and artists, that gets its meaning in the presented material. The novelty of the study lies in assessing the main directions of choreographic activity, which can be mutually transformed so that the museum and dance function successfully in modern conditions and build a new communicative space with the audience. Through a creative analysis of the modern experience of dance practices, it is possible to discover the principles and trends that are destined to breathe new life into the museum space. The considered examples of organising a museum space with theatrical and plastic direction interacting with it clearly demonstrate that modern visual strategies, associated primarily with its interactive substance, affect the communicative and exhibition space of the museum in different ways. A choreographic performance was analysed as part of a diverse event taking place on the territory of the cultural and historical museum complex; inclusion of dance in the dynamics of the halls of the interior spaces of the museum; entry of a choreographic performance, theatrical actions into the exhibition space of expositions; the museum itself inviting artists, choreographic schools and studios to conduct regular classes and masterclasses within the walls of the museum to popularise its collections, and other examples of forms of interaction between the art of dance and the art museum.",

    "abstract": "Classical music venues in the Netherlands and throughout the world are struggling to attract new audiences. Especially younger visitors are underrepresented. Previous research emphasizes the importance of providing new, potentially interested audiences with more means to consume the music. This paper presents an exploratory case study with the persuasive game Listening Space which we developed to help attract new audiences and thus preserve Western classical music heritage. In particular, we studied to what extent this game could promote more varied ways of listening to classical music and thus enrich the experience of visiting a classical music concert. We designed and executed a controlled randomized trial with surveys before and after the experiment as well as a series of in-depth interviews with participants after the experiment. Our treatment group consisted of 139 participants (both new and existing visitors). They played our digital game at their own convenience, followed by a visit to a concert in a renowned classical music concert hall. A control group of 165 participants only visited the concerts. We measured the effects of the game – changes in the ways participants listen to classical music – through self-report in questionnaires before and after the experiment. Results show that Listening Space seems most effective for new audiences: the game promoted more varied ways of listening in the treatment group and thus enriched their experience of visiting a classical music concert. The control group of new visitors did not show an effect and also no differences were found between the treatment and control groups of regular visitors of classical music concerts We employed regression analysis to identify predictors of the game's effect on listening styles: participants’ age and their level of appreciation of the classical music genre were negatively related to the effectiveness of the game. The way in which participants experienced the game also significantly influenced the effectiveness. This case study shows the potential of using games to promote classical music concerts: games seem to be valuable in attracting new, young audiences and, therefore, represent powerful instruments to help preserve Western classical music cultural heritage.",

The design system includes three modules: color extraction, automatic coloration, and color matching evaluation module. The adaptive bipartite k -means clustering algorithm is utilized to extract colors of each sample costume, while the genetic algorithm is applied to generate the optimal color matching scheme, and designers can participate in the design to obtain a satisfied scheme. The evaluation model combines the aesthetic measurement formula and the aesthetic measure of color harmony to evaluate the coloration quality. In the experiment, Jiangnan Han folk costumes are chosen as typical source samples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that different number of extracted colors and patterns can efficiently realize automatic coloration and can provide auxiliary decision-making for pattern color design in the fashion industry.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in experience technologies such as augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) have facilitated receiving content about the audience on site and experiencing architectural heritage in a virtual space. Despite the development of experience devices, if the quantity and quality of content are not sufficiently supported, then immersive user experiences are bound to be limited. Considerable amounts of money, manpower, and time are required to make a building into experience content. Tasks such as building a database create experiential content that occupies a large proportion of the overall process. Therefore, it is necessary to devise an automated method for building data, which is the basis for content creation. This study extracted data on architectural heritage automatically and structured it around spatial expression so it can function as base work for mass content creation. Specifically, this study devised a method to link and structure text and spatial data centering on the architectural spatial data model. Text and spatial data were extracted automatically using deep learning, and each derived result was mapped to Indoor Affordance Spaces—an indoor spatial data model—to test whether information inference is possible based on the interconnection relationship. The spatial experience route inferred using the data model expresses the detailed area where the viewing element exists, based on the description method of the model. It also shows the process of reconstructing an efficient movement line with topological relationships between spaces. The series of processes presented herein showed sufficient applicability to the extraction of data and the connection and utilization of data models. This is useful for extracting and classifying information used for content from massive raw data. This study also considered the specificity arising from architectural heritage and spatial information. Therefore, the research concept can be applied in exhibition and experience spaces, such as architectural heritage, museums, and art galleries, to create sources for content creation and refer to content composition.",

    "abstract": "The Resolutions of the Dutch States General (1576–1796) is an archive covering over two centuries of decision making and consists of a heterogeneous series of handwritten and printed documents. The archive, which has recently been digitised, is a rich source for historical research. However, owing to the archive’s heterogeneity and dispersion of information, historians and other researchers find it hard to use the archive for their research. In this article, we describe how we deal with the challenges of structuring and connecting the information in this archive. We focus on identifying the existing structural elements, to turn the archive from a set of pages into a set of meeting dates and individual resolutions, with rich metadata for each resolution. To deal with the challenges of historical language change, spelling variation, and text recognition mistakes, we exploit the repetitive nature of the language of the resolutions and use fuzzy string searching to identify structural elements by the formulaic expressions that signal their boundaries. We also discuss and provide an analysis of the value of extracting different types of entities from the text and argue that the choice of which types of entities to focus on should be made based on how they support relevant research questions and methods. In the resolutions, we choose to prioritise person qualifications such as profession, legal status, or title, over person names. Qualifications allow users to select certain groups of people and to meaningfully combine with other layers of metadata, whereas person names lack contextual information to disambiguate them, making it unclear which and how many persons are referred to by selecting a specific person name. We show how our methodology results in a computational platform that allows users to explore and analyse the archive through many connected layers of metadata.",

    "abstract": "The development of graffiti studies during the last couple of decades highlighted the relevance and potential of graffiti as a complementary source for understanding different aspects of past societies. Moreover, the availability of digital documentation techniques crucially increased data production, showing the widespread presence of graffiti in Medieval and Early Modern contexts across Europe. However, the approach to historical graffiti has not been yet structured. Guidelines, specific analytical tools, and descriptors are still missing due to various reasons. First, graffiti are a multiform and multimodal graphic expression, so texts, signs, and images must be considered together despite their different communicative nature. Secondly, due to their variety in forms and contents, graffiti have been studied from many perspectives (e.g., epigraphy, palaeography, history, art history, maritime studies), following the specific interests of each scholar. Consequently, the numerous and extensive contributions concerning graffiti highlight the lack of shared standards and approaches, hindering data analysis and interoperability. The panorama emerging is fragmentary and unstructured. This article thus aims to offer a first step toward the development of a specific methodology for the analysis and study of Medieval and Early Modern European graffiti. Precisely, a specific ontology adopting CIDOC CRM for Medieval and Early Modern graffiti will be presented, as developed in a preliminary form within the DIGIGRAF project 1 with the support of the ARIADNEplus 2 network.",

For over a decade, organisations have been leveraging Semantic Web technologies to design their workflows, ensure data quality, and a means for sharing and reusing (Linked Data). Crucially, scholarly projects that leverage cultural heritage data to collaboratively develop new resources would benefit from agile solutions to simplify the Linked Data production workflow via user-friendly interfaces. To date, only a few pioneers have abandoned legacy cataloguing and archiving systems to fully embrace the Linked Open Data (LOD) paradigm and manage their catalogues or research products through LOD-native management systems. In this article we present Crowdsourcing Linked Entities via web Form (CLEF) , an agile LOD-native platform for collaborative data collection, peer-review, and publication. We detail design choices as motivated by two case studies, from the Cultural Heritage and scholarly domains respectively, and we discuss benefits of our solution in the light of prior works. In particular, the strong focus on user-friendly interfaces for producing FAIR data, the provenance-aware editorial process, and the integration with consolidated data management workflows, distinguish CLEF as a novel attempt to develop Linked Data platforms for cultural heritage.",

In this publication, through a series of Speak Aloud tasks with (n = 15) participants, we explore how contextual information can improve user experiences with DCIs. The aforementioned study’s results demonstrate that the inclusion of contextual information when presenting a DCI can, in fact, improve a visitor’s understanding of a DCI’s size and scale plus also the perceived realism of a DCI. Moreover, we observe that contextual information, and its recommended addition, supports the generation of a narrative by the visitor audience. In conclusion, we advise on how contextual information can improve the relationship between a visitor and a DCI, toward interacting with a DCI in a manner very similar to that of its analog counterpart.",

    "abstract": "The fact that the physical shapes of man-made objects are subject to overlapping influences—such as technological, economic, geographic, and stylistic progressions—holds great information potential. On the other hand, it is also a major analytical challenge to uncover these overlapping trends and to disentagle them in an unbiased way. This article explores a novel mathematical approach to extract archaeological insights from ensembles of similar artifact shapes. We show that by considering all shape information in a find collection , it is possible to identify shape patterns that would be difficult to discern by considering the artifacts individually or by classifying shapes into predefined archaeological types and analyzing the associated distinguishing characteristics. Recently, a series of high-resolution digital representations of artifacts have become available. Such datasets enable the application of extremely sensitive and flexible methods of shape analysis. We explore this potential on a set of 3D models of ancient Greek and Roman sundials, with the aim of providing alternatives to the traditional archaeological method of “trend extraction by ordination” (typology). In the proposed approach, each 3D shape is represented as a point in a shape space —a high-dimensional, curved, non-Euclidean space. Proper consideration of its mathematical properties reduces bias in data analysis and thus improves analytical power. By performing regression in shape space, we find that for Roman sundials, the bend of the shadow-receiving surface of the sundials changes with the latitude of the location. This suggests that, apart from the inscribed hour lines, also a sundial’s shape was adjusted to the place of installation. As an example of more advanced inference, we use the identified trend to infer the latitude at which a sundial, whose location of installation is unknown, was placed. We also derive a novel method for differentiated morphological trend assertion, building upon and extending the theory of geometric statistics and shape analysis. Specifically, we present a regression-based method for statistical normalization of shapes that serves as a means of disentangling parameter-dependent effects (trends) and unexplained variability . In addition, we show that this approach is robust to noise in the digital reconstructions of the artifact shapes.",

These collections provide valuable historical information to the public and researchers. Many image collections have little metadata describing who or what is depicted in a structured format, making it difficult to search for specific persons. This work presents a facial recognition pipeline to enrich these collections by recognizing the persons in each image. A reference dataset of over 6,000 known persons was constructed and facial recognition was performed on a dataset of over 150 thousand images. Detected faces were matched with the known faces using a similarity score on the face embeddings. We developed an interactive labeling tool to efficiently validate the face recognition predictions. A total of 182 thousand detected faces were labeled with this tool. Using a minimum similarity score of 0.5, the face recognition model achieved a precision of 0.936 and identified over 62 thousand persons from the image archives. We show how clustering can be used to identify new persons that were not included in the reference dataset. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of facial recognition to enhance the accessibility of the collections and offer new insights.",

    "abstract": "Historical architectural archives enjoy attention from diverse audiences, acting as a primary source of information for architects, historians, public authorities, and common citizens alike. In Italy, the interest in architectural archives has grown slowly but steadily for the last 20 years. However, architectural archives do not generally follow the trend common for museums and galleries in publishing digitized materials and providing standard metadata for individual records. The information that is available online usually includes only an archival finding aid, instead of metadata about the individual records, or fully digital versions of the records. While cataloguing standards for archival descriptions of architectural records have existed at least since the 1980s, the rise of Linked Open Data as a framework for publishing cultural heritage data has allowed archivists to enhance these archival descriptions with richer contextual information and links to external knowledge bases. In this paper we present the ITDT ontology, an extension of the Records in Contexts Ontology that facilitates the representation of architectural records and of the context related to architectural projects, its process, and participating entities. We discuss the application of the ontology to the project files of Italian architect and engineer Dino Tamburini (1924–2011), and the creation of a digital archive offering multiple perspectives over the records.",

To represent this knowledge in a declarative way means to support data interoperability in the context of cultural heritage artefacts, as linked datasets on experience documentation have started to appear. With this objective in mind, we describe a study based on an ontology design pattern for modelling experiences through observations, which are considered indirect evidence of a mental process (i.e., the experience). This pattern highlights the structural differences between types of experiential documentation, such as diaries and social media, providing a guideline for the comparability between different domains and for supporting the construction of heterogeneous datasets based on an epistemic compatibility. We have performed not only a formal evaluation over the pattern but also an assessment through a series of case studies. This approach includes (a) the analysis of interoperability among two case studies (reading through social media and historical sources); (b) the development of an ontology for collecting evidences of reading, which reuses the proposed pattern; and (c) the inspection of experience in humanities datasets.",

    "abstract": "The architectural complex of the al-Madrasa al-Halawiyya in Aleppo, Syria, remains one of the most remarkable monuments in the centuries-old city. First founded as the Church of St. Helen in the 6th century to serve as the Cathedral of Byzantine Aleppo, the structure preserves evidence of a complicated building history. For example, the Cathedral was converted into a mosque in 1124; later, parts of the church were integrated into a Madrassa. More recently, damage to the structure due to the war revealed information about Byzantine building methods. This research revisits the building history of the monument by relying on a parametric, Building Information Modelling (BIM) representation to compare the surviving structure with earlier reconstructions. This article addresses the following: (1) A survey of the building's history, topography, and architecture: Over the centuries, al-Madrasa al-Halawiyya has attracted Medieval monks, travellers, brigands, scholars, and more. Their accounts offer exciting opportunities to contextualise structural and functional changes to the complex. (2) An analysis of the historical structure, especially from the Byzantine period: The presented three-dimensional (3D) documentation of the site focused on historical transformations, which the authors then traced and compared by means of BIM to reconstructions proposed by Samuel Guyer (1911) and Michel Écochard (1950). This research demonstrates how a hybrid methodology can be used to establish building phases for comparison with historical and scholarly accounts, revealing new knowledge about building techniques and processes. The presented work started with a field survey of the monument, which was used to generate a hybrid 3D point cloud. Using the point cloud, the Byzantine church was virtually reconstructed and several construction phases were identified. At the same time, Heritage-BIM models were created based on the work of Guyer and Écochard. Finally, the Guyer and Écochard models were compared with the proposed Byzantine reconstruction and point cloud.",

    "abstract": "The sustainability of digital research outputs, particularly in the humanities where these frequently comprise archives of digital cultural heritage material, has always offered a challenge to the researchers and institutions who have responsibility for them. The amount of upfront care, effort, and funding that goes into developing a research project during the active (and funded) research phase is rarely replicated within the post-project maintenance and curation of the delivered digital assets or archives. What often defines the sustainability of a research project and its archive is a combination of research method and expected life span for the digital collection. Innovation in research data design is often at the expense of its longevity. But this does not need to be so. The tradeoff between longevity and functionality is a false dichotomy. Yet what is clear is that care and consideration in planning the research data storage or archive for a project can make a big difference. A data management plan that meets grant funder requirements is asked for for many research projects, but it is more than simply a funding document. Good research data management ensures that outputs are available online for years to come and available for future research and innovation. This article offers a practical insight to the methods being employed at the University of Oxford to support Digital Humanities scholars (and beyond) safeguard their digital legacy for future generations.",

    "abstract": "Several countries have traditional textiles as a piece of their cultural heritage. Indonesia has a traditional textile called batik. Central Java is one of the regions producing batik known for its variety of distinctive themes. It has unique designs and several motifs that emphasize the beauty of historic sites. Since the diversity of central java batik motifs and the lack of knowledge from the surrounding community, only a select group of people, especially the batik craftsmen themselves, can recognize these motifs. Consequently, the method to identify the batik according to the primary ornament pattern is required. Therefore, this study proposes a computer vision-based method for classifying batik patterns. The proposed method required discriminating appropriate features to produce optimal results. The discriminating features were constructed based on color, shape, and texture. Those features were derived using the method of Color Moments, Area Based Invariant Moments, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). This study’s proposed hybrid features were formed based on the most discriminating and appropriate features. These were yielded by the Correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method. The hybrid features were then fed into several classifiers to determine the batik pattern. The pattern consists of ten classes: Asem Arang, Asem Sinom, Asem Warak, Blekok, Blekok Warak, Gambang Semarangan, Kembang Sepatu, Semarangan, Tugu Muda, and Warak Beras Utah. Based on the experimental results, the most optimal predicted class of the batik pattern was generated using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier. It was indicated by achieving an accuracy value of 99.76% based on the 3,000 images (each class consists of 300 images) with cross-validation using a k-fold value of 10. This study has proved that the hybrid features incorporated with ANN can be selected as a suitable model to classify the batik patterns.",

    "abstract": "The segmentation of films and videos into shots requires the detection of gradual transitions such as dissolves and fades. There are two types of approaches: unified approaches, that is, one detector for all gradual transition types, and approaches that use specialized detectors for each gradual transition type. We present an overview on existing methods and extend an existing unified approach for the detection of gradual transitions in historic material. In an experimental study, we evaluate the proposed approach on complex and low-quality historic material as well as on contemporary material from the TRECVid evaluation. Additionally, we investigate different features, feature combinations, and fusion strategies. We observe that the historic material requires the use of texture features, in contrast to the contemporary material that, in most of the cases, requires the use of color and luminance features.",

The input system of the guqin notation is necessary for digital storage and analysis of guqin notation. This article presents the first handwriting input system of guqin notation. This system adopts a radical-based approach. In this approach, the radicals of the input reduced character are extracted first. Next the layout template that best matches the character is found. The name of the character can then be interpreted according to the radicals and the matching layout template. Radical extraction is the key step of any radical-based approach. In this article a method of radical extraction for online cursive characters is proposed. Experimental results show that the approach is efficient and that the input system performs well.",

An interesting but unfortunate fact is that the traditional notation of guqin music does not provide the duration information for each music note which requires the player to learn from his teacher and memorize. As a result, among several thousands of compositions that have been created and recorded with guqin music notation, only around 100 of them are still being played today. In this article we use a machine learning method to study the guqin music recovery problem which tries to use the guqin music notation to recover the duration of each music note. Information provided by the music note is used as features to predict the duration information with a support vector machine. The experimental result shows that our system can predict with fair accuracy, and can be used as a valuable reference for human guqin masters to recover guqin music.",

Building on this research, NG/DDH participated in the Getty Advanced Workshop on Network Analysis and Digital Art History, which encouraged us to think particularly about the role and nature of network analysis in the field of Digital Art History. In this paper we briefly describe the technical process of digitization, and the possibilities opened up by converting the transactional information contained in the stock books into structured data. We then set this in the historical context of network structures, as embodied by the World Wide Web and social media, and especially the distinction that these types of network have entrenched between objects (or persons) and topics (or other abstract entities). We conclude with an argument that problematizing this distinction – which is enshrined in the whole concept of networks and network analysis – is key if this method is to be applied to art history research.",

These institutes adopt various digitization strategies based on differences in selection procedures. This results in heterogeneous data sources with a huge impact on the accessibility and interoperability of data within and between these distributed collections. We identify three interrelated challenges that researchers may encounter when querying such distributed data sources, namely query formulation , source selection , and alignment of data sources . We present a multiagent architecture to overcome these challenges and discuss a prototype implementation of the architecture by developing and integrating various technologies. To measure and validate the performance of integrated technologies that meet these three interrelated challenges, we propose a methodology for setting up and conducting experiments. We take an existing data source for which we can establish a baseline query result, against which we measure the precision and recall performance, and create various sets of data sources with realistic characteristics. We report on the results of a number of experiments that show the performance of the developed and integrated technologies.",

While increasing sizes of images and datasets enhanced the overall reconstruction results, requirements in storage got immense. Additionally, unsharp areas in the background have a negative influence on 3D reconstructions algorithms. Handling the sharp foreground differently from the background simultaneously helps to reduce storage size requirements and improves 3D reconstruction results. In this article, we examine regions outside the Depth of Field (DoF) and eliminate their inaccurate information to 3D reconstructions. We extract DoF maps from the images and use them to handle the foreground and background with different compression backends, making sure that the actual object is compressed losslessly. Our algorithm achieves compression rates between 1:8 and 1:30 depending on the artifact and DoF size and improves the 3D reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The successful use of deep learning solutions for document image segmentation typically relies on a large number of manually labeled ground truth examples, which is expensive to obtain for historical document images that have significant noise effects and variation. At the same time, successful applications of deep learning solutions for document image segmentation have rich potential to facilitate greater levels of description in archival collections (e.g., at and below the item-level). These greater levels of description are critical to increasing access and use of archival collections across an array of research domains. In response, this article investigates whether an augmentation-based approach to generating pseudo-ground truth can be effective with a limited number of labeled images in a document segmentation application. The rationale is that if we can decrease the cost of generating ground truth through augmentation-based approaches, we can use these approaches as part of the description and access pipelines for historical library and archival collections. In this initial exploration, we first generate synthetic images and corresponding pseudo-ground truth using a set of existing degradation-based augmentation models from a small number of labeled actual images. When generating synthetic images, we control the visual quality distortion based on OCR word-level confidence to avoid generating images unlikely to be present in the dataset. Then, we perform several investigations to examine the impact of incorporating pseudo-ground truth data in the training of the deep learning network dhSegment and further evaluate the use of multiple combinations of degradation models. We also assess the generalizability of the approach by applying the trained network on a larger dataset. Our investigations primarily use real-world datasets known to have significant noise effects. Results show that augmentation-based pseudo-ground truth generation is capable of improving segmentation performance with the use of the full original dataset and requires only 30% of the original dataset. Results also show that using more than three degradation models is likely to cause overfitting during training. Furthermore, we show that a segmentation network trained on pseudo-ground truth data has generalization capability.",

    "abstract": "Making ancient handwritten manuscripts accessible to the general public is challenging, for several reasons. Foremost, they are handwritten. Each and every one is unique, so there is a need for manual transcription for providing enough examples for training a machine-learning-based algorithm to automatically transcribe the handwritten text. Moreover, the quality of the text is diverse—over time the ink faded, pages were damaged, and so forth. Furthermore, the boundaries of the textual regions on a page and the lines of text are not standard. Sometimes there are corrections above the lines, the lines are curved, there are comments and annotations on the margins, and more. A possible solution for these challenges is having a “person in the loop.” However, manual correction brings with it another challenge—how to address disagreement between annotations (as usually several corrections are considered before a decision is taken about the correct transcription). Tikkoun-Sofrim is a system that integrates automatic handwritten text recognition with manual, crowdsourced error correction, introducing an automatic decision process about when to stop asking for additional transcription and selecting the best transcription, declaring it as the recommended agreed reading. The system was applied to several manuscripts of “Midrash Tanhuma,” a medieval Hebrew rabbinic homiletic text, achieving a high level of success.",

Muqarnas work can be performed on several types of materials such as stone, wood, plaster or brick. This paper aims to propose an algorithmic method to construct the circular Moroccan-Andalusian Muqarnas Ornaments from their 2D representation models. The principle is to extract from a 2D design geometric information and underlying rules useful for the construction of its corresponding 3D model. To do so, the first stage consists to determine for each 2D shape of the 2D design model its corresponding 3D Muqarnas element. The second stage consists to perform the spatial composition of these identified 3D elements by using their neighborhood properties. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by its capacity to reconstruct historical circular Muqarnas ornaments appeared during the Almoravids (1040-1147) and Almohads periods (1147-1269). This performance is further evaluated by the ability of the proposed method to construct all possible variants of a historical 3D Muqarnas ornament by considering the different 3D shapes which can be associated to the same 2D shape.",

In this context, even though the digitization process is becoming more and more essential, analyzing and studying the analog materials remains fundamental to perform a retrieval or a correction faithful to the original material. For this reason, the lack of technical information (especially for the oldest materials) and the absence of open source archives of the producing companies underlines the actual and concrete need for a database of physical, chemical, and sensitometric data of both cinematography and photographic films.

The simulation results represent the temperature difference between Hawamahal’s inner and outer spaces during summer days. The study’s findings include using a digital twin system to discover the immersive experience of Jaipur’s Hawamahal without requiring physical participation. For the culture and tourism industries, this has the potential to be a digital revolution. The findings also show the wealth of ancient Indian architecture compared to modern twenty-first-century infrastructure and provide a virtual reality experience of Hawamahal.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the use of digital storytelling in the classroom to frame inquiry-based learning with digital museum collections. It presents the final in a series of three interventions that were part of doctoral research that tested the DiStoMusInq framework. The intervention involved a class of 15-16-years-old students at an international school in Greece as part of their English Literature curriculum, and included eight lessons, two of which were virtual visits to the online collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, UK. The students worked in small groups to agree what questions they want to explore and used their own smartphones and laptops to look for answers in the online collection. They then collected material from the collection and/or took inspiration from the collection to create their own material, and used these to produce video stories that presented their answers. The findings suggest that inquiry-driven digital storytelling offers an effective way to leverage digital technologies in the classroom to engage students in purposeful, self-directed explorations of online museum collections. The processes of developing a digital story and inquiring the collections feed into one another, resulting in cultural heritage-inspired, historically informed creative student outputs and the development of student research skills.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, an interdisciplinary effort between archaeologists and computer vision experts has emerged to provide image retrieval tools that facilitate and support cultural heritage preservation. The performance of these tools largely depends on the hieroglyph representation quality. In the literature, the most successful hieroglyph representation for retrieval following the BoVW model includes a thinning hieroglyph process and selects interest points through uniform random sampling. However, thinned hieroglyphs could have noise or redundant information, and a random set of interest points could include non-useful interest points that are different in each iteration. In this article, we propose improving this hieroglyph representation by pruning thinned hieroglyphs and introducing an improved interest-point selection. Our experiments show that our proposal significantly improves the hieroglyph retrieval results of state-of-the-art methods.",

In the proposed method, the correct feature matching of images obtained by rendering the 3D model of the subject is used. In this research, the subjects were the pillars of the Angkor Thom Bayon Temple and the epilithic microorganisms adhering to and eroding their surfaces. Synthetic transformation of a homography utilizing the correct matches is employed to overlap the target images. When overlapping different background images using the conventional method, estimation of the homography matrix becomes difficult owing to incorrect matches; thus, high-quality overlapping images cannot be obtained. The objective of this research was to realize the overlapping image process even under conditions that cause incorrect feature matches, such as differences in background and illumination. In this study, the damaged parts of the pillar surfaces were visualized using the proposed method. Based on the results of an experiment comparing the proposed method with an existing state-of-the-art method, the effectiveness and higher accuracy of the proposed method were verified. The findings of this research contribute to Angkor Thom Bayon Temple preservation, including a preservation project that the present authors are organizing for this culturally and historically valuable United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage site.",

This article discusses advantages of using a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for organising and systematising research in an interdisciplinary analytical laboratory. LIMS solutions are proven to be effective in managing laboratories, organising their daily management tasks, improving work conditions and increasing productivity, managing equipment and resources, and managing and safeguarding scientific data. LIMS software is commercially available since the 1990s with over a hundred software packages intended either for general or specific purposes. However, the ones currently available do not fulfil all the requirements for heritage science or are over-the-top, complex, one-fits-all standard solutions. The system here proposed was developed for a heritage science laboratory, considering its unique requirements, having as a case study the HERCULES Lab, from the University of Évora (Portugal). This article documents our approach based on the analysis of the unique requirements for the lab resulting in a proposal of a custom user-centred web-based system. For this, we discuss in detail the workflow, and the required system architecture. We conclude that although it is a small niche market for major manufacturers to dwell on, a custom LIMS is of the utmost importance for the current management of heritage science laboratories across the globe.",

    "abstract": "We describe a system that automatically notates a comparative visualization of multiple recorded performances of the same musical work. Written musical scores have transmitted basic performance information to musicians over the ages; however, these scores only provide skeletal instructions that must be fleshed out in performance, as musical notation describes phrasing, articulation, dynamics, accentuation, and other ornamentations in generalized and ambiguous forms. Consequently, musical performances derived from the same notation can vary widely from each other in the same manner that a written text may be spoken with intense emotion or in flat monotone. Prior to the advent of recording technology, musical performances were ephemeral, only occurring once, never to be heard again in exactly the same rendition. As a result, musical interpretations were informed only by live listening. Now, with more than a century of recorded performance practice, musicians can delve deeper into the history of their aural art to gain inspiration and insight from sources that would otherwise have been inaccessible. Performers have become interested in giving performances inspired by recordings of the past, which often obey a musical common sense alien to the standards of modern practice, and it is useful for historically informed performers to describe, analyze, emulate, and internalize the performance styles of the past through the detailed study of recordings. Although much can be learned by listening, a visual interface may reveal potentially inaudible details of a recording. Because performers interact daily with traditional musical notation—a sophisticated, if ambiguous, multidimensional visualization of musical information—one approach to the design of such an interface leverages performers' existing knowledge by reducing the gap between data visualization and traditional musical notation as much as possible. Using Abjad, a Python-based tool for musical composition, the symbols of conventional staff notation are augmented to illustrate the intensity and temporal proximity of performed musical events graphically, thus facilitating the comparison of individual performances and the study of changes in performance aesthetics over time.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the limitations of single image depth prediction (SIDP) under different lighting conditions. Besides that, it also offers a new approach to obtain the ideal condition for SIDP. To satisfy the data requirement, we exploit a photometric stereo dataset consisting of several images of an object under different light properties. In this work, we used a dataset of ancient Roman coins captured under 54 different lighting conditions to illustrate how the approach is affected by them. This dataset emulates many lighting variances with a different state of shading and reflectance common in the natural environment. The ground truth depth data in the dataset was obtained using the stereo photometric method and used as training data. We investigated the capabilities of three different state-of-the-art methods to reconstruct ancient Roman coins with different lighting scenarios. The first investigation compares the performance of a given network using previously trained data to check cross-domains performance. Second, the model is fine-tuned from pre-trained data and trained using 70% of the ancient Roman coin dataset. Both models are tested on the remaining 30% of the data. As evaluation metrics, root mean square error and visual inspection are used. As a result, the methods show different characteristic results based on the lighting condition of the test data. Overall, they perform better at 51° and 71° angles of light, so-called ideal condition afterward. However, they perform worse at 13° and 32° because of the high density of shadows. They also cannot reach the best performance at 82° caused by the reflection that appears on the image. Based on these findings, we propose a new approach to reduce the shadows and reflections on the image using intrinsic image decomposition to achieve a synthetic ideal condition. Based on the results of synthetic images, this approach can enhance the performance of SIDP. For some state-of-the-art methods, it also achieves better results than previous original RGB images.",

    "abstract": "Social networks constitute a valuable source for documenting heritage constitution processes or obtaining a real-time snapshot of a cultural heritage research topic. Many heritage researchers use social networks as a social thermometer to study these processes, creating, for this purpose, collections that constitute born-digital archives potentially reusable, searchable, and of interest to other researchers or citizens. However, retrieval and archiving techniques used in social networks within heritage studies are still semi-manual, being a time-consuming task and hindering the reproducibility, evaluation, and open-up of the collections created. By combining Information Retrieval strategies with emerging archival techniques, some of these weaknesses can be left behind. Specifically, pooling is a well-known Information Retrieval method to extract a sample of documents from an entire document set (posts in case of social network’s information), obtaining the most complete and unbiased set of relevant documents on a given topic. Using this approach, researchers could create a reference collection while avoiding annotating the entire corpus of documents or posts retrieved. This is especially useful in social media due to the large number of topics treated by the same user or in the same thread or post. We present a platform for applying pooling strategies combined with expert judgment to create cultural heritage reference collections from social networks in a customisable, reproducible, documented, and shareable way. The platform is validated by building a reference collection from a social network about the recent attacks on patrimonial entities motivated by anti-racist protests. This reference collection and the results obtained from its preliminary study are available for use. This real application has allowed us to validate the platform and the pooling strategies for creating reference collections in heritage studies from social networks.",

    "abstract": "This research addresses the question of what is an acceptable period between conservation treatments. Taking the cleaning of impressionist paintings as a case study, survival analysis is carried out on metadata from conservation records for the Tate, UK, the National Gallery in Oslo, Norway, and the National Trust, UK. Currently the only guidance available is offered by the National Trust. Based on cost-benefit analysis, it suggests an interval of 25 years for light surface cleaning and 100 years for major treatment. The majority of paintings held by the National Trust are pre-20th century, with a varnish layer protecting the paint surface. Arguments are put forward that this guidance cannot be applied to unvarnished paintings with exposed ground and a fragile paint layer. The cleaning process for these types of paintings poses a greater risk as it inevitably causes some loss of paint. Any cleaning of paintings in this category is more akin to a major conservation treatment. The Kaplan Meier Product Limit estimator uses metadata collected from the conservation records to estimate an average inter-cleaning period for the Tate, UK, and National Gallery, Oslo. The result of the theoretical analysis, although highly dependent on the quality of conservation records available, is supplemented by evidence from practical experience. Current views on acceptable frequency of cleaning and the associated risks of treatment are sought using a survey of conservators with experience of treating impressionist and post-impressionist paintings. This is applied to a case study of the Munch paintings in the University Aula, Oslo, that are currently unacceptably dirty. In the past, these paintings have been cleaned on average once every 14 years, which is clearly too often. The results suggest that the intercleaning period should be increased by a factor of three. Criteria are discussed for improving the environment within the University Aula, Oslo, to achieve this goal.",

    "abstract": "Numerous image inpainting algorithms are guided by a basic assumption that the known region in the original image itself can provide sufficient prior information for the guess recovery of the unknown part, which is not often the case in actual art-image inpainting. Sometimes, the art image that needs to be inpainted is so badly damaged that there is little prior information to serve as a good model to infer the appearance of the unknown fragment. Focusing on the lookup strategy for optimal patches, a novel semi-automatic exemplar-based inpainting framework based on a sample dataset is proposed in this article to solve such a problem with three steps: (1) reference images selection from the dataset using deep convolutional network, (2) sample image creation based on reference images with melding algorithm, and (3) exemplar-based inpainting according to the created sample image. Several comparative experiments over Dazu Rock Carvings with the state-of-the-art image completion approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our contributions. First, the search space for candidate patches is extended from the known region to a sample image. It performs effectively for the inpainting case of little prior information existing in the original image itself. Furthermore, sample image creation is added to reduce the complexity of inpainting via multiple images and avoid the taboo of complete duplication in art restoration. Moreover, Poisson blending is used for post-procedure to improve the visual harmony between the reconstructed fragment and the known region in both color and illumination. Last but not least, our method is successfully applied in the virtual inpainting of Dazu Buddhist face images. The inpainted proposals can be a reference for the final actual artificial inpainting as well as a base for VR show.",

    "abstract": "Automated content-based search for arbitrary cuneiform signs in photographic reproductions is a challenging task in the analysis of ancient documents, a central component of which is a reliable cuneiform sign classification. We present an illumination-based approach to generate synthetic training data for cuneiform sign classification via deep neural networks to overcome common issues with the transferability of machine learning training results. Starting from an analysis of the negative impact of illumination variations in the processed cuneiform data, we employ an illumination augmentation to two-dimensional (2D) training data generated from annotated 3D datasets. We demonstrate that our method is able to overcome the high visual variance of most digitized 2D cuneiform reproductions and achieve an illumination invariant generalization. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated by its successful application to several subsets of a cuneiform script dataset with an originally poor transferability of mutual training results. Furthermore, we show that a sufficient sampling of the illumination space mostly removes the necessity to match the training data to specific target illumination conditions. The practical applicability of our approach is validated by applying it to a larger dataset, raising the overall classification accuracy by 4 percentage points to 90%, resulting in a classification error reduction of 28.5% when compared to results without the proposed data augmentation.",

To better cope with the archival processing need for such large-scale and fast evolving archives, we propose the Data-driven and Circulating Archival Processing (DCAP) method. As a proof-of-concept, our study focuses on an English language Twitter archive relating to COVID-19: Tweets were repeatedly scraped between February and June 2020, ingested and aggregated within the COVID-19 Hate Speech Twitter Archive (CHSTA), and analyzed for hate speech using the Generative Adversarial Network–inspired DCAP method. Outcomes suggest that it is possible to use machine learning and data analytics to surface and substantiate trends from CHSTA and similar social media archives that could provide immediately useful knowledge for crisis response, in controversial situations, or for public policy development, as well as for subsequent historical analysis. The approach shows potential for integrating multiple aspects of the archival workflow and supporting automatic iterative redescription and reappraisal activities in ways that make them more accountable and more rapidly responsive to changing societal interests and unfolding developments.",

    "abstract": "The past decades have changed the way we deal with archives and archival materials. Archives digitised their inventories and part of their collections, but they were joined by many other parties who published archival collections and archive-worthy materials on the web. The information world is in continuous flux, and the developments have made clear that archives and libraries have lost much of their position as the vested authorities of information access. They are challenged by technological parties and citizen science that have as yet not established themselves in definitive positions as information brokers. We propose to analyse the field in terms of information authority, a composite of many different aspects that all contribute to its importance, availability and use. In this article, we first explore the issue of (information) authority in the digital realm, and explain why we choose a conflict metaphor to analyse the different types of partners in the information ecosystem. Digital archives call for cooperation and openness as information is ‘everywhere’, but this is hard to realise as it requires translating intentions into technical means. To maintain their position of authority, archives adopt standards and regulations. We argue that openness is the key, but hard to organise with the existing standards because they are used in monolithic ways that make it hard to combine information. Combining asks for methods from established scholarly and archival disciplines as well as from technology. Furthermore, sharing and cooperation require a harmonisation of contexts: the different contexts in which information is created and organised need to be aligned to understand how collections can be combined across different dimensions. This calls for providing (structured) metadata that define the scope of a collection, to allow one to determine whether combining information is useful. At the moment, the state of affairs is in flux and there is no fixed methodology. In the last part, we explore ways to facilitate and evaluate interdisciplinary communication and collaboration on methodology to address the preceding challenges of producing quality, in all realms.",

This study focuses on the reconstructed Celsus Library in Ephesus ancient city in Turkey, listed as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage. The primary purpose of the study is to examine the structural performance of the library, which was reconstructed by its original plan and materials in the 1970s, during the earthquake (Mw = 6.9) of October 30, 2020, at the Eastern Aegean Sea. The physical and mechanical tests were performed on samples of materials taken from the ancient city of Ephesus, and then non-linear dynamic analyses were conducted to determine how the structure performed during the Aegean Sea earthquake. According to the results obtained from the study, it is seen that the performance of the reconstructed library is well in terms of seismic behavior. Moreover, the results showed that the performance of the reconstructed library is well in terms of seismic behavior and the interaction between the adjacent walls and façade plays a vital role.",

    "abstract": "For Chinaware fragments, it is difficult to assemble them directly without considering the wonderful patterns painted on them. Given the simplicity of the Chinaware designs, each object contains similar textures and patterns. Compared to the oddly diverse appliance modeling, the difference between fragments of different Chinaware is small. The fragments are small and the fracture is flat, and there are many potential matching objects. For the Chinaware fragments’ reassembly, most of the work is still done manually. There is little available fully automatic reassembly work, and these approaches are for the reassembly of a single Chinaware. But what reality demands is the reassembly of the multi-Chinaware. Therefore, this article proposes an automatic method, whose strategy is analogous to the manual assembly, to accomplish this complex task. First, segment the contours of fracture surfaces of the fragments by the geometric feature of fracture edge; then, the contours are matched using our proposed multi-scale linear feature descriptor; given the massive fragments of multiple objects, we use the inaccurate matching strategy to build a matching set for each fracture surface contour and perform contour matching in this set. In this article, the fracture surface is segmented using the 2D slope information on the fragment edge. The descriptor proposed in the article uses distance triangle towers and chained angles to describe the “undulations” of the fracture surface. Moreover, the article uses a strict absolute-advantage-principle to reject false matching. In addition, after the initial reconstruction, we will iteratively adjust fragments according to the gap between the fragments to achieve better multi-fragment matching results. In this article, 18 porcelains, a total of 103 pieces, have been tested. Experiments are also carried out for special cases, including fragment reassembly with missing fragments and fragment reassembly with redundant fragments. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of method. However, the types of experimental data we currently have are relatively simple, and there is no way to reassemble the fragments in minutes. We hope to enable faster reassembly of more fragments in the future.",

Traditional semantic image understanding seeks to summarize an image (such as through a caption), or to answer basic questions expressed in free-text natural language, but can neither infer plausible reasons the creator made the artwork nor compute a high-level message or meaning it conveys. Such meaning is often abstract, dependent upon genre, period, and art movement, and exploits visual conventions such as special objects and signs (“signifiers”), composition, and possibly non-realistic style. Several of these properties have no counterpart in the natural photographs that are studied in most semantic image analysis, nor in the application-specific image analysis applied to robotics, autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, or remote sensing. For such reasons, the extraction of meaning from works in a variety of styles and subjects will be both a tool for art scholars and a grand challenge to artificial intelligence research.",

The author's ideas, and the words chosen to express them, can help identify the cultural time period that most influenced the author. Ideas are expressed in language through sequences of words called n -grams. Over the past several years, Google has been engaged in digitizing millions of books. As part of this endeavor, Google has created a database of n -grams extracted from these digitized books and has made the database available to researchers online. This is the first time ever that such an extensive repository of cultural data has been made available. This study develops and tests an original method for utilizing Google's database to identify the cultural time period that most influenced the author of a published work. Several undisputed literary works are examined, from which sets of n -grams are extracted and compared against the Google database. The frequency and distribution of n -gram matches allow us to determine the cultural time period that most influenced the author. The method is also tested against several literary works having uncertain or disputed authorship and period of composition. The results suggest that the method developed provides a reasonable approximation of the time period of greatest cultural influence for each book. Unexpectedly, the results tend to support conclusions reached by another researcher with regard to prior literary influences on the Ern Malley Poems . In addition, they lend support to early 19 th -century origins for authorship of Book of Mormon",

The Indian performing arts use three more well-defined expressions—peaceful, proud, and erotic. This study proposes an intelligent dual-level expression evaluation system that classifies performance-specific expressions into nine classes, assigns intensity level to the expression, and suggests modifications to the user for precise exhibition of an expression. At decision level-1 of a dual-level system, an 11-state model is designed to classify the nine expressions. The model is verified using the Colored Petri Net that helps analyze the rules used for the classification. Decision level-1 is also implemented using input feature database and SVM classifier, which yields 95.77% accuracy. Further, at decision level-2, SVM is used to assign an intensity level to the correctly classified images. In case of incorrectly exhibited expressions, feedback is provided to the user about the incorrect facial component state. The application-specific image dataset is used for the present study. The qualitative comparison with the other FER approaches is also carried out. With the increasing popularity of Indian classical dance in Western and Asian countries, the dual-level system enables learners of performing arts to practice, evaluate, and improvise their expression skills.",

In this article, we describe a software prototype and a methodology to virtually reconstruct an archaeological site for posterity, once it has been excavated. The system is implemented with a client-server architecture. In the server, a spatial database stores and manages the three-dimensional (3D) models of the finds, as well as several 3D site ground surface models acquired at different times during the excavation process. On the client side, a graphical interface allows the user to manipulate the find models to re-create and virtually reconstruct the original spatial arrangement of the archaeological site. Topological relationships among the finds are stored in the database to provide further spatial analysis. The result is an integrated information system that goes beyond 3D visualization, making the site last for posterity after its excavation and allowing further spatial analysis.",

    "abstract": "Bilaterally symmetrical objects represent a large and important proportion of archaeological artifacts and biological objects. The identification of the plane of symmetry plays a vital role in quantifying surface asymmetry and producing profile drawings in archaeology and anthropology. The correct recognition of symmetry provides evidence to allow experts to restore damaged artifacts, assess consistency in artifact manufacture, and examine morphological variability in human development. With the increasing availability of archaeological and anthropological three-dimensional (3D) meshes, landmark-based and landmark-free morphometric methods for detecting planes of symmetry have both been proposed. However, the landmark-based approach requires manual identification of landmark locations, and hence they are time-consuming and prone to error. Additionally, the landmark-independent morphometric method is influenced by missing data. This study presents an effective landmark-free approach to approximate the best-fitted plane of symmetry from nearly bilaterally symmetrical objects by means of finding the plane with the minimum geometric differences between the original and mirrored meshes. Subsequently, a global and regional method is carried out to quantify surface asymmetry, reducing the effect of the size and orientation of 3D meshes on gross asymmetry detection. Finally, profile drawings are produced by computing the intersections of the plane of symmetry and 3D meshes. Both synthetic and real objects are used to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Our results show the approximated plane of symmetry generated by the proposed method is consistent with that determined by anatomical landmarks, and no significant differences in asymmetry ratio representing the degree of gross asymmetry are found between the landmark-based and proposed methods. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a suitable plane of symmetry from a bilaterally symmetrical object with small geometric distortion or simple missing geometry, thereby speeding up asymmetry detection and profile drawings.",

It describes the solutions and customisations that have been adopted for dealing with the peculiarities of our epigraphical documentation and with the formalisation of epigraphical information deemed interesting for data retrieval in a historical linguistic perspective. The making of a digital corpus consisting of new critical editions of selected inscriptions is a work carried out in the context of the project “Languages and Cultures of Ancient Italy. Historical Linguistics and Digital Models”, which aims to investigate the languages of Ancient Italy by combining the traditional methods, proper to historical linguistics, with methods and technology proper to the digital humanities and computational lexicography. More specifically, the purpose of the project is to create a set of interrelated digital language resources which comprise: (1) a digital corpus of texts editions; (2) a computational lexicon compliant with the Web Semantic requirements; (3) a relevant bibliographic reference dataset encoded according to the FRBRoo/LRMoo specifications. Additionally, selected textual data and scientific interpretations will be encoded using CIDOC CRM and its extensions, namely CRMtex and CRMinf. The present contribution thus tackles one of the main aspects of the project, and proposes significant innovations in the encoding of critical editions for epigraphic texts of fragmentary languages, which will hopefully foster future interoperability and integration with other external datasets, a paramount concern of the project.",

    "abstract": "The cultural world offers a staggering amount of rich and varied metadata on cultural heritage, accumulated by governmental, academic, and commercial players. However, the variety of involved institutions means that the data are stored in as many complex and often incompatible models and standards, which limits its availability and explorability by the greater public. The adoption of Linked Open Data technologies allows a strong interlinking of these various databases as well as external connections with existing knowledge bases. However, as they often contain references to the same entities, the delicate issue of entity alignment becomes the central challenge, especially in the absence or scarcity of unique global identifiers. To tackle this issue, we explored two approaches, one based on a set of heuristic rules and one based on masked language models, or masked language models (MLMs). We compare these two approaches, as well as different variations of MLMs, including some models trained on a different language, and various levels of data cleaning and labeling. Our results show that heuristics are a solid approach but also that MLM-based entity alignment obtains better performance coupled with the fact that it is robust to the data format and does not require any form of data preprocessing, which was not the case of the heuristic approach in our experiments.",

    "abstract": "Ding is a significant type of Chinese bronze that holds key cultural value. Traditional humanists have primarily focused on dating and classifying Ding. However, in the context of Digital Humanities, the research perspective of humanities scholars is gradually shifting towards data-driven research, with linked data emerging as a popular topic. A well-defined and standard ontology representing the complete domain knowledge is essential for linked Ding data. Unfortunately, most existing ontology cannot represent fine-grained knowledge of Ding or is too restrictive to represent partial knowledge of bronze Ding. In this context, we propose a fine-grained Ding ontology to represent the bronze Ding knowledge. In this paper, we present in detail the Ding ontology of Chinese bronze during the Shang and Zhou dynasties (from 1600 BC to 256 BC). We provide a detailed exposition of the Ding ontology and evaluate its effectiveness using OOPS!, OntoMetrics, and by answering competency questions in SPARQL. The building methodology of Ding ontology follows the ISO principles (ISO 1087 and ISO 704). The objective of this paper is to develop an open ontology of Ding during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, which can serve as a valuable resource for bilingual terminology dictionaries. The Ding ontology was published at http://www.dhontology.com/ChineseCulture/data/bronze.owl .",

    "abstract": "Although adaptive reuse has made the preservation, restoration, and maintenance of architectural heritage sites possible due to the revenue generated by the new program, it has unfortunately induced unavoidable renovations that have altered the original design. Consequently, while the physical configuration of an architectural scene of a heritage site can be preserved and restored to mimic how it looked in the past, how to experience it as rendered with the original lighting design that might no longer be available. With the advancement of technologies related to High Dynamic Range Imaging, light models of various ancient illumination can be reconstructed and used as lighting sources for the virtual environment. Although ancient light sources can now be preserved in this digital form, this technique falls short of preserving the real visual perception of the significant canonical scene of cultural heritage with the originally intended lighting. This study proposes a conceptual framework for the digital archiving of the perceptual realism of the original lighting scheme of an architectural heritage site. The Taiwanese folk religion temples were included in a case study to demonstrate the framework; the study investigated how to identify the discrepancy between the scene-based lighting from the past and that of the current period due to adaptive reuse; further, this study determined the systematic method to select the canonical view that can best invoke the memorial spatial experience of the historical space; additionally, this study provides a case report of the restoration of past lighting with candles made with ancient recipes that were recovered from the field study, and the computational process of documenting scene-based lighting with related technologies using high dynamic range imaging. Finally, the researcher of this study conducted two perceptual experiments. The results of the first experiment demonstrated that the pattern of light and dark induced by the daylight falling into the courtyard plays a significant role regarding the viewers’ preference of the canonical scene of the traditional temple. The second experiment further demonstrated canonical views of three temples illuminated with artificial light, modern candlelight, and ancient candlelight, with ancient lighting being the preferred option of viewers.",

    "abstract": "Historical photos are valuable for their cultural and economic significance, but can be difficult to identify accurately due to various challenges such as low-quality images, lack of corroborating evidence, and limited research resources. Misidentified photos can have significant negative consequences, including lost economic value, incorrect historical records, and the spread of misinformation that can lead to perpetuating conspiracy theories. To accurately assess the credibility of a photo identification (ID), it may be necessary to conduct investigative research, use domain knowledge, and consult experts. In this article, we introduce DoubleCheck, a quality assessment framework for verifying historical photo IDs on Civil War Photo Sleuth (CWPS), a popular online platform for identifying American Civil War-era photos using facial recognition and crowdsourcing. DoubleCheck focuses on improving CWPS’s user experience and system architecture to display information useful for assessing the quality of historical photo IDs on CWPS. In a mixed-methods evaluation of DoubleCheck, we found that users contributed a wide diversity of sources for photo IDs, which helped facilitate the community’s assessment of these IDs through DoubleCheck’s provenance visualizations. Further, DoubleCheck’s quality assessment badges and visualizations supported users in making accurate assessments of photo IDs, even in cases involving ID conflicts.",

    "abstract": "In this article, by the ability to translate Aramaic to another spoken languages, we investigated machine translation in a cultural heritage domain for two primary purposes: evaluating the quality of ancient translations and preserving Aramaic (an endangered language). First, we detailed the construction of a publicly available Biblical parallel Aramaic-Hebrew corpus based on two ancient (early 2 nd to late 4 th century) Hebrew-Aramaic translations: Targum Onkelus and Targum Jonathan. Then using the statistical machine translation approach, which in our use case significantly outperforms neural machine translation, we validated the excepted high quality of the translations. The trained model failed to translate Aramaic texts of other dialects. However, when we trained the same statistical machine translation model on another Aramaic-Hebrew corpus of a different dialect (Zohar, 13 th century), a very high translation score was achieved. We examined an additional important cultural heritage source of Aramaic texts, the Babylonian Talmud (early 3 rd to late 5 th century). Since we do not have a parallel Aramaic-Hebrew corpus of the Talmud, we used the model trained on the Bible corpus for translation. We performed an analysis of the results and suggest some potential promising future research.",

    "abstract": "Annotation of a natural language corpus not only facilitates researchers in extracting knowledge from it but also helps achieve deeper mining of the corpus. However, an annotated corpus in the humanities knowledge domain is lacking. In addition, the semantic annotation of humanities texts is difficult, because it requires a high domain background for researchers and even requires the participation of domain experts. Based on this, this study proposes a method for detecting entities and relations in a domain that lacks an annotated corpus, as well as provides a referenceable idea for constructing conceptual models based on textual instances. Based on syntactic and semantic features, this study proposes SPO triple recognition rules from the perspective of giving priority to predicates and generalization rules from the perspective of a triple’s content and the meaning of its predicate. The recognition rules are used to extract text-descriptive SPO triples centered on predicates. After clustering and adjusting triples, the generalization rules proposed in this study are used to obtain coarse-grained entities and relations, and then form a conceptual model. This study recognizes SPO triples with high precision and summarization from descriptive texts, generalizes them, and then forms a domain conceptual model. Our proposed method provides a research idea for entity-relation detection in a domain with a missing annotated corpus, and the formed domain conceptual model provides a reference for building a domain Linked Data Graph. The feasibility of the method is verified through practice on texts related to the four traditional Chinese festivals.",

    "abstract": "Emotional Expression Recognition (EER) and Facial Expression Recognition (FER) are active research areas in the affective computing field, which involves studying human emotion, recognition, and sentiment analysis. The main objective of this research is to develop algorithms that can accurately interpret and estimate human emotions from portrait images. The emotions depicted in a portrait can reflect various factors such as psychological and physiological states, the artist’s emotional responses, social and environmental aspects, and the period in which the painting was created. This task is challenging because (i) the portraits are often depicted in an artistic or stylized manner rather than realistically or naturally, (ii) the texture and color features obtained from natural faces and paintings differ, affecting the success rate of emotion recognition algorithms, and (iii) it is a new research area, where practically we do not have visual arts portrait facial emotion estimation models or datasets. To address these challenges, we need a new class of tools and a database specifically tailored to analyze portrait images. This study aims to develop art portrait emotion recognition methods and create a new digital portrait dataset containing 927 images. The proposed model is based on (i) a 3-dimensional estimation of emotions learned by a deep neural network and (ii) a novel deep learning module (3DEmo) that could be easily integrated into existing FER models. To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed models, we also tested their robustness on a facial emotion recognition dataset. The extensive simulation results show that the presented approach outperforms established methods. We expect that this dataset and the developed new tools will encourage further research in recognizing emotions in portrait paintings and predicting artists’ emotions in the painting period based on their artwork.",

A large scanning campaign can produce billions of point samples—too many to be manipulated in memory on most computers. It is thus necessary to spatially partition the data so that it can be processed in bins or slices. We introduce a novel compression mechanism that exploits spatial coherence in the data to allow the bins to be computed with only 1.01 bytes of I/O traffic for each byte of input, compared to 2 or more for previous schemes. Additionally, the bins are loaded from the original files for processing rather than from a sorted copy, thus minimizing disk space requirements. We demonstrate that our method yields performance improvements in a typical point-processing task, while also using little memory and guaranteeing an upper bound on the number of samples held in-core.",

Spreadsheet software and relational database management systems are still the dominant tools for quantitative analysis and overall data management in these these sciences, allowing researchers to directly analyse the gathered data and perform scholarly interpretation. However, this current practice has a set of limitations, including the high dependency of the collected data on the initial research hypothesis, usually useless for other research, the lack of representation of the details from which the registered relations are inferred, and the difficulty to revisit the original data sources for verification, corrections or improvements. To cope with these problems, in this paper we present FAST CAT, a collaborative system for assistive data entry and curation in Digital Humanities and similar forms of empirical research. We describe the related challenges, the overall methodology we follow for supporting semantic interoperability, and discuss the use of FAST CAT in the context of a European (ERC) project of Maritime History, called SeaLiT, which examines economic, social and demographic impacts of the introduction of steamboats in the Mediterranean area between the 1850s and the 1920s.",

We particularly focus on the synalephe , addressed in terms of the \"propensity\" of a word to take part in a synalephe with adjacent words. We jointly provide an online vocabulary containing, for each word, information about its syllabification, the location of the tonic accent, and the aforementioned synalephe propensity, on the left and right sides. The algorithm is intrinsically nondeterministic, producing different possible syllabifications for each verse, with different likelihoods; metric constraints relative to accents on the 10th, 4th, and 6th syllables are used to further reduce the solution space. The most likely syllabification is hence returned as output. We believe that this work could be a major milestone for a lot of different investigations. From the point of view of digital humanities it opens new perspectives on computer-assisted analysis of digital sources, comprising automated detection of anomalous and problematic cases, metric clustering of verses and their categorization, or more foundational investigations addressing, e.g., the phonetic roles of consonants and vowels. From the point of view of text processing and deep learning, information about syllabification and the location of accents opens a wide range of exciting perspectives, from the possibility of automatic learning syllabification of words and verses to the improvement of generative models, aware of metric issues, and more respectful of the expected musicality.",

    "abstract": "The goal of optical playback of analogue audio discs records has been pursued since at least 1929. Several different approaches have been demonstrated to work. But in most cases the playback quality is worse than using mechanical playback. The Saphir process uses a specifically designed colour illuminator that exploits the reflective properties of the disc material to highlight subtle changes in orientation of the groove walls, even at highest frequencies (20kHz). A standard colour camera is used to collect rings of pictures from the disc. Audio signal is extracted from the collected pictures automatically, under user control. When colour signal is not useable, track slope can be used as an alternative. The process is slow—several hours per disc—but has a wide range of operation on recorded and printed discs, from earliest Berliner recordings to recent vinyl records, and its strength is at decoding direct-recording lacquer discs. An Elementary Shortest Path Solver with a reward (negative cost) on the number of turns is used to re-connect all the sub-tracks obtained, allowing to reconstruct, with limited human intervention, the correct playback order. We describe the approach and present the main advantages and drawbacks. The process was used to play back a number of extremely damaged (broken, de-laminated…), physically unplayable records.",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial laser scanning campaigns provide an important means to document the 3D structure of historical sites. Unfortunately, the process of converting the 3D point clouds acquired by the laser scanner into a coherent and accurate 3D model has many stages and is not generally automated. In particular, the initial cleaning stage of the pipeline—in which undesired scene points are deleted—remains largely manual and is usually labour intensive. In this article, we introduce a semi-automated cleaning approach that incrementally trains a random forest (RF) classifier on an initial keep/discard point labelling generated by the user when cleaning the first scan(s). The classifier is then used to predict the labelling of the next scan in the sequence. Before this classification is presented to the user, a denoising post-process, based on the 2D range map representation of the laser scan, is applied. This significantly reduces small isolated point clusters that the user would otherwise have to fix. The user then selects the remaining incorrectly labelled points and these are weighted, based on a confidence estimate, and fed back into the classifier to retrain it for the next scan. Our experiments, across 8 scanning campaigns, show that when the scan campaign is coherent, i.e., it does not contain widely disparate or contradictory data, the classifier yields a keep/discard labelling that typically ranges between 95% and 99%. This is somewhat surprising, given that the data in each class can represent many object types, such as a tree, person, wall, and so on, and that no further effort beyond the point labeling of keep/discard is required of the user. We conducted an informal timing experiment over a 15-scan campaign, which compared the processing time required by our software, without user interaction (point label correction) time, against the time taken by an expert user to completely clean all scans. The expert user required 95mins to complete all cleaning. The average time required by the expert to clean a single scan was 6.3mins. Even with current unoptimized code, our system was able to generate keep/discard labels for all scans, with 98% (average) accuracy, in 75mins. This leaves as much as 20mins for the user input required to relabel the 2% of mispredicted points across the set of scans before the full system time would match the expert’s cleaning time.",

The CARE-GIS application makes it possible to select and display CARE sites’ information (only for Italy, in the current version), by means of query forms, which allows one to cross several fields of the recorded data, to create thematic maps with the selected data. Moreover, the flexible nature of the application, by means of GeoJSON files and the QGIS software, allows one to add more layers, and map historical/archaeological data vs. other types of data, such as geomorphological ones or the analysis of the construction materials, or any other data related to the CARE sites. The displayed CARE data are extracted from the WikiCARE web pages by means of PHP “scraping” functions. A light-weight database is used by the CARE-GIS application, mainly to handle the connection to the WikiCARE website and fasten up the CARE sites’ search functions. The responsive CARE-GIS user interface allows accessing the maps from any kind of digital device, such as computers, tablets, and smartphones, making it a useful web application to get online information, when visiting the CARE mapped historical sites.",

    "abstract": "After an in-depth examination of the communication strategies, digital offerings, and audio guides currently employed by various Spanish cathedrals constructed during the 12th and 15th centuries, it was detected that there was a need to gradually build and improve an integral and unified tool that serves as a reference for the learning of the artistic elements that characterize the mentioned constructions. This will contribute to both the promotion of the cathedral —understood as an ensemble— and its communication with the public. This article introduces the conceptualization and design of the mobile application “La Catedral Hispana”, a high-fidelity prototype that seeks to promote Spanish cathedrals with Gothic elements in their construction. This prototype encompasses two areas of study for its task: the research of Gothic architecture in cathedrals and the principles of user experience (interaction design, information architecture, and interface development), for the correct development of the sample, using the Figma software for its design and implementation. The objectives lay not only in providing a tool that facilitates access and shares academic information, but also in establishing relationships among the diverse Spanish cathedrals by means of their common features. The Spanish Cathedral is a proposal for promoting the democratization of cultural information, the learning of the value of heritage, and the development of a new solid and accessible communication channel that enables the target audience to both value and recognize one of the most important types of constructions as a part of Spanish identity.",

Despite the increase in online exhibitions and the growing audience engaging with artworks in digital spaces, the utilization of artwork recommendation systems remains inadequate. Thus, this study proposes an artwork recommendation system, which provides artwork groups based on a visual clustering technique and user preferences with WikiArt datasets. The visual attributes of artworks were extracted using VGG16, and k -means clustering was utilized to group a set of images according to their feature similarities. To generate recommendations, new artworks were randomly selected from particular clusters, taking into account users’ preferences. Then, an experiment was conducted to investigate whether the recommended artworks satisfied the users. The statistical results indicate that users’ perceived satisfaction with the recommended artworks is notably more positive compared to their satisfaction with traditional suggested artworks. Based on this study’s findings, we present implications and limitations for future research.",

    "abstract": "The availability of digital music data in various modalities provides opportunities both for music enjoyment and music research. Regarding the latter, the computer-assisted analysis of tonal structures is a central topic. For Western classical music, studies typically rely on machine-readable scores, which are tedious to create for large-scale works and comprehensive corpora. As an alternative, music audio recordings, which are readily available, can be analyzed with computational methods. With this article, we want to bridge the gap between score- and audio-based measurements of tonal structures by leveraging the power of deep neural networks. Such networks are commonly trained in an end-to-end fashion, which introduces biases towards the training repertoire or towards specific annotators. To overcome these problems, we propose a multi-step strategy. First, we compute pitch-class representations of the audio recordings using networks trained on score–audio pairs. Second, we measure the presence of specific tonal structures using a pattern-matching technique that solely relies on music theory knowledge and does not require annotated training data. Third, we highlight these measurements with interactive visualizations, thus leaving the interpretation to the musicological experts. Our experiments on Richard Wagner's large-scale cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen indicate that deep pitch-class representations lead to a high similarity between score- and audio-based measurements of tonal structures, thus demonstrating how to leverage multi-modal data for application scenarios in the computational humanities, where an explicit and interpretable methodology is essential.",

Thus, we introduce in this article the GameBot ZoAm, developed for the Discord instant messaging and social platform. ZoAm offers a unique learning experience centered around storytelling, focusing on fundamental computing concepts and logical challenges that enhance computational thinking skills. Furthermore, the game also promotes an appreciation for Amazonian culture and folklore, with decision-making with human values. An action research study was conducted involving students from the last years of the end of elementary school. The research utilized a heuristic analysis based on the Gameplay Heuristics (PLAY) by Desurvire and Wiberg (ANO) and the evaluation model proposed by Korhonen and Koivisto (ANO) for mobile devices. The analysis employed a reduced and merged set of heuristics from these models, suited for the GameBot's context, focusing on (I) usability, (II) gameplay and immersion, and (III) mobility. Regarding the reliability coefficient used to evaluate the survey applied to students after playing the GameBot, Cronbach's Alpha and Guttman Lambda-6 (G6(smc)) coefficients were applied. These metrics were chosen to ensure the internal consistency and reliability of survey items, reflecting on how effectively the questions measured the focuses proposed by the heuristic analysis. The findings indicate that the game has the potential to facilitate the assimilation of the integrated concepts and sustain student interest throughout gameplay.",

    "abstract": "Recently, cultural institutions have seen a rise in citizen curation projects, where people actively engage in curating and interpreting cultural artifacts. Citizen curation involves using collective knowledge and shared interests to create rich narratives around heritage items. This approach values the diverse perspectives individuals bring to preserving and representing culture. In this work, we investigate the potential of citizen curation applied to the subjective and culturally bound topic of symbolism. To do so, we present a pilot study on the development and user testing of the Multivocal Exhibition application. This application allows users to curate their art exhibitions by picking one theme and three cultural contexts that spark their interest. The app then selects artworks and symbolic data from HyperReal (cultural symbolism knowledge graph), Wikidata, and the National Museum of World Cultures (NMVW) to create a 3D environment featuring three artworks that symbolically convey the chosen theme from the perspective of the selected cultural contexts. The purpose of this app is to foster an open dialogue about the uniqueness and similarities of cultures, and promote inclusivity and cultural awareness, by showing how artifacts and what they depict can be interpreted in different cultural contexts, according to their symbology. Multivocal exhibition was tested by 12 users divided into 6 groups. The evaluation is based on the interaction between the users and the application, the analysis of the dialogues that were prompted utilizing the app, and an interview after trying two scenarios. Our results show how serendipity and surprise emerge as central themes in the cross-cultural experiences of the users. These elements play an indispensable role in cultivating engagement through symbolism, enriching users’ comprehension of diverse cultures, and heightening overall engagement. Moreover, the cognitive gap intentionally created by the app —triggering questions about why specific symbols convey particular meanings within certain contexts— proves to be a potent stimulus for user curiosity and engagement. We report additional findings, lessons learned and future work at the end of the paper.",

    "abstract": "Large parts of museum collections, particularly in the Netherlands, are a legacy of the colonial past, guiding people’s societal perceptions of cultures and histories. There have been increasing efforts to ensure that museums acknowledge and reveal to visitors the multiple (e.g., cultural) meanings and contexts attached to objects in these collections. We address this as an effort to increase polyvocality . The present work contributes to the effort to emphasize, but objectively acknowledge, multiple (perhaps conflicting) perspectives attached to cultural resources. We provide a measurement to assess polyvocality amongst individuals and a case study including an adaptive, polyvocal exhibition design. The developed Virtual Reality (VR) exhibition curates the flag of Suriname (1975 - today), in which participants interactively encountered multiple perspectives on the flag’s colors and, in three different sceneries, learned how those relate to Suriname’s history. Our quantitative findings (obtained among a smaller sample of N = 20) revealed that the experience fostered a polyvocal mindset, which is supported by our qualitative analyses highlighting key polyvocal elements in the virtual environment. In sum, the present approach further explicates the polyvocality construct, proposes ways of assessing a polyvocal mindset, and recommends design principles to tailor polyvocality-enhancing VR applications.",

    "abstract": "The digital humanities have witnessed a clear development in recent years due partly to their adoption of Semantic Web and linked data technologies and the creation of knowledge bases. In this work, we target the creation of an ontology and knowledge base for literature data representation based on the IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM). IFLA LRM is the main model for book-related data, allowing for a fine representation of the various layers that constitute a book. However, by design, it doesn’t deal with some aspects usually available in literature databases, such as information about authors, literary awards or book themes. As a result, LRM requires some extensions to be able to represent ancillary data. Another challenge is the querying of IFLA LRM knowledge bases, with a performance cost that comes with the fine-grained expressivity of the LRM model, which creates longer and therefore typically slower SPARQL queries. In this work, we propose an extension to the IFLA LRM ontology called IFLA LRM* that targets these limitations including a connection to the vocabulary Schema.org and to the taxonomies Thema and Dewey Decimal, and the representation of literary awards. We also present a practical case study on using our extended model to create a Quebec literature knowledge base, discussing the interest of our extensions.",

We evaluate and compare several techniques: Template Matching, Segment Anything Model, Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YoloV8-s.

AR is an established tool for digital placemaking, which is a participatory form of embodied space-based social practice.

In this article, we explore the design and development of ARTours Clearwater, an AR app that was developed as part of a city-led public art initiative aimed at increasing foot traffic and enlivening a downtown district through the creation of vivid, memorable, “imageable” spaces. The app development workflow encompassed terrestrial lidar scanning of the murals, the identification of tracking images in Vuforia, the development and scaling of digital animations in Unity, and onsite testing to evaluate environmental conditions.

Through the integration of image clustering and statistical analysis, the research establishes a robust framework for examining the development of decorative styles in Ilkhanid architecture (1256–1335 CE), renowned for its vibrant and intricate designs. Focusing on the “shamsa,” a star-shaped geometric motif symbolizing the sun and frequently represented through intersecting lines, the study employs a four-stage process: (1) collecting and processing images of decorative elements; (2) developing and applying an unsupervised clustering algorithm to identify meaningful image groups; (3) creating a comprehensive metadata inventory for each image to support analysis; and (4) interpreting the clustered groups to reveal significant patterns and stylistic insights. Analyzing over 230 images from 34 Ilkhanid buildings using hierarchical clustering produced dendrograms illustrating relationships among the image groups. The metadata inventory validated the clusters by incorporating information on region, function, materials, and geometric patterns. This process identified 12 distinct groups of geometric patterns, demonstrating a range of complexity from simple designs to intricate knot motifs, or “gereh.” Ilkhanid decorations predominantly featured materials such as tile, brick, and plaster, with cyan, brick red, azure, and white being the primary colors. The findings present a comprehensive typology of architectural decorations, surpassing prior studies by analyzing broader features.",

    "abstract": "Environmental monitoring and assessment of environmental risk levels are of great significance for the preventive protection of cultural relics in museums. Conventional methods focus on univariate statistical analysis, ignoring the interaction among variables and the time-related characteristics in environmental sequences. In addition, the environmental data is mostly unlabeled. Due to the strict requirements of museums on the environment, the monitoring data is mostly in the normal state, and there exists a serious problem of class imbalance. It increases the difficulty of establishing a supervised classification model for evaluating environmental risk levels. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a hierarchical weighted long-short-term memory (HWLSTM) with a one-class classifier for the preventive protection of cultural heritage in museums. Compared with the conventional methods, the proposed HWLSTM pays attention to the interaction among key variables and extracts dynamic features from the multivariate environmental time series. It hierarchically extracts short-term and long-term dynamic features to overcome the long-term dependency caused by long sequences. A dynamic weighting strategy is proposed to highlight the cumulative impact of continuous abnormal states. Furthermore, to address the issue of lacking labeled data, an unsupervised one-class classifier is proposed based on the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) to achieve environmental monitoring and assessment of risk levels only using unlabeled data. Instead of constructing different models for each task, it provides a unified framework for the preventive protection of cultural relics.In this paper, the proposed method is verified with the paper cultural heritage in Shanghai Museum. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Relevant outcomes of the SPICE project (Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) are presented, focusing on enhancing the state of content management and delivery strategies in museums and memory institutions. We argue that citizen curation requires a principled way of managing and integrating citizen responses, contributions, and data flows in the domain of cultural heritage, raising challenges and opportunities such as integration of distributed and diverse data sources, authoritativeness, interdependence, privacy, data reuse and rights management. The solution is a Linked Data Hub (LDH), which integrates museum collections and user-generated content and repurposes them to end-user systems tailored to specific use cases for citizens and museum practitioners. Such LDH must be non-open , by offering an approach that gives citizens and organisations, such as museums or engagement agencies, meaningful control over their data by implementing user-tailored policies and negotiated access and terms of use. Additionally, our solution addresses privacy violations in user-contributed content by offering a near-real-time content monitoring framework. We present the LDH discussing pilot applications within the EU-funded project SPICE, including “Deep Viewpoints”, which currently supports the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) in citizen curation activities. Overall, this article serves as a critical milestone in closing functional gaps and advancing the state of technology in managing citizen responses and contributions in the cultural heritage domain.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge discovery from databases (KDD) and data mining (DM) belong to the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The integration of artificial intelligence into various segments of the construction industry is still in its infancy, but it is expected to be used more widely soon, driven by the development of databases and data warehouses. By using BIM (Building Information Modelling) technologies in the planning of new buildings, we will be able to obtain valuable data. The situation is different for old, existing buildings and the building engineering associated with these properties. Civil engineers, renovation planners and architects need knowledge of the building before renovation. This knowledge is much less than the possibilities that exist. Information about the building can be found in provincial archives. For historic buildings, 10-15% of the plans, drawings, descriptions, or projects are available. The remaining 85% must be researched on site, which is a lengthy and costly process and hinders the construction process. The question arose as to how the findings from the study of buildings based on written and preserved sources can be applied to the 85% of buildings for which no data is available. This paper presents the use of the collected data as an idea for an initiative to develop a database and modelling using artificial intelligence algorithms. The research study investigates the feature \"load-bearing wall\" for residential buildings with basements and floors built between 1857 and 1948 in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. The aim of this study is to create a model to predict the characteristics of a building for which no archival material is available. The study is based on the use of artificial intelligence in the creation of decision trees to help engineers improve their knowledge of historic buildings in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and building engineering for historic objects.",

    "abstract": "New curatorial practices have emerged in the last decade to increase the engagement of citizens in cultural heritage, ranging from visitors’ experiential feedback to exhibitions and cultural artifacts, to digitally mediated forms of interaction, such as social media and games. Within this context, citizen curation is proposed as a methodology for eliciting, producing, collecting, interpreting, and archiving people's responses to cultural objects in interactive and immersive environments. This special issue provides a comprehensive exploration of the challenges and opportunities posed by artificial intelligence and interactive technologies for citizen curation by presenting a diverse set of case studies that range from museums to heritage sites.",

    "abstract": "Derived from the mural drawings in the UNESCO-listed Mogao Caves, Dunhuang dance has unique cultural value but faces challenges of digitization and preservation. In this paper, we introduce the first open comprehensive motion capture dataset of Dunhuang dance, Chang-E , including full-body movements documented across eight categories, totaling 40 minutes of professional dance (preview available at https://cislab.hkust-gz.edu.cn/projects/chang-e/ ). This dataset contains three formats: skeleton data acquired from motion capture, body mesh generated from skeleton using machine learning, and multiview videos recorded on site. The dataset supports various creative applications for Dunhuang dance culture, as demonstrated by an immersive new media exhibition. Through the curation process, we applied motion inbetweening algorithms to concatenate different dance sequences for choreography. Also, these reinterpreted dance sequences are synchronized with music using retiming techniques, augmenting the rhythms and harmony between the music and dance performance. Furthermore, we applied visual effects on the regenerated motion sequences of digital dancers, achieving artistic and appealing visual results echoing Buddhist discourses of meditation and bodily cognition. The Chang-E dataset enables digital preservation and creative reimagination of Dunhuang dance, offering not only high-quality data but also an interdisciplinary collaboration framework for future graphics and cultural heritage research.",

    "abstract": "The increase of multidisciplinary research in the field of architectural history has led to the need to set up new experiences and solutions for the handling and integration of the information extracted from historical documents. These solutions seek to support diverse users of the research community with the aim of solving challenges directly related with the digitalisation, structuring, standardisation, and management of historical information. These challenges include, for example, the creation of a digital support that enables a collaborative growth and management of information, the normalisation of terms and vocabularies to make its analysis efficient, the elaborating of a conceptual model, and the development of a metadata support that allows its more expanded dissemination and reuse. This article describes a case study project in which the documents of archives, of research, and of projects previously carried out by the Late Gothic Network (Red Tardogótica) are the raw material for the proposal of an event-oriented historical database (e-database). This e-database means to record and systematise the information about the artistic transfers related with the architectural production in the transition of the Modern Age, a period also known as the Late Gothic. The e-database's design has considered the possibility of its use for the analysis of social networks (abstract-relational model, a Graph model) and the spatiotemporal analysis of the events (geo-temporal model, GIS). The main section of this article describes the architecture of the database, with a view to addressing the questions of the relations between the datasets and the matter of implementing the thesauri and controlled vocabularies that must be respected for the standardisation, recording, and later analysis of the data. Next, we contribute quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the database's important gaps of information. This proposal initially covers the geographical framework of the western Andalusian territory, but it can be expanded to other areas and adapted to other case studies. Finally, the article summarises the learning achieved in this first phase of the case study project and describes the perspectives to broaden its use in the community of architectural history researchers.",

The created solutions were designed using non-functional mockups and were based on the CIDOC-CRM model, a model created and applied in the museums community liable to be extended to other cultural heritage institutions, being our solutions an application of this model to archives. A sample of 20 archival professionals was selected to evaluate the elements included in the proposed solutions. The evaluation sessions consisted in structured interviews supported by an introductory video and a survey. The think-aloud protocol was applied during the sessions. We conducted both a quantitative and qualitative analysis to the collected answers. From this analysis, we conclude that the majority of the participants showed great receptivity to the solutions presented and recognized many benefits in the application of linked data.

    "abstract": "Augmented space can be usefully applied to cultural heritage experience, because it is possible to experience physical space and acquire information at the same time. Experiencers can expand their experiences through virtual content while feeling the presence of relics or historic sites. The cultural heritage experiences currently implemented show simple forms in terms of their content and delivery method. Many cases repeatedly provide the same content regardless of the experience in a specific location. The present research, titled “the spatial-experience model of architectural heritage,” derived a methodology for construction of spatial experiences augmented by digital technology. Specifically, it deals with the problem of content curation and the limitations of the information system, which can be seen in the spatial-experience composition methods in the current digital heritage field. The information structure of the model was improved to enable spatial-oriented explanation of the expression of architectural heritage, which was insufficient in the existing metadata and ontology structures. The model has inference rules for creating an experience sequence and composes various combinations of experience content based on historical knowledge relationships. The model and reasoning rules were tested by applying them to real architectural heritage cases. Based on the test results, the role of the information structure in the spatial expression of its combination with content, as well as the possibility of diversification of sequence derivation, were considered. This research presents a syntax for construction of a semantic-rich environment while extending historical knowledge and spatial expression to the existing cultural heritage information system. In addition, by means of the content generator, which is a model for producing content using the extended descriptive language system, it is possible to create experience content in response to the increasing amount and demands of data. By applying the proposed model, it will be possible to quickly and easily derive various experience contents from the cultural heritage space, thereby reducing cost and time for content producers and providing an evolved spatial experience for consumers.",

    "abstract": "Architectural floor plans are tangible cultural history artifacts, valuable for documenting how people live, work, and recreate, both in the present and going back hundreds or even thousands of years. Today, floor plans are created using digital technologies, but prior to the 1990s, the majority were drafted by hand. For archives, the storage, conservation, and handling of hand-drawn floor plans, which are often oversized and fragile, can be challenging. The digitization of floor plans, therefore, can reduce the possibility of damage while providing greater accessibility. However, even with digitization, researchers and archives continue to encounter barriers utilizing and cataloging these collections. Manually processing, collecting, and analyzing information contained in floor plans is time-consuming and prone to human error, particularly when working with large floor plan corpora. A tool to facilitate the broader use of archival floor plans is needed. Here, we propose the Building Database and Analytics System (BuDAS), a tool for the detection, storage, and analysis of floor plan information to assist scholars' research on collections and support metadata capture. In this article, we explore the challenges of detecting floor plan information and provide an overview of BuDAS, which we developed to address these problems. In addition, we test BuDAS's room detection system on two groups of floor plans sourced from archives, representing different levels of detection difficulty. The limitations and future implications of BuDAS and floor plan detection will also be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, libraries and archives of natural history museums and botanical gardens in the US have spent major efforts to digitize their holdings. However, transporting these digitized resources from individual repositories to a wider community of researchers is challenging. Many of the primary resources are handwritten which limits their use and reuse because cursive writing and personal shorthand are difficult to decipher and the documents mostly lack machine-readable data. This article presents three case studies from the Harvard University Herbaria (HUH) Botany Libraries and the Harvard University Ernst Mayr Library and Archives (EMLA) of the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) that utilize crowd-sourcing, detailed access and discovery tools, and open access platforms to make handwritten materials more accessible to researchers by bridging content across collections held within and outside of Harvard University. The case studies show that different approaches can yield opportunities for mining data because transcription of handwritten documents and enhanced metadata allow searching previously unavailable words and phrases such as taxonomic names. Content contributed to the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) and the tools and services available in the BHL were integral to the work. The end result shows how information held in natural history libraries and archives contributes to the expansion of scientific and cultural-historical knowledge by increasing access to previously unavailable historical scientific information through digitization, metadata enhancement, and transcription.",

    "abstract": "The EU H2020 project social cohesion, participation, and inclusion through cultural engagement (SPICE) focuses on developing, designing, and implementing new methods and digital tools for citizen curation. This article delineates several software tools developed within the project, presenting innovative approaches to represent and visualize citizens and communities resulting from their engagement with cultural heritage. Aligned with the central tenets of SPICE –particularly the notions of belonging and the interpretation reflection loop– the primary objective is to bolster citizens’ participation and inclusion in fostering social cohesion. This article describes how the SPICE tools can be utilized to guide the processes of interpretation and reflection on cultural heritage artifacts. The Community Model serves as a pivotal component, enabling the modeling of citizens and communities through the utilization of similarity functions for clustering citizens based on perspectives. The clustering algorithm is intricately crafted to generate coherent communities, iterating until all clusters are interpretable using demographic attributes, centroid-based representations, and similarity attributes. Authors posit that this model holds significant value in comprehending and structuring complex data within cultural heritage contexts. To exemplify our approach, the article examines different attributes of individual citizens and citizen groups in the Galleria Civica d’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea (GAM) case study. Here, perspectives are delineated based on visitors’ demographic attributes and their emotional responses when engaging with artworks. These perspectives are then visualized using the VISIR tool, facilitating the exploration and revelation of connections between citizens and communities, thereby bridging the realms of citizen space and cultural heritage space.",

    "abstract": "Citizen curation is gaining momentum as a new form of engagement with cultural heritage. Citizen curatorial activities require and produce a wealth of information, ranging from descriptions of the artefacts to visitor experience feedback. Although formalising and integrating such various data is of paramount importance, the domain lacks comprehensive ontologies to enable querying, interpreting and reasoning over the collected data. SPICE - Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement - is an EU project dedicated to experimenting with citizen curation activities to foster cultural engagement. SPICE develops technologies that help communities to create and share their own interpretation of cultural artefacts, hence developing a better understanding of, and empathy for, themselves and other communities. Part of the SPICE ecosystem of technologies is the SPICE Ontology Network (SON), which empowers applications with knowledge-level reasoning abilities, and supports both applications and users interacting with data involved in citizen curation activities. This paper provides an overview of the SPICE Ontology Network and outlines its main use cases.",

    "abstract": "A recurrent demand in many archaeological digital documentation systems is the need for an accurate as possible registration of data. Somehow, contrary to this request, are efforts led by various computer science groups dealing with 3D documentation and focusing on developing fast and cheap solutions to record 3D models of archaeological assets. The aim of the article is to highlight the importance of aligning the 3D documentation strategy to the archaeological aims, by detailing all factors to be considered when deciding on one documentation strategy over another. The archaeological question discussed here, part of the PhD thesis of one of the co-authors (MP), relates to the Cypro-Minoan signatory and its diachronic variability. The 3D geometric characterization of signs and subsequent shape analysis is the method chosen to reach this goal. A major effort to be invested in correctly determining the shape and variability of each sign, is in assuring that the 3D captured shape is as close as possible to the archaeological reality, which is a common problem not only in palaeographical analysis but also in other fields, where features of interest are in the sub-millimetre range. The paper will illustrate how different data acquisition approaches and post-processing steps such as alignment methods and error treatment may distort the visualised result and thus have a negative impact on planned analysis. Thus, it will argue for the importance of more detailed paradata to allow an informed assessment of the reliability of 3D models and it proposes a list of values and decision-making steps that help make the 3D digitization process more robust and verifiable.",

Using the example of the evolution of German past tenses, we show how a variety of categories ranging from low to high complexity interact with the choice between competing linguistic variants. To adequately explore the influence of these categories, we use a multilayer corpus architecture that develops together with our study. We show that a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses can recognize relevant contextual factors, which feed into the addition of new annotation layers applying to the same data. By making our categorizations explicit as corpus annotations and our data available to other researchers, we promote an open, extensible, and transparent mode of research, where both raw data and the inferential process are exposed to other researchers.",

The Primitive method is comprised of the RGB Linear method, the RGB Planar method, and the RGB Cuboid method. The Derivative method includes the RGB Multi-Linear method, the RGB Multi-Planar method, and the RGB Multi-Cuboid method. On a practical level, the goal of the paper is to introduce a systems approach to the notion of creating and applying algorithms to create a variety of color combinations and palettes in the field of Media Arts. The framework was implemented as a color design approach to the process of producing color palettes in the context of Media Arts while exploring the intersection of mathematical principles of geometry, color, and code. An investigation was conducted into how algorithmic color palettes generated from the methods correlate to culture, history, and other artistic practices. An application of the methodology and a discussion about how the framework can continue to evolve and be applied to other research areas and fields of applications, such as digital color literacy education, are presented.",

    "abstract": "Artworks need to be constantly monitored to check their state of conservation and to quickly spot the eventual presence of alterations or damages. Preventive conservation is the set of practices employed to reach this goal. Unfortunately, this results generally in a cumbersome process involving multiple analytical techniques. Consequently, methods able to provide a quick preliminary examination of the artworks (e.g., optical monitoring) seem very promising to streamline preventive conservation procedures. We are especially interested in the study of historical wood musical instruments, a kind of artwork particularly subject to mechanical wear since they are both held in museums and also occasionally played in concerts. Our primary goal is to detect possible altered regions on the surface of the instruments early and thus provide the experts some precise indications on where to apply more in-depth examinations to check for potential damages. In this work, we propose an optical monitoring method based on the a-contrario probabilistic framework. Tests were conducted on the “Violins UVIFL imagery” dataset, a collection of UV-induced fluorescence image sequences of artificially altered wood samples and violins. Obtained results showed the robustness of the proposed method and its capability to properly detect altered regions while rejecting noise.",

In the proposed method, a reference object of known dimension must be present in the field of view of a pair of images collected at any two unknown arbitrary positions along the axis of camera (z-axis) and 2D size measurement (x-y) of other target objects, and it is done successfully with the help of the proposed algorithm. The presented method is applicable to the number of images(&gt;=2) containing the target objects and reference object which are not in the same plane and which may be shot from any camera not known to the user. Hence, the internal and external specifications of the camera are completely unknown to the user. The method has been verified successfully to show its applicability in low-cost surveys by determining the dimensions of the Washington-Monument, Christ the Redeemer (Rio de Janeiro) and the Eiffel Tower (Paris) from open source images. Further, an example case of Notre-Dame Cathedral is demonstrated to find the size of the destroyed spire from the undestroyed reference structure. The results are being compared with known standard values of structures and the relative error percentage for all the cases using the proposed algorithm and are found to be less than 1%. The method may find applications in survey or analysis by old digital video footage or images from archive/libraries where the camera specifications are not known to the user.",

Three teaching fellows created learning modules that use products from On the Books and taught the modules to college-level courses. Research fellows are making use of the products on research projects of their own design. This article will provide background for the On the Books project and will assess its use for multiple purposes: as a workflow to be reproduced by others, as content for use in teaching and learning, and as a resource for researchers. To demonstrate the utility of On the Books as a research tool, the article is co-authored by one of the research fellows. The project “Mental Health, Disability, and Jim Crow Laws in North Carolina, 1866–1967,” makes use of the legal corpus as a primary source for researching the intersections of information, mental health, nutrition, and shifts from agricultural to industrial economics in the history of North Carolina. By assessing the experiences of those making use of On the Books products, this article contributes to the understanding of best practices for those interested in creating and supporting collections as data so they may be used successfully for reproducibility, research, and teaching.",

We offer a robust approach to multilingual annotations that involves a combination of the popular open source software FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx) with Kratylos, a web-based corpus tool for display and query. Kratylos exposes linguistic data from various formats to powerful regular-expression queries that can exploit tier structure and other aspects of interlinear glossed text. We show how Kratylos can target mixed structures in our FLEx database of Koda that cannot be easily identified within the original FLEx software itself.",

    "abstract": "Cultural heritage structures have recently faced the adverse impacts of traffic-induced vibrations more frequently than ever due to rapid and excessive urbanization. Closeness of Little Hagia Sophia Mosque to the intense traffic of an adjacent railway line in İstanbul made it vulnerable to the long-term and repetitive action of ground vibrations. To understand the structural response of this Byzantine edifice, an extensive vibration measurement program was conducted on and around the structure. After the construction material properties were determined, a numerical model of the structure was created and modal, self-weight and time history analyses were applied. It was observed that the maximum stresses reach approximately 45% of the tensile strength of the construction materials at certain locations. Cyclic loading of traffic-induced vibrations can be a significant contributing factor in the gradual material deterioration along with other environmental factors. Furthermore, measured peak particle velocity at the gallery level of the structure critically exceeded the limit of 2.5mm/s for historic or sensitive structures.",

    "abstract": "Dropped frames can occur in line-scan cameras, which result in non-uniform spatial sampling of the scene. A dropped frame occurs when data from an image sensor is not successfully recorded. When mosaicking multiple line-scan images, such as in high-resolution imaging, this can cause misalignment. Much previous work to identify dropped frames in video prioritises fast computation over high accuracy, whereas in heritage imaging, high accuracy is often preferred over short computation time. Two approaches to identify the position of dropped frames are presented, both using the A* search algorithm to correct dropped frames. One method aligns overlapping sections of push-broom images and the other aligns the push-broom image to a lower resolution reference image. The two methods are compared across a range of test images, and the method aligning overlapping sections is shown to perform better than the method using a reference image under most circumstances. The overlap method was applied to hyperspectral images acquired of La Ghirlandata, an 1873 oil on canvas painting by D. G. Rossetti, enabling a high-resolution hyperspectral image mosaic to be produced. The resulting composite image is 10,875 \\( \\times \\) 14,697 pixels each with 500 spectral bands from 400–2,500 nm. This corresponds to a spatial resolution of \\( 80 \\,\\mathrm{\\upmu }\\mathrm{m} \\) and a spectral resolution of 3–6 nm.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a model for the observation and design of digital collections exhibitions rooted on three concepts: interaction ecologies, exposing collections, and architectural ephemera. The study examines how to go beyond the “one user, one device” approach in GLAMs, what it means to expose a collection, and what it means to consider architectural elements as ephemera. We define interaction ecologies as the approach to a context in which individuals of different species (devices and humans included) entertain rich and floating relationships appropriate to the roles, activities, and postures they assume. This perspective offers novel possibilities on the exhibition of digital collections. In addition, we discuss the concepts of exposing a collection and the translation of architectural elements to transient artifacts to preserve memory. This discussion allows a series of qualities to emerge that together constitute a model for the observation of collection exhibitions. The study includes the presentation of the exhibition “Ankara Balcony Balustrades 1950–75,” which, by focusing on these aspects, acts as a prototype of the model and helps in verifying the application and its results.",

    "abstract": "Point clouds resulting from digital scanning are increasingly being used in the heritage field to create knowledge-based models, such as building information models (BIM) . Nevertheless, the use of digital image processing techniques in point cloud unorganized data is not well explored yet because of the lack of information about point adjacency and corresponding difficulty in structuring and manipulating data. In this study we propose an approach to deal with image processing-like mathematical morphological operations in unorganized point cloud using the octree graph. Our method consists of three main steps, namely: (i) computing the best distance value between points in the cloud; (ii) constructing an octree from point cloud; and (iii) producing a graph using rectangular layout. We exemplify the use of the proposed methodology performing morphological operations in grayscale and color point clouds of historical buildings. Results prove the effectiveness of the octree representation, which can efficiently generate an adjacency map, demonstrated by the resulting images, and has the potential to be applied at different areas of 3D data analysis.",

    "abstract": "The U.S. Patent Office maintains an archive of cultural artifacts of both ornamental and functional designs. Design patents protect “any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture” [ 23 ] such as busts, statues, and the shape or configuration of any article of manufacture. The Patent Office archive originally contained both drawings and models as an effort to preserve a chronological history of the science and culture of the United States. This collection was devastated by two fires in 1836 and 1877, which destroyed or damaged more than 100,000 patent models. The Patent Office began divesting its collection in 1908, and Congress ultimately chose to dissolve the collection in 1926. A total of 10,000 of the original models are preserved in the collections of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and another 5,000 are preserved in the collections of the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, Delaware. Although most of the physical artifacts no longer exist, documents describing the original physical models remain. These documents show each artifact as a collection of multiple black and white images depicting the artifact from different views. We propose an algorithm to reconstruct 3D point cloud models of the original artifacts from multiview images collected directly from the Patent Office archives. The use of 3D point cloud models allows both local and global geometric properties of the artifact to be described in a single vector representation. This vector representation of the artifact may be used individually or in combination with other descriptors for retrieval and classification tasks. For collections that are unclassified or where differing classification systems are used, these vector representations allow clustering of artifacts into meaningful groupings.",

    "abstract": "The sculpted rocks of Rothéneuf, located between St-Malo and Cancale, are one of Brittany’s best-known spontaneous environments in the form of monumental sculptures in the Outsider art. They were made between the end of 1894 and 1907 by “Abbé Adolphe Julien Fouéré”, known as “Abbé Fouré” (1839–1910), and range from bas-relief to fully exposed faces. The site welcomes tens of thousands of visitors each year. Old photographs of the sculpted rocks, the “Abbé Fouré” and his Hermitage have been digitized and can be consulted on the internet. “Abbé Fouré” also produced wooden sculptures which he kept in a hermitage with a garden which was transformed after his death into a museum in the village. The wooden works disappeared at an unspecified date. The hermitage has also been extensively modified since that time. The sculpted rocks of the site are increasingly eroded by maritime conditions (salt, wind, water spray and run-off), mosses and lichens, as well as by the frequentation of the site (repeated passage of visitors). This erosion seriously compromises the legibility of the sculptures, which are clearly seriously altered when compared with old photographs of the site. Created in 2010, the association Les “Amis de l’Œuvre de l’Abbé Fouré” has set itself the mission of memory: to make the “Abbé Fouré” known. The association organizes exhibitions, guided walks and other events to promote the site and Outsider art. A collaboration between this association, a national school of land surveyors and a public research organization has led to the creation of a methodology combining virtual reconstitution and real reproduction by robotic sculpture. This is now presented in an interpretation centre to seal the dissemination and preservation process.",

Within this article, we present a methodology, based on cross-collection linking, to create awareness about the botanical imagery in Van Eyck’s masterpiece and to inform people about their region’s plant richness and diversity over time. As such, this article is a nice example of how the interdisciplinary fields of cultural heritage and botany can go hand in hand to facilitate its dissemination to the general public. The plants in the painting can be queried by their name or by a picture taken with a mobile device—a plant recognition app is used to evaluate the pictures taken from the plants. A study has also been performed to evaluate these apps and to select the most appropriate one for the collection of plants in the Ghent Alterpiece. Currently, we link the detected plants to herbaria, observation data, Global Biodiversity Information Facility plantinfo, and recent wikimedia commons pictures, but other links can also be easily integrated with the platform. Finally, we also studied nowadays plant observations (volunteered geographic information) in more detail and reveal which region currently has most of Van Eyck’s plants/flowers.",
