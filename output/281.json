    "abstract": "Qualitative comparative analysis allows for the breadth of analysis associated with quantitative data and the depth of case knowledge provided by qualitative analysis. In particular, fuzzy-set qualitative analysis (fsQCA) provides a nuanced analysis of data and offers actionable insights. Despite this, fsQCA has been underutilized in the social sciences. This chapter explores the application of fsQCA in the social sciences. The authors advance an argument for its wider adoption due to fsQCA's ability to disentangle the causal complexity involved in person- and policy-based contexts by applying a set-theoretic understanding of causation. The chapter provides an introduction to fsQCA for readers unfamiliar with the approach and advocates for its suitability within a broad range of social science studies.",

    "abstract": "Segmentation of brain tumors is a crucial step in the field of medical imaging, essential for the early identification and treatment of brain tumors. This process significantly influences patient care by facilitating timely intervention. Brain tumors originate from abnormal cell growth and proliferation that diverge from normal cell behavior, resulting in tumor development. Segmentation, the differentiating between normal brain tissue and tumor regions, is critical for precise diagnosis and effective treatment strategy. Historically, the task of segmentation has been manually performed by healthcare experts. This method is labor-intensive and difficult due to the intricate and diverse brain structure. Deep neural networks (DNNs), renowned for their prowess in image classification tasks, have been employed to overcome these obstacles. Specifically, the GTS (graph-based transductive segmentation) algorithm has been introduced to optimize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation. This advanced method enhances the efficiency of finding the closest optimal solutions by improving convergence, thereby significantly reducing the time required for solution identification. The GTS technique stands out for its remarkable accuracy rate of 97%, showcasing some substantial improvement over previous segmentation methods. This leap in accuracy expedites the diagnostic process and increases the likelihood of successful patient outcomes by enabling earlier and more precise tumor detection.",

Hydrogen is considered one of the most promising energy carriers and capable to replace fossil fuels and meet the world's energy demand and concomitantly reduce toxic emissions. Currently, the world produces around 50 million tonnes/year from the process (i.e., electrolysis of water, steam reforming of hydrocarbons, and auto-thermal processes), but these processes are not sustainable and economical due to energy requirements and waste/pollutants generation. These challenges required growing interest in renewable energy resources such as hydrogen as an energy carrier. Hydrogen production from renewable sources attracted recent research attention because of its potential for sustainability and diversity. Hydrogen can be produced by various thermal, chemical, and biological technologies that include steam reforming, electrolysis, biomass conversion, solar conversion, and biological conversion.",

However, the investigation of the social consequences of the convergence of this technology and concerns about justice and availability are still rare. The metaverse education that AI moved has the potential to increase the differences that already exist in education. In addition, the quality of the metaverse includes all concerns about social exile and the possibility of aligning virtual meetings with real social involvement caused by human behaviour that has excessive dependence on technology to build social connections.

Bachelor students involved in test lessons using laptops, where AI is generative, especially ChatGPT4, is used to produce and modify content, text, data, materials, and tasks. The findings show that ChatGPT4, a type of generative AI, may be used to adjust educational content to meet the knowledge and learning abilities of students with various levels of expertise. Generative material modified by AI was found to be enjoyed by undergraduate students. The use of generative AI in higher education has a big promise because it can promote learning and the development of skills that are motivated by students. Research findings show that the integration of human intelligence, artificial intelligence (AI), and the metaverse presents significant opportunities. Although there are concerns, it is undeniable that AI has the potential to increase human capacity and have transformative impacts on education. Responsible development and application of this technology are needed to guarantee its ability to improve the human experience. Additional investigations are needed to check for and reduce the possibility of social hazards while optimising the benefits of this revolutionary environment.",

Fault diagnosis in WSNs involves the identification, localization, and resolution of these faults to maintain network functionality and data integrity. Several approaches are commonly used for fault diagnosis in WSNs. These include centralized methods, where data is collected and analysed at a central node, distributed algorithms that leverage collaborative processing among sensor nodes, and hybrid techniques that combine elements of both centralized and distributed approaches. Additionally, advancements in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data fusion techniques have enhanced fault diagnosis capabilities in WSNs, enabling proactive detection and predictive maintenance. Challenges in fault diagnosis include energy efficiency, scalability, and adaptability to dynamic network conditions. Efficient diagnosis algorithms are required to minimize energy consumption while improving diagnosis latency, detection accuracy, and reducing false alarm rates.",

While some research studies have explored the potential impacts of digitalization on areas such as logistics and human resources, there has been a notable absence of similar investigations in the field of management control. In this context, this chapter examines the level of digitalization maturity in management control among forty-two Moroccan companies. This study has three main findings. First, the management control systems of the companies surveyed are “moderately” digitalized. Second, the age of the companies does not significantly affect this level of digitalization. Third, legal affiliation significantly influences the digitalization of management control; specifically, management control systems are more digitalized in subsidiaries of foreign groups compared to those of Moroccan groups or independent companies. This research work makes important contributions at both the theoretical and managerial levels.",

Despite the broad interest of academics and practitioners in digital transformation, little attention has been paid to the mediating role of business models in the link between digital transformation and SME performance. A survey of 419 innovative SMEs in France was conducted to examine the proposed conceptual model. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was relied upon to detect the correlation and linear regression of the study model. The results indicate that business models had a role in modifying the relationship between digital transformation and performance. The results contribute to deepening knowledge in the field of digital transformation and business models.

Inefficient power generation, unbalanced consumption patterns that lead to underutilization of expensive infrastructure on the one hand, and severe overload on the other, as well as urgent issues of national and global concern such as power system security and climate change are all driving this evolution. As the smart grid concept matures, we'll see dramatic growth in green power production: small production devices such as wind turbines and solar panels or solar farms, which have fluctuating capacity outside of the control of grid operators. Small companies that specialize in producing power under just certain conditions will boom in forthcoming years. Energy is stored in the storage during low-cost periods, and the stored energy is used during high-cost periods to avoid the expensive draw from the grid. The authors evaluate the impact of large-scale energy storage adoption on grid electricity demand.",

The purpose of prediction is necessary in every field since it could help us to stop the cause of occurring the error before any vulnerable activities could happen. Predictive maintenance is a method that consumes the direct monitoring of mechanical condition of plant equipment to decide the actual mean time to malfunction for each preferred machine. The authors try to estimate the fault that could occur in the machines and decide the time that could cause a critical situation. This prediction should be done effectively, and for this purpose, they have stepped into the concept of machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Legacy information systems can be a serious headache for companies because, on the one hand, these systems cannot be thrown away since they store a lot of valuable business knowledge over time, and on the other hand, they cannot be maintained easily at an acceptable cost. For many years, reengineering has been a solution to this problem because it facilitates the reuse of the software artifacts and knowledge embedded in the system. However, reengineering often fails due to the fact that it carries out non-standardized and ad hoc processes. Currently, software modernization, and particularly ADM (Architecture-Driven Modernization), standardized by the OMG, is proving to be an important solution to that problem, since ADM advocates carrying out reengineering processes taking into account the principles and standards of model-driven development. This chapter provides an overview of ADM and shows how it allows legacy information systems to evolve, making them more agile, preserving the embedded business knowledge, and reducing maintenance costs. Also, this chapter presents the software archeology process using ADM and some ADM success stories.",

The flexibility of VCC systems opens the door to myriad applications that contribute to the safety and comfort of the passengers. They are distributed, self-organizing communication networks built up by moving vehicles, and are thus characterized by very high node mobility and limited degrees of freedom in mobility patterns. Such particular features often make the standard networking protocol inefficient or unusable, hence the growing effort in the development of communication protocols, which are specific to vehicular networks. Routing protocols should be selected carefully after carrying out literature review. This chapter has investigated different on-demand routing protocols and focused to identify the efficient on-demand routing protocol that can give better performance in realistic environments of vehicular cloud computing systems.",

If we can accurately predict which customer or employee will leave their current company or organization, then it will save much time, effort, and cost of the employer and help them to hire or acquire substitutes in advance, and it would not create a problem in the ongoing progress of an organization. In this chapter, a comparative analysis between various machine learning approaches such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression is presented. The presented result will help us in identifying the behavior of employees who can be attired over the next time. Experimental results reveal that the logistic regression approach can reach up to 86% accuracy over other machine learning approaches.",

    "abstract": "A very challenging issue in real-world data is that in many domains like medicine, finance, marketing, web, telecommunication, management, etc. the distribution of data among classes is inherently imbalanced. A widely accepted researched issue is that the traditional classifier algorithms assume a balanced distribution among the classes. Data imbalance is evident when the number of instances representing the class of concern is much lesser than other classes. Hence, the classifiers tend to bias towards the well-represented class. This leads to a higher misclassification rate among the lesser represented class. Hence, there is a need of efficient learners to classify imbalanced data. This chapter aims to address the need, challenges, existing methods, and evaluation metrics identified when learning from imbalanced data sets. Future research challenges and directions are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "The internet of everything (IoE) envelopes the internet of things (IoT) that was simply focusing primarily on machine-to-machine sensor-based smart device communications. The IoE expands to include people and processes in a much more comprehensive scope. The internet of everything is expanding our ability to collect massive amounts of data for comprehensive analysis to achieve a level of understanding not previously possible. Since the internet of everything (IoE) has such a strong focus on collecting and analyzing data using smart sensor-enabled devices, eye tracking data is a perfect match. Eye tracking and other biometric sensor-based data can be collected and analyzed locally in real time through fog/edge computing or cloud-based big data analytics.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, the authors put forward the notion of internet of everything (IoE) as an effort to maximally connect our communication infrastructure to the universe, which can itself be regarded as the real IoE, an interconnected network of physical phenomena (i.e., Everything we perceive as independent wholes that persist through time, such as molecules, light, waves, living organisms, and celestial objects, with the purpose of gaining better understanding of its mechanisms and manipulating them to enable novel technologies via a networked sensing, analysis, and actuation approach). The strategy to outline the IoE effort is by dissecting the vast IoE landscape into IoXs according to their various application domains (Xs), for each of which the authors give an up-to-date account of the state-of-the-art in related fields and point out the challenges in contemporary research faces. They also discuss a wide spectrum of challenges and future research directions (e.g., ubiquitous connectivity, security, big data, etc., which are common to many IoXs and penetrate into the IoE effort in general).",

The design of the controller follows a number of steps. Firstly, based on the semi-group property of fractional order derivative, the system is transformed into a normalized fractional order system by means of a state transformation in order to facilitate the control design. Then, a simple linear state observer is constructed to estimate the unmeasured states of the transformed system. A neural network is incorporated to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions while a Nussbaum function is used to deal with the unknown control direction. In addition, the strictly positive real (SPR) condition, the Razumikhin lemma, the frequency distributed model, and the Lyapunov method are utilized to derive the parameter adaptive laws and to perform the stability proof.",

First, to overcome the difficulties arising from the actuator nonlinearities and nonaffine structures, the mean value theorem is introduced. Second, to deal with the uncertain nonlinear dynamics, the unknown control directions and the output constraints, neural networks, smooth Nussbaum-type functions, and asymmetric barrier Lyapunov functions are employed, respectively. Moreover, for satisfactorily designing the control updating laws and to carry out the stability analysis of the overall closed-loop system, the Backstepping technique is used. The main advantage about this research is that (1) the number of parameters to be adapted is much reduced, (2) the tracking errors converge to zero, and (3) the output constraints are not transgressed. At last, simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the newly presented design techniques.",

    "abstract": "Energy consumption is a constraint in the design architecture of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and internet of things (IoT). In order to overcome this constraint, many techniques have been proposed to enhance energy efficiency in WSNs. In existing works, several innovative techniques for the physical, the link, and the network layer of OSI model are implemented. Energy consumption in the WSNs is to find the best compromise of energy consumption between the various tasks performed by the objects, the detection, the processing, and the data communication tasks. It is this last task that consumes more energy. As a result, the main objective for the WSNs and the IoT is to minimize the energy consumed during this task. One of the most used solutions is to propose efficient routing techniques in terms of energy consumption. In this chapter, the authors present a review of related works on energy efficiency in WSNs and IoT. The network layer routing protocols are the main concerns in this chapter. The interest is focused on the issue of designing data routing techniques in WSNs and IoT.",

    "abstract": "As per the report of Grand View Research, the global Social CRM market is expected to grow to USD $81.9 billion by 2025. The report justifies that Social CRM has managed to exhibit a profound growth rate in a couple of years. Social CRM is now becoming a necessity for most of the businesses. The transformation of CRM went from being a strategy that focused on forming only financial bonds with customers to a business strategy that aims at establishing both transactional and interactional relationship with its customers. This change led to the evolution of a new version of CRM known as Social Customer Relationship Management. Social Media combined with CRM can benefit companies like never before. This chapter proposes a conceptual framework of a metamorphosis of CRM based on literature review. It presents the hospitality practitioners a reference to gain insights into the potential advantages like brand loyalty and positive word of mouth by the systematic implementation of Social CRM Strategies.",

    "abstract": "Applications that are serverless can be distributed (many services are connected for smooth operation), elastic (resources can be scaled up and down without limit), stateless (interactions and data aren't stored), event-driven (resources are allocated only when triggered by an event), and hostless (apps aren't hosted on a server). Serverless computing is becoming more and more popular as cloud adoption rises. In many respects, serverless computing unleashes the entire potential of cloud computing. We pay only for the resources consumed, and resources are allocated, increased, or decreased dynamically based on user requirements in real-time. It makes sure that when there are no user requests and the application is effectively dormant, resources are immediately scaled to zero. More scalability and significant cost reductions are the outcomes of this. According to research by Global Industry Insights, the serverless industry is expected to reach $30 billion in market value by the end of the forecast period, growing at an above-average rate of 25% between 2021 and 2027.",

Then, it provides an overview and more thorough explanation of the various kinds of changes that may need to be faced by service-oriented systems. To understand how such changes could be addressed, the chapter introduces a reference service life-cycle model which distinguishes between evolution, viz. the manual modification of the specification and implementation of the system during design-time, and (self-)adaptation, viz. the autonomous modification of a service-oriented system during operation. Based on the discussion of the key activities prescribed by that life-cycle, the chapter elaborates on the need for agility in both adaptation and evolution of service-oriented systems.",

    "abstract": "Agile methodologies have become the preferred choice for modern software development. These methods focus on iterative and incremental development, where both requirements and solutions develop through collaboration among cross-functional software development teams. The success of a software system is based on the quality result of each stage of development with proper test practice. A software test ontology should represent the required software test knowledge in the context of the software tester. Reusing test cases is an effective way to improve the testing of software. The workload of a software tester for test-case generation can be improved, previous software testing experience can be shared, and test efficiency can be increased by automating software testing. In this chapter, the authors introduce a software testing framework (STF) that uses rule-based reasoning (RBR), case-based reasoning (CBR), and ontology-based semantic similarity assessment to retrieve the test cases from the case library. Finally, experimental results are used to illustrate some of the features of the framework.",

The dynamical strategy allocates the available energy resources using the residual energy of a specific node, the distance to the base station, and the intensity of the data traffic of the fuzzy system. The proposed strategy provides real-time decisions on the transmission power, routing paths, and sleep/wake cycles. The system with different network conditions has been demonstrated against traditional static schemes with the standard network lifetime. The fuzzy-based strategy shows a 15% improvement in packet delivery rate and a 20% reduction in end-to-end delay. The proposed adaptive approach provides a good energy conservation capability, especially for the change in node density under different network conditions. The fuzzy-based dynamic power allocation strategy makes WSNs more efficient and extends their lifetime in IoT applications.",

The network nodes in charge of processing data and transferring information are constrained by the battery. Increasing the network's total lifespan is therefore essential to network optimization. Two important factors that are relevant in any application are the network's lifetime and the energy consumption for routing. In this chapter, the functionalities of genetic algorithms and low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy algorithm are discussed. This study provides a comparison of various energy optimization algorithms in terms of supporting mobility, power management, and multi-path routing.",

Meanwhile, directly predicting their performance is challenging due to the complicated internal structures. Fortunately, a knowledge-based machine learning method can provide a promising prediction and optimization strategy for the performance of energy systems. In this chapter, the authors show how they utilize the machine learning models trained from a large experimental database to perform precise prediction and optimization on a solar water heater (SWH) system. A new energy system optimization strategy based on a high-throughput screening (HTS) process is proposed. This chapter consists of: 1) comparative studies on varieties of machine learning models (artificial neural networks [ANNs], support vector machine [SVM], and extreme learning machine [ELM]) to predict the performances of SWHs; 2) development of an ANN-based software to assist the quick prediction; and 3) introduction of a computational HTS method to design a high-performance SWH system.",

These “intelligent” activities include thinking, reasoning, receiving stimuli from the environment and responding to them, solving puzzles, speaking and understanding language, etc. It was John McCarthy who coined the word artificial intelligence at the conference on computers in Dartmouth in 1954, indicating that its goal was to achieve a digital equivalent of human-level intelligence. In the 1970s, AI entered a low-productive period known as the AI winter. During this period, scientific and notably commercial activities in AI dropped dramatically. The victory of IBM's Deep Blue AI program over the reigning world chess champion in 1997 is probably hailed as the biggest achievement of AI. Yet another great AI achievement is the victory of IBM's Watson over the world Jeopardy champions in 2011.

In this method, the device is tested under conditions beyond its defined nominal specifications. Limits for this harsh condition is determined based on the calculations which are presented in chapters 3 and 4. If a problem occurs in implementing and operating process of the converter, accelerated aging tests decrease the time to failure. Theoretical concept of accelerated aging tests is described. Standard tests of electric power converters are presented. Equipment and test chambers for standard tests are explained. These tests contain all four various failure factors which are presented in chapter 2. Sample industrial examples are presented to demonstrate the procedure of the tests. Some accelerated aging tests may lead to destruction of the converter. Difference between destructive and nondestructive tests is presented. Sample devices after accelerated aging tests are shown.

This chapter proposes a new multicriteria group decision-making (MCGDM) strategy to overcome those issues. This strategy integrates the original MABAC method with trapezoidal fuzzy neutrosophic numbers (TrFNNs). First, the proposed method converts independent judgments from experts in the form of linguistic variables into TrFNNs and aggregates them using some aggregation operators. Next, it utilizes the functions of score and accuracy to rank the evaluated alternatives. By using the distance measure between the alternatives and the border approximation area, the proposed MABAC selects the best solution. Finally, the chapter illustrates an example of COVID-19 vaccine selection and a comparative analysis to show that the proposed MABAC has benefits to support indeterminate information and is more reasonable and practicable in handling MCGDM problems.",

The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process is used to determine the importance weight of each criterion and sub-criterion considered for the supplier selection, which are quality, cost, service level, supplier profile and risk. These weights are utilized in a mathematical model to determine the optimum order level of each row material from each supplier. The model considers capacity, demand, on-time delivery, quality and bill of materials. To determine the optimum order levels, the Bees Algorithm is applied to optimize this NP-hard type model under the constraints. The results showed that the Bees Algorithm performed better than Genetic Algorithm during the optimization stage.",

    "abstract": "We describe a model-based construction of an online tester for black-box testing. Contemporary model-based online test generators focusing mainly on computationally cheap but far from optimal planning strategies cover just a fraction of the wide spectrum of test control strategies. Typical examples of those used are simple random choice and anti-ant. Exhaustive planning during online testing of nondeterministic systems looks out of reach because of the low scalability of the methods in regard to the model size. The reactive planning tester (RPT) studied in this chapter is targeted to fill the gap between these two extremes. The key idea of RPT lies in offline static analysis of the IUT (implementation under test) model to prepare the data and constraints for efficient online reactive planning. The external behavior of the IUT is modelled as an output observable nondeterministic EFSM (extended finite state machine) with the assumption that all the transition paths are feasible. A test purpose is attributed to the transitions of the IUT model by a set of Boolean variables called traps that are used to measure the progress of the test run. We present a way to construct a tester that at runtime selects a suboptimal test path from trap to trap by finding the shortest path that covers unvisited traps within planning horizon. The principles of reactive planning are implemented in the form of the decision rules of selecting the shortest paths at runtime. Based on an industrial scale case study, namely the city lighting system controller, we demonstrate the practical use of the RPT for systems with high degree of nondeterminism, deep nested control loops, and requiring strictly bounded tester response time. Tuning the planning horizon of the RPT allows a trade-off to be found between close to optimal test length and scalability of tester behavior with computationally feasible expenses.",

Power imbalance between the load and the generation can severely affect system stability. Therefore, it is necessary that these imbalance conditions be addressed in the minimum time possible. It is well known that power system frequency is directly proportional to the speed of rotation of synchronous machines and is also a function of the active power demand. As a consequence, when active power demand is greater than the generation, synchronous generators tends to slow down and the frequency decreases to even below threshold if not quickly addressed. One of the most common methods of restoring frequency is the use of under frequency load shedding (UFLS) techniques. In this chapter, load shedding techniques are presented in general but with special focus on UFLS.",

    "abstract": "Another alternative derating, which was described in the previous chapter, is application of fault tolerant structures for the power converter. Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of a failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components. Fault tolerant systems are systems that can be operating after fault occurrence with no degraded performance in their basic functional requirements. This is the main difference between fault tolerant systems and derated systems. In this chapter, some methods for fault tolerance in electric power converters are presented. Fault tolerance is almost the only method for achieving a desired reliability in a converter that operates with non-zero fault possibility. There are two main approaches for this aim: re-configuration of the faulty system and using redundant systems. Redundancy is the provision of functional capabilities that would be unnecessary in a fault-free environment. Various types of redundant systems as passive and active redundancy are described and their application in power supply systems is presented. A new approach for a reliable and fault tolerant power supply is proposed and justified with experimental results. The concept of fault tolerance in electrical machines is presented.",

    "abstract": "Edge AI changes data processing (EI) strategy incorporating powerful AI capabilities directly at the network's edge, where devices and sensors gather data. This convergence solves cloud-centric AI's latency and bandwidth challenges by enabling real-time analysis and decision-making. Three paradigm-shifting effects of edge intelligence include localized processing allowing real-time data analysis and quick responses. Second, minimizing large-scale data transfers to centralized cloud services greatly minimizes latency. Third, edge intelligence's distributed architecture reduces centralized system demand, boosting infrastructure resilience and scalability and enabling new developments. Imagine smart cities using edge-based analysis to enhance traffic flow or autonomous cars making quick sensor-based choices. Data at the network edge needs security. AI algorithms must work on low-resource edge devices. Edge intelligence can solve these issues and enable near-instantaneous network decision-making, changing numerous industries. Edge computing (EC) solved this problem by moving processing closer to data sources, but edge intelligence introduced AI at the network edge. This unique solution uses AI to increase edge device capabilities beyond data processing. A network edge device can learn, decide, and infer in real-time with EI. Integration reduces latency, boosts efficiency, and empowers intelligent devices. This chapter covers the need for solid EI infrastructure and cutting-edge AI models to optimize the edge device (ED). AI's astounding results in numerous fields have inspired EC researchers to investigate its potential, particularly in machine learning (ML), a fast-growing discipline of AI. This chapter defines EC and explains its popularity. EC's fundamental issues and flaws in traditional methods are then examined. This chapter shows research on optimizing EC and applying AI within the EC framework for different areas to stimulate new research lines that exploit AI and EC's synergy.",

Unprecedented prospects for improved efficiency, real-time monitoring, and data-driven decision-making are presented by this paradigm change. But even in the middle of these developments, data security becomes an increasingly important issue. This study examines the various facets of the change of the supply chain ecosystem in the context of the Internet of Things and the smart grid, with a particular emphasis on the difficulties and solutions pertaining to data security. The smart grid and supply chain operations' integration of IoT devices create several weak points that are open to cyberattacks, underscoring the necessity of putting strong security measures in place as soon as possible.",

In a cloud data center, numerous physical machines (PMs), also called servers, host various VMs. Placement of these VMs in Physical Machines is a critical task as there are many factors that need to be considered. Nature-inspired optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Ant Colony Optimization are inspired by natural phenomena and behaviour. These algorithms have been used in the past to generate near-optimal solutions in polynomial time for computationally intractable problems like VM Placement Problems (VPP).

This new model is moderately supported by an analysis of data obtained from 134 end-users in 16 Korean business organizations. The results imply that we should pay attention to the fit between task uncertainty and utlization to promote user satisfaction. The results also provide a framework which resolves the inconsistent relationship between utilization and user satisfaction.

To a computer, images are either a raster image or a vector image. Simply put, raster images are a sequence of pixels with discreet numerical values for color; vector images are a set of color-annotated polygons.

Precise and concise analytics guarantee perfect decision-making and action. We need competent and highly integrated analytics platform for speeding up, simplifying and streamlining data analytics, which is becoming a hard nut to crack due to the multi-structured and massive quantities of data. On the infrastructure front, we need highly optimized compute, storage and network infrastructure for achieving data analytics with ease. Another noteworthy point is that there are batch, real-time, and interactive processing of data. Most of the personal and professional applications need real-time insights in order to produce real-time applications. That is, real-time capture, processing, and decision-making are being insisted and hence the edge or fog computing concept has become very popular.

    "abstract": "Power apparatus windings are subjected to voltage surges arising from transient events in power systems. High frequency surges that reach windings can cause high voltage stresses, which are usually concentrated in the sections near to the line end, or produce part-winding resonance, which can create high oscillatory voltages. Determining the transient voltage response of power apparatus windings to high frequency surges is generally achieved by means of a model of the winding structure and some computer solution method. The accurate prediction of winding and coil response to steep-fronted voltage surges is a complex problem for several reasons: the form of excitation may greatly vary with the source of the transient, and the representation of the winding depends on the input frequency and its geometry. This chapter introduces the most basic models used to date for analyzing the response of power apparatus windings to steep-fronted voltage surges. These models can be broadly classified into two groups: (i) models for determining the internal voltage distribution and (ii) models for representing a power apparatus seen from its terminals.",

    "abstract": "Growing demands are causing increased pressure on the electrical infrastructure and perpetually escalated energy prices. Utilities around the world have been considering demand-side management in their strategic planning. The costs of constructing and operating a new capacity generation unit are increasing every day as well as transmission, distribution, and land issues for new generation plants, which force the utilities to search for other alternatives. Here, demand-side management has been implemented as it is less expensive to intelligently influence a load than to build a new power plant or install electrical based storage device. In this chapter, the author has discussed energy efficiency and demand response fulfilling the criteria of energy management which usually tries to take influence onto the energy consumption of a number of energy consumers. The explained demand-side management technical objectives are peak clipping, valley filling, load shifting, load building, energy conservation, and flexible load shape.",

In opportunistic networks, nodes are able to communicate with each other even if the route between source to destination does not already exist. Opportunistic networks have to be delay tolerant in nature (i.e., able to tolerate larger delays). Delay tolerant network (DTNs) uses the concept of “store-carry-forward” of data packets. DTNs are able to transfer data or establish communication in remote area or crisis environment where there is no network established. DTNs have many applications like to provide low-cost internet provision in remote areas, in vehicular networks, noise monitoring, extreme terrestrial environments, etc. It is therefore very promising to identify aspects for integration and inculcation of opportunistic network methodologies and technologies into delay tolerant networking. In this chapter, the authors emphasize delay tolerant networks by considering its architectural, routing, congestion, and security issues.",

Additionally, various uncertainties include in the statistical data makes common mathematical analysis is not competent to deal with. Hence, this paper presents the Fuzzy Random Regression approach to determine the coefficient whereby statistical data used contain uncertainties namely, fuzziness and randomness. The proposed methods are able to provide coefficient information in the model setting and consideration of uncertainties in the evaluation process. The assessment of coefficient value is given by Weight Absolute Percentage Error of Fuzzy Decision. It clarifies the results between fuzzy decision and non-fuzzy decision that shows the distance of different between both approaches.

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the size of digital media collections. Because emotion is an important component in the human classification and retrieval of digital media, emotional semantic detection from multimedia has been an active research area in recent decades. This chapter introduces and surveys advances in this area. First, the authors propose a general frame of research on affective multimedia content analysis, which includes physical, psychological and physiological space, alongside the relationships between the three. Second, the authors summarize research conducted on emotional semantic detection from images, videos, and music. Third, three typical archetypal systems are introduced. Last, explanations of several critical problems that are faced in database, the three spaces, and the relationships are provided, and some strategies for problem resolution are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Integration of vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) and cellular network is a promising architecture for future machine-to-machine applications. This integration helps the vehicles have steady internet connection through cellular network (i.e., LTE), and at same time communicate with other vehicles. However, dead spot areas and unsuccessful handoff processes due to the high speed of vehicles that can disrupt the implementation of this kind of architecture. In this chapter, simplified cluster-based gateway selection (SCGS) scheme for multi-hop relay in VANET network is proposed. The scheme is achieved by utilizing a new routing protocol called an enhanced hybrid wireless mesh protocol (E-HWMP). The simulations results show that SCGS scheme through E-HWMP protocol performed better than ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. Furthermore, SCGS scheme through E-HWMP is compared with other cluster-based gateway selections used in the previous works; the result shows that SCGS scheme through E-HWMP protocol outperforms the other cluster-based gateway selections schemes.",

    "abstract": "Mobile is getting increasingly popular and almost all applications are shifting into smartphones. Even though lots of advantages are there for smartphones, they are constrained by limitations in battery charge and the processing capacity. For running resource-intensive IoT applications like processing sensor data and dealing with big data coming from the IoT application, the capacity of existing smartphones is not enough, as the battery will be drained quickly, and it will be slow. Offloading is one of the major techniques through which mobile and cloud can be connected together and has emerged to reduce the complexity and increase the computation power of mobiles. Other than depending on the distant cloud for offloading, the extended version of cloud called fog computing can be utilized. Through offloading, the computationally intensive tasks can be shifted to the edge fog devices, and the results can be collected back at the mobile side reducing the burden. This chapter has developed mobile cloud offloading architecture for decision making using fuzzy logic where a decision is made as to whether we can shift the application to cloud or not depending on the current parameters of both cloud and the mobile side. Cloud computing introduces a number of variables depending on which offloading decision must be taken. In this chapter, the authors propose a fuzzy-logic-based algorithm which takes into consideration all the parameters at the mobile and cloud that will affect the offloading decision.",

Fog computing is suitable for many IoT services as it has many extensive benefits such as reduced latency, decreased bandwidth, and enhanced security. However, the characteristics of fog raise new security and privacy issues. The existing security and privacy measures of cloud computing cannot be directly applied to fog computing.

In this chapter, the possibilities of using Decision Diagrams (DD) for uniform diagnostic modeling of digital systems at different levels of abstraction are discussed.

The authors differentiate two general types of DDs – logic level binary DDs (BDD) and high level DDs (HLDD). Special classes of BDDs are described: structurally synthesized BDDs (SSBDD) and structurally synthesized BDDs with multiple inputs (SSMIBDD). A method of iterative synthesis of SSBDDs and SSMIBDDs is discussed. Three methods for synthesis of HLDDs for representing digital systems at higher levels are described: iterative superposition of HLDDs for high-level structural representations of systems, symbolic execution of procedural descriptions for functional representations of systems, and creation of vector HLDDs (VHLDD) on the basis of using shared HLDDs for compact representing of a given set of high level functions. The nodes in DDs can be modeled as generic locations of faults. For more precise general specification of faults different logic constraints are used. A functional fault model to map the low level faults to higher levels, particularly, to map physical defects from transistor level to logic level is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Spatial variability in soil properties is still in the exploratory stage and, despite of an increase in probabilistic and statistical analysis, many challenges remain in using spatial variability of soil properties in practical designs. This chapter addresses the problem of how to incorporate spatial variability of soil properties by using Geostatistics. Existing researches in variability analysis tend to focus on the distribution of the soil properties, reliability based design and simulation of random fields. However, there is limited evidence that researchers have approached the issue of spatial variability in soil properties. Consequently, the aim of this chapter is to develop a framework for incorporating spatial variability in soil properties in prediction analysis and how it could be applied to infrastructure design. The developed framework is validated by performing spatial variability analysis of soil strength parameters evaluated from the piezocone penetration test data.",

    "abstract": "Sizing analog, mixed-signal, and particularly radio-frequency circuits generally relies on the experience of the designer. Metaheuristics have been recently proposed, and it has been shown that they can arguably replace the classical iterative simulation-based trial/error approaches. Among the most known metaheuristics, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has already successfully been used to deal with analog circuit performance optimization. Despite the fact that ACO is robust and has a good intrinsic intensive research strategy, it suffers from its greedy requirement in computation time. In this chapter, the authors deal with the improvement of the ACO technique by integrating in this algorithm a backtracking search technique that has the role to act on the ratio of the accumulated pheromones, thus reducing the computation time. The new algorithm is called BA-ACO. Performances of BA-ACO are highlighted through some RF-applications. ADS simulation results are given to show the validity of the proposed algorithm.",

The approach is based on the multi-level decomposition of the network model, which allows us to proceed from the initial problem to less complex sub-problems of a smaller dimension. New algorithms are developed to numerically solve the parameter optimization problems of heat supply systems: an effective algorithm based on the multi-loop optimization method, which allows us to consider hierarchical creation of the network model in the course of problem solving; a parallel high-speed algorithm based on the dynamic programming method.

    "abstract": "While the rapid development in semiconductor technologies makes it possible to manufacture integrated circuits (ICs) with multiple processors, so called Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC), ICs manufactured in recent semiconductor technologies are becoming increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which enforces fault tolerance. Work on fault tolerance has mainly focused on safety-critical applications; however, the development of semiconductor technologies makes fault tolerance also needed for general-purpose systems. Different from safety-critical systems where meeting hard deadlines is the main requirement, it is for general-purpose systems more important to minimize the average execution time (AET). The contribution of this chapter is two-fold. First, the authors present a mathematical framework for the analysis of AET. Their analysis of AET is performed for voting, rollback recovery with checkpointing (RRC), and the combination of RRC and voting (CRV) where for a given job and soft (transient) error probability, the authors define mathematical formulas for each of the fault-tolerant techniques with the objective to minimize AET while taking bus communication overhead into account. And, for a given number of processors and jobs, the authors define integer linear programming models that minimize AET including communication overhead. Second, as error probability is not known at design time and it can change during operation, they present two techniques, periodic probability estimation (PPE) and aperiodic probability estimation (APE), to estimate the error probability and adjust the fault tolerant scheme while the IC is in operation.",

    "abstract": "Formal and semiformal techniques can play complementary roles in MDA-based software development processes. We consider it beneficial for both semiformal and formal specification techniques. On the one hand, semiformal techniques lack a precise semantics; however, they have the ability to visualize language constructions, allowing a great difference in the productivity of the specification process, especially when the graphical view is supported by means of good tools. On the other hand, formal specification allows us to produce a precise and analyzable software specification and clarifies the intended meaning of metamodels, helps to validate model transformations, and provides reference for implementations; however, they require familiarity with formal notations that most designers and implementers do not currently have and the learning curve for the application of these techniques requires considerable time. A combination of metamodeling and formal specification techniques can help us to address MDAbased processes such as reverse engineering, forward engineering and round-trip engineering. In light of this, we propose to use the algebraic metamodeling language, called NEREUS which can be viewed as an intermediate notation. NEREUS can be integrated with different formal languages and object-oriented languages. It is particularly suited for specifying metamodels based on the concepts of entity, relation and system. Most of the MOF metamodel concepts can be mapped directly to NEREUS.",

Cloud computing has centralized architecture and is not scalable towards the emerging internet of things (IoT) landscape of the grid. Further, under large-scale integration of renewables, this framework could be bogged down by congestion, latency, and subsequently poor quality of service (QoS). This calls for a distributed architecture called fog computing, which imbibes both clouds as well as the end-devices to collect, process, and act upon the data locally at the edge for low latency applications prior to forwarding them to the cloud for more complex operations. Fog computing offers high performance and interoperability, better scalability and visibility, and greater availability in comparison to a grid relying only on the cloud. In this chapter, a prospective research roadmap, future challenges, and opportunities to apply fog computing on smart grid systems is presented.",

    "abstract": "A microgrid is a representation of controllable electrical power network, which comprises the distributed generation (DG) such as micro-hydro, wind turbines, photovoltaic arrays, bio-mass generation, battery energy storage systems (BESSs), and a group of interconnected load. A typical microgrid can be operated in either grid connected or island mode. The issue of unintentional islanding in microgrid is a major challenge for power engineers as it may harm the service personnel working during maintenance or restoration of the main grid. In literature, various passive, active, and hybrid islanding detection methods (IDMs) have been developed and implemented by researchers/engineers. In this chapter, the proposed IDMs from the recent literature have been analyzed and briefly discussed. The primary requirement of IDMs is fast and accurate detection of main grid failure and should not deteriorate the power quality of distribution networks.",

    "abstract": "Systems with high dependability requirements are increasingly relying on complex on-line fault management systems. Such fault management systems involve a combination of multiple steps – monitoring, data analysis, planning, and execution – that are typically independently developed and optimized. We argue that it is inefficient and ineffective to improve any particular fault management step without taking into account its interactions and dependencies with the rest of the steps. Through six real-life examples, we demonstrate this inefficiency and how it results in systems that either under-perform or are over-budget. We propose a holistic approach to fault management that is aware of all relevant aspects, and explicitly considers the couplings between the different fault management steps. We believe it will produce systems that will better meet cost, performance, and dependability objectives.",

    "abstract": "ICT service-providers are to daily face the problem of delivering ICT services (data processing (Dp) and/or telecommunication (Tlc) services) assuring the best compromise between Quality of Service (QoS) and Energy Optimization. Indeed, any operation of saving energy involves waste in the QoS. This holds both for Dp and for Tlc services. This paper introduces models the providers may use to support their decisions in the delivery of ICT services. Dp systems totalize millions of servers all over the world that need to be electrically powered. Dp systems are also used in the government of Tlc systems, which also require Tlc-specific power, both for mobile networks and for wired networks. Research is thus expected to investigate into methods to reduce ICT power consumption. This paper investigates ICT power management strategies that look at compromises between energy saving and QoS. Various optimizing ICT power management policies are studied that optimize the ICT power consumption (minimum absorbed Watts), the ICT performance (minimum response-time), and the ICT performance-per-Watt.",

Intermediate velocity field is solved by fractional steps method. At the second stage, three-dimensional Poisson equation is solved by the Fourier method in combination with tridiagonal matrix method (Thomas algorithm). At the third stage it is expected that the transfer is only due to the pressure gradient. Finally stage equation for temperature solved like momentum equation with fractional step method. To increase the order of approximation compact scheme was used. Then qualitatively and quantitatively approximate the basic laws of the hydrothermal processes depending on different hydrometeorological conditions are determined.",

Thus, a significant shift has happened to these common applications to focus only on their usage than on their maintenance. However, today’s software development projects spend a noteworthy amount of resources to setup and maintain necessary development tools–over and over again. Thus, a similar shift for these development tools in the future would enable to spend valuable resources more on the actual project’s goals than on the tools’ maintenance. Especially development projects for cyber-physical systems, which interact with the real life’s surroundings by relying on sensors and actuators, have specific needs when using cloud-based solutions. In this contribution, preconditions, design decisions, and limitations of a cloud-based testing approach for CPS are outlined and discussed on the example “Hesperia.” “Hesperia” bases on the experiences from the development of “Caroline”–an autonomously driving vehicle for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. “Hesperia” as a cloud-based testing approach was tested 2009 during the development of an autonomously driving vehicle at the University of California, Berkeley.",

    "abstract": "For several years, many authors have predicted that nano-scale integrated devices and circuits will have a rising sensitivity to both transient and permanent faults effects. Essentially, there seems to be an emerging demand for building highly dependable hardware / software systems from unreliable components. Most of the effort has so far gone into the detection and compensation of transient fault effects. More recently, also the possibility of repairing permanent faults, due to either production flaws or to wear-out effects after some time of operation in the field of application, needs further investigation. While built-in self test (BIST) and even self repair (BISR) for regular structures such as static memories (SRAMs) is well understood, concepts for in-system repair of irregular logic and interconnects are few and mainly based on field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGAs) as the basic implementation. In this chapter, the authors try to analyse different schemes of logic (self-) repair with respect to cost and limitations, using repair schemes that are not based on FPGAs. It can be shown that such schemes are feasible, but need lot of attention in terms of hidden single points of failure.",

    "abstract": "Many real world problems are characterized by multiple goals, often conflicting in nature and compete with one another. Multi-objective optimization problems (MOOPs) require the simultaneous optimization of several non-commensurable and conflicting objectives. In the past, several studies have used conventional approaches to solve the MOOPs by adopting weighted approach or constrained approach, which may face difficulties while generating Pareto optimal solutions, if optimal solution lies on non-convex or disconnected regions of the objective function space. An effective algorithm should have an ability to learn from earlier performance to direct proper selection of weights for further evolutions. To achieve these goals, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become effective means in recent past, which can generate a population of solutions in each iteration and offer a set of alternatives in a single run. This chapter presents an effective MOEA, namely multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) for problems of solving water, environmental systems.",

This approach weighs specified criteria via fuzzy SWARA according to the expert evaluations and ranks the alternatives via fuzzy MARCOS. This study aims to select sustainable health tourism site according to the criteria by decision makers. Sensitivity analysis is performed by creating different scenarios, and the results are discussed.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of cognitive science concerned with intelligent machines capable of doing tasks formerly accomplished by humans. It focuses on using computers to perform activities that require knowledge, perception, reasoning, comprehension, and cognitive talents. AI algorithms can be trained to exploit individual actions, preferences, opinions, and interests. They can educate machines to behave in human-like ways. Furthermore, AI can learn these habits much faster than humans. Artificial intelligence is used in various industries to automate and increase the efficacy of specific processes and excessively in social media. Organizations use social media to reach many people by assessing their general perception and learning about their feelings and reactions to brands and products through AI However, there is a knowledge gap in the literature when holistically exploring AI's role in social media, its application, challenges, and opportunities.",

In this paper, the authors introduce a pedestrian detection application used for pedestrian safety. The authors proposed a deep fully convolutional neural network (DFCNN) for pedestrian detection. The proposed model is suitable for mobile implementation. To do this, the authors propose to build lightweight blocks using convolution layers, and replace pooling layers and fully connected layers with convolution layers. Training and testing of the proposed DFCNN model for pedestrian detection were performed using the Caltech dataset. The proposed DFCNN has achieved 85% of average precision and an inference speed of 30 FPS. The reported results have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed DFCNN for pedestrian detection. The achieved performance was low computation complexity and high performance.",

Along with that, the chapter shows how quantum machine learning is being used in real-world settings in a variety of fields, such as drug discovery, financial modelling, image identification, and natural language processing. All fundamental subatomic particles fall into two classes, based on how identical particles of each type behave when swapped. They are either fermions, a class that includes electrons and other particles that make up matter, or bosons, which include particles of light known as photons. Data encoding is often the most crucial step of quantum machine learning with classical data. It illustrates the possible advantages and insights that quantum algorithms can offer to various fields and analyses the ongoing research projects aimed at converting conventional machine learning models for quantum platforms.",

Models like neural networks and stochastic gradient descent have their own “go-to” training algorithms, each with their own set of supporting terminology and communities of experts. Since the specifics of gate decomposition, compilation, and error correction all depend heavily on the physical implementation of qubits and quantum gates, it has been difficult to design quantum hardware capable of running such algorithms. Therefore, the authors can only provide asymptotic estimations of total execution times. Since developing quantum hardware is so prohibitively expensive, researchers are incentivized to use terms like “superior quantum algorithms” to justify their work. This has given rise to the contentious term “quantum supremacy” to describe experiments that definitively show a difference between classical and quantum levels of computational complexity.",

To demonstrate the supremacy, obtained results are compared with some existing control algorithms.

However, the selection of technologies for establishing intelligent cites has to be made after a careful consideration of multiple factors. There are several technologies coming and going without contributing anything substantial for the originally visualized and articulated needs, and hence, the choice plays a vital role in shaping up and strengthening our cities for future challenges and changes. Another noteworthy point is that instead of going for a single technology, it is prudent and pertinent to embrace a cluster of technologies to reach the desired state comfortably. Technology clusters are becoming prominent these days. Especially considering the growing complexity of smart cities (being touted as the system of systems), the need for a collection of competent technologies is being felt across not only the technology-cluster choice but also the appropriate usage of it also is pivotal in achieving the target in a risk-free and relaxed manner. Thus, any smart city strategy has to clearly illuminate resilient technologies and methodologies together towards accelerating and attaining the varied goals of smart cities in this vast and vivacious planet. In this chapter, the authors discuss the immense potential and promise of the newly coined paradigm of the internet of things (IoT) in making next-generation cities that sharply elevate the features, facilities, and functionalities of our crumbling and clogging cities.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture holds paramount significance in Pakistan due to its high impact on gross domestic product (GDP). However, there is huge gap between actual production and estimated production in agriculture due to manual farming system, which is time-consuming, inefficient, and labor-intensive. As of today, ultra-modern technology such as Internet of Things (IoT) can assist in acquiring timely and accurate crop information essential for the success of precision agriculture technology. Towards such ends, the authors propose an IoT-based crop health monitoring system comprised of different sensors used in agricultural fields. Additionally, low altitude remote sensing platforms, such as drones, are used to capture the spectral imagery of the entire crop field of the study region. The development of such a system can be instrumental for crop status monitoring and localizing the areas under stress to maximize the agricultural output by leveraging the IoT technology.",

Human operators' intervention and interaction is significantly reduced by connecting machines and creating intelligent networks along the entire value chain that can communicate and control each other autonomously. The difference between IoT and IIoT is that where consumer IoT often focuses on convenience for individual consumers, industrial IoT is strongly focused on improving the efficiency, safety, and productivity of operations with a focus on return on investment.

Ultimately, this chapter provides a platform to develop an audit framework with associated metrics borrowed from ONA.

Each of those particular reference states, defined by an equation, is unstable in the formal sense, but it is passed through or hovered about by the observed process. Information geometry gives precise meaning for nearness and neighbourhood in a state space of processes, naturally quantifying proximity of a process to a particular state via an information theoretic metric structure on smoothly parametrized families of probability density functions. We illustrate some aspects of the methodology through case studies: inhomogeneous statistical evolutionary rate processes for epidemics, amino acid spacings along protein chains, constrained disordering of crystals, distinguishing nearby signal distributions and testing pseudorandom number generators.",

    "abstract": "Voltage surges arising from transient events, such as switching operations or lightning discharges, are one of the main causes of transformer winding failure. The voltage distribution along a transformer winding depends greatly on the waveshape of the voltage applied to the winding. This distribution is not uniform in the case of steep-fronted transients since a large portion of the applied voltage is usually concentrated on the first few turns of the winding. High frequency electromagnetic transients in transformers can be studied using internal models (i.e., models for analyzing the propagation and distribution of the incident impulse along the transformer windings), and black-box models (i.e., models for analyzing the response of the transformer from its terminals and for calculating voltage transfer). This chapter presents a summary of the most common models developed for analyzing the behaviour of transformers subjected to steep-fronted waves and a description of procedures for determining the parameters to be specified in those models. The main section details some test studies based on actual transformers in which models are validated by comparing simulation results to laboratory measurements.",

To overcome this, quasi-oppositional biogeography based-optimization (QOBBO) for optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) is presented in this study. In the proposed QOBBO algorithm, oppositional based learning (OBL) concept is integrated with BBO algorithm to improve the search space of the algorithm. For validation purpose, the results obtained by the proposed QOBBO approach are compared with those obtained by BBO and other algorithms available in the literature.

The scientific and methodical base for its description and research offers to accept the fundamental principles of the theory of hydraulic circuits, bi-level programming, principles of economics in the energy sector. Distinctive feature of the developed mathematical model is that it, along with traditionally solved tasks within the bilateral relations heat sources – consumers of heat, considers a network component with physics and technology properties of a heat network inherent in it, and also the economic factors connected with costs of production and transport of heat energy. This approach gives the chance to define the optimum levels of load of heat sources, providing the set demand for heat energy from consumers taking into account receiving with heat sources of the greatest possible profit and performance thus of conditions of formation of the minimum costs in heat networks during the considered time period. Practical realization of the developed mathematical model is considered by the example of the heat supply system with two heat sources, working for single heat networks.

The advantage is that deterministic chaotic systems are described by simple nonlinear equations, and therefore, they are straightforward to implement in hardware. To ensure that the generated sequence has the desired Probability Density Function (PDF), the chaotic map, which is the heart of the system, is synthesized using an approach based on the theory of positive matrices method.

However, power supply scaling demands less threshold voltage, which rises leakage current. Several low power techniques have been devised. This chapter deals with the non-conventional low power design solutions, based on adiabatic switching theory. In such circuits, the energy rather than getting dissipated during every cycle, is transferred back and forth between the logic and power-clock sources. A brief discussion on the reversible logic circuits will be presented followed by the fully adiabatic and quasi-adiabatic circuits. The use of power-clock sources for operating the adiabatic circuits will also be introduced. The generalized energetics of an adiabatic circuit followed by the typical loss models of the adiabatic families are presented. Some of the adiabatic circuits employing CMOS transistors are introduced in the chapter. A short comparison for the adiabatic circuit leakage models follows.",

This has made the topic of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), a major concern for aircraft safety. The use of composite materials worsens this situation, for their poor shielding and low conductive capabilities. Some of the main experimental E3 certification scenarios used in aeronautics are revisited in this chapter. Guidelines to achieve simple, yet accurate, numerical models of them are provided, with appropriate tradeoffs between computational simplicity and accuracy. The numerical method, endowed with extended capabilities, has been chosen for this task for its ability and efficiency to deal with complex problems of arbitrary materials. The feature selective validation (FSV) IEEE standard procedure, commonly used to quantify the comparison of data in electromagnetic problems, is also revisited. The simulation of three different air vehicles in several certification scenarios is finally described and the numerical results compared to experimental data.",

This is particularly evident for embedded systems which are often deployed in unprotected environments and at the same time being constrained by limited resources. Security and trust have also become important considerations in the design of virtually all modern embedded systems as they are utilized in critical and sensitive applications such as in transportation, national infrastructure, military equipment, banking systems, and medical devices. The increase in software content and network connectivity has made them vulnerable to fast spreading software-based attacks such as viruses and worms, which were hitherto primarily the concern of personal computers, servers, and the internet.

The feasibility of mishap in induction motors is less, but they are prone to faults, which are left unobserved most of the time. Hence, more attention has been paid to detection and diagnosis of incipient faults to prevent damage spreading and increase the lifetime of the motor. To detect and diagnose the faults, online condition monitoring of the machine has been utilized in a wide manner. At present, focus is made on optimization procedures for fault diagnosis in induction motors to obtain a quick assessment at industry level. This chapter discloses an overview of various types of possible faults in induction motors. In addition, the conventional (invasive) and innovative techniques (noninvasive), especially motor current signature analysis (MCSA), techniques for fault detection and diagnosis in induction machines are covered with a focus on future research.",

The interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems (IT2FLS) are used to approximate the plant dynamics represented by unknown functions of the system, and the IT2F adaptation law adjusts the consequent parameters of the rules based on a Lyapunov synthesis approach. One of the main contributions in this work is the use of an IT2F and an adaptive fractional order PIλ control law to eliminate the chattering action in the control signal. Based on fractional order Lyapunov stability criterion, stability analysis is performed for the proposed method for an acceptable synchronization error level. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through the synchronization of two different fractional order chaotic gyro systems. Simulations are implemented using a numerical method based on Grünwald-Letnikov approach to solve the fractional differential equations.",

Discretization of such domains itself may introduce significant numerical errors into the solution. Specifically, in phase transition or moving boundary problems, discretization of the domain is a time-consuming and complex process. In these problems, at each time step, the computational domain may change its shape and need to be re-meshed accordingly for the purpose of accuracy and stability of the solution.

In the same way, conditions are provided in order to allow the reconstruction of the states and the unknown input which is the message in this case.

In the first section, the new developments in DC Microgrids are discussed, then, the Modelling of renewable energy resources based DC Microgrid using characteristics and mathematics equations of each component are presented and then they are simulated by MATLAB. Afterward, the fault analysis and fault current behavior of the studied DC Microgrid are investigated. In the second section, a method of protecting the DC Microgrid and locating the fault in different parts of the system are proposed. The proposed method protects DC Microgrid using localized protection devices. And, the effectiveness of the proposed protection method is validated in a DC Microgrid with ring configuration. GENERAL INTRODUCTION This chapter is summarized as follows: in the first section, the new developments on DC Microgrids are discussed and future trends of DC Microgrids in power grid, aircraft and vehicles are introduced. Then, a DC Microgrid including Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbine (WT), battery, DC motor, and power electronic converters is simulated in MATLAB for fault studies. In addition, the behavior of these components during fault is investigated by mathematical and simulation analysis. The protection challenges and constraints are also discussed in this section. In the second section, the new protection methods for DC Microgrids are presented and compared, then, a protection method based on the characteristics of the DC Microgrids and DC current nature is proposed. The protection method uses communication links and localized protection devices to locate and detect fault. In addition, this method uses the equation of current and voltage variation to find the location of fault. Finally, the proposed protection method isolates the faulty zone and insures the normal operation of other zones. The presented method uses the characteristics of current to detect the location of faults in the DC Microgrid. As a final point, the results of the proposed methods are shown, and the effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated by simulation in MATLAB environment.",

Then the Bag-of-Word model of the dataset is converted into vector representation which corresponds to a number of words in the vocabulary. Each word in the review documents is assigned with a score and the scores are later represented in vector representation which is later fed as input to neural model. In the Kera's deep learning library, the neural models will be simple feedforward network models with fully connected layers called ‘Dense'. Bigram language models are developed to classify encoded documents as either positive or negative. At first, reviews are converted to lines of token and then encoded to bag-of-words model. Finally, a neural model is developed to score bigram of words with word scoring modes.",

    "abstract": "Variable displacement axial piston hydraulic pumps (VDAP) are the heart of any hydraulic system and are commonly used in the industrial sector for its high load capacity, efficiency, and good performance in the handling of high pressures and speeds. Due to this configuration, the most common faults are related to the wear and tear of internal components, which decrease the operational performance of the hydraulic system and increase maintenance costs. So, through data acquisition such as signals of pressure and the digital processing of them, it is possible to detect, classify, and identify faults or symptoms in hydraulic machinery. These activities form the basis of a condition-based maintenance (CBM) program. This chapter shows the developed methodology to detect and classify a wear fault of valve plate taking into account six conditions and the facilities providing by wavelet analysis and ANNs.",

The timing traces users when present at home and out of the home. But how does one secure this information from the attacker? There is a need for IoT devices security. As there are three layers of IoT devices—the application layer, network layer, and perception layer—three layers to be secure. IoT devices are heterogeneous and constrain energy consumption. The proposed solution in this chapter is three-way authentication of IoT devices by generating tokens from the device serial number and from the few configuration devices at the network layer.

According to the level and type of the dysfunctions, there are a variety of designs available in clinics. Different AFO designs, such as solid, dynamic, and hinged can be prescribed for different abnormalities. New designs lead to development of new manufacturing methods. The most conventional manufacturing technique includes a molding process in which the lower part of the leg is casted by producing a positive cast to represent patients' shank, ankle, and foot. However, different manufacturing methods have been improved due to the different design and material requirements. All these developments affect the selection of the AFO. In this chapter, a substantial survey regarding design, manufacture, and selection of AFOs is provided and future trends about these issues are discussed.",

It shows how the field is delineated into numerous sub-topics, all of which can stand on their own yet still draw from each other.

The exploration of the technology limits using classic performance optimization techniques and leads to the best trade-off for the area, power consumption, and speed. Nevertheless, such key characteristics have been degraded in a context of continuous use and stressful environment. Thus, circuit reliability emerges as a design criterion for AMS/RF performance optimization. Aiming a design for reliability, this chapter presents an overview of CMOS unreliable phenomena. Reliability-aware methodologies for circuit design, simulation, and optimization are reviewed. The authors focus in particular on large and complex systems, providing circuit design insights to achieve a reliability specification from system-level to transistor-level.

    "abstract": "Electronic systems are essential parts in the everyday life, and these systems have grown continuously in their performance and in their complexity. Therefore, the design process for such a system has also become more and more complex and has become a critical challenge. A popular tool for solving the design process of complex systems is SystemC. SystemC is a C++ language class library, which allows the modeling of hardware behavior in a programming language for software. Advantages by the usage of SystemC are e.g. an integrative concept of the design description in a continuous design flow, combined with a fast execution of compiled code during the simulation process. This chapter describes the simulation of faults in electronic systems by the usage of SystemC. It treats especially faults in hardware, which can occur after a successful validation of the design. The simulation of faults is well known in two operation areas. One field is the fault simulation of test pattern for the detection of fabrication faults. The other field is the simulated fault injection that the effects of faults emerging during the operation of the device. Such procedures are important for analysis of electronic system designs for safety critical applications with respect to their dependability under fault conditions. At first, the chapter explains some issues in the context of fault injection and fault simulation. Furthermore, it relates something about SystemC and the possibility to simulate the design. State of the art applications are also presented for this purpose. A prerequisite for a simulation is an appropriate modeling. The modeling of faults is presented in the context of their design level. It is also shown how a simulation with fault models can be implemented by several injection techniques. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the injection techniques are explained. Another challenge for a simulation task is the execution in an acceptable amount of time. Approaches are presented, which help to speed up simulations. Some practical simulation environments are shown at the end of the chapter.",

    "abstract": "For the active control of three dimensional (3D) irregular structures subjected to seismic load, a new nonlinear model is discussed in this chapter. As well as geometric nonlinearity, material nonlinearity is also considered with a neuro-controller training algorithm, which is applied to a structure of multi degrees of freedom. For the control model, a dynamic assembly of two different motions is considered such as coupling between torsional and lateral responses of the structure and interaction between the structural system and the actuator. The training algorithm and the proposed control system of the structure are evaluated by the response simulation of the structure under the excitation of El-Centro 1940 earthquake. With linear and nonlinear stiffness, a 3D three story building structure is controlled by a trained neural network as an example. As additional parameters for the simulation control time delay, the incident angle of earthquakes is considered. The results show that the proposed control algorithm is efficient in the control of the structural vibration.",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, the usage of embedded microprocessors in complex SoCs has become common practice. Their test is often a challenging task, due to their complexity, to the strict constraints coming from the environment and the application, and to the typical SoC design paradigm, where cores (including microprocessors) are often provided by third parties, and thus must be seen as black boxes. An increasingly popular solution to this challenge is based on developing a suitable test program, forcing the processor to execute it, and then checking the produced results (Software-Based Self Test, or SBST). The SBST methodology is particularly suitable for being applied at the end of manufacturing and in the field as well, to detect the occurrence of faults caused by environmental stresses and intrinsic aging (e.g., negative bias temperature instability, hot carriers injection) in embedded systems. This chapter provides an overview of the main techniques proposed so far in the literature to effectively generate test programs, ranging from manual ad hoc techniques to automated and general ones. Some details about specific hardware modules that can be fruitfully included in a SoC to ease the test of the processor when the SBST technique is adopted are also provided.",

The theoretical neuroscience is basically converging towards the basic concept that the brain acts as a complex and decentralized computer which can perform rigorous calculations in a different approach compared to the conventional digital computers. The motivation behind the study of neural networks is due to their similarity in the structure of the human central nervous system. The elementary processing component of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is called as ‘Neuron'. A large number of neurons interconnected with each other mimic the biological neural network and form an ANN. Learning is an inevitable process that can be used to train an ANN. We can only transfer knowledge to the neural network by the learning procedure.

The increasing complexity of AI algorithms, particularly deep learning ones, frequently results in a “black-box” situation, where the rationale behind decisions is non-transparent and challenging to decipher. To tackle this issue, the authors introduce a groundbreaking method that utilizes depth map analysis to clarify these processes, thereby making the decisions made by AI more transparent and understandable. The methodology is centred around generating depth maps from the layers of neural networks. These maps are subsequently scrutinized to gain insights into the significance of different features and the pathways leading to decisions. This strategy offers a dual advantage: it serves as a visual and a quantitative tool for interpreting AI decisions. Such an approach is pivotal in fostering AI systems that are not only more trustworthy but also reliable. The effectiveness of this method is showcased through a series of experiments, underscoring its applicability and potential benefits in various AI domains. These experiments demonstrate how depth map analysis can elucidate the internal workings of AI models, thereby making their decision-making processes more transparent and interpretable to users, researchers, and developers alike.

The chapter introduces a groundbreaking approach that harnesses the power of Explainable AI (XAI) to not only predict but also comprehensively understand crowd dynamics derived from video data. Predicting crowd behavior accurately is challenging, but providing interpretable insights into the reasoning behind these predictions is equally essential. The methodology achieves both of these objectives. By leveraging XAI techniques, the approach yields highly accurate predictions of crowd dynamics while simultaneously demystifying the underlying logic of these predictions. The significance of this approach lies in its ability to provide an understandable rationale behind complex AI decisions. Stakeholders, including law enforcement, event organizers, and urban planners, can benefit from this level of transparency. It enables them to make informed decisions based on AI analyses and contributes to the safety and efficiency of public spaces and events. The incorporation of XAI into crowd dynamics prediction not only enhances prediction accuracy but also builds trust among end-users. It bridges a significant gap in the field by ensuring that AI is not just a black box making predictions but a valuable tool that can be reasoned with and trusted. This research offers a transformative approach to crowd dynamics prediction, where the power of AI is harnessed, and the rationale behind its predictions is made accessible to stakeholders.

As governments implement various policies to protect citizens, the utilization of AI by governmental agencies has significantly increased. Despite this, there is a significant gap between theoretical knowledge of AI and cybersecurity as separate fields and their practical integration. The challenge lies in the rapid evolution of both AI and cybersecurity, which often outpaces the legislative process, rendering many regulatory efforts outdated before they are fully realized. Due to the lack of dedicated laws for these dynamic areas, achieving optimal results is difficult. Therefore, it is crucial to explore how AI can be leveraged to improve cybersecurity. By using appropriate safeguards, AI can autonomously protect against threats like viruses, misuse, and hacking attacks. This paper examines the role of technology in AI and cybersecurity and investigates how AI can optimize cybersecurity, the opportunities &amp; challenges of AI in cybersecurity, regulatory bodies, and strategies to merge these fields.",

To schedule the task optimally in a cloud environment is considered an NP-hard problem, which has become complex with the introduction of variables such as resource dynamicity and on-demand consumer applications. The proposed research introduces a Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) incorporating a transfer function (TF) and a tent chaotic map to tackle scheduling challenges in cloud computing. The performance of the proposed chaotic-based whale optimization algorithm (CWOA) is compared to that of well-known metaheuristics methods. The results show that CWOA may significantly reduce the makespan of the task scheduling problem compared to standard Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and BAT algorithms. Furthermore, it converges quickly as the search space grows more prominent, making it suitable for large-scale scheduling issues.",

A three-pole Chebyshev bandpass filter with centre frequency of 2.6 GHz, fractional bandwidth of 3%, passband ripple of 0.04321 dB, and return loss of 20 dB has been designed. The designed filter implementation is based on the Rogers RT/Duroid 6010LM substrate with a 10.7 dielectric constant and 1.27 mm thickness. The circuit model and microstrip layout results of the BPF are presented and show good agreement. The microstrip layout simulation results show that a less than 1.8 dB minimum insertion loss and a greater than 25 dB in-band return loss were achieved. The overall device size of the BPF is 18.0 mm by 10.7 mm, which is equivalent to 0.16λg x 0.09λg, where λg is the guided wavelength of the 50 Ohm microstrip line at the filter centre frequency.",

    "abstract": "The architecture of a system is a specification of software components, interrelationships, and rules for component interactions and evolution over time. In 2001 OMG, adopted an architecture standard, the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). MDA is an architectural framework for improving portability, interoperability and reusability through separation of concerns (MDA, 2003) (MDA, 2005). It is not itself a technology specification but it represents an evolving plan to achieve cohesive model-driven technology specifications. MDA is built on OMG standards including the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) (XMI, 2007) and CORBA (CORBA, 1992) (CORBA, 2002) a major middleware standard. MDA is model-driven because it uses models to direct the complete lifecycle of a system. All artifacts such as requirement specifications, architecture descriptions, design descriptions and code, are regarded as models. MDA provides an approach for specifying a system independently of the platforms that it supports, specifying platforms, selecting a particular platform for the system, and transforming the system specification into one implementation for the selected particular platform. Why MDA? OMG has focused on the creation of open specifications to encourage application interoperability. It was defined to solve enterprise application integration. A middleware describes a piece of software that connects two or more software applications, allowing them to exchange data. To achieve this, it must be implemented for all different languages and platforms that need linking.",

The glyphs belong to graphemes as models are realized in the relics as symbols. Some group of glyphs may transform their shape (shapeshifting) through time which produces various versions of scripts that use different glyphs to express the same grapheme. These glyph variants can be identified from extant relics, mainly from historical abecedaries that are used as references. Our algorithm can determine whether or not an abecedary is related to the symbols of a relic from unknown origin by means of the canonical decomposition of the glyphs and symbols. From there an aggregated value called fingerprint is created and it is unique for each relic. The fingerprints then are evaluated by clustering technique using various metrics. As the result of performing comparative evaluations the Minkowski metric provides the most interpretable clustering structure. The results of the evaluations, conclusions, and future work are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Increased electricity demands and economic operation of large power systems in a deregulated environment with a limited investment in transmission expansion planning causes interconnected power grids to be operated closer to their stability limits. Meanwhile, the loads uncertainty will affect the static and dynamic stabilities. Therefore, if there is no emergency corrective control in time, occurrence of wide area contingency may lead to the catastrophic cascading outages. Studies show that many wide area blackouts which led to massive economic losses may have been prevented by a fast feasible controlled islanding decision making. This chapter introduces a novel computationally efficient approach for separating of bulk power system into several stable sections following a severe disturbance. The splitting strategy reduces the large initial search space to an interface boundary network considering coherency of synchronous generators and network graph simplification. Then, a novel islanding scenario generator algorithm denoted as BEM (Backward Elimination Method) based on PMEAs (Primary Maximum Expansion Areas) has been applied to generate all proper islanding solutions in the simplified network graph. The PPF (Probabilistic Power Flow) based on Newton-Raphson method and Q-V modal analysis has been used to evaluate the steady-state stability of created islands in each generated scenario. BICA (Binary Imperialistic Competitive Algorithm) has then been applied to minimize total load-generation mismatch considering integrity, voltage permitted range and steady-state voltage stability constraints. The best solution has then been applied to split the entire power network. A novel stochastic contingency analysis of islands based on PSVI (Probability of Static Voltage Instability) using MCS (Monte Carlo Simulation) and k-PEM (k-Point Estimate Method) have been proposed to identify the critical PQ buses and severe contingencies. In these approaches, the ITM (Inverse Transform Method) has been used to model uncertain loads with normal probability distribution function in optimal islanded power system. The robustness, effectiveness and capability of the proposed approaches have been validated on the New England 39-bus standard power system.",

Therefore, the design of miniature RFID antennas is important, and the microstrip antenna is a good choice because they are known to be low-profile, low weight, easy to make, and mechanically robust.",

    "abstract": "Complex systems usually have to deal with a huge number of potential situations and contingencies. Therefore, a mechanism is required that enables the expression of variability at design-time so that it can be efficiently resolved at run-time. As composability plays an increasingly relevant role in building systems in an economic way, variability management should also contribute to and be taken into account in terms of composability. This chapter presents a variability management workflow aimed at supporting different developer roles in an ecosystem context. Two kinds of variability are addressed: in system operation and associated with quality of service. The former provides robustness to contingencies, while the latter focuses on the quality of the application (in terms of non-functional properties) under changing situations and limited resources. The concepts introduced in this chapter conform to the structures and principles of the H2020 European Project RobMoSys, which consolidates composability in the robotics domain.",

This chapter addresses the problem of synchronization of fractional-order-derivative chaotic systems using random numbers generator for a novel technique to key distribution in cryptography. However, there is evidence that researchers have approached the problem using integer order derivative chaotic systems. Consequently, the aim of the chapter lies in coding and decoding a text via chaos synchronization of fractional-order derivative, the performance analysis and the key establishment scheme following an application on a text encryption using the chaotic Mathieu-Van Der Pol fractional system. In order to improve the level of the key security, the Fibonacci Q-matrix is used in the key generation process and the initial condition; the order of the derivative of the responder system secretly shared between the responder and the receiver are also involved. It followed from this study that compared to the existing cryptography techniques, this proposed method is found to be very efficient due to the fact that, it improves the key security.",

The use of conventional wind and electrical stations is an easy and reliable solution. However, annual wind velocity on most settled territories does not exceed 6 m/s or even 4 m/s. It makes the efficient use of wind electrical stations more complicated. One of the solutions can probably be the use of wind and electrical stations on the basis of slow speed non-transmission arc-shaped-stator inductor-type generators with an integrated radial and ring-shaped rotor. Another efficient solution to provide areas with water and electrical energy is to use a combined wind station with a crank-and-rod mechanism and the rod of the driving mechanism of the back-and-forth motion of the core of a magnetic and electrical linear generator and the piston of a plunger pump.",

Moreover, the blockchain concept has drawn attention as the next-generation technology through the authentication of peers that share encryption and the generation of hash values. In addition, the blockchain can be applied in conjunction with Cloud Computing and the IoT paradigms, since it avoids the involvement of third parties in a broker-free way.

CCVEs are grounded on three key elements: creation, collaboration, and distribution. These relate not only to the technical but also to the social layers of virtual online communities. Shared creativity and distributed authorship are approached as examples of specific dynamics rooted upon these three elements. The concept of CCVE is important to the design of emerging virtual worlds, specifically regarding the preservation of affordances for collaborative creativity. Discussion based on these observations demonstrates how collaborative creation of new content and meaning takes place in CCVEs, and how they transform communicative and creative agency in digital communities.",

The main idea of identifying a wireless device through its RF emissions is that the electronic circuits and the RF components have specific characteristics determined by the production and manufacturing processes. These characteristics, which result in unique differences, can be used to distinguish a wireless device from another because they appear as subtle modification of the RF signal in space even if the wireless device generates a signal conformant to the standard. This chapter describes the main techniques for the fingerprinting of wireless devices using their RF transmission. There are still some key challenges to overcome. This chapter tries to identify them in this context as well as providing possible approaches to solve them. Further research work is needed to investigate the portability issues between fingerprints taken using different receivers, as well as to identify and remove potential other sources of bias.",

Its characteristics of being independent of implementation language, technique and technology promoted the use in software cost estimation and other project management practices. It has been about three decades since Albrecht introduced the concept of functional size and a variety of measurement methods have been developed, some of which have been published by International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Although the concept is recognized in the software community, and there is a growing interest in Functional Size Measurement (FSM), the applications in software organizations have not been common as expected. The problems with FSM method structures and practices have been discussed to be the major factors to explain this situation. This chapter reviews the research papers that propose solutions to the problems with FSM via formalizations in FSM practices or related concept definitions. The associations of the formalization ideas to the abstract software models that represent the view of functionality for FSM methods are of particular interest of the chapter.",

    "abstract": "Weighted dependency trees (WDTs) are used in a multitude of approaches to system analysis, such as fault tree analysis or event tree analysis. In fact, any acyclic graph can be transformed to a WDT. Important decisions are often based on WDT analysis. Common for all WDT-based approaches is the inherent uncertainty due to lack or inaccuracy of the input data. In order to indicate credibility of such WDT analysis, uncertainty handling is essential. There is however, to our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the uncertainty handling approaches in the context of the WDTs. This chapter aims to rectify this. We concentrate on approaches applicable for epistemic uncertainty related to empirical input. The existing and the potentially useful approaches are identified through a systematic literature review. The approaches are then outlined and evaluated at a high-level, before a restricted set undergoes a more detailed evaluation based on a set of pre-defined evaluation criteria. We argue that the epistemic uncertainty is better suited for possibilistic uncertainty representations than the probabilistic ones. The results indicate that precision, expressiveness, predictive accuracy, scalability on real-life systems, and comprehensibility are among the properties which differentiate the approaches. The selection of a preferred approach should depend on the degree of need for certain properties relative to others, given the context. The right trade off is particularly important when the input is based on both expert judgments and measurements. The chapter may serve as a roadmap for examining the uncertainty handling approaches, or as a resource for identifying the adequate one.",

Among numerous system configurations which can experience the phenomena, a few typical systems scenarios, which cover the majority of the observed ferroresonance incidents in power systems, are introduced. This chapter also classifies the ferroresonance study methods into the analytical and the time-domain simulation approaches. A set of analytical approaches are presented, and the corresponding fundamentals, assumptions, and limitations are discussed. Furthermore, key parameters for accurate digital time-domain simulation of the ferroresonance phenomenon are introduced, and the impact of transformer models and the iron core representations on the ferroresonance behavior of transformers is investigated.

    "abstract": "Technology scaling into subnanometer range will have impact on the manufacturing yield and quality. At the same time, complexity and communication requirements of systems-on-chip (SoC) are increasing, thus making a SoC designer goal to design a fault-free system a very difficult task. Network-on-chip (NoC) has been proposed as one of the alternatives to solve some of the on-chip communication problems and to address dependability at various levels of abstraction. This chapter concentrates on system-level design issues of NoC-based systems. It describes various methods proposed for NoC architecture analysis and optimization, and gives an overview of different system-level fault tolerance methods. Finally, the chapter presents a system-level design framework for performing design space exploration for dependable NoC-based systems.",

    "abstract": "A pervasive theme today regarding the performance of new systems is “many systems are technical successes, but organizational failures.” Systems that are well designed often fail to meet user expectations at implementation. This chapter details and analyzes the implementation of a major operations support system at a large U.S. firm that fits this theme. Measurements (of success) from a quasi-experiment are used to accurately measure user performance and user expectations pre- and post-system implementation. These measurements offer solid proof that the system achieved key user defined objectives. ... And yet, the system is widely viewed as a failure. This chapter highlights the \"organizational chaos\" that \"technically successful\" systems often cause in user organizations when the Systems Delivery process (how systems are delivered to users) is ineffectual. In effect, systems are dropped off at the users' doorsteps. A prescriptive model using five key guidelines is proposed for effective management of the Systems Delivery process. These five relatively small secrets can save corporations millions in investment dollars, reduce negative impacts to customer service, and enhance employee morale and systems acceptance.",

There are a lot of scopes for research in this pervasive field. Intrusion detection systems are designed to uncover both known and unknown attacks. There are many methods used in intrusion detection system to guard computers and networks from attacks. These attacks can be active or passive, network based or host based, or any combination of it. Current research uses machine learning techniques to make intrusion detection systems more effective against any kind of attack. This survey examines designing methodology of intrusion detection system and its classification types. It also reviews the trend of machine learning techniques used from past decade.

For many people, the term energy storage is the storage of electricity in batteries, as it is the most commonly found way of storing energy. In addition to classic batteries, there are other energy storage alternatives from a primary source for later use. The most valuable forms of energy storage are the ones that can both take over and release the energy on demand, in the form of electricity, such that, in the end, the electrical energy is transformed into thermal or mechanical energy. In stationary applications, energy can be stored in various forms such as batteries, ultracapacitors, or tanks of hydrogen, water, and different types of materials. This chapter will evaluate each form of energy storage.",

Music related researches are classified into 6 categories; Kansei evaluation methodology, music psychological research, physiological measurement, music theoretical research, Kansei music system and recommendation system. Then, the authors present their approaches for research Kansei on melody and rhythm from the music theoretical aspect. A mode, one of the most elemental structures in music, is a sequence of n musical tones, arranged from the 12 tones, that fall within a one-octave range and are chosen and arranged according to the rules of that mode. In this chapter, the authors analyze, using sound tracks composed automatically by computer software, the relationships between modes and Kansei. “Melodic range” is defined as the high and low extent of the tone movements in a mode. Mode and melodic ranges were the parameters they controlled for evaluation by Kansei. Eighteen sample tracks were automatically composed from combinations of six modes and three ranges. Forty-seven Kansei word pairs were used in the research questionnaire. The results of principal component analysis and an analysis of variance reveal a contrast between tracks with major modes and a larger range and tracks with minor modes and small range. The authors also found that modes and ranges can independently or synergistically affect the Kansei. Based on their results, they have developed a real-time melody recognition program that identifies the mode and its corresponding Kansei from music. The authors also studied rhythm with programmed drum patterns and found that the fluctuation of drum beats relates to the degree of activity, with the interval and complexity of the rhythmic variations relating to the strained to bright axis of a principal components loading map.",

    "abstract": "Soft Computing is a relatively new computing paradigm bestowed with tools and techniques for handling real world problems. The main components of this computing paradigm are neural networks, fuzzy logic and evolutionary computation. Each and every component of the soft computing paradigm operates either independently or in coalition with the other components for addressing problems related to modeling, analysis and processing of data. An overview of the essentials and applications of the soft computing paradigm is presented in this chapter with reference to the functionalities and operations of its constituent components. Neural networks are made up of interconnected processing nodes/neurons, which operate on numeric data. These networks posses the capabilities of adaptation and approximation. The varied amount of uncertainty and ambiguity in real world data are handled in a linguistic framework by means of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. Hence, this component is efficient in understanding vagueness and imprecision in real world knowledge bases. Genetic algorithms, simulated annealing algorithm and ant colony optimization algorithm are representative evolutionary computation techniques, which are efficient in deducing an optimum solution to a problem, thanks to the inherent exhaustive search methodologies adopted. Of late, rough sets have evolved to improve upon the performances of either of these components by way of approximation techniques. These soft computing techniques have been put to use in wide variety of problems ranging from scientific to industrial applications. Notable among these applications include image processing, pattern recognition, Kansei information processing, data mining, web intelligence etc.",

In this contribution, the traditional HM is generalized to aggregate complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy information, and a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approach is proposed to solve decision-making problems with complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy information. Firstly, the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamy mean (Cq-ROFHM) operator and the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy dual Hamy mean (Cq-ROFDHM) operator along with its weighted forms are proposed. Moreover, to deal with MADM problems, a novel approach is developed based on the proposed HM operators under complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy framework.

Therefore, sustainable supplier performance evaluation and selection are of great importance in terms of economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainable development. Sustainable supplier selection problem can be considered as a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. In the MCDM problems, decision-makers evaluate conflicting criteria and alternatives according to their own preferences/judgments. One of the most well-known MCDM methods is the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS).

The system has been experimentally validated in several scenarios. In addition, an empirical study of the effect of three matching outlier rejection mechanisms (radio test, fundamental matrix, and homography matrix) on the quality of estimated 3D localization has been performed. The outlier rejection mechanisms, combined themselves or alone, reduce the number of matched feature points but increase their quality, and so, the accuracy of the 3D estimation. The combination of ratio test and homography matrix provides the best results.",

    "abstract": "This chapter proposes a quantum multi-layer neural network (QMLNN) architecture suitable for handwritten character recognition in real time, assisted by quantum backpropagation of errors calculated from the quantum-inspired fuzziness measure of network output states. It is composed of three second-order neighborhood-topology-based inter-connected layers of neurons represented by qubits known as input, hidden, and output layers. The QMLNN architecture is a feed forward network with standard quantum backpropagation algorithm for the adjustment of its weighted interconnection. QMLNN self-organizes the quantum fuzzy input image information by means of the quantum backpropagating errors at the intermediate and output layers of the architecture. The interconnection weights are described using rotation gates. After the network is stabilized, a quantum observation at the output layer destroys the superposition of quantum states in order to obtain true binary outputs.",

With the rise of programming as a school subject in ever-younger age groups, the importance of dedicated educational systems for programming education is increasing. In the past, professional environments were often used in programming teaching; with the shift to younger age groups, this is no longer tenable. New educational systems are currently being designed by a diverse group of developing teams, in industry, in academia, and by hobbyists. In this chapter, the authors describe their experiences with the design of three systems—Blue, BlueJ, and Greenfoot—and extract lessons that they hope may be useful for designers of future systems. The authors also discuss current developments, and suggest an area of interest where future work might be profitable for many users: the combination of aspects from block-based and text-based programming. They present their work in this area—frame-based editing—and suggest possible future development options.",

Considering the emotional needs of stakeholders is important because both the users' perceptions of a product and their use of a product are influenced by emotion as much as cognition. Building on recent work in modelling the emotional goals of stakeholders, the authors extend an existing viewpoint framework to capture emotions, and to use emotions in models from early-phase requirements to detailed software design. They demonstrate the models and framework with a case study of an emergency alarm system for older people, presenting a complete set of models for the case study.

Metaheuristic techniques have the capability to handle large search spaces and therefore are well suited to deal with such problems. In this chapter, quantum-inspired genetic algorithm-based DNA fragment assembly (QGFA) approach has been proposed to perform the de novo assembly of DNA fragments using overlap-layout-consensus approach. To assess the efficacy of QGFA, it has been compared genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization-based metaheuristic approaches for solving DFA problem. Experimental results show that QGFA performs comparatively better (in terms of overlap score obtained and number of contigs produced) than other approaches considered herein.",

The latter is augmented by a robust control term to efficiently compensate for the unavoidable fuzzy approximation errors, external disturbances as well as residual error due to the use of the so-called e-modification in the adaptive laws. A Lyapunov approach is employed to derive the parameter adaptation laws and to prove the boundedness of all signals of the closed-loop system.

The job scheduling problem has become more challenging with the ever-increasing size of grid systems. The optimal job scheduling is an NP-complete problem which can easily be solved by using meta-heuristic techniques. This chapter presents a hybrid algorithm for job scheduling using genetic algorithm (GA) and cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) for efficiently allocating jobs to resources in a grid system so that makespan, flowtime, and job failure rate are minimized. This proposed algorithm combines the advantages of both GA and CSA.

Current integration technologies, such as Web Services and RESTful APIs, solve the interoperability problem but usually entail more coupling than needed, since they require sharing data schemas between interacting applications, even if not all values of those schemas are actually used.

Fog computing faces new security and privacy challenges besides those inherited from cloud computing. Authentication helps to ensure and confirms a user's identity. The existing traditional password authentication does not provide enough security for the data, and there have been instances when the password-based authentication has been manipulated to gain access to the data.

Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling techniques can be rewarding, and the drastic power savings obtained in subthreshold voltage operation makes this an important technique to be used in battery-operated devices. However, unpredictability in nanoscale chips is high, and working at reduced supply voltages makes circuits more vulnerable to operational-induced delay-faults and transient-faults. The goal is to implement an adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) strategy, which can work at subthreshold voltages to considerably reduce power consumption. The proposed strategy uses aging-aware local and global performance sensors to enhance reliability and fault-tolerance and allows circuits to be dynamically optimized during their lifetime while prevents error occurrence.

    "abstract": "Developing IoT projects from scratch requires a lot of knowledge and expertise; moreover, it takes a very long time to be developed. It can be hard for starters and even senior developers to perfect every aspect of an IoT project in a timely manner. These aspects include hardware, communication, data storage, security, integration, application, data processing, and analysis. This chapter introduces a cloud-based platform that is concerned with data storage, device management, data processing, and integration with external systems, all while providing high level of security and allowing for future scaling. This platform should accelerate and simplify the development of IoT projects by lowering the entry barrier and offloading some of the burden off developers to give them more time to focus on other aspects such as hardware and applications. The authors discuss many implementation issues in the functional and design perspective that may guide others to make their own platforms from this insight view.",

    "abstract": "In many countries, renewable energy production already represents an important percentage of the total energy that is generated in electrical grids. In order to reach higher levels of integration, demand side management measures are yet required. In fact, different from the legacy electrical grids, where at any given instant the generation levels are adjusted to meet the demand, when using renewable energy sources, the demand must be adapted in accordance with the generation levels, since these cannot be controlled. In order to alleviate users from the burden of individual control of each appliance, energy management systems (EMSs) have to be developed to both monitor the generation and consumption patterns and to control electrical appliances. In this context, the main contribution of this chapter is to present the implementation of such an IoT-based monitoring and control system for microgrids, capable of supporting the development of an EMS.",

Accuracy of document categorization can be greatly improved if documents are indexed or modeled using the semantics rather than the traditional term-frequency model. This annotation has its own challenges like synonymy and polysemy in the document categorization problem. The model proposes to build domain ontology for the textual content so that the problems like synonymy and polysemy in text analysis are resolved to greater extent. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the topic modeling technique has been used for feature extraction from the documents. Using the domain knowledge on the concept and the features grouped by LDA, the domain ontology is built in the hierarchical fashion. Empirical results show that LDA is the better feature extraction technique for text documents than TF or TF-IDF indexing technique. Also, the proposed model shows improvement in the accuracy of document categorization when domain ontology built using LDA has been used for document indexing.",

Under stress conditions, the operating parameters of power system violate their limits. From the past anatomy reports of several blackouts, it is clear that equipment, control, and protective relay failures are the major causes behind large power system failure. From study, it is also revealed that failure of back-up protection is more prone during system stressed conditions. In transmission system, third-zone of distance relay is highly affected by system stressed events such as voltage instability and load encroachment. As third-zone protection is a delayed protection scheme, with the help of wide area measurement system better protection function can be provided to reduce future percentage of blackout. In this chapter, a detailed discussion about the existing solutions is provided to mitigate the issue of system stressed conditions and a synchrophasor technology-based approach is provided.

The most effective way to protect against interferences is an introduction into the receiver structure of adaptive interference compensators. However, the most of proposed methods have been designed for radiolocation and communication and use a priori information about the transmitted signal. Since as structure of GNSS signal differs from the radar and communication systems, GNSS does not know the time-frequency structure of the useful signal in advance, which excludes the possibility of using a number of widely known methods.

The topology preferred in this chapter provides a dc voltage in the shape of a staircase which approximates the rectified shape of a commanded sinusoidal wave to the bridge inverter, which in turn alternates the polarity to produce an AC voltage with lesser total harmonic distortion. This topology requires fewer components and hence it leads to a reduction of overall cost and complexity particularly for higher output voltage levels. The component fault diagnostic procedure is developed using wavelets transform tool. Finally, the experimental prototype is developed and validated with the simulation results for different loading conditions.",

Although the simple analytical analysis is not sufficiently implemented in complex coupler structure, it is capable of providing an initial design guideline for the coupler dimensions.

Then the shift towards incorporating public clouds becomes inevitable. The current problem that many of these firms are encountering is the difficulty of managing multiple clouds that reside within different vendors running on different platforms, computational requirements, and vendor SLAs. Lack of support for a single standard for an overall multi-cloud hybrid model exposes the hybrid IT-management to further threats.

Here, one application is mentioned to recognize a printed character automatically with the help of Hamming distance. The proposed method is applicable when the characters are printed with same font, same size, and same shape. In the case of hand-written characters, the proposed method is also equally effective if it is modified.

It is necessary to improve the accuracy of an OCR system. Traditionally, for separating text from a document, different feature extraction processes have been used that require handcrafting of the features. However, deep learning-based methods are excellent feature extractors that learn features from the training data automatically. Deep learning gives state-of-the-art results on various computer vision, image classification, segmentation, image captioning, object detection, and recognition tasks. This chapter compares various traditional as well as deep-learning techniques and uses a semantic segmentation method for separating text from Devanagari document images using U-Net and ResU-Net models. These models are further fine-tuned for transfer learning to get more precise results. The final results show that deep learning methods give more accurate results compared with conventional methods of image processing for Devanagari text extraction.",

The educational data of students from engineering domain with cognitive and non-cognitive parameters is considered. The hybrid model with support vector machine (SVM) and deep belief network (DBN) is devised. The SVM predicts class labels from preprocessed data. These class labels and actual class labels acts as input to the DBN to perform final classification. The hybrid model is further optimised using cuckoo search with Levy flight. The results clearly show that the proposed model SVM-LCDBN gives better performance as compared to simple hybrid model and hybrid model with traditional cuckoo search.",

The loss of critical data packets might lead a patient to an embarrassing position. Therefore, WBANs require a secure and efficient data transmission mechanism. However, wireless transmission traditionally remains vulnerable to many security attacks such as node misbehavior attack. Routing protocols play a key role in the extended network lifetime. However, efficient data routing in WBAN is a challenging task. In addition, sensor nodes due to wireless communication produce electromagnetic radiation that is absorbed by the human body and results in temperature rise. Therefore, routing protocols along with security issues must consider temperature rise to ensure safe wireless transmission. In this chapter, the authors present a comprehensive review of most relevant security and privacy concerns and relevant routing protocols addressing the aforementioned routing issues.",

Its undoubted advantages are a learning (tilting) ability in real time to process indefinite, nonlinear disturbances, and to change the value of the active force in the hydraulic leaf spring by adjusting the weight coefficients of the neuron net and/or the radial parameters of the basic function. The model is a ¼ hydraulic active sprung mass of a mobile vehicle. The modeling shows that the use of a neuron net controller makes the sprung mass much more efficient.",

More precisely, one also presents a systematic approach for designing a fractional-order (FO) sliding mode controller to achieve a rapid, robust, and perfect chaos synchronization. By this robust controller, it is rigorously proven that the associated synchronization error is Mittag-Leffler (or asymptotically) stable. In a numerical simulation framework, this synchronization scheme is tested on many chaotic optical systems taken from the open literature. The obtained results clearly show that the proposed chaos synchronization controller is not only strongly robust with respect to the unavoidable system's uncertainties (as unmodeled dynamics, and parameters' variation and uncertainty) and eventual dynamical external disturbances, but also can significantly reduce the chattering effect.",

    "abstract": "The success of a software project depends intrinsically on effective communication among stakeholders. The purpose of a glossary is to ensure that the knowledge of the domain underlying a software project be communicated properly to all the stakeholders of that project. This chapter provides the context, the rationale, and the means for developing a glossary for software projects. In doing so, it proposes a process for developing a glossary. This process is independent of any particular application domain, software development methodology, and information technology. The approaches for representing and presenting a glossary, for the consumption of humans as well as that of machines, are discussed.",

Small universal Sleptsov net that runs in polynomial time was constructed; it consists of 15 places and 29 transitions. Principles of programming in Sleptsov nets, as composition of reverse control flow and data, have been developed. Standard control flow patterns include sequence, branching, loop, and parallel execution. Basic modules, which implement efficiently copying, logic, and arithmetic operations, have been developed. Special dashed arcs were introduced for brief specification of input and output data of modules (subnets). Ways of hierarchical composition of a program via substitution of a transition by a module were discussed. Examples of Sleptsov net programs for data encryption, fuzzy logic, and partial differential equations have been presented. Enterprise implementation of Sleptsov net programming promises ultra-performance.",

The results are promising as the obtained root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values reach 0.58 for the SVD and 0.62 for the item-based system.

However, these particularities, usually called situational factors, are seldom taken into account in other activities of the requirements process. Most situational factors, when considered in software projects, have a high influence on the requirements process. Therefore, the different situations that may attempt against or may favor a successful requirements process should be identified at the beginning of the project. Additionally, some factors may evolve along with software development life cycle; this may imply re-planning the requirements process at later strategic milestones. In this chapter, a process for constructing and dynamically adapting a requirements process is proposed. The process uses different combinations of situational factors at specific variation points and manages a repository of process blocks to perform the tailoring.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which normally consist of hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes each capable of sensing, processing, and transmitting environmental information, are deployed to monitor certain physical phenomena or to detect and track certain objects in an area of interests. The sensor nodes in WSN transmit data depending on local information and parameters such as signal strength, power consumption, location of data collection and accretion. Only reachable nodes are able to communicate with each other directly to collect and transmit data. The motes have limited energy resources along with constraints on its computational and storage capabilities. Thus, innovative techniques that eliminate energy inefficiencies that would shorten the lifetime of the network are highly required. Such constraints combined with a typical deployment of large number of sensor nodes pose many challenges to the design and management of WSNs and necessitate energy-awareness at all layers of the networking protocol stack. In this chapter, we present a survey of the state-of-the-art routing techniques in WSNs that take into consideration the energy issue.",

The characteristics of the voltage and the current are explained, and the propagation constant (attenuation and propagation velocity) and the characteristic impedance are described. For a multi-conductor system, a modal theory is introduced, and it is shown that the multi-conductor system is handled as a combination of independent single conductors.

The new QC-LDPC encrypted codes are flexible in terms of large girth, multiple code rates, and large block lengths. In the proposed algorithm, the restructuring of the interconnections is developed by splitting the rows into subrows. This row division reduces the load on the processing node and ultimately reduces the hardware complexity. In this method of encrypted code construction, rows are used to form a distance graph. They are then transformed to a parity-check matrix in order to acquire the desired girth. In this work, matrices are divided into small sub-matrices, which result in improved decoding performance and reduce waiting time of the messages to be updated. Matrix sub-division increases the number of sub-matrices to be managed and memory requirement. Moreover, Prototype architecture of the LDPC codes has been implemented by writing Hardware Description Language (VHDL) code and targeted to a Xilinx Spartan-3E XC3S500E FPGA chip.",

    "abstract": "Software development governance can be defined as the application of “governance” in software engineering in order to increase the probability of success in the level of individual projects as well as in the level of the organization comprising many interrelated projects. The topic deserves an interdisciplinary perspective, as the general subject of governance has been analyzed quite extensively under the field of Transaction Cost Economics. This interdisciplinary approach enabled the identification of three main modes of governance for software engineering, namely: top-down governance, bottom-up governance and reuse governance, each having unique transaction cost characteristics. To be cost effective, (1) the organizations should adapt the right governance structure for their projects based on their characteristics, and (2) the software development tools should support and be in alignment with the underlying governance structure. In this chapter, we briefly overview the first premise and then outline an approach to address the second premise, specifically tackling the issue of tools integration, for software modeling and configuration management tools. We use Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) to represent the mapping between governance structures and software modules, propose a configuration management approach for each mode of software governance, and demonstrate a successful integration using Lattix LDM, IBM Rational ClearCase and IBM Rational Rhapsody, three broadly available tools in the software industry.",

    "abstract": "Sensors are electrical-mechanical elements which are the interface between environment and electrical systems. The input of sensors is characteristics of the environment for example temperature, pressure and etc. and their output is a small electric voltage or current. Their job is to convert environment characteristics to an electric voltage or current at their outputs. Since the output current or voltage is very small, it must be amplified in order to be suitable for use in electronic systems. In this chapter we completely explain the design procedure and characteristics of sensor amplifiers. The important parameters of sensor amplifiers are input and output resistance, gain, unity gain bandwidth and etc. One of the most important characteristics of amplifiers is the linearity of amplification in a way that it must have uniformity for all amplitude voltages or currents in all frequencies of the bandwidth. For this purpose, first the operational amplifier is completely discussed, then the linearity of feedback operation will be explained.",

A liquid gated graphene field effect transistor (LG-GFET) based biosensor model is analytically developed for electrical detection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. E. coli absorption effects on the graphene surface in the form of conductance variation is considered. Moreover, the current-voltage characteristic in terms of conductance model is applied to evaluate the performance of the biosensor model. Furthermore, the CNT-FET platform is employed for modeling biosensor in order to detect Glucose. For diagnosing and monitoring the blood glucose level, glucose oxidase (GOx) based enzyme sensors have been immensely used. According to the proposed CNT-FET structure, charge based analytical modeling approach is used. The charge-based carrier velocity model is implemented to study electrical characteristics of CNT-FET.

While technology scaling facilitates faster and high performance devices, at the same time it causes excessive power dissipation. Leakage power dissipation is now a dominating component of total power consumption in such portable devices. So there is a tremendous need to limit the power dissipation in high density chips which has initiated many innovative techniques to develop in the design of low power circuits and systems. Today's nano-scaled VLSI chips have ultra-thin gate oxide, very low threshold voltage and having short channels. As such leakage power dissipation has emerged as the most challenging issue in VLSI circuit and systems. This Chapter review and compare the state of the art circuit techniques for leakage minimization. It also conceptually classifies the different techniques of leakage minimization. Moreover, a detailed comparison based on trading-offs with other design parameters is also given along with leakage minimization.",

The proposed IPG-PSO method is an improved PSO by chaotic weight factor and guided by pseudo-gradient search for particle's movement in an appropriate direction.

In order to reduce test time while keeping the temperature of the cores under test within a safe range, thermal-aware test scheduling techniques are required. In this chapter, the authors address the test time minimization problem as how to generate the shortest test schedule such that the temperature limits of individual cores and the limit on the test-bus bandwidth are satisfied. In order to avoid overheating during the test, the authors partition test sets into shorter test sub-sequences and add cooling periods in between, such that applying a test sub-sequence will not drive the core temperature going beyond the limit. Furthermore, based on the test partitioning scheme, the authors interleave the test sub-sequences from different test sets in such a manner that a cooling period reserved for one core is utilized for the test transportation and application of another core. The authors have proposed an approach to minimize the test application time by exploring alternative test partitioning and interleaving schemes with variable length of test sub-sequences and cooling periods as well as alternative test schedules. Experimental results have shown the efficiency of the proposed approach.",

Firstly, security for dependable systems is a broad concept and traditional view of security, e.g., in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability, does not suffice. Secondly, a clear definition of security in the dependability context is not agreed upon. Thirdly, security attacks cannot be modeled as a stochastic process, because the adversary’s strategy is often carefully planned. In this chapter, we explore these challenges and provide some directions toward their solutions.",

This work considers its effectiveness on a small cluster (4 nodes) to determine any inefficiency present in the system and attempts to overcome them with the purpose of increasing performance. It was found that naïve use of HadoopUnit on a small cluster was slower than the best times achieved on a single machine, but by properly configuring the number of tests executed by each Hadoop Map task, a 75% reduction in execution time was achieved.

There are many similarities to testing web services in a local service-oriented architecture, but there are also significant differences. In a company specific SOA, testers can gain access to the source. This is not true of the cloud. There is no possibility of accessing the source. Therefore, testers must rely solely on the specification contained in the service level agreement – SLA – and the web service interface definition – WSDL or REST – to base their test upon. Testing in the cloud is strictly a black-box test. The goal of a cloud service test is also not to find errors but to assess the suitability of the service to the purpose of the user. It may be necessary to test several services in order to find that one best suited to the requirements of the user. To judge suitability it is necessary to define an ideal usage profile, including performance, security and other non-functional criteria, and to compare that with the actual profile of each potential service. For this both static and dynamic analysis methods must be applied. The chapter presents an automated approach to assessing cloud services and selecting that one most suitable to the user’s application.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Software as a Service (SaaS) has made it possible to develop dynamic and complex business processes as eServices. The development of business processes as eServices (SaaS) can be assisted by the means of adaptive or agile development processes. The development of business processes in terms of SaaS require to perform SaaS requirements engineering (RE), which is an important phase of a software development process for the success of any project. The challenge here is how best to do SaaS RE (e.g. mapping business process to eServices) and select agile development practices for developing business processes in terms of SaaS. In order to address this challenge, an integrated agile RE model for SaaS project development environments is outlined within this chapter. The purpose of the proposed RE model is to aid in iteratively determining SaaS requirements in short iterations as opposed to the “only first and onetime upfront” phase of a development process. Each identified SaaS requirement or a set of requirements for a given iteration is linked to a single or set of specific agile practices for implementation in short iterations. This model can be used as a guideline by organisations wishing to understand the challenging task of mapping business processes to SaaS and its implementation by using agile software development processes or practices.",

Although the KDD process has provided a lot of solutions, in many cases these techniques have to be scaled in order to deal with the new challenges posed by the big data paradigm. Cloud computing is the modern infrastructure that can provide the means to efficiently manage big data.

However, this challenge is still open, despite the efforts of the scientific community, due to its complexity. This complexity starts from the fact that NFRs can represent structural constraints, QoS attributes, temporal constraints, or behavioral attributes. Therefore, this characterization makes the task of web service composition lifecycle (e.g., specification, verification, integration, etc.) increasingly complicated. Therefore, this chapter investigates this point of view and suggests a complete approach supporting specification, formalization, validation, and code generation of desired composite web service. This approach has the advantage to tackle with quantifiable (i.e., measurable) and behavioral NFRs, and provide a support for composing NFRs with FRs using seamless weaving.",

The quality of the ontologies and the alignments between them is a great challenge to guarantee the usefulness of ontology repositories. Like ontologies, alignments are subject to changes throughout their life cycle, which can decrease their quality. As a result, alignments must be evolved and maintained in order to keep up with the change in ontology or to meet the demands of applications and users. This chapter reviews and classifies the main ontology alignment change approaches. In addition, the chapter presents a new approach for the alignment change problem. The approach proposes a general framework that consists of a process of change. Various methods, each with a specific purpose, are proposed to automate and support the change process.",

With the increase in the dimension of data, the chance of irrelevant, redundant, and noisy features or attributes also increases. Feature selection acts as a catalyst in reducing computation time and dimensionality, enhancing prediction performance or accuracy, and curtailing irrelevant or redundant data. The neuro-fuzzy approach is used for feature selection and classification with better insight by representing knowledge in symbolic forms. The neuro-fuzzy approach combines the merits of neural network and fuzzy logic to solve many complex machine learning problems. The objective of this article is to provide a generic introduction and a recent survey to neuro-fuzzy approaches for feature selection and classification in a wide area of machine learning problems. Some of the existing neuro-fuzzy models are also applied to standard datasets to demonstrate their applicability and performance.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is to improve driver safety and traffic efficiency. Most VANET applications are based on periodic exchange of safety messages between nearby vehicles and between vehicles and nearby road side communication units (e.g., traffic lights, road-side lights, etc.). This periodic communication generates huge amount of data that have typical storage, computation, and communication resources needs. In recent years, there has been huge developments in automotive industry, computing, and communication technologies. This has led to vehicular cloud computing (VCC) as a solution to satisfy the requirements of VANETs such as computing, storage, and networking resources. Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is a standard that comprehends cloud computing and related services to the proximity of a network. Since VANET applications have special mobility, low latency, and location awareness requirements, fog computing plays a significant role in VANET applications and services. In urban cities, vehicles parked at shopping malls, offices and similar other places are under-utilized. These can offer great opportunity and value to implement applications of VFC by utilizing vehicles as an infrastructure. In this chapter, we present real time scenarios and applications of VANET that can be implemented using VFC. VANET applications and quality of service can be enhanced by aggregating the resources of these vehicles. We discuss different types of scenarios of moving and parked vehicles as computational, communication, storage and network infrastructures. We have also discussed the challenges and open problems to implement VFC system. This chapter provides the thorough understanding of novel research paradigm and about vehicular communication infrastructures.",

The proposed framework deploys a local IDS to provide security in a substation. Whereas a global IDS is deployed to provide security in control center and overall smart grid network, it further verifies the consequences of control-commands issued by SDN controller and SCADA master.

This integration requires a power conditioning system (PCS), enabling smooth operation. Continuity of supply can be maintained by having a battery backup, for the time when both grid and solar array fail to meet the load demand.

Then, they detail how to check behavioral properties specified in temporal logic using the model checker NuSMV. A WSC is with added value only if the involved services are compatible. So, in this context, across the translation proposed, the authors develop a verification layer of the WSC compatibility. This work is developed in a framework named D&amp;A4WSC which allows to model the WSC by oWF-nets and to check their compatibility by invoking the model checker NuSMV. Furthermore, the authors extended D&amp;A4WSC so that it permits a web services choreography described in a WS-CDL specification. For this they developed a translation from WS-CDL to a composition of oWF-nets, so that one can verify this choreography by the aforementioned approach.",

The key element of the approach is the RadViz visualization that helps to identify groups with similar behavior and outliers. The scatter plot visualization of the time intervals with transaction activity supported by the heat map visualization of the historical activity of the MMTS subscriber is used to conduct analysis of how the MMTS users' transaction activity changes over time and detect sudden changes in it.

    "abstract": "Since the 1990s, the field of smart grid has attempted to remedy some of the core development deficiencies associated with power supply in the smart city. While it seemingly succeeds in provision of electricity, it fails to fully resolve the difficulties associated with sustainable energy consumption. This suggests that the future of smart grid analytics in the smart city largely depends on efficiency in energy consumption which integrates sustainability in the overall energy use. This chapter analyzes the nexus between smart grid, sustainable energy consumption, and the smart city.",

    "abstract": "Metamaterial-based design of microstrip antennas and other microwave structures have gained enormous popularity worldwide among researchers. The complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) is one of the most commonly used metamaterial structures in this direction. The CSRR structure yields a negative value of its effective permittivity at a narrow band near its resonant frequency. CSRR structure was initially proposed as a notch filtering element in microstrip transmission lines because of the negative permittivity. Later, the CSRR structure found its use in antennas and other microwave applications. The CSRR structure is reported to enhance the performance of a microstrip antenna in terms of its gain and bandwidth. In addition, CSRR structure is also used in the design of dual band antennas and antennas with integrated filters. This chapter deals with the practical design aspects relative to these applications of CSRR structures.",

In past few years, retrieval and extraction of information from a large amount of data is growing rapidly. Classification is nothing but a stepwise process of prediction of responses using some existing data. Some of the existing prediction algorithms are support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor. But there is always some drawback of each algorithm depending upon the type of data. To reduce misclassification, a new methodology of support vector machine is introduced. Instead of having the hyperplane exactly in middle, the position of hyperplane is to be change per number of data points of class available near the hyperplane. To optimize the time consumption for computation of classification algorithm, some multi-core architecture is used to compute more than one independent module simultaneously. All this results in reduction in misclassification and faster computation of class for data point.",

Past research showed that computer anxiety influences how users perceive ease of use of a learning management system (LMS). Although computer anxiety has been used successfully to evaluate the usability of LMS, the main data collection mechanisms proposed for its evaluation have been questionnaires. Questionnaires suffer from possible problems such as being inadequate to understand some forms of information such as emotions and honesty in the responses. Quantum-based approaches to consciousness have been very popular in the last years including the quantum model reduction in microtubules of Penrose and Hameroff (1995). The objective of the chapter is to propose an architecture based on a NeuroIS that collects data by using EEG from users and then use the collected data to perform analytics by using a quantum consciousness model proposed for computer anxiety measurements for the usability testing of a LMS.",

The four classical arithmetic operations can be defined on FNs, which play an important role in fuzzy mathematics analogous to the role played by the ordinary numbers in crisp mathematics. The simplest form of FNs is the triangular FNs (TFNs), while the trapezoidal FNs (TpFNs) are straightforward generalizations of the TFNs. In the chapter, a combination of the COG defuzzification technique and of the TFNs (or TpFNs) is used as an assessment tool. Examples of assessing student problem-solving abilities and basketball player skills are also presented illustrating in practice the results obtained. This new fuzzy assessment method is validated by comparing its outcomes in the above examples with the corresponding outcomes of two commonly used assessment methods of the traditional logic, the calculation of the mean values, and of the grade point average (GPA) index. Finally, the perspectives of future research on the subject are discussed.",

But the inadequacy of the parameterization tool in fuzzy set theory leads to difficulties for decision making in the game theory. Soft sets were introduced by Molodtsov to overcome this problem in fuzzy sets and it was illustrated by him. Choice functions play an important role in game theory. Soft set theory gives an opportunity to construct new mathematical tool which keeps all good sides of choice function and eliminates its drawbacks. Also, decision making is an integral part of games and many researchers have applied soft set theory in decision making. In this chapter, the authors describe all these and propose some important improvements leading to better deals in game environments.",

Regarding the issue, marketing and consumer scholars have conducted research on eWOM message senders and recipients. Focusing on eWOM receiving behavior, this chapter presents academic knowledge regarding how recipients evaluate mobile e-WOM messages and how he/she behaves as a consequence. There are two kinds of eWOM (i.e., PC-based eWOM and mobile-based eWOM [mWOM]). Moreover, two types of messages can be identified in each kind of eWOM—viral messages from marketers via friends and relatives, and eWOM reviews on products and services from anonymous senders. Prior studies on viral marketing can be further divided into two research streams; research that have constructed and tested causal models explaining why consumers participate in viral marketing, and research that have focused on illustrating comprehensively a multi-stage cognitive and behavioral customer journey towards receiving, using, and forwarding viral marketing messages.",

These first and striking results were not fully replicated by subsequent studies that were characterized by a more methodological robustness and attention to exposure aspects. In accordance with this view, latest reviews and metanalyses have confirmed the paucity of evidence and the lack of reliability of psychomotor and cognitive effects of acute RF EMF exposure on human volunteers, particularly when assessed in well controlled laboratory settings. Thus, despite the public opinion about potential biologic effects of acute RF EMFs irradiation, it can be concluded that to date there is substantial lack of evidence about a negative influence of non-ionizing radiations on cognitive functioning in humans.",

Next, the absolute difference is calculated between them and the result frame is converted into binary by applying gray threshold technique. The binary frame is segmented using contour extraction algorithm. The centroid representation is used for motion tracking. In the second stage of experiment, initially object is detected by using CECR and motion of each track is estimated by Kalman filter. Experimental results show that the proposed method can robustly detect and track the moving object.",

To help systematizing the various aspects relevant to interoperability, this chapter proposes a multidimensional interoperability framework, which includes the following dimensions: Lifecycle (with typical development stages), interoperability (based on compliance and conformance, with various layers of abstraction), and concerns (to deal with non-functional aspects such as security, quality of service, and social and legal issues).",

The DSM controls the match between the demand and supply of electricity. Another objective of DSM is to maintain the power quality in order to level the load curves. In this chapter, a genetic algorithm is used in conjunction with demand-side management techniques to find the optimal scheduling of energy consumption inside N buildings in a neighborhood. The issue is formulated as multi-objective optimization problem aiming at reducing the peak load as well as minimizing the energy cost. The simulations reveal that the adopted strategy is able to plan the daily energy consumptions of a great number of electrical devices with good performance in terms of computational cost.",

The gap between the cloud and the end devices must be reduced in latency specific applications (i.e., disaster management). Right now, fog computing is an advanced mechanism to reduce the latency and congestion in IoT networks. It emphasizes processing the data as close as possible to the edge of the networks, instead of sending/receiving the data from the data centre by using large quantity of fog nodes. The virtualization of these fog nodes (i.e., nodes are invisible to the users) in numerous locations across the data centres enabled the fog computing to become more popular. The end users need to purchase the computing resources from the cloud authorities to process their excessive workload. Since computing resources are heterogeneous and resource are constrained and dynamic in nature, allocating these resources to the users becomes an open research issue and must be addressed as the first priority.",

In the majority of cases, this reaction is of exothermic nature accompanied by a rise in temperature in the laminate. This leads to the appearance of a thermal gradient. This research aims to study the thermal gradient generated. The objective is to minimize the temperature excess in the composite. By means of a one-dimensional numerical study using the finite differential method, we have showed that the energy balance depends not only on the temperature and on the degree of curing but also on several other factors, namely: the volume fraction of the fibres, the temperature cycle, and the reinforcement thickness. Authors have shown in this study the effect of increasing temperature on the optimization of the curing cycle. The chapter also investigated the effect of thickness variation on temperature distribution in the composite. A comparison of the authors' results with literature achievements showed agreement.",

Firstly, face images under various conditions were acquired. Next, face detection was performed using the Viola Jones algorithm to detect the face in the original image. The original image was minimized and transformed into grayscale for faster computation. Histogram techniques of oriented gradients was applied to extract the features from the grayscale images, followed by the principal component analysis (PCA) in dimension reduction stage. Face recognition, the last stage of the entire system, using support vector machine (SVM) as classifier. The development of a graphical user interface for student attendance monitoring was also involved. The highest face recognition accuracy of 62% was achieved.

Due to the unavailability of channel parameters for UAVs at low altitudes, measurements were performed using a radio propagation simulator for generalized environments developed using ITU-R parameters. Further, cell coverage analysis is shown with simulation results obtained from the ray tracing. Later, an optimal replacement to UDNs was proposed to support the flash crowds and smart cites known as ultra-dense cloud drone network. This system is advantageous as it offers reduction in total cost of ownership due to its on-demand capability.

The controller should be logically centralized, but it must comply with availability, reliability, and security requirements, which implies that it should be physically distributed in the network. In this context, two questions arise: How many controllers should be included? and Where should they be located? These questions comprise the controller placement problem (CPP). The scope of this study is to solve the CPP using the meta-heuristic Tabu search algorithm to optimize the cost of network operation, considering flow setup latency and inter-controller latency constraints. The network model presented considers both controllers and links as IT resources as a service, which allows focusing on operational cost.",

    "abstract": "This chapter compares the performances of multiple Big Data techniques applied for time series forecasting and traditional time series models on three Big Data sets. The traditional time series models, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and exponential smoothing models are used as the baseline models against Big Data analysis methods in the machine learning. These Big Data techniques include regression trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM). Across three time series data sets used (unemployment rate, bike rentals, and transportation), this study finds that LSTM neural networks performed the best. In conclusion, this study points out that Big Data machine learning algorithms applied in time series can outperform traditional time series models. The computations in this work are done by Python, one of the most popular open-sourced platforms for data science and Big Data analysis.",

Such effects of the parasitic fractional elements have been studied via the simulations based on the obtained solutions where many interesting results have been proposed in the work. For example, it has been found that the parasitic fractional elements cause both charge and flux decay of the memristor and the impasse point breaking of the phase portraits between flux and charge of the memristor-based circuits similarly to the conventional parasitic elements. The effects of the order and the nonlinearity of the parasitic fractional elements have also been reported.",

Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been gaining popularity for analyzing histopathological images. Based on the predominant cancer type, the goal is to classify images into four categories of normal, benign, in situ carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma. The convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed to retrieve information at different scales, including both nuclei and overall tissue organization. This chapter utilizes several deep neural network architectures and gradient boosted trees classifier to classify the histology images among four classes.

In this chapter, a new objective function is generated that is also used as a more binding equality constraint. This generated equality constraint can be shown to significantly reduce the search region for the branch and bound-related algorithms. The verification process for optimality proposed in this chapter is easier than most of the available branch and bound-related approaches.

Historic data is collected for solar radiation, wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity, and are used to train the model.

The main application of influence maximization is promoting the product to a set of users. However, a real challenge in influence maximization algorithms to deal with enormous amount of users or nodes obtainable in any OSN is posed. The authors focused on graph mining of OSNs for generating ‘seed sets' using standard influence maximization techniques.

In this case, several parallel lines can be drawn from the given point to measure the indeterminacy, which is used to be find flight paths. It means these types of data do not follow the fifth law. To deal with them, following the NeutroAlgebra, a new geometry called as NeutroGeometry is studied in this chapter to characterize them based on Euclidean, non-Euclidean, and indeterminate zones.",

Paper packaging machinery manufacturer Windmöller &amp; Hölscher's representatives have been in-depth interviewed to gather their opinions. Since there are some relations that cannot be determined (i.e., existence of indeterminacy), neutrosophy became a necessity in this chapter. Delphi technique is implemented to obtain a single neutrosophic adjacency matrix. As a result, the sustainable supply chain structure based on environmental awareness and recycling has been modeled visually, and the causal relationships were determined.",

It asks expert opinions to evaluate the causal relationships of identified variables. However, in many cases experts cannot determine a relationship or can be doubtful about stating an idea. In the meantime, the neutrosophic cognitive mapping provides a step-by-step guidance in order to deal with the indeterminate relationships. Therefore, this study aims to propose a neutrosophic ISM approach and to implement it for the medical tourism services' barriers during the COVID-19 pandemic as an illustrative example. In order to do that, text mining was conducted to the medical tourism-related tweets written in English from January to December 2020 via RapidMiner software, and the barriers in medical tourism were identified. Next, the relationships between these barriers were examined via expert evaluations, and the proposed neutrosophic ISM was applied to construct a structural model.",

Chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science engineering, and telecommunication engineering are prone to a variety of uncertainty in terms of system uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. Hence, with the application of fuzzy soft set, the uncertainty in the mentioned engineering types can be handled very well. In this chapter, fuzzy soft set is applied for handling the uncertainty in the mentioned engineering domains. The performance achieved by the fuzzy soft set-enabled computer science and engineering and biotechnology is found to be good towards the performance metrics like response time, throughput, resource utilization rate, and error rate.",

    "abstract": "This chapter presents two methodologies for solving quadratic programming problems with multiple objectives under fuzzy stochastic environments. The right side parameters of the chance constraints of both the models are chosen as fuzzy random variables (FRVs) following different probability distributions. Like the previous chapters, chance constrained programming (CCP) methodology is employed to the fuzzy chance constraints to develop fuzzy programming model. In the first model, cut of fuzzy sets and fuzzy partial order relations are incorporated to the fuzzy programming model to develop an equivalent deterministic model. For the second model, defuzzification method of fuzzy numbers (FNs), which are presented in Chapter 2, are taken into consideration to generate equivalent quadratic programming model in a crisp environment. As the objective functions are quadratic in nature, it is easy to understand that the membership functions obtained through methodological development process are also quadratic in nature. To linearize the quadratic membership functions, linearization techniques are employed in this chapter. Finally, for achieving the maximum degree of each of the membership goals of the objectives, a fuzzy goal programming (FGP) approach is developed for the linearized membership goals and solved by minimizing under-deviational variables and satisfying modified system constraints in fuzzy stochastic decision-making environments. To illustrate the acceptability of the developed methodology presented in this chapter, some numerical examples are included.",

The transmission-line model is the simplest of these methods, and it provides good physical insight but is less accurate. The cavity model is more accurate compared to the transmission-line model, but cavity model is more complex. Though cavity model gives good physical insight, it is rather difficult to model coupling. The full-wave models (which include primarily integral equations/moment method) are very accurate, very versatile, but they are the most complex models and usually give less physical insight.

Reliability plays a major role at every stage in the manufacturing, testing and use of integrated circuit packages. The coupled influence of operating voltages and joule heating on the mechanical reliability of ICs is discussed here. Die shear tests were conducted on the ICs and the shear strength compared with the values obtained from the finite element results. Thermal tests were carried out on the ICs that were later inspected under a Scanning Acoustic Microscope (SAM) for delaminations arising from hygrothermal stresses. Finally the results of the electro-hygrothermo-mechanical analyses were analyzed and presented at the maximum operating temperature (MOT) that highlight the overall static reliability of the ICs with acceptable factors of safety. The main objective of this investigation is the construction of the failure envelopes through determination of the maximum operating temperatures and test temperatures of the ICs that aid in the evaluation of the overall static reliability of the ICs.",

    "abstract": "Typical applications involving image retrieval processes demand a great amount of computation. The visual content of the images is extracted and represented by means of descriptor vectors of multidimensional characteristics. The image retrieval process consists of two tasks: (1) generation of database and indexing; and (2) the search process. The first task involves the construction of descriptor vectors. Then, an index is built upon the database to speed the search process. The second requires calculating a descriptor vector for the query image and computes the similarity search with the ones stored in the index. In this context, it is relevant to devise new algorithms and different parallel platforms that can reduce execution times. In particular, this work focuses on platforms with FPGAs based SoCs to present and evaluate a two stage system where the index is constructed off-line and the similarity search is executed on-line. Results show that the FPGA is 73% faster than a 2 Quad CPU to compute the descriptor vector of an image when using the Color Layout Descriptor of MPEG-7.",

Solving the problem suggests search for effective directions in expansion of a system in terms of allocation of new heat sources, their type, output; construction of new heat networks, their schemes and parameters; detection of “bottlenecks” in the system and ways of their elimination (expansion, dismantling, replacement of heat pipeline sections, construction of pumping stations). The authors present a mathematical statement of the problem, its decomposition into separate subproblems and an integrated technique to solve it. Consideration is given to a real problem solved for a real heat supply system. A set of arising problems is presented. The application of developed methodological and computational tools is shown.",

Therefore, this chapter is dedicated to this class of circuits. A brief history of the first nonlinear circuits, which were the most important stages in the evolution of chaotic circuits, is given at the beginning of the chapter. Next, one of the most well known nonlinear circuits, the circuit of Colpitts oscillator, and its modifications, operating from a few Hertz up to the microwave region, are described in detail. A novel modification of Colpitts oscillator, which has higher fundamental frequency than the others do and greater Lyapunov dimension is also studied. Finally, some interesting applications of this class of circuits are presented at the end of this chapter.",

An adaptive weight particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to find the global optimum solution. To increase the efficiency of the proposed scheme, a co-simulation platform is developed. Since the proposed method is mainly based on the cost optimization, variations in loads and uncertainties within DG units are also taken into account to perform the analysis. An IEEE 123 node distribution system is used as a test distribution network which is unbalanced and multi-phase in nature, for the validation of the proposed scheme. The superiority of the proposed method is investigated through the comparisons of the results obtained that of a Genetic Algorithm based OPF method. This analysis also shows that the DG capacity planning considering annual load and generation uncertainties outperform the traditional well practised peak-load planning.",

This chapter describes a robust design methodology for enhanced reliability of analog front-end circuits in mixed-signal chips. The system under development is comprised of small blocks close to high-frequency analog circuits under test to down-convert signals to low frequencies such that they can be routed to an on-chip analog-to-digital converter architecture for built-in testing applications. An efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) engine is used to calculate the frequency spectrum of the signal with significantly less chip area compared to existing FFT engines. The self-contained system provides the measurement results in digital form to support digital calibration approaches, particularly those that involve digitally assisted analog blocks.",

Furthermore, changes in charged lipid membrane properties can be electrically detected by graphene based electrolyte gated Graphene Field Effect Transistor (GFET). In this chapter, monolayer graphene-based GFET with a focus on conductance variation occurred by membrane electric charges and thickness is studied. Monolayer graphene conductance as an electrical detection platform which is tuned by neutral, negative and positive electric charged membrane together with membrane thickness is suggested. Electric charge and thickness of the lipid bilayer (QLP and LLP) as a function of carrier density are proposed and the control parameters are defined.

The potential benefit of using H/W implementation of genetic algorithm is that it allows the use of huge parallelism which is suited to random number generation, crossover, mutation and fitness evaluation. The operation of selection and reproduction are basically problem independent and involve basic string manipulation tasks. The fitness evaluation task, which is problem dependent, however proves a major difficulty in H/W implementation. Another difficulty comes from that designs can only be used for the individual problem their fitness function represents. Therefore, in this work the genetic operators are implemented in H/W, while the fitness evaluation module is implemented in software (S/W). This allows a mixed hardware/software approach to address both generality and acceleration. Moreover, a simple H/W implementation for fitness evaluation of robot motion path planning problem is discussed.",

Electrical energy conversion systems consist of two main parts: Electrical machines and Power electronic converters. Electrical machines are used for converting electrical energy to mechanical one in the generator state and vice-versa in the motor state. To emphasize the importance of these devices, it may be noted that electrical motors consume about half of the total generated electrical energy in the world. On the other hand, power electronic converters are essential equipments which are used for electrical energy conditioning. These equipments have observed considerable growth in modern industries in recent years. Because energy conditioning allows us to use energy with higher efficiency and better performance, in this chapter, importance of electric power converters in modern industries is presented. The aim of this presentation is showing the dependence of various industrial functions to conversion of electric power. Basic relations of various electrical machines as well as power electronic converters are presented. In each section, some typical industrial examples are presented. This background will be used in the next chapters for reliability calculation and improvement. In fact, this chapter is an introduction on reasons of writing an individual book about reliability of electric power converters.",

Reliability prediction is a tool for this goal. Reliability is the probability of performing adequately to achieve the desired aim of the system. In this chapter, probability calculation is used to predict failure rate of the converter. The formulation of these calculations are based on the concepts of failure factors which were described in the previous chapter. Some detailed examples are presented to show the power of probability tool for analyzing the behavior of complex systems. This chapter covers the methods for reliability calculation from component to system level. Some standards of reliability are presented. One can use the information from a reliability prediction to guide design decisions throughout the development cycle. MIL-HDBK-217 is described in details as a well-known standard for reliability prediction at component level. Reliability modeling is introduced for calculating the reliability at system level. Difference between system block diagram and reliability model is presented. The reliability models of various static and rotary power converters are expressed. Some examples are presented to demonstrate the procedure of calculations for a simple converter with its auxiliary components. This chapter gives a quantitative view to reader about evaluation of reliability and it can be used in the next chapters for reliability improvement.",

The central processing unit (CPU) of the controller receives input from position sensors, processes that input, and then outputs operation control signals that indicate the updated course that the vehicle will take. A programming interface and operation controls are also included as parts of the controller. This interface helps to facilitate communication between the various controller components. Inputs from position sensors are normalized for the processor by the controller, which then sends outputs from itself as inputs into the operation control mechanisms. It is a stand-alone device that can be configured to function with a broad range of distant sensors and control mechanisms. As a direct consequence of the rapid spread of new technologies, edge computing has developed into a more widespread practice. Users may be able to have a more individualized and interactive experience in their day-to-day lives thanks to edge computing and edge devices.",

The chapter focuses on how the voltage difference perturbs the battery pack's performance by using an optimized control strategy. It helps in battery operated vehicles to charge and work efficiently. The control strategy involves the proper switching of the resistors connected to the charging circuit. The thermal balance of the resistors is balanced using the thermal power dissipation modelling in simulation. The models are tested under variable cell voltage conditions in MATLAB Simulink. The technique for voltage error balancing is termed passive cell balancing in BMS for the arrangement of a multiplicity of cells in stacks. The major issue of the passive cell balancing arises due to the State of Charge (SoC) imbalance in the batteries. The charging conditions of the battery are taken into the parameter estimation for the control technique of the balancing technique.",

The author calls them finite mixed projective-affine-hyperbolic planes.

In this chapter, we discuss methods to generate sample paths of this underlying stochastic process for situations where the well-stirredness or fast-diffusion assumption holds true. We introduce various approximations to exact simulation algorithms that are more efficient in terms of computational complexity.

A certain level of PD may be tolerated because corrective maintenance requires the transformer to be removed from service. However, PD cannot simply be ignored because it can provide advance warning of potentially serious faults, which in the worst cases might lead to complete failure of the transformer. Conventional monitoring based on dissolved gas analysis does not provide information on the defect location that is necessary for a complete assessment of severity. This chapter describes the use of ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensors to detect and locate sources of PD in transformers. The UHF technique was developed for gas-insulated substations in the 1990s and its application has been extended to power transformers, where time difference of arrival methods can be used to locate PD sources. This chapter outlines the basis for UHF detection of PD, describes various UHF sensors and their installation, and provides examples of successful PD location in power transformers.",

Most of the research work in IC test technology has focused on problems of production testing, while the problem of self test in the field of application has found much less attention. With SoCs being used also in long-living systems for safety critical applications, such enhanced self test capabilities become essential for the dependability of the host system. For example, automotive electronic systems must be capable of performing a fast and effective start-up self test. For future self-repairing systems, fault diagnosis will become necessary, since it is the base for dedicated system re-configuration. One way to solve this problem is a hierarchical self-test scheme for embedded SoCs, based on hardware and software. The core of the test architecture then is a test processor device, which is optimised to organize and control test functions efficiently and at minimum cost. This device must be highly reliable by itself. The chapter introduces the basic concept of hierarchical HW / SW based self test, the test processor concept and architecture, and its role in a hierarchical self test scheme for SoCs.",

One common approach to address this concern is to create “software testing factories” with the aim of increasing testing efficiency by standardizing and speeding up delivery of testing services. To achieve this balance, software testing factories are turning to cloud-based infrastructures as an essential delivery approach. Cloud technology exhibits characteristics that make adoption of software testing factories particularly attractive: elasticity of resources, ease of deployment, and flexible pricing.

By introducing ideas around the software development life cycle, source code analysis, documentation, and testing, and touching on best practices, this chapter demonstrates ways in which scientific software can be improved and future developments made easier. This is not a research article on current software engineering methods, nor does it attempt to specify best practices. Its aim is to introduce components that can be built into a tailored process. The chapter draws upon ideas of best practice current in software engineering, but recommends using these only selectively. This is done by presenting details of tools that can be used to implement these ideas and a set of case studies to demonstrate their use.",

Unfortunately, enterprise DRE system developers and testers often lack the necessary resources to support such testing efforts. This chapter discusses how test clouds (i.e., cloud-computing environments employed for testing) can provide the necessary testing resources. When combined with system execution modeling (SEM) tools, test clouds can provide the necessary toolsets to perform QoS testing earlier in the lifecycle. A case study of design and implementing resource management infrastructure from the domain of shipboard computing environments is used to show how SEM tools and test clouds can help identify defects in system QoS specifications and enforcement mechanisms before they become prohibitively expensive to fix.",

What starts as a step in evolution, grows into a mass movement in Internet and social media, and results in an avalanche of books, training, and consultancy services. Each proponent tries to differentiate from others with extreme statements of own superiority and blames of others’ shortcomings. Only a next fad, hype, or paradigm shift seems to be able to override the previous. This chapter looks through the fad, hype, or paradigm shift statements and describes the principles of the agile and lean approaches to the software development. Then it introduces the service orientation that is expected to be the next major shift. If it will overshadow the agile and lean excitement in the software industry, is discussed at the end of the chapter. In addition, this chapter looks into the past in order to find a continuum between these topics till today and to the future. Further some chasms in this continuum are identified, where a new idea has made a major shift and consequently has become a major force in the field. The service orientation in the software development is in the early phase of its lifecycle. The question is: will it still go through some chasm until it settles for large use, or is it already through all of adaptations and ready to be the next wave of evolution, or the next fad, hype and paradigm shift in software industry? The last part of this chapter proposes one more adaptation that creates continuum from the agile and lean approaches but brings up also the revitalization of architecting and design methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Various information systems are widely used in the information society era, and the demand for highly dependable system is increasing year after year. However, software testing for such a system becomes more difficult due to the enlargement and the complexity of the system. In particular, it is often difficult to test parallel and distributed systems in the real world after deployment, although reliable systems, such as high-availability servers, are parallel and distributed systems. To solve these problems, the authors propose a software testing environment for dependable parallel and distributed system using the cloud computing technology, named D-Cloud. D-Cloud consists of the cloud management software as the role of the resource management, and a lot of virtual machine monitors with fault injection facility in order to simulate hardware faults. In addition, D-Cloud introduces the scenario manager, and it makes a number of different tests perform automatically. Currently, D-Cloud is realized by the use of Eucalyptus as the cloud management software. Furthermore, the authors introduce FaultVM based on QEMU as the virtualization software, and D-Cloud frontend that interprets test scenario, constructs test environment, and dispatches commands. D-Cloud enables automating the system configuration and the test procedure as well as performing a number of test cases simultaneously and emulating hardware faults flexibly. This chapter presents the concept and design of D-Cloud, and describes how to specify the system configuration and the test scenario. Furthermore, the preliminary test example as the software testing using D-Cloud is presented. As the result, the authors show that D-Cloud allows easy setup of the environment, and to test the software testing for the distributed system.",

This method is complemented by an approach to analyze functional coverage of the proven Bounded Model Checking (BMC) properties.

Here, the authors investigate the use of cloud computing to facilitate the testing of large-scale software. They discuss the aspects of cloud-based testing and provide an example application of this. They describe the testing of the functional importance of methods of classes in the Google Chrome software. The methods that we test are predicted to be functionally important with respect to a functionality of the software. The authors use network analysis applied to dynamic analysis data generated by the software to make these predictions. They check the validity of these predictions by mutation testing of a large number of mutated variants of the Google Chrome.

To meet these objectives, a model-driven Scrum for Service-Oriented Software Reengineering (mScrum4SOSR) methodology was chosen and applied to a reengineering project. Scrum is employed to manage the reengineering project, as well as to measure implementation effort related to the modernization process. Further, a re-documentation technique called 5W1H Re-Doc is used to re-document the non-secure software application at a high level of abstraction in order to help project participants comprehend what is needed to identify candidate services for service-oriented reengineering.

    "abstract": "Grid systems and cloud servers are two distributed networks that deliver computing resources (e.g., file storages) to users' services via a large and often global network of computers. Virtualization technology can enhance the efficiency of these networks by dedicating the available resources to multiple execution environments. This chapter describes applications of virtualization technology in grid systems and cloud servers. It presents different aspects of virtualized networks in systematic and teaching issues. Virtual machine abstraction virtualizes high-performance computing environments to increase the service quality. Besides, grid virtualization engine and virtual clusters are used in grid systems to accomplish users' services in virtualized environments, efficiently. The chapter, also, explains various virtualization technologies in cloud severs. The evaluation results analyze performance rate of the high-performance computing and virtualized grid systems in terms of bandwidth, latency, number of nodes, and throughput.",

Participants are asked to judge the selected twenty sidewalk photographs with the rating scales through a psychological survey. Two perception factors including harmoniousness and openness are specified through semantic differential technique by using factor analysis. In the meantime the physical components of sidewalk environments are surveyed in the field survey. Then the rough sets approach is applied to link people’s perception factors and physical components of sidewalk environment. The application of the rough sets approach outputs the most important attributes to people’s perceptions, minimal attribute sets without redundancy, and a series of decision rules that represent the relationships between perceptions and physical components of sidewalk environments. The analytical approach helps to better understand people’s perceptions to sidewalk environments in a small city and then establish a useful and constructive ground of discussion for walking environment design and management.",

It is extremely difficult for amputees to carry out their daily activities and to deal with daily life as normal people do. The purpose of the myoelectric prosthesis is to restore the basic functions of the lost organs in the joint using neural signals produced by the muscles. Unfortunately, the use of such myosignals is complicated. In addition, once detected, it usually requires a computational force strong enough to convert it into a user-controlled signal. Its modification to the actual function of the implant is limited by a number of factors, especially those associated with the fact that each amputee has a different muscle movement. Modified artificial intelligence systems designed for pattern recognition have the potential to improve the size of implants but still fail to provide a system in which artificial arms can be controlled by brain signals.",

The considered heat sources are mainly due to electrical overpotentials (Ohm, activation, and concentration). The results are obtained according to a FORTRAN code based on the proposed model that is numerically modeled using the finite difference method.

Hydrogen is the only secondary energy carrier that is suitable for wide application. At the center of attention is the fact that hydrogen can be obtained from a wide range of primary energies. It can be used advantageously for a wide range of applications. Hydrogen can be used in decentralized systems without emitting CO2. Hydrogen is already a part of today's chemical industry, but as an energy resource, its rare benefits can only be achieved through fuel cell technology. The next generations of energy systems for stationary applications based on hydrogen fuel cell have the potential of using and implementing clean energy in the residential buildings sector, as well as in the tertiary and industrial sector, thus having a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions decreasing, specific characteristics of hydrogen technology having an important role in the decarbonization of energy production systems.",

Data were collected from 120 managers in 22 Egyptian banks. Age, tenure in the job, and user involvement in systems development were found to be positively correlated with user satisfaction. However, age, organizational level and education were found to be negatively associated with system usage. While beneficial to the Egyptian IS managers, such evidence from developing countries should contribute to the building of a general theory of transnational global information systems.",

The work is not limited to just classifying the query but also explores how these classifications will help search engines to make modifications in their user interface, which helps users to reach their desired information faster.

    "abstract": "One of the most important IT sectors that requires big data management is mobile data communication systems (MDCS) of GSM companies. In the charging mechanism of current MDCS, a subscriber “surfs” on the internet that creates data traffic and a counter subtracts the amount of data used by the user from the subscriber's quota. In other words, instant constant quota values are assigned to subscribers without concern for their previous amount of internet usage in current MDCS. Moreover, constant quota values cause constant charge calls in control traffic that are repeated for all new quota requests. Thus, performance degradation occurs because of the repetition of quota request calls and allocations. In this chapter, a dynamic quota calculation system (DQCS) is proposed for dynamic quota allocations and charging in MDCS using data mining approaches as two cascaded blocks. The first block is self-organizing map (SOM) clustering based on a sliding window (SW) methodology followed by the second block, which is the markov chain (MC); the overall system is denoted as “SOM/SW and MC.”",

Universal description discovery and integration (UDDI) help businesses, organizations, and other web services providers to discover and reach to the service(s) by providing the URI of the WSDL file. However, it does not offer a mechanism to choose a web service based on its quality. The standard also lacks sufficient semantic description in the content of web services. This lack makes it difficult to find and compose suitable web services during analysis, search, and matching processes. In addition, a central UDDI suffers from one centralized point problem and the high cost of maintenance. To get around these problems, the authors propose in this chapter a novel framework based on mobile agent and metadata catalogue for web services discovery. Their approach is based on user profile in order to discover appropriate web services, meeting customer requirements in less time and taking into account the QoS properties.",

    "abstract": "In today's competitive market, deregulation of power industry is inevitable. The aim of deregulating the power markets is to bring competition into them and thereby make them more economically efficient. In an economically efficient market, no consumer or producer has the ability to impact on prices by itself or by collaborating with any other participant. However, the electricity wholesale market is not a perfect market and the potential for market power exploitation is an issue. Sometimes private companies collaborate with each other to get more profit, driving the prices to a higher level and thus acquiring a market power which is an anti-competitive practice. Thus, market power is the capability of a seller or a group of sellers to profitably maintain the prices above a competitive level and control the total output for a noteworthy period of time.",

The authors review different kinds of probes, documenting and analyzing two separate deployments—technology probes and informational probes—in a care setting. They suggest that probes, when deployed in this fashion, reflect a “post-disciplinary” era of “messy” data and a shift of attention beyond “the social” to greater concern with individual variation, personal aggregated datasets in technology design, materiality, and the visual. The authors also suggest that in an era of big data, through considering everyday development in terms of personhood, everyday technology and practice, probes can play an important role in providing insights concerning the product of people-oriented programming and, potentially, its process.",

Along with these issues and with limited energy resources, it is imperative to look for non-conventional methods of power generation like from renewable energy resources. Microgrid has emerged as a new field that can meet the energy demand with a special emphasis on good power quality, reliability, and security. A major concern with the use of renewable energy resources is their intermittent nature which makes their integration and operation a challengeable task. Energy storage devices like batteries can be used to overcome the problem of intermittent nature of renewable energy resources. This chapter focusses on different aspects of renewable energy resources in detail. It analyzes the effectiveness of the proposed topology of the microgrid for health clinic load profile with the help of PVSYST software.",

We identify various parameters that moderate energy consumption of these hashes and protocols. Our work is directed towards redesigning or modifying these algorithms to make them consume lesser energy. As a first step, we try to determine the applicability of the asymptotic energy complexity model by Roy on these hashes and protocols. Specifically, we try to observe whether parallelizing the access of blocks of data in these algorithms reduces their energy consumption based on the energy model. Our results confirm the applicability of the energy model on these hashes and protocols. Our work is motivated by the importance of cryptographic hashes and symmetric key protocols for the cloud. Hence the design of more energy efficient hashes and protocols will contribute in reducing the cloud energy consumption that is continuously increasing.",

Multicollinearity effect may harm classification analysis from producing good parameters estimate during the construction of the classification rule. The common approach to deal with multicollinearity is feature extraction. However, the criterion used in extracting the raw features based on variances may not be appropriate for the ultimate goal of classification accuracy. Alternatively, feature selection method would be advisable as it chooses only valuable features. Two distance-based criteria in determining the right features for classification purposes, Wilk's Lambda and bounded Mahalanobis distance, are applied. Classification with features determined by bounded Mahalanobis distance statistically performs better than Wilk's Lambda. This chapter suggests that classification of e-nose with feature selection is a good choice to limit the cost of experiments and maintain good classification performance.",

With the aim of overcoming the limitation of existing frameworks, which only mine periodic patterns individually, a framework is proposed to mine periodic patterns on both the aspects together. Further, the patterns are analyzed to develop a better understanding of the dynamic network. A set of six parameters, defined later in the chapter, are used to conduct a microscopic study on the behavior of interactions. The framework is tested on real world and synthetic datasets.

The CI duration follows p-persistent CSMA mechanism, which allows M2M devices to contend for the transmission slots with equal priorities. After contention, only those devices which have won time-slots are allowed to transmit data packets during TI. In the proposed MAC scheme, the TI duration follows TDMA mechanism. Each M2M transmitter device and its corresponding one-hop distant receiver communicate using IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol within each TDMA slot to overcome various limitations of TDMA mechanism.

This motivates the Fog computing architecture, where IoT systems distribute their processes to the computational resources at the edge networks near data sources and end-users. Although fog computing is a promising solution, it also raises a challenge in mobility support for mobile ubiquitous applications. Lack of proper mobility support will increase the latency due to various factors such as package drop, re-assigning tasks to fog servers, etc. To address the challenge, this chapter proposes a dynamic and proactive fog computing approach, which improves the task distribution process in fog-assisted mobile ubiquitous applications and optimizes the task allocation based on runtime context information.

More precise time variations of the electric fields produced by spacecraft equipment have to be characterized, measured, and modeled. The proposed methodology is employing equivalent dipole modeling (EDM) to describe the ELF electric field spectral dependency. Each spectral component of the measured field is considered isolated and produced by one electric dipole. In order to validate the accuracy of the proposed methodology, various ELF signals in different distances are studied. In addition, since the validation of the proposed methodology would require “on ground” measurements and due to the low-frequency range, test facilities decoupling techniques are discussed. Moreover, early considerations including contributing phenomena for the complete spacecraft system modeling are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation network promises to integrate cross-domain carriers; thus, infrastructure can be provided as a service. 5G-PPP's vision is directed toward solving existing 4G LTE mobility challenges that congest core networks, disrupt multimedia and data transfer in high mobility situations such as trains or cars. This research adopts 5G methodology by using software-defined networking (SDN) to propose a novel mobile IP framework that facilitates seamless handover, ensures session continuity in standard and wide area coverage, and extends residential/enterprise indoor services across carriers under service level agreement while ensuring effective offload mechanism to avoid core network congestion. Performance excels existing protocols in setup and handover delays such as eliminating out-band signaling in bearer setup/release and isolating users' packets in virtual paths. Handover across cities in wide area motion becomes feasible with lower latency than LTE handover inside city. Extending indoor services across carriers becomes equivalent to LTE bearer setup inside a single carrier's PDN.",

    "abstract": "Food quality evaluation is a tedious job as it can be sensed either by its flavor, taste, or appearance. Sensory evaluation for food quality determination is very complex and depends on biological sensor systems and is subject to high variability depending on taster's mood, physical state, etc. Moreover, as it is purely subjective, the observations may vary for different tasters. For food industries the instrumental means for quality monitoring has significant appreciations which are repeatable, accurate, and reliable. Electronic nose is an array of sensors that senses based on aroma of samples. For the last two decades, electronic nose has been applied in several domains of applications in food analysis, for example, food quality monitoring based on seasonal effect, ageing, geographical origin, fermentation, etc. This chapter aims to focus on different domains of application of electronic nose in food analysis.",

Moreover, coupled synchronization of fractional-order chaotic system is investigated theoretically. The synchronization performances with synchronization controller parameters and derivative order varying are analyzed. Synchronization and complexity of intermediate variables which generated by ADM are investigated.

In current CI solutions, white-box testing is left to the work methodology, typically addressed after code reviews. Code security inspection is often done in specific code reviews focusing on security. SonarQube is a tool that, to a certain extent, can automate white-box design and testing and serve as a guide for formal code reviews. Moreover, this tool can help audit the code for potential security issues. Most web programming today uses components readily available and transparently managed by package managers, like npm for Node.js or Composer for PHP. This use must also be audited at least for potential security problems; yet traditional white-box test design would require a good understanding of the vendor code, which can be difficult/impractical to achieve. This chapter will address SonarQube as a valuable tool to automate white-box and security testing and also provide suggestions on how to manage your vendor branches when there is a need to audit/change the vendor source code.",

This can support efficient management of traffic in the city, and cops can communicate with each other, get real-time, accurate, status update of the traffic, track the vehicular movements, etc. In addition, jam control mechanism can be placed on heavy traffic days to optimize the routes.

In addition, both introduce more application coupling than required, since data schemas need to be common, even if not all instantiations of those schemas are used. This chapter contends that it is possible to improve this scenario by conceiving a new architectural style, structural services, which combines services and resources to reduce the semantic gap with the applications, allowing to tune the application integration between pure service-based and pure resource-based, or an intermediate mix. Unlike REST, resources are not constrained to offer a fixed set of operations, and unlike SOA, services are allowed to have structure. In addition, compliance is used to reduce coupling to the bare minimum required by the actually used application features.",

Performance and operating frequency of the slot antenna are strongly dependent on the dimension and shape of the slot or slotted array on the antenna. Nowadays, most antennas are designed using numerical simulation software for accuracy in analysis. However, analytical formulations still play an important role in the pre-design of the antenna due to the numerical simulation which still requires relatively long period of computation time compared to the analytical calculation. The predicted dimension of the antenna from analytical calculations will only require minor adjustment to optimize its performance in numerical simulation. Hence, the time spent for the antenna design can be shortened. Besides the performance of antenna, the antenna calibration process is crucial as well for releasing systematic errors in the antenna measurements. Some one-port calibration methods are described in detail.",

Second, it builds up its service platform with two business strategies, two marketing strategies, and two management of technology. Third, the integration of these strategies becomes a three-part entrepreneurial strategy, which realizes economies of scale and scope cyclically. Finally, it realizes agglomeration economies in the service platform. Therefore, start-up with two-sided markets and freemium not only dares to design its service platform with single architecture but also should build up the three-part entrepreneurial strategy to formulate service platform as market before building up its business ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "In natural language, individual things are typically referenced by proper names or definite descriptions. Data modeling languages differ considerably in their support for such linguistic reference schemes. Understanding these differences is important both for modeling reference schemes within such languages and for transforming models from one language to another. This chapter provides a comparative review of reference scheme modeling within the Unified Modeling Language (version 2.5.1), the Barker dialect of entity relationship modeling, Object-Role Modeling (version 2), relational database modeling, the Web Ontology Language (version 2.0), and LogiQL (an extended form of datalog). The authors identify which kinds of reference schemes can be captured within these languages as well as those reference schemes that cannot be captured. The analysis covers simple reference schemes, compound reference schemes, disjunctive reference, and context-dependent reference schemes.",

    "abstract": "The chapter deals with the problem of controlling the flow of information coming from a group of unmanned air vehicles by radio channel. The inevitable data losses are compensated by repetition of lost packages or reconfiguration network. Modern methods control of data flow assumes using a mechanism ARQ based on the method sliding window. The consequence of these problems is a partial or total loss of its performance manifested in a decrease in the network's starting throughput. Part of the problem of restoring the network is solved by routing mechanisms, which lead to reconfiguration of the network due to the elimination of faulty nodes. Management of computer network overload is solved by well-known routing protocols such as OSPF, IS-IS, RIP, and others. In solving the problem, the representation of the output of individual nodes of the network using the “death and reproduce” scheme was used substantially. This scheme of network operation presupposes its representation by the Markov chain and the derivation of probabilistic characteristics by solving the Kolmogorov equations.",

Indeed, the main advantage of this approach is its very good frequency resolution for a very short acquisition time, something impossible to achieve with the conventional method.

According to published surveys, two-fifths of the faults are due to bearing failures. Inter-turn short circuit faults in stator windings are approximately responsible for one-third of the motor faults. In the last few decades, various methods and alternative techniques have been proposed and implemented to diagnose induction motor faults. In an induction motor, stator winding and bearing faults account the largest percentage of motor failure. Due to the fact these faults can lead the motor to catastrophic failure that are expensive in term of maintenance cost, wastage raw material, and unplanned shutdown. Thus, to diagnose the state of motor and overcome existing problem, the chapter provides detailed invasive methods which are proposed and are currently in practice.

The proposed method projects the high dimensional input data into the random low dimensional space. The data independent and distance preserving property helps the proposed method to reduce the computational complexity of the machine learning algorithm.

For deterministic computer simulators, the realizations of Gaussian Process (GP) models are commonly used for fitting a surrogate statistical metamodel of the simulator output. The chapter starts with a quick review of the standard GP based statistical surrogate model. The chapter also emphasizes on the numerical instability due to near-singularity of the spatial correlation structure in the GP model fitting process. The authors also present a few generalizations of the GP model, reviews methods and algorithms specifically developed for analyzing big data obtained from computer model runs, and reviews the popular analysis goals of such computer experiments.

    "abstract": "Ubiquitous use of wireless technology and ad-hoc networks have paved the way for intelligent transportation systems also known as vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Several trust-based frameworks have been proposed to counter the challenges posed by such fast mobile networks. However, the dynamic nature of VANETs make it difficult to maintain security and reliability solely based on trust within peers. Decision-making upon collaborative communications is critical to functioning of VANETs in safe, secured, and reliable manner. Decision taken over malicious or wrong information could lead to serious consequences. Hence, risk management within paradigm of trust becomes an important factor to be considered. In this chapter, a survey of the existing works having incorporated risk factor in their trust models has been explored to give an overview of approaches utilized. The parameters chosen in these models are analyzed and categorized based on the approaches modeled. Finally, future research directions will be presented.",

    "abstract": "Social networking systems are usually huge centralized systems owned by a single company. However, this solution has many drawbacks (e.g., lack of privacy, lack of anonymity, risks of censorship, and operating costs). This chapter proposes a novel P2P system that leverages existing, widespread, and stable technologies such as DHTs and BitTorrent. In particular, it introduces a key-based identity system and a model of social relations for distributing content efficiently among interested readers. The proposed system, called Blogracy, is a micro-blogging social networking system focused on (1) anonymity and resilience to censorship, (2) authenticatable content, and (3) semantic interoperability using activity streams. This chapter presents the model and the implementation of the Blogracy system, discusses the experimentations to study its behavior, and presents their results regarding (1) communication delays for some simulations of node churn, (2) delays measured in test operations over PlanetLab in direct communication, and (3) through the I2P anonymizing network.",

In this context, conventional optoelectronic devices are replaced by novel photonic counterparts, both in transreceiver design as well as devices and systems. The major objective of this replacement is to reduce noise by means of lower scattering, where photons are only responsible for propagation of electromagnetic wave. With introduction of novel materials, low-loss communication system can now be designed at beyond THz range, mainly due to the physical realization of electromagnetic bandgap structure. This chapter is extended towards plasmonics with the intension of making sensors for beyond THz applications.",

Guided media acts to direct the transmission of energy from transmitter to receiver. Transmission lines are usually used in low frequency power distribution and in high frequency communications as well as in the ethernet and internet in computer networks. Two or more parallel conductors may be used to construct a transmission line, which connects source to a load. Typical transmission lines consist of coaxial line, waveguide, microstrip line, coplanar waveguide, etc. In this chapter, problems related with transmission lines are solved with the help of EM field theory and electric circuit theory.",

Recently there has been considerable interest in applying DHT routing algorithms to application-level multicast. However, early DHT-based multicast protocols are insufficient in addressing a number of technical issues such as heterogeneous capacity of nodes or node churn. In this chapter, the author describes a solution called BAM-Chord (i.e., Bandwidth Adaptive Multicast over Chord) that optimizes the topology of a multicast tree based on node bandwidth. In the proposed solution, node position (i.e., node identifier) on a BAM-Chord ring will be decided based on node bandwidth capacity such that it can build a wide and balanced multicast tree rooted at the source node. As a result, BAM-Chord protocol can utilize network resources of every node to reduce the depth of the multicast tree and take advantages of DHTs in maintaining the multicast tree.",

There are product vendors bringing forth additional capabilities to easily and quickly setup and sustain competent cloud environments, which are being positioned as the one-stop IT solution for worldwide business organizations. The business domains such as governments, retail stores, healthcare providers, telecommunication service providers, supply chain and logistics, utilities, homeland security, etc. are keenly embracing the cloud idea to be ahead of their competitors in their operations, outputs, and offerings. However, there are some critical challenges and concerns being associated with the cloud paradigm. The widely quoted non-functional requirements (NFRs) and the quality of service (QoS) attributes such as security, performance, reliability, modifiability, and availability have to be fulfilled by cloud software, platform and infrastructures in order to boost the confidence level of business executives and institutions. There are mission-critical and emergency services, which are finding their residence in cloud environments (private, public, and hybrid). Their requirements are quite unique and hence researchers across the globe are striving hard and stretching further to bring forth innovative, disruptive, and transformation technology solutions to fulfill the various needs. This chapter proposes a cloud-based network architecture that contributes a consistent and ubiquitous internet connection. The mesh topology is recommended here to ensure that the connectivity is available all the time without any fail and slowdown. The security of data when it gets transmitted over channels, persisted in data stores, and used by applications, has to be ensured in order to boost the confidence of data owners and users. Hence, this chapter proposes a secure cloud-based heterogeneous network using a novel routing protocol.",

The research of a GaAs single stage solid state broadband power amplifier based of ATF13876 which operates in the frequency band ranging from 1.17 GHz to 3 GHz is presented in this chapter. The wider bandwidth circuits are designed by using transmission lines which are intrinsically wideband circuits. With carefully designed biasing and broadband matching networks, unconditionally stability and excellent matching performance are fulfilled over the overall operating bandwidth with a maximum power gain of 17.34 dB and a saturated output power of 17 dBm. Considering the wider bandwidth of the proposed BPA, the latter compares favorably with the contemporary state-of-the-art.",

In this regard, communication process is the most energy demanding in sensor nodes. Subsequently, using energy-aware routing protocols in order to decrease the communications costs as much as possible and increase the network lifetime is of paramount importance. In this chapter, we have mainly focused on the most recent-based clustered routing algorithms for heterogeneous WSNs, namely Selected Election Protocol (SEP), and Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering Protocol (DEEC). In addition, we have proposed an efficient clustered routing protocol based on Zonal SEP algorithm. Indeed, we have evaluated the performance of the proposed protocol according to different scenarios in order to guarantee the best distribution of heterogeneous nodes in the network. The results have shown that the proposed clustered routing approach outperforms the existed Z-SEP protocol in terms of energy efficiency and stability.",

All human beings have the ability to concentrate on a single source of their interest and ignore the other sources as disturbing background noise. To apply this powerful gift to a machine, it must obligatory pass through the source separation process. If there is not enough information about the process of mixture of those sources and their nature as well, the problem is known by Blind Source Separation BSS. This thesis is dedicated to study the BSS as a solution for human machine interaction. The objective consists in recovering one or several source signals from a given mixture signal. Recently, the science research is towards artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. The proposed approach for the separation will be to apply a Deep Neural Network method based on Keras. Extracting features from the audio with signal processing techniques and machine learning to learn a representation from the audio for the compression tasks and the suppression of the noise will improve the state-of-the-art.",

Results showed that RS-PTS is the best one among descent-heuristics algorithms. Metaheuristics algorithms can also be classified into single solution-based methods and nature-inspired methods. Among metaheuristics algorithms, two natural inspired algorithms and one single solution-based methods, namely PSO, ABC, and SA, were selected to be compared with descent-heuristics algorithms.

    "abstract": "At present, public health and population health are the key areas of major concern, and the current study highlights the significant challenges through a few case studies of application of machine learning for health data with focus on regression. Four types of machine learning methods found to be significant are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In light of the case studies reported as part of the literature survey and specific exercises carried out for this chapter, it is possible to say that machine learning provides new opportunities for automatic learning in expressive models. Regression models including multiple and multivariate regression are suitable for modeling air pollution and heart disease prediction. The applicability of STATA and R packages for multiple linear regression and predictive modelling for crude birth rate and crude mortality rate is well established in the study as carried out using the data from data.gov.in. Decision tree as a class of very powerful machine learning models is applied for brain tumors. In simple terms, machine learning and data mining techniques go hand-in-hand for prediction, data modelling, and decision making. The health analytics and unpredictable growth of health databases require integration of the conventional data analysis to be paired with methods for efficient computer-assisted analysis. In the second case study, confidence interval is evaluated. Here, the statistical parameter CI is used to indicate the true range of the mean of the crude birth rate and crude mortality rate computed from the observed data.",

This chapter deals with the comparative analysis of CMOS and CNTFET-based ternary inverter and universal gates design. The simulation result is analyzed and validated with a Hailey simulation program with integrated circuit (HSPICE) simulations. The average delay and power consumption in CNTFET-based ternary inverter have been reduced by approximately 90.3% and 48.8% respectively, as compared to CMOS-based ternary inverter design. Likewise, delay is reduced by 50% and power gets 99% reduction in ternary CNTFET NAND gate as compared to CMOS-based ternary NAND gat.

    "abstract": "In recent years, carbon nanotube (CNT) interconnects have emerged as a potential alternative to copper interconnects due to their several magnificent properties. Due to fabrication issues, realization of densely packed CNTs with uniform diameters in a bundle structure is difficult to achieve. Consequently, it is advantageous to obtain a combination of CNTs with non-uniform diameters in the bundle, thereby leading to a densely packed mixed-wall CNT bundle (MWCB). In a MWCB structure, tube density plays a major role to determine the parasitic elements associated with the interconnects. For this, prospectively, colliding bodies optimization (CBO) technique has been incorporated. It is inferred from the study that the overall crosstalk noise, delay, and power dissipation of MWCB interconnect with higher tube density (i.e., obtained using CBO technique) are lesser than other CNT structures. Henceforth, it is determined from the proposed work that prospective CBO technique for advanced MWCB structure is highly efficient and effective for on-chip interconnects in IC designs.",

This RDG is made up of a wind generator associated with a Super-Capacitors (SC) considered as a storage system. The study investigates a control scheme for RDG integrated into power electrical system to maintain the voltage and the frequency of the grid in an allowable range and to ensure the continuity of power supply in case of grid faults. The proposed control strategy has three parts: a vector control of the wind generator to extract the maximum power; the control of the DC bus voltage by inserting the SC; and a droop control loop proposed to ensure the grid stability. The simulation results demonstrate the reliability of the control system.",

Therefore, carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNTFET) can be considered most suitable alternative for SRAM. In this chapter, the performance and stability of CNTFET-based SRAM cells have been analyzed. Numerous figures of merit (FOM) (e.g., read/write noise margin, power dissipation, and read/write delay) have been considered to analyze the performance of CNTFET-based. The static power consumption in CNTFET-based SRAM cell was compared with conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-based SRAM cell. Conventional CNTFET and tunnel CNTFET-based SRAMs have also been considered for comparison. From the simulation results, it is observed that tunnel CNTFET SRAM cells have shown improved FOM over conventional CNTFET 6T SRAM cells without losing stability.",

In the new paradigm, information rather than the host takes the central place in serving the users. Hence, the users will search for information and download it from the nearest device holding it. In order to serve the customers better while optimizing the use of network resources, in-network caching is enabled in ICN. In ICN, the intermediate routers will serve as cache repositories in addition to acting as data forwarding devices. There are several ICN architectures proposed in the literature, each having its own merits and demerits.

In this chapter, the authors present an overview of existing performance test products/tools, provide a summary of some of the contemporary system performance testing frameworks, and capture the key requirements for a general-purpose performance testing framework. Based on previous works, the authors propose a system performance testing framework that is suitable for both simple and small as well as complicated and large-scale performance testing projects. The core of the framework contains an abstraction to facilitate performance testing by separating the application logic from the common performance testing functionality and a general-purpose data model.",

An important task in computer vision and image understanding is to analyze the scene through image operation on the image of scene in order to guide the action. To do this, one needs to locate the objects in the scene, and to determine how they change its position, attitude, speed, and relationships in the space over time. In short, it is to grasp the action in time and space, to determine the purpose of the operation, and thus to understand the semantics of the information they passed.

These improvements are very efficient and important in context of big data tine series data streams processing. Finally, an empirical evaluation was performed on two types of time series data.",

The behavior modules with respective pre-conditions and post-conditions can be dynamically connected in response to status events from action control modules at the lower level to achieve the specified overall task.

    "abstract": "Focusing on healthcare, in the last few decades advanced technologies have become crucial keys in supporting subjective wellbeing. Among them, virtual reality has been proven to be effective for mental health promotion in several research studies. Although the dramatic development in the field of virtual reality system, there are still important problems related to the use of this technology. Within this perspective, the growing availability, low-cost and easy-to-use mobile virtual reality (i.e., the integration of virtual reality system on mobile devices such as smartphone and tablet) represents a meaningful opportunity to support mental health interventions. The chapter will first briefly describe mobile virtual reality. Then, a mobile virtual reality design practice will be presented. Finally, the current application of mobile virtual reality to enhance subjective wellbeing will be discussed with the support of concrete examples and research study analysis.",

The findings improve understanding around cloud solutions in the higher education context by unpacking—through a qualitative thematic analysis approach—relevant themes that inform the extant information systems literature.

Faced with this challenge, key stakeholders are increasingly realizing the need to focus on service quality as a measure to improve their competitive position in today's highly competitive environment. Considering the amount of study done with cloud computing in education, very little has been done in examining the needs and the satisfactions of the instructor customer.

In that sense, the compensation can be considered as a one in the wideband, or in the narrowband.

However, some statements in CQL can be considered too complex for end users as it is shown later on. Because of that, the main idea of this chapter is to explore two other languages for graph databases. One of them is new and it is used to pose queries visually.

This chapter introduces the two most prominent AI approaches used in developing board game agents—the MinMax algorithm and machine learning—and explains their usage in playing games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Othello, Chess, Go, etc. against human opponents. The game tree is essentially a directed graph, where the nodes represent the positions in the game and the edges the moves. Even a simple board game like Tic-Tac Toe (naughts and crosses) has as many as 255,168 leaf nodes in the game tree. Traversing the complete game tree becomes an NP-hard problem. Alpha-beta pruning is used to estimate the short-cuts through the game tree. The board game strategy depends on the evaluation function, which is a heuristic indicating how good the player's current move is in winning the game. Machine learning algorithms try to evolve or learn the agent's game playing strategy based on the evaluation function.",

The former refers to a technological model or system that commercializes value solely created by cloud-based systems in public and private sectors whereas the latter refers to various ways that cloud-based systems are integrated into existing business models to enhance, improve, or enable creation and commercialization of new value.

    "abstract": "Mobile robots have extended to many different environments, where they have to move autonomously to fulfill an assigned task. With this aim, it is necessary that the robot builds a model of the environment and estimates its position using this model. These two problems are often faced simultaneously. This process is known as SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) and is very common since when a robot begins moving in a previously unknown environment it must start generating a model from the scratch while it estimates its position simultaneously. This chapter is focused on the use of computer vision to solve this problem. The main objective is to develop and test an algorithm to solve the SLAM problem using two sources of information: (1) the global appearance of omnidirectional images captured by a camera mounted on the mobile robot and (2) the robot internal odometry. A hybrid metric-topological approach is proposed to solve the SLAM problem.",

Originally, it was the bulky helper of the anesthetist in the operating theatre, but gradually it has become a routine check for hospital admittance and is rapidly shaped as a simple consumer item, similar to a smart thermometer. The success is inspiring for more. A variety of sensor types are being experimented with to capture the vital data for health in general, and fitness in particular. Accessories are placed in, on, and around the body, and together with the smartphone, they are rapidly becoming part of a “fashion statement.” Some sensors are integrated into a single product; some are wirelessly connected to one or more wearables to provide extensive services.",

At its heart lies the qubit, the elemental building block of quantum information, which resides in a state of superposition, representing both 0 and 1 concurrently. Quantum computers, constructed from assemblies of qubits, inhabit an expansive and intricate 2^n-dimensional complex Hilbert space, with their evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation. The process of quantum computation can be distilled into three key stages:1) Initialization of the input state: Initiating the quantum process; 2)Application of unitary transformations: Executing the desired transformations on the input state; 3) Measurement of the output state. Quantum computers serve as universal machines, capable of decomposing any unitary transformation into a sequence of fundamental gates.

For simplification of classification, one may use scikit-learn tool kit. This chapter mainly focuses on the classification of Iris dataset using scikit-learn. It concerns the recognition of Iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, and verginica) on the basis of the measurements of length and width of sepal and petal of the flower. One can generate classification models by using various machine learning algorithms through training the iris flower dataset, and can choose the model with highest accuracy to predict the species of iris flower more precisely. Classification of Iris dataset would be detecting patterns from examining sepal and petal size of the Iris flower and how the prediction was made from analyzing the pattern to form the class of Iris flower. By using this pattern and classification, in future upcoming years the unseen data can be predicted more precisely. The goal here is to gain insights to model the probabilities of class membership, conditioned on the flower features. The proposed chapter mainly focuses on how one can train their model with data using machine learning algorithms to predict the species of Iris flower by input of the unseen data using what it has learnt from the trained data.",

    "abstract": "In typical Indian organisational settings, users usually rely on the traditional electrical grid and costly, environmentally harmful diesel generators to supply electricity for regular, emergency backup, and transient services. In addition to offering a chance to supply electricity to relocated people, integrating solar capacity into the current grid can result in considerable cost and carbon reductions. Utilising computational energy system modelling and the analysis of monitored demand data, we assess the savings made possible by the integration of solar (160 kW) capacity into the current supply grid of Assam Power Distribution Co. Ltd. (APDCL, India) at the Azara campus of Assam Don Bosco University, India. The authors discover that, over a five-year period, the renewable infrastructure significantly lowers costs and CO2 emissions. In order to cut costs and emissions and pave the way for sustainable energy practices, organisations should look into ways to integrate renewable energy sources into their current electrical infrastructure and maximise their performance once installed.",

    "abstract": "Renewable energy sources plays a vital role in power generation. Renewable solar energy resources abound on a global scale. When employing solar energy as a resource, the output of photovoltaic (PV) modules is determined by radiation and the temperature of the sun. The first PV systems were developed in the mid-nineteenth century. The underlying issue in the solar industry is that PV systems capture just a percentage of the sun's beams. The technique works best when the Solar Panel (SP) is perpendicular to the sun's rays. Solar tracking systems (STS) are used to keep a PV panel orthogonal to the radiation at all times, allowing for optimal energy output from the sun. With the help of advanced technology in tracking systems, numerous tracking techniques are available. The goal of this research is to explore the most recent improvements in solar tracking technology to estimate the best orientation for PV panels. The angular displacement of an STS with a single or dual-axis is possible. This chapter starts with mathematical modeling of the SP and ends with evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of STS. The pipeline between the start and end points covers the identification of sun position, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based controller. This survey can help the researchers to create an effective STS.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a major global health issue, accounting for a significant number of cancer cases and highlighting the importance of modern diagnostic methods for precise detection. A large set of histopathology photos was carefully gathered and thoroughly examined using strict quality control techniques for this study project. Reliable tumor classification relies on robust datasets from various sources, highlighting the need for careful dataset organization, accurate labeling, and removing poor-quality images to enhance model performance. Advanced image processing techniques can be strategically used to improve the reliability of convolutional neural network (CNN) data, especially through patch-based approaches and the application of Otsu's threshold methods. Incorporating fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and max-pooling into a cutting-edge CNN design significantly improves the ability to identify complex histology patterns accurately. The precise training and optimization methods used resulted in high accuracies of 99.69% and 99.32%, respectively. The Adam optimizer and eight-batch optimization technique are key to achieving these results. This new approach shows great promise as a useful tool for categorizing colorectal cancer in real-world situations, mainly due to its significant enhancements in accuracy and dependability.",

The risk that a plant will sustain additional damage may be reduced by early and precise detection of plant diseases.

Stress is a condition of mental pressure for particular individuals facing problems from environmental and social well-being, which leads to so many diseases. Stress causes damage that is often underestimated, and it is a social phenomenon that should be closely examined and evaluated. Nowadays, stress leads to suicide attempts, depression, mental conditions, etc. Using IoT sensors like GSR MAX30105 and IoT components such as Node MCU, Arduino UNO, and LCD can detect stress. Stress can also be measured through parameters like Spo2, HR/PR, and temp levels. The internet of things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) alarm the situation when the person is at real risk. ML is used to predict the condition of the patient by using techniques like SVM (support vector machines), CNN (convolutional neural networks), k-nearest neighbours, and logistic regression, etc. The user will get feedback through the GSM module and the internet based on the above information. According to the latest findings in the literature, an IoT-based system is designed to monitor the well-being of people during their daily activities. By capturing human facial expressions through the camera, emotion is detected. Finally, by combining stress and emotion detection through an efficient ML algorithm, the stress levels as low, medium, or high stress are predicted.",

    "abstract": "In many modern situations, wireless sensor networks play a crucial role, used for monitoring things like environmental conditions, transactions, and various statuses. These networks gather a large amount of data, sending it to a central hub for analysis. However, a significant problem is that traditional wireless sensor networks heavily rely on energy, and this limits how long they can operate. This chapter develops an optimization approach for a variable clustering routing protocol to address the issue. The objective is to enhance the cluster structure in wireless sensor networks while reducing energy loss in cluster heads. The first step involves employing a dynamic estimation method for clustering to determine cluster heads, utilizing core concentration to establish the head within the cluster radius. The authors also introduce a fuzzy logic algorithm to handle uncertainties in selecting cluster heads. The residual energy of the cluster's head nodes, maintaining a balanced distribution of cluster heads, and optimizing node use of energy are all taken into account by this fuzzy logic approach. An ant colony algorithm-based technique for optimizing inter-cluster transport is presented in this outline. The primary objective is to optimize energy consumption while simultaneously reducing the data communication overhead among cluster heads. Chaotic mapping is utilized by this technique to update and perturb pheromones, ensuring optimal performance. Energy utilization among cluster heads is optimized by selecting the optimal path based on considerations of energy dispersion parameters and distance coefficients. Our experiments show that compared to traditional algorithms, Researchers provide a non-uniform clustering approach for route optimization that dramatically extends the network lifespan by 75% and lowers overall energy consumption by about 20%. This effectively optimizes network energy utilization and significantly extends the network lifetime, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and early diagnosis of kidney cancer is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes, yet current methods often face challenges in precision and reliability. This research addresses these challenges by integrating Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with advanced deep learning models—DenseNet, ResNet 50, and VGG 19—and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the prediction and classification of kidney cancer from CT scans and medical records. The approach leverages ACO to optimise feature selection, improving the performance of these deep learning models. DenseNet, combined with ACO and LSTM, achieved the highest accuracy of 97.9%, demonstrating exceptional capability in accurately detecting and classifying kidney cancer. Res-Net 50, also optimised by ACO, followed with a notable accuracy of 96.2%, showing its robustness. VGG 19, despite substantial improvement over training epochs, attained a lower accuracy of 92.3%, indicating that further optimisation could be beneficial.",

In spite of the recent developments in DNA-based analyses for phylogeny and systematics, visual leaf recognition is still commonly applied for species identification in botany. Histograms, along with the well-known nearest neighbor rule, are often a simple but effective option for the representation and classification of leaf images. Such an option relies on the choice of a proper dissimilarity measure to compare histograms. Two state-of-the-art measures—called weighted distribution matching (WDM) and Poisson-binomial radius (PBR)—are compared here in terms of classification performance, computational cost, and non-metric/non-Euclidean behavior. They are also compared against other classical dissimilarity measures between histograms. Even though PBR gives the best performance at the highest cost, it is not significantly better than other classical measures. Non-Euclidean/non-metric nature seems to play an important role.",

Despite the possible benefits of health services assisted by IoT, there are barriers such as the storage of data in the cloud for analysis by physicians, the security and privacy of the data that are communicated, the cost of communication of the data that is collected, and the manipulation and maintenance of the sensors. This chapter intends to deploy and develop the context of the IoT platforms in the field of health and medicine by means of the transformation of edge and fog computing, as intermediate layers that provide interfaces between heterogeneous networks, networks inherited infrastructure, and servers in the cloud for the ease of data analysis and connectivity in order to implement a structural health monitoring based on IoT for application of early warning score.",

Application programmers rarely design and create software elements for possible future reuse. In many agile software development processes, the project teams believe that the development of reusable software elements can slow down the project. This can be a misconception. This chapter examines various ways to reuse software. Three approaches to developing reusable software artifacts from 15 years of experience in the agile development process are presented. The first approach is to create generic programs or configurable frameworks that support similar solutions for a variety of use cases and environments. The reuse of patterns is the second approach presented. Another effective way is to use a model-driven approach with model patterns. These approaches help to speed deployment software. The final product is flexible and can easily be adapted to changes. This is one of the main goals of an agile approach.",

The fractional governing equations are subjected to physical initial and boundary conditions. The joint Laplace and Hankel transform is employed to develop exact analytical solutions. The obtained solutions are computed numerically and plotted in different graphs. It is noticed that for a long time the blood and MDP velocities increase with increasing values of the fractional parameter. In contrast, this effect reverses for a shorter time. In the case of the magnetic parameter, both velocities are decreased with increasing values of the magnetic parameter.",

The process is modeled and linearized around the operating points, resulting in third order plant, which is approximated to lower order integer and non-integer model. Both conventional integer order PI (IO-PI) &amp; PID (IO-PID) and fractional order PI (FO-PI) &amp; (FO-PID) controllers are implemented for this inferential control. Extensive simulation studies performed using MATLAB validate the supremacy of non-integer order model and controller over integer order model and controller. Genetic algorithm (GA) is being applied for both, firstly for reduced order model approximation and secondly for controller tuning.",

The model under investigation has three steady states, and the positive steady state exists under certain condition. Dynamic nature of the model is discussed through local stability analysis. Enquiry into the qualitative behavior of the model reveals rich and complex dynamics exhibited by the discrete-time model. Moreover, this model undergoes Neimark Sacker bifurcation when the chosen parameter passes through a critical value. The analytical results are strengthened with appropriate numerical examples. The computation of maximal Lyapunov exponents confirms the existence of chaos. Chaos control is achieved by linear feedback control and hybrid control methods.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, power quality (PQ) has become an increasingly major concern for both electric utilities and the end users. Accordingly, the electrical engineering community has to deal with the analysis, diagnosis, and solution of PQ issues using system approach rather than handling these issues as individual problems. This chapter describes the analysis of PQ using advanced signal processing tools represented in Hilbert and wavelet transforms (HT-WT) and artificial intelligence tools represented in artificial neural network and support vector machine (ANN-SVM) for detection and classification of power quality disturbances, respectively. These techniques were successfully simulated using LABVIEW software capabilities. The results of simulation indicate that the signal processing techniques are effective mechanisms to detect and classify power quality disturbances. At the end, the combination of WT as a tool of detection and features extraction with SVM as a classifier tool resulted as the best combination for PQ monitoring system.",

Although a lot of focus has been put on homogenous Si based NWFETs, there has been a rising interest in III-V NWFETs. This is mainly due to the excellent carrier transport properties are provided by these materials. NWFETs have ability to suppress SCEs and are also good in suppressing OFF-current (IOFF), because of gate all around (GAA) configuration. Secondly, NWFETs have large ON-current (ION) due to quasi one-dimensional (1D) conduction of NWs, and as a result of low carrier scattering, conduction of NWs-based devices is very large.",

The live streaming has to reach the end users mobile devices after traveling through the base station nodes, core network, routers, switches, and other equipment. Further, this will lead to a scenario of content latency and thereby causing the rejection of the mobile devices users' request due to congestion of the network and mobile service providers' core network witnessing an extreme load.

The main focus of the chapter is to introduce a neutrosophic fuzzy soft set (NFSS) to deal with uncertainty parametrically, and it gives the approximate solution to the problem. NFSS is a mixture of a neutrosophic set, fuzzy sets, and soft sets. So, it can be treated as a hybrid structure that gives more flexibility to solve multi-criteria decision-making problems under a fuzzy environment. NFSS evolved as an extension of fuzzy set, soft set, neutrosophic set, etc. Then the authors propose an algorithmic approach for group decision-making (GDM) problems using a neutrosophic fuzzy soft matrix (NFSM) and its related properties.

IFSs are suitable to consider stakeholders hesitation for criteria importance and requirements ratings. The proposed process is supported by a recommender system which provides suggestions to stakeholders and also guide them to collaboratively reach consensus for the final RP.

Power management is a crucial parameter for designing VLSI circuits since it is essential for estimating the performance of devices, especially those utilized in biomedical and IoT applications. To achieve greater performance, designing a low-power system on a IC is becoming increasingly challenging due to the reduction in size of chip, increases in chip density, and rise in device complexity. Furthermore, for the less than 90 nm node, due to its increasingly complicated design, the total power factor on a chip is turning into a significant difficulty. Leakage current also has a significant effect on how low-power VLSI devices manage their power. Leakage and dynamic power reduction are increasingly being prioritized in VLSI circuit design in order to improve the battery life of electronic portable devices. The many methodologies, tactics, and power management schemes that can be employed for the design of low-power circuit systems are discussed in this chapter.",

To attain the best result, a mutation-based glow worm swarm optimization (MGWSO) technique is proposed. With this method, the makespan is reduced for a single work set across multiple datacentres. The work is motivated to decrease the consumption of resources in dynamic contexts while simultaneously increasing their availability.

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive failure rate examination for implantable antennas, employing a liability tree-based analysis focused on a clamped double subsystem (CDSM) equipped with DC short voltage protective functionality. The enhanced protective feature of the CDSM aims to improve the security and safety of implantable antennas used in critical applications. However, this subsystem's design necessitates the use of additional IGBTs, diodes, and capacitors compared to standard configurations, consequently increasing the complexity and potential failure rate. Given that demanding converter operation in implantable antennas can escalate the failure rate, conducting a precise reliability analysis becomes vital for the deployment of CDSM in these devices. A failure durability analysis is undertaken to address the operational characteristics of CDSM in implantable antennas. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is utilized to evaluate the risk with greater precision than previous methods, which mainly considered component types, quantities, and network connectivity states.",

S-box strengthens the encryption and decryption process by introducing nonlinearity and protecting the encrypted data against various differential and linear cryptanalytic attacks. The problem of generating an S-box with optimal properties is challenging and falls under the category of NP-Hard problems. This study proposes a hybrid approach combining the Particle Swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and the Booster algorithm to construct a highly nonlinear S-box with low computational efforts. The PSO algorithm, assisted by the Transfer function and Random Key (RK), is utilized to navigate the large permutation search space to find an S-box with acceptable cryptographic properties. The Booster algorithm works based on random applications of local operators for shuffling the elements of the S-box with each other and transforming the elements' arrangement, resulting in a modified S-box with increased nonlinearity.",

The purpose of this updated study is to identify which issues are associated with system development success as measured by computing satisfaction. The results indicate that although some of the issues identified by Ginzberg continue to be relevant to implementation success, their character has changed somewhat. Based on the responses from six companies, end-user computing satisfaction can be explained by the extent of project definition and planning, organizational commitment, breadth of analysis, user responsibility, and commitment to change.

The perception that an organisation is at a competitive disadvantage without computer systems has significantly increased users’ expectations for information systems. These expectations have been further increased by the sensational media promotions of new computer products and services in the marketplace. Some vendors, acting in their own self-interest, may make inflated claims about their products putting more gap between users’ expectations for information systems and the actual services delivered by the systems. The information technology industry has come under growing pressure to produce high-quality systems quickly and inexpensively to satisfy to growing user expectations (Lederer and Mendelow, 1990).

Neural network modeling (ANN), which is particularly useful in modeling processes about which adequate knowledge of the physics is limited, is presented here as a tool complimentary to predict the complex non-linear relationship between the friction factor of an alluvial channel and its influencing factors. Friction factor comprises of different hydraulic and geometric parameters. Hence it is important to know the influences of these parameters on friction factor. Based on the input significant techniques through ANN model, it has been found that flow velocity influences more friction factor. The least influencing parameter is channel width. This shows the importance of determining the flow velocity more correctly.",

The layout-induced parasitic effects and process variations are also considered simultaneously to guarantee the circuit performance after manufacturing. As shown in the experimental results, the proposed approach successfully solves the unreachable specification in previous work and keeps the performance and yield of the generated circuit even in post-layout simulations.

    "abstract": "Intelligent techniques are quickly gaining importance in the field of geophysics, mining and geology. In this chapter the significance of intelligent techniques like ANN and ANFIS for prediction of longitudinal wave velocity and its advantages over other conventional methods of computing have been discussed. Longitudinal wave measurement is an indicator of peak particle velocity during blasting in a mine and it is a significant factor to be predicted to minimize the damage caused by ground vibrations. Wave velocity measurements have wide applications in the different fields of geophysics, mining and geology. In this chapter, ANN and ANFIS models are designed to predict the longitudinal wave velocity of different rocks and correlation have been developed with fracture properties. The fracture roughness coefficient and physico-mechanical properties are taken as input parameters and longitudinal wave velocity as output parameters. The mean absolute percentage error for the Longitudinal wave velocity predicted by Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System has been found to be the least.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, a fuzzy expert system is developed to assist the operators in fault detection. It requires much less memory to store the database (power system topology and the post fault status of circuit breakers and protective relays). The fuzzy expert system identifies two basic network section sets, Shealthy for the healthy sub network and Sisland for the fault islands, using the post fault status of circuit breakers and relays. It then calculates membership function for each possible fault section. The objective of this calculation is to determine the likelihood of each candidate fault section as the actual fault section. Moreover membership functions provide a convenient means of ranking among possible (or candidate) fault sections, and are the most important factors in decision making. During decision making, the most possible fault section is determined by maximum selection method. In this method most possible fault section is the one which is having highest membership grade. MATLAB code for the proposed scheme is developed and the results obtained in four cases for a power- system network.",

TSC-OPF is a non-linear optimization problem which is not easy to deal directly because of its huge dimension. This paper presents a novel and efficient optimisation approach named the teaching learning based optimisation (TLBO) for solving the TSCOPF problem. The quality and usefulness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through its application to four standard test systems namely, IEEE 30-bus system, IEEE 118-bus system, WSCC 3-generator 9-bus system and New England 10-generator 39-bus system. To demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed method, the results obtained from the proposed algorithm are compared with those obtained from other algorithms available in the literature. The experimental results show that the proposed TLBO approach is comparatively capable of obtaining higher quality solution and faster computational time.",

The real data acquired corresponds to time, environmental and electrical data of 30 buildings belonging to the University of León (Spain). Firstly, we segmented buildings in terms of their energy consumption using principal component analysis. Afterwards, we applied state of the art machine learning methods and compare between them. Finally, we predicted daily electric power consumption profiles and compare them with actual data for different buildings. Our analysis shows that multilayer perceptrons have the lowest error followed by support vector regression and clustered extreme learning machines.

Seismologists and geologists who study this hazard at a deeper level are concerned more with the history and cause of earthquake events rather than their effects. When seismic energy is released during an earthquake it passes from the bedrock, then through the soil and to the sub structure through which it is transmitted to the superstructure. Liquefaction phenomenon is a consequence of earthquake induced pore water pressure in the soil due to this released energy. Various deterministic and probabilistic based methods have been developed in the recent past after various case histories. It is crucial to understand the performance of critical structures such as pipelines, road networks, nuclear reactors etc during liquefaction. The current chapter majorly focuses on the liquefaction assessment using numerical modeling.",

However, most existing methods have not taken into account of the four imperfections within the system, i.e. the existence of severe power harmonics due to the PWM inverter drive, the imbalancing of the 3-phase supply from the inverter, the variation of supply frequency under load changing and acceleration/deceleration, and changes in resistance. In this example, we have developed a new method of parameter estimation based on real time data sampling of voltages and currents, no matter they are sinusoidal or not. Here, the assumption of a synchronous rotating speed of the stator flux is not critical. With the aid of hybrid genetic algorithm techniques, the model has been found useful for on-line speed/torque control in most field orientation control schemes as it is much easier to achieve a global minimum during the optimization process.",

The developing countries faced the problem of high demand growth along with irrational tariff policies and lack of efficiency in managing the power system. On the contrary, the developed countries restructured the power sector to provide electricity at lower prices and give the customers a number of operators to choose from. In short, the goal of restructuring is to encourage competition in the market along with providing consumers with more choices in purchasing economic energy and economic benefits. This might seem to be less complex but involves several issues which are discussed further. This chapter describes this restructuring of power sector with special reference to Indian scenario.",

For the optimization of the LC-VCO characteristics, special attention must be paid to the integrated inductor design, since its quality factor may have a strong influence in the LC-VCO phase-noise. Furthermore, designers must ensure that the higher limit of VCO operating frequency is sufficiently below the inductor resonant frequency.

Then, optimization of integrated inductors by exploring the inductor geometric layout is presented.

Results show that density, energy, and viscosity of the oxidized asphalt are higher than the unoxidized asphalt, indicating hardening and rheological property changes of asphalt after oxidation. Both the unoxidized and oxidized asphalts deform more and fail faster with an increase in stress rates, especially under tensile stress. The oxidized asphalt is stronger than the unoxidized asphalt under mechanical stress. Moisture inclusion affects viscosity more by decreasing the viscosity of the oxidized asphalt faster compared to the unoxidized asphalt. The viscosity of the oxidized asphalt is lower than that of the unoxidized asphalt above 5% moisture inclusion.

However, the SEIG demands an external supply of reactive power to maintain the constant terminal voltage under the varying loading conditions, which limits the application of SEIG as a standalone power generator. The regulation of speed and voltage does not result in a satisfactory improvement although several studies have been emphasized on this topic in the past. To improve the performance of the SEIG system in isolated areas and to regulate the terminal voltage STATic COMpensator (STATCOM) has been modelled and developed in this dissertation. The STATCOM consists of AC inductors, a DC bus capacitor and solid-state self-commutating devices. The ratings of these components are quite important for designing and controlling of STATCOM to maintain the constant terminal voltage. The proposed generating system is modelled and simulated in MATLAB along with Simulink and sim power system block set toolboxes. The simulated results are presented to demonstrate the capability of an isolated power generating system for feeding three-phase resistive loads.",

After determining the accuracy of the models, particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to minimize the error of the numerical model.Then, optimization results are shown. Overally, the accuracy of more than 98% represents an overall error of less than 2\\% which is quite acceptable for the optimized numerical model.",

Some of the important advantages of CNTs over silicon components are high mechanical strength, high sensing capability and large surface-to-volume ratio. Many researches have been presented using CNT as a sensing material in various applications to improve the sensor characteristics. In this chapter, the platform of CNT sensors such as transistor-based sensors, chemiresistors, chemicapacitance and resonator sensors are discussed in detail. Using CNT as a sensor platform although has great advantages; it does not have sufficient sensor reliability.

Condition monitoring is the process of monitoring a parameter of condition in machinery (vibration, temperature etc.), in order to identify a significant change which is indicative of a developing fault. The use of conditional monitoring allows maintenance to be scheduled, or other actions to be taken to prevent failure and avoid its consequences. In this chapter, commonly used methods for condition monitoring the converters and electric machines are presented. The aim of this task is producing an alarm in converter before failure factor damage the system. Sensor based and sensor less methods for converter and motor parameter monitoring are described. The data obtained from sensor based methods is real but sensor is a weakness point in a converter. On the other hand, sensorless methods give estimated information but they are reliable. Temperature as the most important parameter from reliability point of view is a common parameter for monitoring in all systems. Other parameters like vibration, harmonics can be used for monitoring of various faults inside the system. Many typical cases are presented to demonstrate the techniques.",

    "abstract": "In the previous chapter, we assumed that there is no fault in the converter. To achieve a converter without failure, we presented the methods for stress reduction. However, a fault may occur in a system even operating with low stress. In the current chapter, we take one further step and assume that a fault occurs in the converter but there is a short time interval between fault occurrence and catastrophic damage to the converter. Therefore, the topic of this chapter is the methods for saving the converter in this condition. In this chapter, protection methods for saving the system against damaging faults are presented. Based on background of chapter two, protection systems should be able to bypass the effect of failure factors on electric power converter. Methods for current limiting and voltage clamping as the usual factors of failure in converters are described. Circuit diagram of a snubber is presented and its operation is described based on safe operating area of solid state power switches. Operating diagrams of fuses as emergency circuit breakers are presented. Measurement methods and devices used in protection systems are explained. Experimental samples and standard diagrams are presented to clarify the theoretical notes in all cases.",

    "abstract": "In previous chapters, we discussed the converter with or without fault. The common similarity between them is that they continue to operate without reduction of their nominal specification. In this chapter, uninterrupted operation of a faulty power conversion system with catastrophic damages in some of its parts is investigated. It is shown that a faulty electric power converter can continue to work with degraded specifications. This algorithm is named derating for accessibility. This technique can be used for both a faulty system because of its uninterrupted operation and a normal system because of extensive life time. Algorithms for derating of a faulty electric machine and a power supply are described. Derating for increasing the useful life of a motor drive system is presented. A novel method for switching frequency selection in a switching power supply is proposed based on derating concept. Derating is introduced as a technique to compensate additional losses in an electric power converter operating in harsh environment (for example: a motor drive which is supplied with a non sinusoidal voltage waveform). Industrial examples are presented in details for better understanding of the derating concept. Some of the presented examples contain novel idea for derating and others are well known in industry.",

    "abstract": "In chapter 10, It is shown that the types of the bonding are one of the important factors which affect the sheath losses in single-core cables, and it is concluded that both single-point bonding and cross bonding, which are known as special bonding, introduce the lowest losses in the metallic sheath of the cable. To take the advantages of the specially bonded cable systems it is necessary to insulate the cable sheath from earth to avoid corrosion. This is achieved by having an extruded serving of PVC or PE on the cables and housing the joints in compound filled fiberglass boxes to insulate them from the surrounding soil. The use of special bonding gives rise to sheath over-voltages at sheath sectionalizing insulators in cross bonded cable system and insulators in a single-point bonded cable system due to lightning, switching surges or faults. One of the factors affecting the sheath losses in single-core underground power cables in case of special bonding types is the sheath overvoltage. Those over-voltages may cause the sheath multi-points break-down which result in a large sheath currents and losses and hence may cause overheating of the cables and finally leading to operation faults. As mentioned before, faults are one of reasons which cause sheath over-voltages. System faults may be divided into internal faults occurring within the cables themselves and external faults for which the cables carry some or the entire fault current. The sheath voltages resulting from internal faults may greatly exceed those caused by external faults. A fault in the cables themselves inevitably involves repair work and hence it is not so important if the sheath insulation adjacent to the fault is also damaged. The sheath bonding design should preclude the damage cascading to other parts of the cable system i.e. the cable installation must clearly be capable of safely withstanding the effects of any fault in the system external to the cables . So it is important to consider the performance of special sheath bonding methods in relation to power frequency external fault currents.",

In addition, some of other failure factors such as dielectric breakdown act as over temperature in damaging process of a converter. In the previous chapter, it is emphasized that temperature factor is a key index in reliability calculation. Unlike fully electrical variables, thermal calculations require details of geometry of the system and its environment. In this chapter, thermal analysis as the most important factor in failure of converters is presented. Two main approaches for this goal are presented: numerical and lumped mode. Principles of these methods are described with various examples and a comparison is presented. Basic principles of thermal modeling are described and concept of sample node is explained. Methods for thermal management of an electric power converter are described. These methods are at both component and system levels and contain various heat transfer mechanisms like conduction and convection. Theoretical methods and practical considerations for heat sink selection and proper mounting are presented. Thermal insulation classes and various standards related to thermal management are expressed. Industrial samples are presented to show application of theoretical topics in real world.",

This chapter briefly describes the fundamental concepts of insulation testing including – insulation behavior, types of tests, and some test procedures. Most electrical equipment in utility, industrial, and commercial power systems uses either 50 or 60 Hz alternating current. Because of this, the use of an alternating current source to test insulation would appear to be the logical choice. However, as will be described a little later, insulation systems are extremely capacitive. For this and other reasons, DC has found a large niche in the technology. Before we can really evaluate the value of one system as opposed to the other (e.g. AC vs DC), let us examine how each type of voltage affects insulation.

Since that time numerous papers and books appeared, dealing with the physics and recognition of partial discharges. First industrial PD tests of HV apparatus were introduced at the beginning of 1940. The method applied was based on NEMA 107, which specifies the measurement of ratio influence voltages (RIV) expressed in terms of µV. One disadvantage of this method is, however, that the RIV level is weighted according to the acoustical noise impression of the human ear, which is not correlated to the PD activity. Therefore, the IEC Technical Committee No.42 decided the issue of a separate standard on electrical PD measurement associated with the PD quantity apparent charge, which is expressed in terms of pC.",

    "abstract": "On-site PD measurements on high voltage cables have to concentrate on the cable accessories because there is a remaining risk for assembling faults on site. PD sensors with an appropriate coupling behavior to accessory-internal PD give sensitivities of a few pC or even better. Unfortunately, two main reasons prevent the general use of PD sensors in cable accessories. First of all, the costs for PD sensors have to be balanced with the costs of the accessories, importance of the cable link, consequential costs for outage etc. This is the reason why PD sensors were mainly used EHV cable systems. The second reason is limited accessibility: the PD sensor cable at the accessory has to be connected to a PD detection unit. Accessibility is much more difficult for direct buried cable systems than for cable terminations and tunnel-laid cable systems: the senor cable must pass the ground and the end up in a box on the surface to provide access. This solution causes additional costs and new problems like sealing the sensor cable against humidity, capability to withstand sheath testing etc. By looking for alternative access to PD signals from cable joints of long cable systems, a very simple solution proved suitable: detecting PD at cross-bonding links. To investigate the high frequency propagation of PD pulses in cross-bonding links, computer simulations and laboratory measurements were done.",

In this standard the soil thermal resistivity of the surrounding soil is supposed to be varies from 0.5 oC m/w to 1.2 oC m/w but under loading the heat dissipated from underground power cables increases the soil thermal resistivity and this may leads to cable thermal failure and thermal instability of the soil around the underground cables. For this reason de-rating factors for cable loading taking the dry zone formation into consideration has to be considered during distribution cable network design. Several approaches have been adopted to establish current ratings of buried cables based on constant values of soil thermal conductivities. Mathematical models are suggested by many researches to study the drying out phenomenon around underground power cables. In this chapter de-rating factor for underground power cables taking dry zone formation into account is calculated depending on IEC 60287-1-3 (1982).

However, that doesn't mean the converter performance is necessarily adequate for a practical application. At the end of design process of a converter, some desired specifications may not be achieved. In this chapter, reliability as a figure of merit in design of a system is presented and compared with other indices. We want to highlight the effect of reliability considerations on the design methodology of a power converter. The most important specification of a power supply or power converter is its robustness. Because any failure in power supply leads to failure of the whole of the system. A power converter may have poor performance but operate reliably and vice versa. In fact, this is a reliability based design approach to achieve a long useful life. It is shown that in many systems, high efficiency is not a good choice for selection of system operating point. A system can be inefficient but very reliable. Two complex examples are presented to show undesired results of neglecting reliability in design process. Methods for more reliable operation of electric power converters than high performance operation are proposed.

These methods are used in both design and operation process of the converter. The focus of this chapter is on the component stress reduction in the design process. Based on background of chapter two, reliability of a converter increases if it operates at a set point with low stress. It is assumed that the converter is under design process or operates without fault. The methods for reliability improvement in faulty converters are discussed in the next chapters. In this chapter, methods for reducing electric field are described at both system and printed circuit board level. Low temperature operating conditions for an electric power converter are described and tools for this goal are presented. Series connection for voltage sharing and parallel connection for current sharing is explained. Novel control methods of power converters for reducing the complexity and reliable operation are presented. Control of inrush current as a typical transient problem in electric power converters is presented. Methods for preventing the over stress condition on the components in faulty cases are described. Techniques for reducing mechanical and environmental stress are expressed. Mechanical dampers for preventing the high amplitude vibration and insulating colors against humidity are presented.

    "abstract": "Protection methods, which were described in the previous chapter, save the converter against non-catastrophic faults. However, this method saves the converter but it also takes the converter out of the service. The subject of this chapter is converters that are not damaged but can not operate normally. In this chapter, availability of electric power converters as a most important but usually forgotten parameter is described. The concept of availability was originally developed for repairable systems that are required to operate continuously. It is explained that a system may be unavailable while none of its parts damaged. In fact, there is an important difference between reliability and availability. A converter may be highly reliable but unavailable and vice versa. One of the most important factors for this undesired state is influence of noise. In this chapter, electromagnetic interference and certain methods for reducing its undesired effects on electric power converters are presented. Electric power converters are usually the source of electromagnetic noise due to high operating voltage and/or current. Various techniques for safe operation of sensitive systems that operate close to these converters are described. In the last part of chapter, alarm management is presented based on availability concept. This method is used to prevent fast shutdown of important systems due to dispensable faults.",

In this chapter, causes of failure in electric power converters is described.

Other types of failure without destructive effect on converter like electromagnetic interference will be presented in the next chapters. All descriptions are based on details of operation of the converters which were presented in the previous chapter. Over temperature, over voltage, mechanical forces and environmental effects like humidity are the main factors of failure in systems. Origins of these factors are described in this chapter. Over temperature is a special factor among them because other failure factors finally act as over temperature in failure process of the converters. Since over temperature is the main failure factor in electric power converters, loss model of components in electric power converters are presented in details. In addition, practical technique for measuring power loss is described. Sample industrial examples of damaged equipments due to these failure factors are shown to give a real sense to reader about failure results.",

If the fault is on secondary cable, knowing the exact route is even more critical. Since it is extremely difficult to find a cable fault without knowing where the cable is, it makes sense to master cable locating and tracing and to do a cable trace before beginning the fault locating process. Success in locating or tracing the route of electrical cable and metal pipe depends upon knowledge, skill, and perhaps, most of all, experience. Although locating can be a complex job, it will very likely become even more complex as more and more underground plant is installed. It is just as important to understand how the equipment works as it is to be thoroughly familiar with the exact equipment being used.",

The installation of the SPV system is advantageous for the electrical load demand. Solar systems have greater efficiency for supplying both types of load (i.e., thermal and electrical) simultaneously. The modeling of two power system components (i.e., generation and distribution) can be performed using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique. The data used for generation modeling is taken from IEEE-RTS (reliability test system) and data for the distribution system is obtained from IEEE-RBTS (reliability busbar test system). The reliability parameters such as average energy not supplied (AENS) and loss of energy expectation (LOEE) are evaluated for the analysis of individual customer reliability and overall system reliability simultaneously.",

The most advantageous factor of this proposed converter is the use of low-voltage semiconductor devices as they don't require large heat sinks. The converter operation in the steady state is fully analyzed. In addition to that, for the purpose of stability analysis, the small signal model for the proposed converter has also been developed. The frequency response using the small-scale transfer function of the converter has also been done by employing MATLAB. A suitable controller with suitable parameters has also been designed to improve the overall stability of the DC-DC converter in consideration.

Hydrogen is considered one of the promising alternative fuels to replace oil, but its storage remains a significant challenge. The main hydrogen storage technologies can be broadly classified as physical, chemical, and hybrid methods. The physical methods rely on compression and liquefaction of hydrogen, and currently, compressed hydrogen storage is the most mature technology that is commercially available. The chemical methods utilize materials to store hydrogen, and hydrogen can be extracted by on-board regenerable or off-board regenerable chemical reactions depending on the type of material. Hybrid methods take advantage of both physical and chemical storage methods. The most prominent hybrid method is the cryo-adsorption hydrogen storage which utilizes physisorption-based porous materials.

The effect of electromagnetic radiation from four base stations located at the residential area was studied by measuring their electric field strength and calculating their magnetic field strength and power density at different distances covering a frequency range of 900MHz to 2100MHz. The obtained values showed that the four cellular base stations are operating above the standard values of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection Electromagnetic Field Radiation. The specific absorption rate was measured to determine the amount of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation absorbed by the human body. The result which is in the range of 3.22-3.70 W/kg is higher than the acceptable 2 W/kg for localized specific absorption rate.",

To reduce the cost of test, previous studies have used test-data compression techniques on system-level to reduce the test-data volume or employed test architecture design for module-based SOCs to enable test schedules with low test execution time. Research on combining the two approaches is lacking. Therefore, this chapter studies how core-level test-data compression can be combined with test architecture design to reduce test cost further. The study is conducted in three steps. The first step analyzes how the TAM width influences three test-data compression techniques, namely Selective Encoding, Vector Repeat and the combination of the two. The second step investigates in what order to consider test architecture and test-data compression in the SOC design process to best reduce test cost. It is observed that test architecture design and test-data compression-technique selection should be performed in an integrated process. The third step presents a novel approach to integrate test-data compression-technique selection in the test architecture design process. Experiments on benchmarks with realistic cores show that the integrated approach achieves up to 32% reduction in test cost (7.8% on average) compared to non-integrated test architecture design and test-data compression technique selection.",

The remaining part of the chapter describes a new approach to fault simulation based on exact critical path tracing to conduct fault analysis in logic circuits. A circuit topology driven computational model is presented which allows not only to cope with complex structures of nested reconvergent fan-outs but also to carry out the fault reasoning for many test patterns concurrently. To achieve the speed-up of backtracing, the circuit is simulated on higher than traditional gate level. As components of the circuit network, fan-out free regions of maximum size are considered, and they are represented by structurally synthesized BDDs. The latter allow to reduce the number of internal variables in the computation model, and therefore to process the whole circuit faster than on the flat gate-level. The method is explained first, for the stuck-at fault model, and then generalized for an extended class of functional fault model covering the conditional stuck-at and transition faults. The method can be used for simulating permanent faults in combinational circuits, and transient or intermittent faults both in combinational and sequential circuits with the goal of selecting malicious faults for injecting into fault tolerant systems to evaluate their dependability. Experimental results are included to give an idea how efficiently the method works with different fault classes.",

Commonly, contingency planning has been achieved through epidemiological studies and the use of relatively simple models. However, computational methods increasingly allow more complex, and potentially more realistic, simulations of various scenarios of the control of the spread of disease. However, understanding computational results from more sophisticated models can pose considerable challenges.

The “down view” examines software development, describing how CSE applications are programmed on HPCC computers. Additionally, a cost analysis and an example illustrate the origin of the benefits.

The current generated by a discharging capacitor is injected to the transformer, and it is interrupted at its zero point by a diode. A transformer model for the TLF condition is constructed from leakage impedance and a stray capacitance with an ideal transformer in an EMTP computation. By using the frequency response analysis (FRA) measurement, the transformer constants are evaluated in high-frequency regions. The FRA measurement graphs show that the inductance value of the test transformer gradually decreases as the frequency increases. Based on this fact, a frequency-dependent transformer model is constructed. The frequency response of the model gives good agreement with the measured values.

The total reliability of a system on a chip is more and more dependent on the reliability of interconnects. The growing volume of communication due to the increasing number of integrated functional units is the main reason. Articles have been published, which predict that static faults due to wear-out effects will occur more often. This will harm the reliability and decrease the mean-time-to-failure. Most of the published techniques are aimed at the correction of transient faults. Built-in self-repair has not been discussed as much as the other techniques. In this chapter, the authors will provide an overview over the state of the art for fault-tolerant interconnects.

For illustration purposes, the core form transformer type with circular windings around a quasi-circular core is assumed. The insulation system is assumed to be comprised of mineral insulating oil, oil-impregnated paper and pressboard. Other insulation media have different transient voltage withstand capabilities.

    "abstract": "The approach aims at solving the above problems by including the analysis and verification of two different levels of software development process–design level and implementation level-and bridging the gap between software architecture analysis and verification and the software product. In the architecture design level, to make sure the design correctness and attack the large scale of complex systems, the compositional verification is used by dividing and verifying each component individually and synthesizing them based on the driving theory. Then for those properties that cannot be verified on the design level, the design model is translated to implementation and runtime verification technique is adapted to the program. This approach can highly reduce the work on the design verification and avoid the state-explosion problem using model checking. Moreover, this approach can ensure both design and implementation correctness, and can further provide a high confident final software product. This approach is based on Software Architecture Model (SAM) that was proposed by Florida International University in 1999. SAM is a formal specification and built on the pair of component-connector with two formalisms – Petri nets and temporal logic. The ACV approach places strong demands on an organization to articulate those quality attributes of primary importance. It also requires a selection of benchmark combination points with which to verify integrated properties. The purpose of the ACV is not to commend particular architectures, but to provide a method for verification and analysis of large scale software systems in architecture level. The future research works fall in two directions. In the compositional verification of SAM model, it is possible that there is circular waiting of certain data among different component and connectors. This problem was not discussed in the current work. The translation of SAM to implementation is based on the restricted Petri nets due to the undecidable issue of high level Petri nets. In the runtime analysis of implementation, extraction of the execution trace of the program is still needed to get a white box view, and further analysis of execution can provide more information of the product correctness.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and simulating rotating machines in power systems under various disturbances are important not only because some disturbances can cause severe damage to the machines, but also because responses of the machines can affect system stability, safety, and other fundamental requirements for systems to remain in normal operation. Basically, there are two types of disturbances to rotating machines from disturbance frequency point of view. One type of disturbances is in relatively low frequency, such as system short-circuit faults, and generation and load impacts; and the other type of disturbances is in high frequency, typically including voltage and current surges generated from fast speed interruption device trips, and lightning strikes induced travelling waves. Due to frequency ranges, special models are required for different types of disturbances in order to accurately study machines behavior during the transients. This chapter describes two popular computer models for rotating machine transient studies in lower frequency range and high frequency range respectively. Detailed model equations as well as solution techniques are discussed for each of the model.",

    "abstract": "Programming languages have evolved through the course of research from machine dependent to high-level “platform-independent” languages. This shift towards abstraction aims to reduce the effort and time required by developers to create software services. It is also a strong indicator of reduced development costs and a direct measure of a positive impact on software productivity. Current trends in software engineering attempt to raise further the abstraction level by introducing modelling languages as the key components of the development process. In particular, modelling languages support the design of software services in the form of domain models. These models become the main development artefacts, which are then transformed using code generators to the required implementation. The major predicament with model-driven techniques is the complexity imposed when manually developing the domain-specific design tools used to define models. Another issue is the difficulty faced in integrating these design tools with model validation tools and code generators. In this chapter a model-driven technique and its supporting model-driven environment are presented, both of which are imperative in automating the development of design tools and achieving tools integration to improve software productivity. A formal parametric model is also proposed that allows evaluating the productivity impact in generating and rapidly integrating design tools. The evaluation is performed on the basis of a prototype domain-specific design tool.",

The agents reside on distributed nodes and collectively represent a distributed system capable of executing tasks that cannot be effectively executed by an individual node. The two key requirements to be met when designing such a system are scalability and reliability. Scalability ensures that a large number of agents can participate in computation without overwhelming the system management facilities and thus allows agents to join and leave the system without affecting its performance. Meeting the reliability requirement guarantees that the system has enough redundancy to transparently tolerate a number of node crashes and agent failures, and is therefore free from single points of failures. The Event B formal method is used to validate the design formally and to ensure system scalability and reliability.",

Owing to the technical, exploitation, and economic nature, the overvoltage risk in high and extra high voltage electrical power systems has been rarely investigated, and therefore the theoretical methods of analysis are intensely developed. This especially applies to lightning overvoltages, which are analyzed using mathematical modeling and computer calculation techniques. The chapter is dedicated to the problems of voltage transients generated by lightning overvoltages in high and extra high voltage electrical power systems. Such models of electrical power lines and substations in the conditions of lightning overvoltages enable the analysis of surge risks, being a result of direct lightning strokes to the tower, ground, and phase conductors. Those models also account for the impulse electric strength of the external insulation. On the basis of mathematical models, the results of numerical simulation of overvoltage risk in selected electrical power systems have been presented. Those examples also cover optimization of the surge arresters location in electrical power substations.",

    "abstract": "Statically scheduled superscalar processors (e.g. very long instruction word processors) are characterized by multiple parallel execution units and small sized control logic. This makes them easy scalable and therefore attractive for the use in embedded systems as application specific processors. The shrinking feature size in CMOS technology makes such processors in long living embedded systems more susceptible to several types of faults. Therefore, it should be possible to run an application, even if one or more components in the data path of a statically scheduled processor become permanently faulty. Then it becomes necessary either to reconfigure the hardware or to reconfigure the executed program such that operations are scheduled around the faulty units. The authors present recent investigations to reschedule operations in the field either on-line in hardware or off-line in software. Thus, the reconfiguration of the program is either done dynamically by the hardware or permanently by self-modifying code. If a permanent fault is present in the data path, then in both cases a delay may occur during the execution of the application. This graceful performance degradation may become critical for real-time applications. A framework to overcome this problem by using scalable algorithms is provided, too.",

We survey computational nanoelectronics of interconnects and analyze four real-world case studies: 1) using graphical processing units (GPUs) for nanoelectronic simulations; 2) HPC simulations of current flow in nanotubes; 3) resistance analysis of molecular interconnects; and 4) electron transport improvement in graphene interconnects.

It is doubtful that current approaches can address the challenges ahead. As a result, the field finds itself at a crossroads, facing the challenge to successfully identify the way forward.

Refactoring is a powerful technique when is repeatedly applied to a model to obtain another one with the same behavior but enhancing some non functionality quality factor such as simplicity, flexibility, understandability and performance (Fowler, 1999) (Mens, Van Eetvelde, Demeyer &amp; Janssens, 2005). Refactorings are horizontal transformations for supporting perfective model evolution. In MDA, a crucial part of the evolution from abstract models to executable components or applications (forward engineering) or, from code to abstract models (reverse engineering) is accomplished by means of refactoring. Although the most effective forms of refactorings are at the design levels (for example, PIMs or PSMs), MDA-based CASE tools provide limited facilities for refactoring only on source code through an explicit selection made by the designer (CASE, 2009). MDA-based refactorings can be specified in OCL as contracts between meta-patterns (MOF metamodel), consisting of pre- and post-conditions that hold for the model before/after refactoring. Besides, we propose an alternative formalization based on the NEREUS language. We propose a uniform treatment of refactoring at platform independent, platform specific and implementation specific abstraction levels.",

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing software systems to extract software artifacts at a higher level of abstraction. Nowadays, software and system engineering industry evolves to manage new platform technologies, design techniques and processes. Architectural framework for information integration and tool interoperation, such as MDA, had created the need to develop new analysis tools and specific techniques. MDA is not itself a technology specification but it represents an evolving plan to achieve cohesive model-driven technology specifications. The original inspiration around the definition of MDA had to do with the middleware integration problem in internet. Beyond interoperability reasons, there are other good benefits to use MDA such as to improve the productivity, process quality and maintenance costs. The outstanding ideas behind MDA are separating the specification of the system functionality from its implementation on specific platforms, managing the software evolution from abstract models to implementations increasing the degree of automation and achieving interoperability with multiple platforms, programming languages and formal languages.",

The projected route area indicates the magnitude of naturalness (as in rainbows) of color sequences, with the minimum sequence being similar to the order of rainbow colors.

Clarifying the relationship between route complexity and the impressions of subjects for a projected route area revealed that the majority (&gt;26%) of subjects of nearly all ages have natural impressions when the minimum route area is large.

    "abstract": "The success of MDA depends on the definition of model transformations and component libraries which make a significant impact on tools that provide support for MDA. MDA is a young approach and several technical issues are not adequately addressed. For instance, existing MDA-based CASE tools do not provide adequate support to deal with component-based reuse (CASE, 2009). In light of this, we propose a metamodeling technique to reach a high level of reusability and adaptability of components. Reusability is the ability to use software elements for constructing many different applications. An ideal software reusability tehnology should facilitate a consistent system implementation, starting from the adaptation and integration of “implementation pieces” that exist in reusable components library. Software reusability has two main purposes: to increase the reliability of software and to reduce the cost of software development. Most current approaches to object oriented reusability are based on empirical methods. However the most effective forms of reuse are generally found at more abstract levels of design (Krueger, 1992). In MDA, software reusability is difficult because it requires taking many different requirements into account, some of which are abstract and conceptual, while others, such as efficiency are concrete. A good approach for MDA reusability must reconcile models at different abstraction levels. In this chapter, we analyze how to define reusable components in a way that fits with MDA and propose a megamodel for defining MDA components. Considering the relevant role that design patterns take in software evolution we exemplify MDA components for them.",

Model-driven development (MDD) distinguishes different kinds of models: the computation-independent model (CIM), the platform-independent model (PIM), and the platform-specific model (PSM). Model transformation is the process of converting one model into another model of the same system, preserving some kind of equivalence relation between them. One of the key concepts behind MDD is that models generated during software developments are represented using common metamodeling techniques. In this chapter, we analyze an integration of MDA metamodeling techniques with knowledge developed by the community of formal methods. We describe a rigorous framework that comprises the NEREUS metamodeling notation (open to many other formal languages), a system of transformation rules to bridge the gap between UML/OCL and NEREUS, the definition of MDA-based reusable components, and model/metamodeling transformations. In particular, we show how to integrate NEREUS with algebraic languages using the Common Algebraic Specification Language (CASL). NEREUS focuses on interoperability of formal languages in MDD.",

Then, a specification that reflects all the information of UML diagrams is constructed.

On the basis of the decision threshold, a biometric recognition system should be in a position to accept the query image as client or reject him as imposter. However, the selection of proper threshold of a given class in a dataset is an open question, as it is related to the difficulty levels dictated in face recognition problems. In this chapter, the authors have introduced a novel thresholding technique for a real life scenario where the query face image may not be present in the training database, i.e. often referred by the biometric researchers as the open test identification. The theoretical basis of the thresholding technique and its corresponding verification on several datasets has been successfully demonstrated in the article. The proposed threshold selection is based on statistical method of set estimation and is guided by minimal spanning tree. It has been found that the proposed technique performs better than the ROC curve based threshold selection mechanism.",

    "abstract": "This chapter discusses software evolution, challenges and strategic directions in the context of MDA. Various authors agreed that it is difficult to define completely software and then, software evolution. Software is certainly more that bits stored in a file, it is an abstract idea that encompasses the concepts, algorithms embodied in the implementation as well as all its associated artifacts and processes. Research seems to confirm that computer software and process software have much in common. Osterweil (2003) assures that software processes are software too. In other paper (Osterweil, 2007), he suggests analyzing the nature of software and proposes to define taxonomies for exploring characteristics and approaches to the development, verification of qualities and software evolution. The exploration of these questions is an important current of software engineering research. On the other hand, evolution is defined as a process of gradual change and development from fewer and simpler forms to higher, more complex, or better ones. In biology, evolution is related to develop over time often many generations, into forms that are better adapted to survive changes in their environment. Thus, evolution captures the notion of something improving and changes occur in species in successive generations, i.e. individuals get old and species evolve. Jazayeri (2005) analyzes the definition of software evolution. The concept of “specie” in software may be associated to meta-levels describing families (species) of software systems. These meta-levels or architectures are created as improvements to previous existing ones and describe evolved families of software systems.",

CASL is an expressive and simple language based on a critical selection of known constructs such as subsorts, partial functions, first-order logic, and structured and architectural specifications. A basic specification declares sorts, subsorts, operations and predicates, and gives axioms and constraints. Specifications are structured by means of specification building operators for renaming, extension and combining. Architectural specifications impose structure on implementations, whereas structured specifications only structure the text of specifications. CASL allows loose, free and generated specifications. The models of a loose specification include all those where the declared functions have the specified properties, without any restrictions on the set of values corresponding to the various sorts. In models of a generated specification, in contrast, it is required that all values can be expressed by terms formed from the specified constructors, i.e. unreachable values are prohibited. In models of free specifications, it is required that values of terms are distinct except when their equality follows from the specified axioms: the possibility of unintended coincidence between their axioms is prohibited.",

    "abstract": "Although the areas of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) and Agile and Lean Software Development (LSD) have been evolving separately in the last few years, they share several commonalities. Both are intended to exploit reusability and exhibit adaptability. SOC in particular aims to facilitate the widespread and diverse use of small, loosely coupled units of functionality, called services. Such services have a decided agility advantage, because they allow for changing a service provider at runtime without affecting any of a group of diverse and possibly anonymous consumers. Moreover, they can be composed at both development-time and run-time to produce new functionalities. Automatic service discovery and selection are key aspects for composing services dynamically. Current approaches attempting to automate discovery and selection make use of only structural and functional aspects of the services, and in many situations, this does not suffice to discriminate between functionally similar but disparate services. Service behavior is difficult to specify prior to service execution and instead is better described based on experience with the execution of the service. In this chapter, the authors present a behavioral approach to service selection and runtime adaptation that, inspired by agile software development techniques, is based on behavioral queries specified as test cases. Behavior is evaluated through the analysis of execution values of functional and non-functional parameters. In addition to behavioral selection, the authors’ approach allows for real-time evaluation of non-functional quality-of-service parameters, such as response time, availability, and latency.",

    "abstract": "Reverse Engineering is the process of analyzing available software artifacts such as requirements, design, architectures, code or byte code, with the objective of extracting information and providing high-level views on the underlying system. A common idea in reverse engineering is to exploit the source code as the most reliable description both of the behavior of a software system and of the organization and its business rules. However, reverse engineering is immersed in a variety of tasks related to comprehending and modifying software such as re-documentation of programs and relational databases, recovering of architectures, recovering of alternative design views, recovering of design patterns, building traceability between code and designs, modernization of interfaces or extracting the source code or high level abstractions from byte code when the source code is not available. Reverse engineering is hardly associated with modernization of legacy systems that were developed many years ago with technology that is now obsolete. These systems include software, hardware, business processes and organizational strategies and politics. Many of them remain in use after more than 20 years; they may be written for technology which is expensive to maintain and which may not be aligned with current organizational politics. Legacy systems resume key knowledge acquired over the life of an organization. Changes are motivated for multiple reasons, for instance the way in which we do business and create value. Important business rules are embedded in the software and may not be documented elsewhere. The way in which the legacy system operates is not explicit (Brodie and Stonebraker, 1995) (Sommerville, 2004).",

    "abstract": "Cloud-based applications offer great value and benefits to businesses and other application consumers. However, unlike traditional in-house developed systems or commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) applications, the customer has little or no control over when and how functionality may change. The cloud consumer also has little or no control over how the data controlled by the application is processed, stored, and secured. This chapter explores how the testing of cloud applications is fundamentally different from other contexts where the customer has a greater degree of control. The limitations of risk mitigation are discussed as well as cloud computing models that may also reduce the cloud consumer’s risk.",

    "abstract": "From the reading of numerous press releases, one may deduce that Japan is a country more and more dedicated to a ‘robot world’. Previously, robots were hidden in plants confined within difficult or dangerous tasks: nowadays robots make themselves visible: humanoids and androids offer home services for elderly. Such a situation is questioning the nature of relationships between human beings and humanoids and highlights how we can understand the human’s position and identity. In becoming part of a family, we could presume that robots should be considered in the position of a child with his or her parent establishing an amazing couple. We will refer to the works of a renowned psychoanalyst Donald Woods Winnicott to understand the way a child may receive the best conditions to become a mature and independent adult. A child when becoming an adolescent is at risk to show possible antisocial behaviours, as symptoms of delinquency. Human beings would certainly prefer the option of an absolute dependence from their robot-child, keeping it waiting in a sort of perpetual adolescence. In that way, human beings would feel more secure not to be challenged in their unshared human hood. Conversely, humans challenging machines and imagining cyber-bodies are to be found in performances and sports events. Researchers consider that robots would emancipate and create a life of their own. Doing so, they seem to offer new opportunities for developing human creativity, eluding the inexpressible threat: shall humanoids overtake human beings in their capacity to run a creative life?",

However, there are concerns that security is difficult to build incrementally, and can prove prohibitively expensive to refactor. This chapter describes how to grow security, organically, within an agile project, by using an incremental security architecture that evolves with the code. The architecture provides an essential bridge between system-wide security properties and implementation mechanisms, a focus for understanding security in the project, and a trigger for security refactoring. The chapter also describes criteria that allow implementers to recognize when refactoring is needed, and a concrete example that contrasts incremental and “top-down” architectures.",

Currently, a wide variety of Web services are available and ready to use for this purpose. Current software process models also support commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)-based development processes. However, although COTS and Web Services are similar, they are different in many perspectives. On one hand, there are various software process models that support Web services development. Yet there is no process model that supports the project that uses services provided by others. This chapter introduces the Incremental Commitment Spiral Model (ICSM), a new generation process model that provides development guidelines, from exploring a Web service alternative to deployment and maintenance with case studies.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen the rapid growth of on-demand, flexible, low-cost cloud-based information technology services. Government and business organizations around the world have started transforming their traditional in-house data center environments to cloud-based outsourced data centers. This transformation is opening doors to new risks given that the cloud computing delivery models, related services, and technologies are still maturing and evolving. Before deployment, organizations must implement cloud environment assessment methodologies to comply with the applicable standards and regulations. They must evaluate the environment’s quality attributes of Internet connectivity, user access control, privacy and confidentiality, asset protection, multiple platforms locality, availability, reliability, performance, and scalability. The purpose of this chapter is to assist organizations that are considering providing and consuming cloud-based services in developing an assessment plan specific to organizational policies, strategies and their business and applicable legal and regulatory requirements; and assessing the cloud environment controls for infrastructure, platform, and software services.",

The first section gives a brief survey of basic text mining techniques, such as keyword extraction, word graphs, clustering of texts and association rule mining. The second section demonstrates an example of text mining applied to interview analysis. Two text mining systems - the concept graph system and the matrix search system - are applied to analyze 2,409 remarks about products and services from 19 people. The analysis shows that text mining systems with a search function achieve interactive analysis of texts and an examination of various problems that we targeted.",

    "abstract": "Web services are increasingly being used in business critical environments as a mean to provide a service or integrate distinct software services. Research indicates that, in many cases, services are deployed with robustness issues (i.e., displaying unexpected behaviors when in presence of invalid input conditions). Recently, Test-Driven Development (TDD) emerged as software development technique based on test cases that are defined before development, as a way to validate functionalities. However, programmers typically disregard the verification of limit conditions, such as the ones targeted by robustness testing. Moreover, in TDD, tests are created before developing the functionality, conflicting with the typical robustness testing approach. This chapter discusses the integration of robustness testing in TDD for improving the robustness of web services during development. The authors requested three programmers to create a set of services based on open-source code and to implement different versions of the services specified by TPC-App, using both TDD and the approach presented in this chapter. Results indicate that TDD with robustness testing is an effective way to create more robust services.",

Applications such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) require high processing power to process and analyze genomic data of the order of petabytes. Cloud computing techniques to process this large datasets could be used which involves moving data to third party distributed system to reduce computing cost, but this might lead to security concerns. These issues are resolved by using a new distributed architecture for De novo assembly using volunteer computing paradigm. The cost of computation is reduced by around 90% by using volunteer computing and resource utilization is increased from 80% to 90%, it is secure as computation can be done locally within the organization and is scalable.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear power is giving an increasing share of power resource in China since it produces much less air pollution compared with power plant consuming fossil fuel. The power system insulation in nuclear power plant takes the risk of radiation. This chapter provides some basic research on the effect of radiation on different materials. The gamma-ray irradiation inhibiting surface charge accumulation on polyethylene is shown in this chapter. The quantity of surface charge is relative with the direction and the magnitude of voltage. Another interesting study presents the effects of atmospheric pressure on tracking failure of gamma-ray irradiated polymer insulating materials. Finally this chapter puts forward a research revealing that the Magnetic could influence the field tracking failure of gamma-ray irradiated polybutylene polymers.",

In this regard, partitioning techniques for BSP heterogeneous computing should produce computing loads with different sizes (unbalanced partitions) in order to exploit processors with different computing capabilities. In this chapter, three major graph partitioning paradigms that are relevant to parallel graph processing are reviewed: balanced graph partitioning, unbalanced graph partitioning, and community detection. Then, the authors discuss how any of these paradigms fits the needs of graph heterogeneous computing where the suitability of partitions to hardware architectures plays a vital role. Finally, the authors discuss how the decomposition of networks in layers through the k-core decomposition provides the means for developing methods to produce unbalanced graph partitions that match multi-core and GPU processing capabilities.",

Yet, equipment is costly and it is not easy to convert existing equipment for Smart Grid application as they may require additional resources which could also inflict much costs. The extra costs involving the remodeling of existing housing structure and installment of new equipment can be avoided by using advanced wireless technologies. As an example, this book proposed an indoor localization system that adopts Bluetooth technology and uses RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) values for localization. Researchers have configured a system where the central control device will recognize all other devices or equipment in the system, communicate with each other, and respond to the commands or the information provided. However, despite the efforts of many researchers, existing RSSI-based indoor localization systems do not show a satisfactory level of accuracy such that we have devised a system that traces the trend in the RSSI samples.",

The obtained results indicate that the acoustic characteristic of discharge is sensitive to the hydrophobic properties in the laboratory tests, which can be applied as a non-contact method for hydrophobicity evaluation of SiR insulator. Besides, the surface charge behaviors considering the hydrophobic properties of SiR insulator were discussed. The droplet experiment was carried out to investigate the maximum value, cumulative charge and energy eigenvector of discharge current. Finally, considering the strong airflow for SiR insulators employed in high-speed railway, the hydrophobic properties and corona discharge properties were investigated in this chapter.",

The study of SiR attempts to clarify whether the addition of boron nitride (BN) particles can improve the resistance to tracking and erosion of SiR by increasing its thermal conductivity. For PP, in addition to measuring thermal conductivity of various samples, thermal dissipation was also discussed to analyze the relationship between them. Meanwhile, in order to evaluate tracking failure (a kind of surface dielectric breakdown) resistance of the manufactured samples, time to failure, erosion depth and weight loss of the test samples were measured through tracking test. As for PE, Thermal conductivity and relative permittivity were measured to characterize the basic properties of various samples. Obtained results show that several properties of the filled specimens are obviously improved.",

The performance of cable accessories, as an essential part of the HVDC networks, is a great concern to the reliability of the system. However, Cable accessories made of ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM), which are considered to be the weakest part of HVDC cable system, have to face the problem of space charge accumulation. Nanosized particles have been proved as an effective method to suppress the space charge accumulation in dielectric composites. This chapter presents a study aimed at clarifying the effect of nanoparticles and direct-fluorination on space charge behaviors for HVDC cable accessory insulation. Obtained results show that the dielectric properties and DC conduction for HVDC cable accessory insulation are significantly influenced and the interface charge density can be effectively suppressed by doped fillers.",

    "abstract": "Among many hacking attempts carried out in the past few years, the cyber-attacks that could have caused a national-level disaster were the attacks against nuclear facilities including nuclear power plants. The most typical one was the Stuxnet attack against Iranian nuclear facility and the cyber threat targeting one of the facilities operated by Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co., Ltd (Republic of Korea; ROK; South Korea). Although the latter was just a threat, it made many Korean people anxious while the former showed that the operation of nuclear plant can be actually stopped by direct cyber-attacks. After these incidents, the possibility of cyber-attacks against industrial control systems has become a reality and the security for these systems has been tightened based on the idea that the operations by network-isolated systems are no longer safe from the cyber terrorism. The ROK government has established a realistic control systems defense concept and in the US, the relevant authorities have set up several security frameworks to prepare for the threats. At the same time, Smart Grids are not an exception any longer. Thus, in this chapter, the security tests have been tested under the Smart Grid environment and several DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack scenarios were developed for experiments.",

From being viewed as a cheaper software alternative, it has become a fountain head of ideas which are adopted cheerfully by people across many domains. From a collaborative effort to build world's biggest encyclopaedia to artists sharing their works under liberal licences, FOSS has become a reference for global, peer-reviewed, volunteer based production model of creating knowledge commons. With everyone from governments to big corporates displaying keen interest in FOSS, it is high time educationalists too take FOSS into classrooms. The ecology of FOSS is filled with more than just a set of software from which a teacher can choose from. He can bring the rich set of coding practices, licensing options, production model and importantly a different world-view by adopting FOSS in teaching. The benefits for students too are many ranging from using modern tools to participating in real world software development. There are many scholarly papers reporting the innovative use of FOSS in teaching graduate courses. By combining these studies with our experience of delivering courses in FOSS, we present a three-stage process which can be adopted by teachers and institutes to utilise the benefits of FOSS to the fullest.",

Considering the unique operating environment, epoxy resin and PI face the challenge of low temperature. Electrical tree is one of the aging failure phenomena occurring in solid dielectrics. These imperfections could cause the field concentration with the application of high voltage, which results in partial discharges (PD). PD testing is an important quality check for the insulation of HTS cable. This chapter presents a study aimed at clarifying the influence of low temperature, pulse frequency and pulse duration on the electrical tree characteristics in epoxy resin, as well as PD characterization of PI film in LN2. The results show that the number of discharges and the discharge quantity in PI films increase with the increasing of the applied voltage and the defect size.

The accumulation of surface charge on the paper would lead to flashover. When the power flow of the HVDC system is reversed, the charge field will easily lead to discharge. Direct-fluorination is a method which could affect the material property without alternating the bulk property. Besides, a new type of nano-modified transformer oil is a method to improve properties. This chapter presents a study of the effect of fluorination on surface charge behavior, the effect of polarity reversal voltages on interface charge behavior and the effect of Boron nitride (BN) nanoparticles on the high thermal conductivity of transformer oil. Results show that fluorination had an influence on the chemical property of the paper and BN nanoparticles has improvements in heat transfer process.

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal impairment can be caused by Avascular Necrosis(AN). Younger people are more likely to develop it, thus early intervention and fast diagnosis are essential. The femoral bones are typically affected by this condition, which results in fractures that change the geometry of the bones. It is difficult to retrieve the AN-affected bone pictures because of the many places where the fractures are located. In this work, a useful method for retrieving AN pictures using deep belief CNN feature representation is proposed. Preprocessing is first applied to the raw dataset. In this stage, the median filter (MF) is used to reduce image noise and downsize the image. Using a deep belief convolutional neural network, features are represented (DB-CNN). The representations of the image feature data have now been converted to binary codes. Then, using the modified-hamming distance, the similarity measurement is calculated. The images are then retrieved with a focus on the similarity values. The test results demonstrated that the proposed approach is superior to the other methods now in use.",

Simultaneously, extensive research in deep learning model development to its deployment has made its way to industrial applications with unprecedented accuracy. The most crucial task in predictive maintenance is to predict the machine's remaining useful life, yet the most beneficial one. In this chapter, the authors address the problem of predicting the remaining lifecycle of an engine using its sensor data. The authors provide practical implementation of predicting the RUL of an engine by proposing a deep learning-based framework on the open-source benchmark NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) engine dataset, which contains sensor information of around 100 engines with 22 sensors. The proposed framework uses the bi-directional long short term memory algorithm. The authors optimize hyperparameters using advanced deep learning frameworks.",

The idea of having machines that are able to process certain cognition to come to a decision without the intervention of humans is the ultimate idea that is being pursued. Though the stage in which AI is able to completely outperform humans in its cognitive skills is yet to be achieved, there has been remarkable progress towards that area. This chapter aims to provide a brief introduction about AI and the area covered under the topic. Various algorithms are used in programming AI on machines such as evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, and swarm intelligence. AI encompasses machine learning, which will be further discussed in this chapter. Furthermore, the impact of AI on society and futuristic predictions the chapter reviews.",

So, to tackle this security problem, the authors propose a night patrolling mechanism to detect objects in low light conditions. Images taken during the nighttime have difficulties with less contrast, brightness, and noise owing to inadequate light or insufficient exposure. Deep learning-based methods accomplish end-to-end, unsupervised object recognition using convolutional neural networks, which abolishes the requirement to describe and draw out attributes separately. Despite the fact that deep learning has led to the invention of many successful object detection algorithms; many state-of-the-art object detectors, like Faster-RCNN and others, can't carry out at their best under low-light situations. Even with an extra light source, it is hard to detect the features of an item due to the uneven division of brightness.

Currently, lithium-ion batteries are widely used in EVs due to their safety concerns, high stability, and energy density properties. The performance of the batteries depends on their thermal characteristics and thermal management systems. Hence, a thermal management system is necessary to sustain the performance of electric vehicles. In this chapter, the effect of temperature rise and self-discharge of the battery packs are discussed. The techniques followed to manage the thermal characteristics of batteries are described with advantages and disadvantages. The chapter is concluded by a future outlook.",

This paper proposes a model-based algorithm using the graph neural network (GNN) to predict the QoS values. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, an experiment was conducted. The WS-dream dataset used in the experiment and the proposed method performance were compared with three baseline methods (User item-based Pearson correlation coefficient for QoS prediction-UIPCC, reputation-aware network embedding-based QoS Prediction-RANEP, and trust-aware approach TAP for personalized QoS prediction). The experiment results show that the proposed method, the GNN-based QoS prediction algorithm, performs better than memory-based and other model-based methods in terms of RMSE and MAE in most cases.",

Quality control is a significant factor for the data scientist, particularly if data collection was poorly administered or designed, leading to issues like missing values. Once the data scientist has acquired a relevant dataset, they should inspect the outliers associated with each feature to make sure the data is suitable for analysis.

NeutroGeometry is not one kind of classical geometry, but it can be a combination of some of them in the same space. For the first time, this chapter introduces notions of NeutroGeometry for finite geometries. Finite geometries consist of incidence structures where the set of points has finite cardinality. Usually, they are either projective or affine geometries. In this chapter, the author is mainly focused on the definition of the mixed projective-affine geometry (MPA geometry), which is a NeutroGeometry that follows the line of Smarandache's ideas of defining mixed geometries. The properties of the MPA spaces are studied, especially the one related to the satisfaction of parallelism for some lines and the no satisfaction for others. Additionally, other approaches to this theory are introduced, where elements of Neutrosophy are combined with the incidence matrices obtained from finite geometries.

Thus, the neutrosophic theory's (T, I, F) components are added to traditional topological space, yielding a new structure. Topology is a branch of mathematics that works with particular definitions for spatial structure notions, compares them, and analyses the relationships between the structure and the set's qualities. In topology, the initial step is to define a general definition of the fit, followed by an investigation of the connections between topological structures derived from various methodologies.

Scikit-learn is a popular library in the data science industry that offers various data mining commands for regression, decision constructs, and cluster analysis, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning. Therefore, junior data scientists must learn Python programming for data science applications, especially when using software packages that require editing the model using Python commands.",

    "abstract": "In this book, the focus is on data mining with RapidMiner. However, it's important to note that there are other essential steps to consider when delving into the realm of data mining. This chapter serves as an introduction to the process of data pre-processing using RapidMiner, allowing readers to practice with a data set example available on the platform. With RapidMiner, data pre-processing begins with exploring the data visually and then selecting the features that will be analysed with each data mining technique. Managing missing values in a feature is also a crucial step in this process, which can be achieved by either eliminating or replacing them with appropriate values. In addition, RapidMiner allows data scientists to detect outliers and normalize features easily using diagram design, without requiring any computer programming skills. To help readers become familiar with the tools offered by RapidMiner, a classification technique will be demonstrated step-by-step in the book.",

These structures are formed through lithographic patterning of quantum wells or spontaneous growth techniques, and can be considered as 3D quantum wells with no degrees of freedom and quantized levels for all three directions of motion. Due to their small size, quantum dots have dimensions that are similar to the Bohr exciton radius, and they confine electrons in all three spatial directions to produce discrete energy levels that are similar to those found in atoms. One of the key features of quantum dots is that their electronic and optical properties can be tailored by altering parameters such as size and shape. In this chapter, the authors will use the Schrödinger equation to solve for the energy levels of different types of quantum dots, including infinite (1D and 2D) and finite potential wells. They will also use Matlab programs to solve for a realistic model of a quantum dot, investigating the effects of changing parameters such as potential and well widths.",

Various actuating devices have been integrated into structures along with specifically designed control strategies. Semi-active dampers are nonlinear switching systems that require enhanced controllers. In order to minimize instability risk, a cascaded fuzzy control system that integrates the switch behaviour is designed. The inner loop uses a PI (proportional-integral) controller that is tuned with evolutionary optimization. The case study uses an electrohydraulic damper and a three-story building. To anticipate robustness to real-world disturbances and equipment failure, an uncertainty effect analysis is included in which three control systems are compared. First, structural and actuator disturbances are considered. Then, the case of switch failure brings forth the high reliability of the fuzzy control system, in what concerns using semi-active dampers in the development of civil structures.",

By implementing a good UX (user experience), the solutions can be seen to cause improvements in training, reduce on-site training risks and cut costs rapidly. By creating 3D simulations driven by engine mechanics, the applications for AR and VR technologies are vast ranging from purely computer science oriented applications such as data and process simulations to mechanical equipment and environmental simulations.

Its challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, and information privacy. Lately, the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. In this chapter, the authors distinguish between fake note and a real note and would like to take it to a level where it can be used everywhere. Its data after the detection of the fakeness and the real note can be stored in the database. The data to store will be huge. To overcome this problem, we can go for big data. It will help to store large amounts of data in no time. The difference between real note and fake note is that real note has its thin strip to be more or less continuous while the fake strip has fragmented thin lines in the strip. One could say that the fake note has more than one line in the thin strip while the real note only has one line. Therefore, if we see just one line, it is real, but if we see more than one line, it is fake. In this chapter, the authors use foreign currency.",

A texture segmentation method has been designed to distinguish between the human skin and objects with similar colors to that of human skin. Once the skin is detected, image is divided into several skin components and the process of detecting the face is limited to these components—increasing the speed of the face detection.

    "abstract": "The number of consumers consulting online reviews in order to purchase a product or service, keeps growing. In addition to that, consumers can add an online review in order to express their experience upon the services or products received. This iterative process makes reviews matter regarding consumer's purchase decision. Apart from reviews, consumers are welcomed to provide numerical ratings for the product or services they bought. If a hotel is exposed to an online hotel review site, then it very possible to improve the possibility of a consumer to consider booking a room in this hotel. According to this chapter, regardless of positive or negative reviews, hotel awareness is enhanced. Online reviews significantly improve hotel awareness for lesser-known hotels than for well-known hotels.",

    "abstract": "Semantic mashup applications allow automating the process of services and data integration to create a composite application with a new user interface. Nevertheless, existing mashup applications need to improve the matching methods for discovering semantic services. Moreover, they have to create or modify workflows in mashup applications without the assistance of the original developers. Automating the combination of user interfaces is another challenge in the context of semantic mashups construction. In this chapter, the authors propose an approach that allows automating the combination of data, services, and user interfaces to provide a composite application with an enhanced user interface. The construction of the semantic mashup application is based on the use of domain ontology, a matching tool, and a collection of patterns. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposal, the authors present a use case to construct a semantic mashup application for a travel agency.",

It becomes difficult to know the features that can be included in tag software; also, not all features may be required. This chapter presents a framework for integration of tag software in web applications. The framework has four components corresponding to phases of the software development lifecycle. For requirement, a weighted requirement checklist is presented to ease requirement selection. A metric, software estimation, is defined for quantifying selected requirement. A logical design defined for design phase displays interaction of entities with users. For development, best mechanisms are suggested to web applications. Software engineering artefacts are provided to help during testing. A case study is presented where estimation and design is applied to freely available tag software.",

For physical learning resources, these informative tools must provide a fast and efficient inquiry/location. Augmented reality helps this location by showing, through digital content, the three-dimensional space (3D) of that location, highlighting categories and classifications of physical references so that, in turn, the user able to visualize it, using a mobile device, and is therefore directed to the exact place of the location in a relatively short time.

In spite of the availability of different microgrid topologies, DC microgrid largely facilitates the injection of DC power from various renewable energy sources into the stabilised DC power pool. The requirement for a minimal number of conversion stages, simple structure, economic operation, and numerous localised applications are driving factors for the DC microgrid technology. The mettle of the DC microgrid technology lies in choosing the appropriate microgrid participants for energy interchange and the suitable supervisory control to tap power from the microgrid partakers even after respecting their operating constraints. The use of high gain DC-DC converters is inevitable in DC microgrid due to the low terminal voltage levels of different RESs.",

Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are developed with the help of mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) with the difference that the data are exchanged among mobile vehicles to enhance the road safety and traffic efficiency. VANETs safety applications includes traffic signal violation, curve speed warning, emergency brake lights, pre-crash sensing, collision warning, left turn assist, lane change warning, and stop sign assist. But due to the requirement of smaller size, one of the significant challenges of the vehicular network is the limited resource with respect to memory, computation power, and bandwidth. It leads to slow data processing capability. However, the demanding requirement of emerging application is complex computation with high storage capacity. This necessity can be fulfilled by sharing the available resource among all the vehicles which are in near proximity. It can be achieved by integrating the vehicular network with cloud computing which is called as vehicular cloud computing (VCC). VCC is a new technological shift that can take the advantages of cloud computing to afford the services to drivers of VANET. But VCC is still in early stage and due to its unique features and applications it has become a significant emerging research area which needs to be explored further.",

    "abstract": "Smart cities encompass a complex, diverse, and rich ecosystem with the potential to address humanity's biggest challenges. To fully support society demands, many emerging technologies should be gracefully integrated. Current architectures and platforms frequently address specific topics, requiring intricate coordination of partial solutions. In this context, interoperability of technological solutions is mandatory. Examples include interoperability of IETF standards (e.g., 6LowPAN, RPL, CoAP to other IEEE standards, such as 802.15.4, and Bluetooth). Designs based on these protocols are being largely employed worldwide. However, they have some limitations that deserve our attention. Recent examples, such as ramsomware and DDoS attacks, are concerning many people on the suitability of our current stacks. NovaGenesis (NG) is an alternative architecture for TCP/IP that has been already proofed. In this chapter, the NG model for smart cities is explored, presenting its benefits. Recent results in NG are summarized and discussed on the proposed scope.",

The numerical formulation is presented in detail. Two approaches, homogeneous GPU and heterogeneous CPU+GPU, on each of the refinement methods are studied. Obviously, the use of the two architectures, CPU and GPU, to compute the same problem involves more important challenges with respect to the homogeneous counterpart.

A recurring question relates to the sources of competitive advantage that a franchise network may have. This chapter intends to contribute to the debate based on the fundamentals of the resource/competence-based view, and applying the reflection to the case of the logistical service. The aim is to identify how and why supply chain resources and skills are deployed by franchisors to retain their franchisees thanks to a high level of service quality and therefore avoid the termination of contractual relationships. Based on a case study driven within a European franchise network, it is possible to conclude that the supply chain resources and competences of a franchisor play an important role in the duration of the franchisor-franchisee relationship when customized solutions are proposed thanks to information technologies.",

These algorithms are very efficient in identifying optimal solutions, but as the size of the problem increases, these algorithms tend to get stuck at local optima. In order to extract these algorithms from local optima, genetic algorithm has been used.

The central argument across the chapter is two-fold: firstly, in promoting an initial shift in focus from the management of online identity to the nature and significance of identity itself whose construction may be conceptualized as a process of sense making and strengthening; and only then, armed with a better understanding of identity, one can focus back upon the management of it more effectively, with a view to the individual taking more control of their own identity within cyberspace, which is increasingly transitioning us all into a functioning global community, in both predictable and unforeseen ways.",

    "abstract": "The miniature Raspberry Pi computer has become of interest to many researchers as a platform for building sociotechnical IoT systems for end-users; however, for the end-user to design and build such apps themselves requires new people-oriented tools and design methods. This chapter describes a people-oriented design method called TANDEM and demonstrates the use of it in detail, by way of a case study—the design of a mashup of services and local data stores—that solves the so-called movie-cinema problem. An implementation of the newly designed movie-cinema app is then built within the DigitalFriend, an end-user programmer IDE. Furthermore, a significant part of the TANDEM design method is then automated within the development tool itself. This automation removes the most skilled task required by TANDEM of the end-user: the automation of the process of data normalization. The automation applies data normalization to the initial model of components and data sources that feed into the mashup. The presentation here relies on some understanding of data normalization, so a simple example is presented. After this demonstrated example of the method and the implementation, the authors discuss the applicability of a model achievable by end-users using TANDEM coupled with the automated normalization process built into the IDE vs. using a top-down model by an experienced information analyst. In conclusion, the TANDEM method combined with the automation as demonstrated does empower an end-user to a significant degree in achieving a workable mashup of distributed services and local data stores and feeds. Such a powerful combination of methods and tools will help the Raspberry Pi to become a significant people-oriented platform, beyond just a platform for teaching novices to code. Furthermore, the TANDEM method does have broader applicability to designing a broad class of logic programs, complementing the use of collected patterns in logic programs.",

The routing strategies developed for WSNs must be efficient to make it an operationally self-configurable network. For this we need to resort to near shortest path evaluation. Therefore, some soft computing approaches that can calculate the near shortest path available in an affordable computing time are required. WSNs have a high computational environment with limited and precise transmission range, processing, and limited energy sources. The sever power constraints strongly affect the existence of active nodes and hence the network lifetime.

    "abstract": "Supplier selection is one of the most important decisions within SCM since suppliers have emerged as value adding partners in industrial relationship. In the current study, supplier selection on the basis of information pertaining to quality and delivery time is explained. The cost aspects are taken care while coordinating procurement and distribution in the echelons. The deteriorating nature of the product creates imprecision in demand and fuzziness in different stages of the coordination. A fuzzy bi-objective mixed integer non-linear model is developed, where the first objective minimizes the combined cost of holding, processing, and transportation in all the echelons and the second objective maximizes combination of lot acceptance percentage and on-time delivery percentage. The solution process converts the model into crisp form and solves using a fuzzy goal programming technique.",

    "abstract": "The process used to build an autonomous smart home system based on cyber-physical systems (CPS) principles has recently received increased attention from researchers and developers. However, there are many challenges to be resolved before designing and implementing such a system. In this chapter, the authors present a high-level design approach that simulates a smart home system by implementing three levels of the 5C architecture used in CPS modeling and uses well-known machine learning algorithms to predict future user actions. The simulation demonstrates how users will interact with the smart home system to make more efficient use of resources. The authors also present results from analyzing real-world user data to validate the accuracy of prediction of user actions. This research illustrates the benefits of considering CPS principles when designing a home autonomous system that reliably predicts a user's needs.",

The proposed method is divided into two stages: (1) The authors present analytical models and utilize the analytical models for both query access time over broadcast channel and on-demand channel; (2) they present a global index, an indexing scheme designed to assist data dissemination over multi broadcast channel. Several factors are taken into account, which include request arrival rate, service rate, number of request, size of data item, size of request, number of data item to retrieve, and bandwidth. Simulation models are developed to find out the performance of the analytical model. Finally, the authors compare the performance of the proposed method against the conventional approach.",

If the signal is not properly filtered, the overlapping of the repeated replicas of the original spectrum, called aliasing, may occur. The aliasing may destroy the useful information of the decimated signal and must be eliminated by the filter which precedes the decimation, called decimation filter. The most popular decimation filter is a comb filter, usually used in the first stage of decimation. However, its magnitude characteristic is not flat in the pass band of interest and there is not enough attenuation in the folding bands. Different methods are proposed to improve comb magnitude characteristic. This chapter presents an overview of methods for simultaneous improvement of comb magnitude characteristic in both: pass band and folding bands. The methods are divided into three main groups: sharpening-based methods, corrector-based methods, and methods based on the combination of alias rejection and compensator design methods.",

However, anticyclones and depressions produce noticeable pressure gradients that may affect the consequences of phenomena like tides and tsunamis.

In this chapter, the authors have evaluated the performances of three different clustering algorithms used in image segmentation: the classical k-means, its modified k-means++, and proposed enhanced clustering method. Brief explanations of the fundamental working principles implicated in these methods are presented. Thereafter, the performance which affects the outcome of segmentation are evaluated considering two vital quality measures, namely structural content (SC) and root mean square error (RMSE). Experimental result shows that the proposed method gives impressive result for the computed values of SC and RMSE as compared to k-means and k-means++. In addition to this, the output of segmentation using the enhanced technique reduces the overall execution time as compared to the other two approaches irrespective of any image size.",

The handwritten document images are segmented into words and each word image is represented by a vector that contains the frequency of visual words appeared in the image. In order to include spatial information to the BoVW framework, the authors adopted spatial pyramid matching (SPM) method. The proposed method is evaluated using precision and recall metrics through experimentation conducted on popular datasets such as GW and IAM.

In the present scenario, the victims completely rely on the passersby for almost every kind of medical help such as informing the hospital or ambulance. This project aims to automate the process of detecting and reporting accidents using accident detection kits in vehicles. The kit has a system on chip and various sensors which sense various parameters that change drastically during the occurrence of accidents such as the vibration levels, orientation of vehicles with respect to the ground. The accident is said to occur when these values cross the permissible threshold limit. As soon as this happens, the latitude and longitude of the accident spot is tracked using the GPS module present in the kit. The nearest hospital and police station is computed by the GPS module, which uses the latitude and longitude values as the input. The accident notifications are sent to the concerned hospital and police station over the web interface accordingly. The assignment of particular ambulance and the required traffic policemen to the accident cases is done using the web interface. The android application guides the ambulance driver as well as the policemen to the accident spot and also helps in the detailed registration of the accidents. The closest doctor facility and police headquarters is processed by the GPS module, which utilizes the scope and longitude esteems as the information. The accident warnings are sent to the concerned healing facility and police headquarters over the web interface as needs be. The task of specific rescue vehicle and policemen to the accident cases is finished utilizing the web interface. An intelligent analysis of the last five years' rich dataset uncovers the patterns followed by the accidents and gives valuable insights on how to deploy the existing resources such as ambulances and traffic-police efficiently. Various types of analysis are done to identify the cause-effect relationships and deal with this in a better way. Such technical solutions to the frequently occurring problems would result in saving many lives as well as making the cities safer and smarter.",

Very low cost of maintenance and non-polluting nature are major reasons behind their growing demand.

In the last few years, a great interest has been seen in microwave power scavenging for charging wireless devices. This chapter presents a RF energy harvesting circuit with tuned π-matching network that resonates at desired incident RF frequency to boost these signals. Various computer intelligent techniques have been used to optimize parameters value of matching circuit. The designed circuit has been analyzed for input power range from -30 dBm to 0 dBm. Approximately 80% maximum PCE is achieved at RF input of 0 dBm with 4 KΩ load. It is also demonstrated that better output power is produced for power range -15 dBm to 0 dBm at higher load values.",

In the vast majority of cases, social networking platforms are still used without corporate blessing. However, several traditional information systems, such as CRMs and ERPs, have also been modified in order to include social aspects. This chapter discusses the participation in online social networking activities and, in particular, the technologies that support and promote the participation in online social network.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, a brief discussion about the application of lattice Boltzmann method on complex flow characteristics over circular structures is presented. A two-dimensional computational simulation is performed to study the fluid flow characteristics by employing the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with respect to Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision model to simulate the interaction of fluid flow over the circular cylinders at different spacing conditions. From the results, it is observed that there is no significant interaction between the wakes for the transverse spacing's ratio higher than six times the cylinder diameter. For smaller transverse spacing ratios, the fluid flow regimes were recognized with presence of vortices. Apart from that, the drag coefficient signals are revealed as chaotic, quasi-periodic, and synchronized regimes, which were observed from the results of vortex shedding frequencies and fluid structure interaction frequencies. The strength of the latter frequency depends on spacing between the cylinders; in addition, the frequency observed from the fluid structure interaction is also associated with respect to the change in narrow and wide wakes behind the surface of the cylinder. Further, the St and mean Cd are observed to be increasing with respect to decrease in the transverse spacing ratio.",

    "abstract": "As power dissipation and time constraint have become vital challenges during the creation of a digital circuit, researchers' and designers' efforts have increased to figure out new ways of preserving power through the study of its sources and its impacts as well as through the decrease of response time to obtain faster treatments. However, it is widely acknowledged that these two parameters are antagonistic in synchronous systems. In fact, current technologies have managed to further decrease the response time to have a faster circuit at the cost of a considerable simultaneous augmentation in its power or vice versa, which leaves no option for designers but to choose from these two important parameters. Hence, the main objective of this chapter is to propose a design method that simultaneously builds a low power design and provides a faster circuit. For the achievement of that purpose, a controller based on a finite state machine (FSM) has been chosen as an example of synchronous system to prove that the new proposed design can optimize both parameters: time and power.",

To improve the ability and analyze and understand the behavior of 1D-EBG, three techniques of analysis are developed. The results show that the periodicity of the dielectric permittivity makes it possible to stop the waves propagation in certain frequency bands. A comparison between the different methods shows an excellent agreement. An evolution of the transmission coefficient of a structure consisting of six layers with a cavity of thickness equal a wavelength in the middle of the structure, shows that there is a peak of transmission which is formed at the center frequency of the band gap and reflects a resonance phenomenon. This phenomenon of frequency filtering is exploited for the design of a directive EBG antenna by introducing an excitation to the cavity center.",

A shared understanding between ethnographers, interaction designers, and software engineers is vital to ensure that complex and subtle social interactions present in the data are considered in the final system design. One solution for supporting team conversations uses the quality goal construct as a container for complex and ambiguous interaction attributes. Quality goals in system modelling promote shared understandings and collaborative design solutions by retaining a high level of abstraction for as long as possible during the design process.

Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) service design defines a service catalog as a list of technology-enabled services that an organization provides, often to its employees or customers. More specifically, the service catalog is an expression of the operational capability of a service provider or enterprise within the context of an end customer, a market space, or an internal business unit stakeholder. Unfortunately, most service catalogs are built by technologists for technologists. This design methodology is fine assuming the user of the catalog is an information technology professional.",

Guidelines are proposed to elicit two types of actions, triggering actions that cause the policy violation and the corresponding correcting actions. The decision-making problem is that of selecting the most appropriate correcting action in the event of a policy violation. This selection requires information. The elicited information is unstructured and is “early.” This work is extended by proposing a method to directly convert early information into its multi-dimensional form. For this, an early information mode is proposed. The proposed conversion process is a fully automated one. Further, the tool support is extended to accommodate the conversion process.

CA structures present potential benefits over traditional approaches since they are computationally efficient and can adapt to the particularities of the task to be solved. However, it is necessary to generate an appropriate rule set for each particular problem, which is usually a difficult task. The generation of the rule sets is handled here following a new methodology based on the application of evolutionary algorithms and using synthetic low-dimensionality images and sequences as training datasets, which results in CA structures that can be used to process HI and sequences successfully, thus avoiding the problem of lack of labeled reference images. Both processing approaches have been tested over real HI providing very competitive results.",

    "abstract": "Within the last 20 years, wireless communication and network has been one of the fastest-growing research areas. Significant progress has been made in the fields of mobile ad hoc network (MANET) and wireless sensor networks (WSN). Very recently, the cyber-physical system (CPS) has emerged as a promising direction to enrich human-to-human, human to-object, and object-to-object interactions in the physical world as well as in the virtual world. The possibilities are enormous, such that CPS would adopt, and even nurture, the areas of MANET and WSN because more sensor inputs and richer network connectivity are required. The chapter reviews what has been developed in these fields, outlines the projection of what may happen in the field of CPS, and identifies further works. The authors identify the unique features of WSN, raising some CPS critical examples, and then directing the future challenges of CPS. In order to fully comprehend the connection of WSN to CPS, the authors provide some preliminaries of WSN and establish their necessary connections.",

    "abstract": "GPUs deliver higher performance than traditional processors, offering remarkable energy efficiency, and are quickly becoming very popular processors for HPC applications. Still, writing efficient and scalable programs for GPUs is not an easy task as codes must adapt to increasingly parallel architecture features. In this chapter, the authors describe in full detail design and implementation strategies for lattice Boltzmann (LB) codes able to meet these goals. Most of the discussion uses a state-of-the art thermal lattice Boltzmann method in 2D, but all lessons learned in this particular case can be immediately extended to most LB and other scientific applications. The authors describe the structure of the code, discussing in detail several key design choices that were guided by theoretical models of performance and experimental benchmarks, having in mind both single-GPU codes and massively parallel implementations on commodity clusters of GPUs. The authors then present and analyze performances on several recent GPU architectures, including data on energy optimization.",

The neural network architecture uses fuzzy theoretic concepts to assist in the segmentation process. The authors propose a grayscale image segmentation method endorsed by context-sensitive thresholding technique. This quantum-inspired multilayer neural network is adapted with self-organization.

For example, a concert-goer may like to visit restaurants or parks before the concert and may not like the advertisements of grocery stores or farmers' markets. This research tries to overcome the challenge by using the methods of location-aware data mining. Furthermore, privacy is always a great concern for location-based advertising (LBA) users because their location information has to be shared in order to receive the services. This chapter also takes the concern into serious consideration, so the user privacy will not be compromised. Preliminary experiment results show the proposed methods are effective and user-privacy is rigorously preserved.",

    "abstract": "Electrical machines are used almost everywhere, and our daily life depends on them. For this reason, it is important to articulate mechanisms to control, supervise, and perform proper maintenance of these machines, especially those used in critical industrial process. The SCADA protocol is one of the technologies that eases the operation and supervision of electrical machines. However, the absence of a spatial connection between the SCADA signals and the machines being supervised suggests the use of augmented reality (AR) to fill this void. This chapter describes SIMARA: A Mobile AR application based on a dual computer-vision system (QR-codes and fiducial markers). SIMARA provides a robust client application for the integration of AR and SCADA signals by means of virtual panels shown on top of real SCADA machines. An authoring tool is also provided in order for users to customize the application to their particular needs, allowing to create, by means of web services, customized virtual panels, and links between SCADA signals and the virtual information shown in the AR application.",

In such heterogeneous multi-cloud environments, the need for monitoring the quality of (a) the acquired resources, (b) the services offered to the final users, and (c) the offered service-based processes, and adapting them has come into force. Current research approaches addressing these areas are limited and most of them target a subset of these offerings.

Next it performs prioritization on classified data to rank functions into higher and lower levels according to the degree of impact they will make.

It designs adaptive FWN as a nonlinear-in-parameter approximator to approximate the uncertain dynamics of the system. Then, the proposed control scheme is developed by incorporating the DSC method to the adaptive FWN-based model. Stability analysis of the proposed scheme is provided and adaptive laws are designed to learn all linear and nonlinear parameters of the network. It is proven that all the signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error can be made arbitrary small. The proposed scheme does not require any prior knowledge about dynamics of the system and offline learning. Furthermore, it eliminates the “explosion of complexity” problems and develops accurate model of the system and simple controller. Simulation results on the numerical example and permanent magnet synchronous motor are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

Partitioned coupling strategies allow one to solve separately the fluid and solid subdomains using adapted or optimized numerical schemes, which provides a considerable flexibility for FSI simulation, especially for more realistic and industrial applications. However, partitioned coupling procedures often encounter numerical instabilities due to the fact that the time integrations of the two subdomains are usually carried out in a staggered way. As a consequence, the energy transfer across the fluid-solid interface is usually not correctly simulated, which means numerical energy injection or dissipation might occur at the interface with partitioned methods. The focus of the present chapter is given to the energy conservation property of different partitioned coupling strategies for FSI simulation.",

The customers under the cloud providers are very concerned about their data, which has been stored in the cloud environment. In this regard, it is essential for a cloud provider to implement some powerful tools for security, to provide a secure cloud infrastructure to the customers. Generally speaking, there are some foundational needs to be attained and some actions to be combined to ensure data security in both cloud, as well as, non-cloud infrastructure.

In particular, the ability to wirelessly update devices is a must in order to fix security issues and software bugs, or to extend firmware functionality. Code update mechanisms in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a subset of IoT networks, must handle limited resources and strict constraints. Also, over-the-air (OTA) code updates in the context of an IoT ecosystem may open new security vulnerabilities. An IoT security framework should therefore be extended with additional mechanisms to secure the OTA code update functionality. The chapter presents an overview of various OTA code update techniques for WSNs and their security flaws along with some existing attacks and possible countermeasures. It is discussed which attacks can be used more easily with the code update functionality. Countermeasures are compared as to whether they secure the weakened security objectives, giving a guideline to choose the right combination of countermeasures.",

Vehicles cooperate among themselves and establish an intelligent transportation system to fulfill the needs on traffic management.

Such information is stored in cloud server to be accessed by the vehicles at any time. During the message communication, the origin of the message is checked for its authenticity by the receiver. During signature verification, to preserve the privacy of the user, it is required that the ID of the vehicle should not be revealed. Security and privacy of the information stored in the cloud is a challenging task. The privacy of the vehicle user and the information should be secured from the threats. The solutions in the existing literature do not fulfill the requirements of security and privacy. In this chapter, a secured and dynamic privacy preserving scheme is proposed for vehicular cloud computing. Analysis on the proposed privacy scheme is done based on anonymity and un-linkability.

    "abstract": "Buildings maintenance has received increasing international attention in various fields of scientific research. As a result, there has been a change in the maintenance of buildings from the preventive to the predictive approach. This is done through an evaluation model to support and assist the management of the facility in selecting alternatives and making appropriate decisions in maintenance according to building status and maintenance budget. This chapter investigated the reasons for the electrical maintenance of the university buildings and the degree of importance of each element of electrical maintenance through the design of a questionnaire in which the electrical components were divided into elements and then each element was linked to all maintenance items that related to it. At the end of the research, mathematical models were developed; these models help to forecasting the electrical maintenance items and distribution of the maintenance budget, and to verify the validity of these models, they have been applied to study the case of dorm buildings in Tishreen University.",

Thus, it has been shown that the RDMA principle, together with the formation of a separate computing network in the data interchange environment, and the implementation of VLAN mechanisms, allowed the data transmission among nodes memory of the multiprocessor computing system without additional buffering.

    "abstract": "Software quality is imperative for industrial strength software. This quality will be often determined by a few components present in the software which decides the entire functionality. If any of these components are not rigorously tested, the quality will be highly affected. Without knowing which of these components are really critical, it will not be possible to perform high level testing. Hence, to predict such fault-prone or critical components from the software prior to testing and prioritizing them during the testing process, an agent-based approach is proposed in this chapter. The framework developed as part of this work will certainly reduce the field failures and thus will improve the software quality. Further, this approach has also utilized important metrics to predict such components and also prioritized the components based on their critical value. Also, the work proposed in this research has also been compared with some of the existing approaches and the results reveal that, this work is a novel one and can both predict and test the components from the software.",

If the service provider is not the trusted one, there may be a chance of leakage of confidential data to external third party. Security and privacy of data require high consideration, which is resolved by storing the data in encrypted form. Data owner requires that the service provider should be trustworthy to store its confidential data without any exposure.

This information is fused in the sink module of QPSONN to get the preferred output. Each pixel of the input image is converted to the corresponding qubit neurons according to the phase manner. The interconnection weights between the layers are represented by qubit rotation gates.

This allows for a reduction in the cell area required for producing a given amount of power. The goal is to significantly reduce the cost of electricity generated by replacing expensive PV converter area with less expensive optical material.

This is the main advantage of fractional models in comparison with classical integer-order models; another feature is that scientists have developed new models that involve fractional differential equations in mechanics, electrical engineering. Many scientists have become aware of the potential use of chaotic dynamics in engineering applications. With the development of the fractional-order algorithm, the dynamics of fractional order systems have received much attention. Chaos cannot occur in continuous integer order systems of total order less than three due to the Poincare-Bendixon theorem.

    "abstract": "3D maps have become an essential tool for navigation aid. The aim of a navigation aid is to provide an optimal route from the current position to the destination. Unfortunately, most mobile devices' GPS signal accuracy and the display of pathways on 3D maps in the small screen of mobile devices affects the pathway architectural from generating accurate initial positions to destinations. This chapter proposed a technique for visualizing pathway on 3D maps for an interactive user navigation aid in mobile devices. This technique provides visualization of 3D maps in virtual 3D workspace environments which assists a user to navigate to a target location. The Bi-A* path-finding algorithm was used for establishing dynamic target location in Voronoi diagram/Delaunay triangulation. This approach could navigate more than two users in a 3D walk-space and at the same time showing their whereabouts on 3D projections mapped. The map shows the users' location in the scene to navigate from source to the target and the target also moves to the source to meet on the same physical location and image plane.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, chaos has stimulated the interest of researchers due to its existence in different fields of science and engineering. The chaotic systems are characterized by their sensitivity to the initial conditions. This property makes the system unpredictable long term. Similar to the integer-order differential systems, fractional-order differential systems can exhibit chaotic behaviors. This type of system contains one or more elements of fractional order. The fractional calculus is recognized in the early seventeenth century but it has been widely applied in many fields and with intense growth just over the past decades. To avoid troubles arising from unusual behaviors of a chaotic system, chaos control has gained increasing attention in recent years. An important objective of a chaos controller is to suppress the chaotic oscillations completely or reduce them to the regular oscillations. The goal of this chapter is to present the evolution of chaotic systems in open and closed loop in function of their parameters and designing a controller using bifurcation diagrams.",

However, pedagogical approaches also do not provide requirements for technologies; they rather consider tools and features as predefined design parameters. Taking an interoperability point of view allows focus on the interaction between the pedagogical and the technological systems. By interpreting technology and didactic approaches as systems and ensuring their interoperability, educators are able to adapt learning experiences and technological features in a way that the overall learning system becomes personalized.

This allows increasing the robustness of LBM with lower computational costs without increasing the mesh density in a prohibitive way.

However, the flow of user energy consumption data may lead to the violation of user privacy. Inference on such data can expose the daily habits and types of appliances of users. Thus, several privacy preservation schemes have been proposed in the literature to ensure the privacy and security requirements of smart grid users.

Impedance bandwidth of the above slot antenna is enhanced through various tuning stubs. In case of forklike tuning stub, the obtained bandwidth is about 900MHz, for hexagonal stub the available bandwidth is 1751MHz.

    "abstract": "A novel compact ultra-wideband (UWB) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) slot antenna with band notch characteristics is presented for portable wireless UWB applications. The antenna comprises of co-planar waveguide feed (CPW) and two radiating monopoles oriented in orthogonal orientation for providing orthogonal radiation patterns. A Minkowski fractal parasitic stub along with a Minkowski fractal grounded stub has been placed at 45° between the monopoles to reduce the coupling between them, which in turn establishes high isolation between the radiators. An excellent band notch characteristic is obtained at 5.5 GHz by etching a modified E-shaped compact slot on the radiators. Results show that the designed antenna meets -10 dB impedance bandwidth and -17 dB isolation throughout the entire operating band (3.1 -12 GHz). Novelty of this design lies in improving isolation using fractal which occupies less space in compared to other isolation mechanisms in MIMO structures. The simulated and measured results depict that the proposed antenna is convenient for MIMO diversity systems.",

    "abstract": "Storage elasticity on the cloud is a crucial feature in the age of data-intensive computing, especially when considering fluctuations of I/O throughput. In this chapter, the authors explore how to transparently boost the I/O bandwidth during peak utilization to deliver high performance without over-provisioning storage resources. The proposal relies on the idea of leveraging short-lived virtual disks of better performance characteristics (and more expensive) to act during peaks as a caching layer for the persistent virtual disks where the application data is stored during runtime. They show how this idea can be achieved efficiently at the block-device level, using a caching mechanism that leverages iterative behavior and learns from past experience. Second, they introduce a corresponding performance and cost prediction methodology. They demonstrate the benefits of our proposal both for micro-benchmarks and for two real-life applications using large-scale experiments. They conclude with a discussion on how these techniques can be generalized for increasingly complex landscape of modern cloud storage.",

By evenly distributing the dynamic local workload across all the nodes in the whole cloud, load balancing makes sure that no single node is overwhelmed, and some other nodes are kept idle. Hence, the technique helps to improve the overall performance resource utility of the system which will lead to high user satisfaction and resource utilization ratio. It also ensures the fair and effective distribution of each and every computing resource in the distributed system. Furthermore, the various load balancing techniques prevent the possible bottlenecks of the system created by the load imbalance. Maximization of the throughput, minimization of the response time, and avoidance of the overload are the other major advantages of the load balancing. Above all, by keeping resource consumption at the minimum, the load balancing techniques help to reduce costs.",

There are 36 pairs of (H, G), when H, G represent connected graphs on four vertices (as there are only 6 non-isomorphic connected graphs on four vertices). In this chapter, the authors find mj (H, G) exhaustively for all such pairs in the tripartite case j=3, and in the quadpartite case j=4, excluding the case m4 (K4,K4). In this case, the only known result is that m4 (K4,K4) is greater than or equal to 4, since no upper bound has been found as yet.",

The rules of chess specify that in one move a queen can advance any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as long as there are no other chess pieces in its way. In 1850 enthusiasts who studied the problem came to the correct conclusion that all the squares in an 8 x 8 chessboard can be dominated by five queens and five is the minimum such number. With very few exceptions (Rooks, Bishops), these problems still remain unsolved today. Let G = (V,E) be a graph. A set S ⊂ V is a dominating set of G if every vertex in V–S is adjacent to some vertex in D. The domination number γ(G) of G is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set.",

The simulations were then carried out using ABAQUS CAE by exciting the fundamental A0 Lamb mode in the frequency 300 kHz. The delamination was then estimated by analyzing the signal picked up at two sensors using two techniques: Two Dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2D-FFT) to identify the propagating and converted modes, and Wavelet Transform (WT) to measure the arrival times. The results showed that the mode A0 is sensible to symmetric and asymmetric delamination. Besides, based on signal changes with the delamination edges, a localization method is proposed to estimate the position and the length of the delamination. In the last section, an experimental FEM verification is provided to validate the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a gathering of sensor hubs that powerfully self-sort themselves into a wireless system without the use of any previous framework. One of the serious issues in WSNs is the energy consumption, whereby the system lifetime is subject to this factor. Energy-efficient routing is viewed as the most testing errand. Sensor organizes for the most part work in perplexing and dynamic situations and directing winds up repetitive assignment to keep up as the system measure increments. This chapter portrays the structure of wireless sensor network the analysis and study of different research works identified with energy-efficient routing in wireless sensor networks. Along these lines, to beat all the routing issues, the pattern has moved to biological-based algorithms like swarm intelligence-based strategies. Ant colony optimization-based routing protocols have shown outstanding outcomes as far as execution when connected to WSN routing.",

Auditing sector serves as a means of verification to protect investors from making decisions based on inaccurate information. However, auditors can use their superior information for extracting additional rents. This study explores an economy where entrepreneurs choose their financial reporting quality considering incentives imposed by the society, and rent-seeking auditors may manipulate their reports to extract gains in the expense of public interest. The analysis captures the dynamics of strategy changes among different actors by introducing a population game framework. The steady-state equilibrium analysis shows that there is a pure state and mixed states whose stability is affected by policy parameters such as subsidies, taxes, competitive auditor fee, and rate of adjustment of different behavioral dynamics. It appears that corruption in auditing sector and poor quality in financial reporting may arise as a temporally persistent outcome.",

This is because electronics consume similar amounts of power during the idling state as compared to the active state, resulting in low power efficiency of the application. Thus, power consumption is affected by the modes of the electronic operations. Different electronics also have their own types of settings that can be configured to reduce the power consumption, and this will be further investigated in this study. This chapter will address the issue of how to create a power-saving IoT application by applying power-saving schemes and creating an accurate model to predict the battery lifetime of the IoT application.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, carbon nanotube (CNT) emerged as one of the promising materials that shows various advantages over silicon material (e.g., aggressive channel length scaling due to absence of mobility degradation, variable bandgap with single material, ultra-thin body device that is possible due to smaller diameter [1-3nm], and compatibility of CNT with high-k materials resulting in high ION). Moreover, CNTs show both metallic and semiconducting properties; hence, by using metallic CNTs, interconnects can be realized to fabricate a circuit purely consisting of CNTs. This chapter will provide introduction to carbon nanotubes field effect transistor (CNTFETs) starting from material properties of carbon nanotubes and followed by how it can be used as semiconductor channel in field effect transistor (MOSFET) to form CNTFET. The different types of CNTFETs will be discussed based on the type of CNT used along with their advantages and disadvantages.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, as computer systems are expected to be intelligent, techniques that help modern applications to understand human languages are in much demand. Amongst all the techniques, the latent semantic models are the most important. They exploit the latent semantics of lexicons and concepts of human languages and transform them into tractable and machine-understandable numerical representations. Without that, languages are nothing but combinations of meaningless symbols for the machine. To provide such learning representation, embedding models for knowledge graphs have attracted much attention in recent years since they intuitively transform important concepts and entities in human languages into vector representations, and realize relational inferences among them via simple vector calculation. Such novel techniques have effectively resolved a few tasks like knowledge graph completion and link prediction, and show the great potential to be incorporated into more natural language processing (NLP) applications.",

To improve the accuracy of classification, a semantic similarity approach of a question along with the question dataset is calculated. The semantic similarity of the question is initially achieved by syntactic parsing to extract the noun, verb, adverb, and adjective. However, adjectives and adverbs do give sentences an exact meaning that should also be considered for computing the semantic similarity. The proposed RLQC (Register Linear and Question Classification) model for semantic similarity of questions uses HSO (Hirst and St. Onge) measure with Gloss based measure to enhance the semantic similarity relatedness by considering the Noun, Verb, Adverb and Adjective. The semantic similarity of the question pairs for RLQC is 0.2% higher compared to HSO model. The highest semantic similarity of the proposed model achieves a better accuracy.",

The growth and freedom of social media has facilitated the dissemination of positive and negative ideas. Proponents of hate speech are one of the key abusers of the privileges allotted by social media, and the companies behind these networks have a vested interest in identifying such speech. Manual moderation is too cumbersome and slow to deal with the torrent of content generation on these social media sites, which is why many have turned to machine learning. Neural network applications in this area have been very promising and yielded positive results. However, there are newly discovered and unaddressed problems with the current state of hate speech detection. Authors' survey identifies the key techniques and methods used in identifying hate speech, and they discuss promising new directions for the field as well as newly identified issues.",

Data mining extracts the interesting information from huge volumes of data. Association rule (AR) mining is one of the core areas of data mining where interesting information is extracted in the form of rules. Traditional AR mining is incapable of handling uncertain situations. In order to handle uncertainty, mathematical tools like vague theory can be utilized with AR mining methodologies for the development of novel vague theory based algorithms, which will be more suitable in effectively handling vague situations that helps framing effective selling strategy. Since an organization can't analyze the huge rule set obtained from these algorithms, every resultant rule should have a certain ratio of factors customized to the interest of the organization that can be achieved through optimization algorithms.

Total energy loss index (TELI) is formulated as the main objective function and meanwhile bus voltage deviations and PV penetrations of B-SSPV plants are calculated. To deal the stochastic behavior of solar irradiance, 15 years of weather data is modeled by using beta probability density function (Beta-PDF). The proposed algorithm is applied on IEEE 33 bus and IEEE 69 bus test distribution networks and optimum results are acquired for different time varying voltage dependent load models. From the results, it is known that, compared to PV only, the integration of B-SSPV plants in the distribution networks resulted in higher penetration levels in distribution networks. The proposed algorithm was very effective in terms of determining the sizes of the PV plant and the battery storage, and for the charging and discharging of the battery storage.",

Thus, smartphones are gradually replacing our desktops as they increasingly become cheaper and more powerful with excellent multimedia processing support. As mobile users go about their routines, they continuously browse the web, seeking interesting content to consume, and also uploading personal content. However, users encounter huge volume of content that does not match their preferences, resulting in mobile information overload. Context-aware media personalization (CAMP) was proposed as a solution to this problem. CAMP assists users to select relevant content among alternatives considering users' preferences and contexts. This solution, however, are limited to static contexts. The contribution is mobile context-aware media personalization (MobCAMP), which is a special kind of personalization that utilizes users' contexts and activities to suggest media content according to the user's tastes and contextual situations.",

Security constraints such as thermal limits of transmission lines and bus voltage limits must be satisfied under any operating point in order to deliver reliable power to the consumers. One of the best alternative solutions of improvement of the security of power system is the use of flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices. FACTS devices can be used to limit the power flow on the overloaded line and to increase the use of alternative paths to improve power transmission capacity. This chapter briefly describes all three categories of FACTS devices, namely shunt controllers (static synchronous compensator, static var compensator, thyristor-controlled reactor, thyristor switched reactor, thyristor switched capacitor), series controllers (static synchronous series compensator, thyristor controlled series capacitor, thyristor-controlled series reactor), and combined series-shunt controllers (unified power flow controller).",

From healthcare to manufacturing to space missions, these systems are typically conceived to perform dangerous or critical tasks. The nature of such tasks (e.g., surgery operations or radioactive waste clean-up) places high demands on the dependability of robotics systems. Fault tree analysis is among the most often used dependability assessment techniques in various domains of robotics. However, fault tree analysis of cost-effective fault tolerant robotics systems requires compositional synthesis of fault trees extended with the expressive power to allow analyzing the sequential dependencies among the components. Thereafter, a relevant experience from the automotive domain is presented. This consists mainly of a suitable synthesis approach that computes expressions of global failure conditions from the dysfunctional behavior local to the components. The benefits of the approach to dependability analysis of robotics architectures are highlighted by using a fault-tolerant example system.",

The authors are interested in a fingerprint matching method using contactless images for fingerprint verification. After features extraction, they compute Euclidean distances between template minutiae (bifurcation and ending points) and input image minutiae. They compute then after bifurcation ridges orientation angles and ending point orientations. In the decision stage, they analyze the similarity between templates. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a set of 420 fingerprint images. The verification accuracy is found to be acceptable and the experimental results are promising. Future work will enhance the proposed verification method by a new template protection technique.",

    "abstract": "Chapter 5 explores the use of distributed ledger technologies in cities to help improve citizen-centric services: land registries, health care, welfare payments, identity, supply chains, and voting. McKinsey analysts predict that by 2020 the number of smart cities will reach 600 worldwide, and 5 years later almost 60% of the world's GDP will be produced in them. Digital technologies could become an engine of economic progress, and Blockchain could be one of those technologies. This connectivity, however, comes at a cost. How will cybersecurity evolve with Web 3.0 and 4.0 technologies to protect cities from cyber-attacks? This chapter introduces how Blockchains may be used to resolve a range of city-based challenges arising from broader global concerns like national population increases, urban density, anthropomorphic climate change, urban pollution and mobility, local and national citizen services, and infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "The research on gate control work presents the concept of regulating the flow of water by controlling the dam gates or shutters using servo-motors in order to manage the dam water level. Water level control and insufficient water supply are the major challenges at the hydropower company (HDPC). The system at this dam site consists of the outlet works tower with four outlet penstocks that collects water to the main discharge outlet. The automation implements the electronic control system that uses the programmable logic controller (PLC) and the optical level sensors to detect water level. For the new design, the power screw hoist mechanism is used to open and close the gate of weight 600N with the efficiency of 35.4% of the square thread screw. The gate takes 160 seconds to travel a vertical distance of 600mm in its guide, to fully open and close the 400mm penstock diameter. Mat-lab Simulink was used to control the electronic system for stability to avoid vibrations and fluctuation of speed.",

Decimal multiplication is a fundamental operation utilized in many algorithms, and it is referred in the standard IEEE-754 2008. Decimal multiplication has an inherent difficulty associated with the representation of decimal numbers using a binary number system. Both bit and digit carries, as well as invalid results, must be considered in decimal multiplication in order to produce the correct result.

The methodology consisted in acquiring by a 3D laser scanner or coordinate measuring machine (CMM) and in some small complex items using a 3D photogrammetry scanner. These data were transferred first as a CAD or SolidWorks® geometry and subsequently transferred to domains geometry useful for ANSYS or COMSOL simulation software. These models with high-resolution brings the simulations closer to real prototypes. As a source of direct information from the prototypes, thermal images obtained using a thermographic camera were taken. Also, wireless sensors were installed for temperature and humidity monitoring. The analyses of the energy efficiencies of both prototypes were performed.",

When using such apps, many users trustfully log everything from diet to sleep patterns. Studies suggest that many applications do not have a privacy policy, or users do not have access to an app's permissions before s/he downloads it to the mobile device. This raises questions regarding the ethics around sharing personal data gathered from health and fitness apps to third parties. Despite the important role of informed consent in the creation of health and fitness mobile applications, the intersection of ethics and sharing of personal information is understudied and is an often-ignored topic during the creation of mobile applications. After reviewing the online privacy policies of four mobile health and fitness apps, this chapter concludes with a set of recommendations when designing privacy policies to share personal information collected from health and fitness apps.",

Cloud computing offers these resources as a service, namely infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and software-as-a-service. To use these services, two roles involved: the cloud provider offers the service and the cloud customer consumes the service. These resources are efficiently shared and utilized by customers and it is called workload. The requirement of workload depends on customer demands that vary from higher to lower. Based on the customer demand, cloud provider makes the resource available efficiently. In the context of cloud, the workload is based on web-based service or jobs processed in batch mode. The arrival process of jobs in the cloud is not often deterministic. The irregular increase or decrease in workload has a vital impact on resource provision. Monitoring the resources helps in measuring the performance of the cloud so that the resource can be provisioned to customers efficiently.",

This chapter takes cone-type insulator as research object and then finds the characteristics of flashover, surface charge accumulation, and the interface electric field regulation (IER) of epoxy (EP)-/graphene (GR)-coated insulator. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the uniform surface charge of monopole is conducive by reduce peak field and flashover voltage. Among them, that of 0.1% EP/GR possesses the highest flashover voltage. With the SiC content and coating thickness enhancement of IER insulator, the electric field regulation of EP/SiC-coated insulator becomes notable, due to energy loss and increasing leakage current. The results show that insulator coated by EP/SiC can reach higher flashover voltage than uncoated insulator and enhanced SiC content contributes to improve the flashover voltage.",

Then, attach each interval, instead of a word, with an inverted sub-list. In this way, both set intersection and union can be conducted by performing a series of simple interval containment checks. Experiments have been conducted, which shows that the new index is promising. Also, how to maintain indices, when inserting or deleting documents, is discussed in great detail.",

The notion of software literacy is emerging as one way to conceptualize the repertoires of skills and understandings needed for people to be critical and creative users of software packages and systems in a software saturated culture. This conceptual model is a response to current digital literacy frameworks which do not identify the implications of the choice of software on what can be achieved. Studies on information literacy and on ways of mastering software have tended to ignore the role of software itself. The study of software is only now emerging as a field of study. This contribution argues for the relevancy of software literacy as part of understanding the ways people engage with software and how its affordances influences knowledge representation, generation, and critique. It will define the term and set out three progressive tiers of development towards software literacy.",

    "abstract": "People's anger has also given rise to controversy on the internet in Japan and is often linked with the issue of “flaming.” Thus, this chapter focuses on the expression and sharing of anger on the internet in Japan by providing examples. It also covers the results of large-scale studies that have been conducted in recent years and analyzes the traits of those who participate in flaming. The authors cover the problems of expression of anger on the internet in terms of social sharing of emotion. Through these arguments, the authors list the results of studies done in Japan that ask what should be done to control anger. In addition, they discuss what we should be focusing on when expressing emotions of anger and their experiences on the internet.",

    "abstract": "The chapter is based on fuzzy logic approaches to machinery failure analysis. Six companies and organisations were used as model validation case studies. At a platinum mining company, the research was based on the root cause analysis technique. The objective was to determine the major causes of failure of the pebble crusher, to estimate between the major crusher failures, and to provide suitable solutions that included the optimization of the crushing circuit. The second application was done on beverages manufacturing companies focusing on the bottle washing process. The third company used a reactive and firefighting maintenance strategy which resulted in frequent catastrophic breakdowns, ever increasing maintenance costs, and long, unplanned plant shutdowns. The fourth was done for a hydropower generation company. The dynamic characteristics of these systems are nonlinear and difficult to predict. The fifth case study application focused on the water gate control and avoidance of its failure. The sixth and final case study application was at a thermal power generation company.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important points for more effective use in the environment of cloud is undoubtedly the study of reliability and robustness of services related to this environment. In this case, fault tolerance is necessary to ensure that reliability and reduce the SLA violation. Checkpointing is a popular fault tolerance technique in large-scale systems. However, its major disadvantage is the overhead caused by the storage time of checkpointing files, which increases the execution time and minimizes the possibility to meet the desired deadlines. In this chapter, the authors propose a checkpointing strategy with lightweight storage. The storage is provided by creating a virtual topology VRbIO and the use of an intelligent and fault tolerant I/O technique CSDS (collective and selective data sieving). The proposal is executed by active and reactive agents and it solves many problems of checkpointing with standard I/O. To evaluate the approach, the authors compare it with a checkpointing with ROMIO as I/O strategy. Experimental results show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach.",

Several schemes have been developed that enable the IP network to provide such guarantees.

The semantic intelligence naturally arises in the setting of concept of boundedness where it commences from highly non-trivial interplay between structural and functional properties of a complex system. The major generic property of that interplay is that it renders the relation between structural and functional properties to be non-recursive. In result, this renders the efficiency of semantic intelligence to be provided by efficiency of hierarchical self-organization of a complex system prior to the efficiency of software and to the speed of hardware.",

Besides performance, reconfigurable hardware devices also achieve lower power consumption compared to general-purpose processors.

However, ASICs are not reconfigurable, turning them application specific. Reconfigurable logic becomes a major advantage when hardware flexibility permits to speed up whatever the application with the same hardware module. The first and most common devices utilized for reconfigurable computing are fine-grained FPGAs with a large hardware flexibility. To reduce the performance and area overhead associated with the reconfigurability, coarse-grained reconfigurable solutions has been proposed as a way to achieve better performance and lower power consumption.

The authors repeat the above procedure for the entire network session to determine the sequence of longest-living instances of the mobile graphs and the corresponding instances of the topology of interest such that the number of topology transitions is the global minimum.

    "abstract": "The phrase “open source” is not something often heard in everyday conversation. However, the idea of downloadable, free software, particularly mobile applications, or “apps,” has become quite commonplace. Individuals often download free products, grateful that they are available and will potentially work well, without thinking where they originate or why they even exist. Not so long ago, most things associated with computers available to the general population came at a cost and were available from only a few vendors. This is no longer the case thanks to the ever-increasing availability and popularity of open source software, operating systems, and applications.",

    "abstract": "A facility for generating sequences of pseudorandom numbers is a fundamental part of computer simulation systems. Furthermore, multiple independent streams of random numbers are often required in simulation studies, for instance, to facilitate synchronization for variance-reduction purposes, and for making independent replications. A portable set of software utilities is described for uniform random-number generation. It provides for multiple generators (streams) running simultaneously, and each generator (stream) has its sequence of numbers partitioned into many long disjoint contiguous substreams. Simple procedure calls allow the user to make any generator “jump” ahead/back v steps (random numbers). Implementation issues are discussed. An efficient and portable code is also provided to implement the package. The basic underlying generator CMRG (combined multiple recursive generator) combines two multiple recursive random number generators with a period length of approximately 2191 (≈ 3.1× 1057), good speed, and excellent theoretical properties.",

By studying the surface discharge behavior of the nanocomposites under different operating temperature, it is helpful to improve the creeping voltage of epoxy resin. Polypropylene is a kind of material which is usually chosen to build film capacitors. The effects of voltage form on surface charge and discharge behavior were studied. Furthermore, a modification method of a polypropylene film which can suppress surface charge accumulation is proposed. Polypropylene also has great application potential in HVDC cable insulation, provided that its toughness is to be overcome. Different mass fractions of ULDPE and graphene were added to polypropylen to improve mechanical and insulating properties, respectively. Studies on the DC conductivity, space charge behavior, trap level distribution, and breakdown strength of the new material were carried out.",

This is a non-contact, non-invasive, and radiation-free technique that is mostly used to analyze the back shape of a human body. The most practical aspect of raster-stereography is ease in its apparatus setup and reduced exposure to x-rays. Another very important and effective application is to identify the human faces that can be used in security domain. The problem of breaking lines was observed while traversing the distorted raster pattern on the human body. These breaks in raster pattern increased significantly when projected on the face. Computationally, it becomes difficult to extract all valid curvatures of the human face. This problem was resolved using a modified dotted raster, and the noise effect was reduced substantially. The dotted raster technique proved that it is by far the best option when compared with the conventional line grid.",

Cloud providers maintain large-scale data centers to offer storage and computational resources in the form of virtual machines instances. They offer different pricing plans: reservation, on-demand, and spot pricing. For obtaining optimal integration charging strategy, revenue sharing, cost sharing, wholesale price is applied frequently. The vertically integrated content provider's incentives for cloud migration can induce significant complexity in integration contracts, and consequently improvements in costs and requests' rejection rate.",

The objective is to determine if recent data confirms the conclusion that engaging in a cell phone conversation does not increase crash risk beyond that of driving without engaging in a cell phone conversation. In particular, a recent estimate is presented of the relative crash risk for cell phone conversation in the strategic highway research program 2 (SHRP2) naturalistic driving study data. This estimate is compared with five other estimates in a meta-analysis, which shows that cell phone conversation reduces crash risk (i.e., has a protective effect). A recent experimental study will also be discussed, which supports the hypothesis that driver self-regulation gives rise to the protective effect by compensating for the slight delays in event response times during cell phone conversation.",

Under the action of this complicated electric field, the oil-paper insulation of the valve-side bushing of the converter transformer is prone to electric field distortion due to charge accumulation, which causes a surface discharge, which will seriously cause the edge breakdown. At the same time, since the temperature in the converter transformer rises due to a large amount of loss during the operation of the transformer, creeping discharge is more likely to occur under the electrothermal composite field. Hence, it is significant to carry out research on the surface discharge characteristics of the oil-paper insulation on the valve side of the converter transformer under the electrothermal composite field.",

The negative phase constant results in a negative phase velocity and negative index of refraction in the medium. Complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) as a valuable metamaterial component is illustrated. The resonant frequencies of the CSRR are associated with the features of their arrangements.

The main problem is that the pneumatic valve of the bottle washer that controls the discharge of clean bottles sometimes sticks or fails, which results in significant loss of production since this is a bottleneck operation. The main causes of failure were found to be the temperature and pressure, which often fell outside the required ranges, and minor contributions to failure due to moisture and abrasive particles. In order to solve this problem, a model reference adaptive fuzzy controller was designed for the pneumatic valve using the MATLAB software. The model reference adaptive control (MRAC) system consists of the reference model that has the desired output of the system. The error resulting from the difference between the actual system output and that of the reference model is executed by the fuzzy logic controller (FLC).

    "abstract": "Parallel computation is widely employed in scientific researches, engineering activities, and product development. Parallel program writing itself is not always a simple task depending on problems solved. Large-scale scientific computing, huge data analyses, and precise visualizations, for example, would require parallel computations, and the parallel computing needs the parallelization techniques. In this chapter, a parallel program generation support is discussed, and a computer-assisted parallel program generation system, P-NCAS, is introduced. Computer-assisted problem solving is one of key methods to promote innovations in science and engineering, and contributes to enrich our society and our life toward a programming-free environment in computing science. Problem-solving environments (PSE) research activities started to enhance the programming power in 1970s. The P-NCAS is one of the PSEs; the PSE concept provides an integrated human-friendly computational software and hardware system to solve a target class of problems.",

BYOD-based technology and its applications have numerous benefits, but they can be difficult to implement. They usually result in lower costs for the business, but they often require the organization to adapt. Since there are so many constraints and situations that could inhibit the security of the business, some businesses are hesitant to use BYOD in their business.",

Included are a survey of current views and history of randomness, relevant concepts of whether something exists (ontology), how we know (epistemology), entropy, foundations of order, statistics, prediction, time, and scientific methods. Randomness is tied to determinism, and determinism becomes an issue of free will. Thus, discussions of free will cycle back to whether everything is laid out before us, but this is controversial, at best. We may only act as though there is randomness, similar to acting as though there were free will, even after being told that the universe, indeed, may be deterministic. Such a method is comparable to doing a logic proof in drawing an assumption line and displaying the consequences. Alternate worlds are referenced in which randomness may be seen in a different light.",

    "abstract": "This chapter develops a methodology for solving fully fuzzified multi-objective chance constrained programming (CCP) problems with fuzzy random variables (FRVs) as parameters. In the preceding chapters, it is assumed that the parameters of the multi-objective programming models are uncertain, and these uncertain parameters are expressed through fuzzy numbers (FNs) and FRVs. However, in practical situations, it is also observed that not only the parameters but also the variables of the multi-objective programming problems are uncertain. From that view point, the methodology for solving fully fuzzified multi-objective stochastic programming problems are presented in this chapter. At first the fuzzy probabilistic constraints are modified into fuzzy constraints. Using the defuzzification method of FNs, the different fuzzy parameters and fuzzy variables in the constraints are converted into crisp equivalent parameters and crisp variables. In this chapter, the parameters of the objectives are considered as either symmetric trapezoidal FNs or FRVs whose mean and variances are taken as symmetric trapezoidal FNs. If the parameters of the objectives are FRVs, then expectation model and variance model of the objective is used to find an equivalent form of the objectives whose parameters are only FNs. The ranking function of FNs is then applied to the objectives to convert them into crisp objectives. Then each objective is solved independently under the modified system constraints to construct the membership goals of each objective. Finally, weighted fuzzy goal programming (FGP) model is applied to achieve the most satisfactory solution for the overall benefit of the organization. Two illustrative numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology and to compare the solution obtained by the developed methodology with the pre-defined techniques.",

For most database applications, changing the schema of the database without loss of existing data is a significant challenge: it is usually a time-consuming and error-prone task which must be done carefully. In the literature, schema evolution has been defined as the modality for the management of schema changes which relieves database programmers and administrators from this burden, by automatically recovering extant data and possibly adapting them to the new schema.

Based and derived on Lyapunov stabilization arguments of fractional-order systems, the stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is investigated. The design and multiobjective optimization of Fo-PDF control law is theoretically rigorous and presents a powerful and simple approach to provide a reasonable tradeoff between simplicity, numerical accuracy, and stability analysis in control and synchronization of FoCS. The feasibility and validity of this developed Fo-PDF scheme have been illustrated by numerical simulations using the fractional-order Mathieu-Van Der Pol hyperchaotic system.",

The security and low power consumption of IBC are also apparent in this model. The path loss characterization of IBC implants shows lower values compared to their MICS counterparts. In addition, the chapter also elaborates on the use of human body as antenna. A scenario where an RF current is fed by a tiny toriodal inductor clamped around tissues in the ankle is studied. The frequency range of 1-70 MHz is considered. Theoretical results show that the system has a maximum gain of - 25 dB between 20 to 40 MHz, assuming an isotropic radiation from human body.

    "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the use of data analytics to satisfy the accountability demands (summative evaluation) of higher education, while contributing to faculty and staff development in the process (formative evaluation). By situating the data analytics process within a strategic questioning framework, the inquiry has focused on the evaluation of the impact of the programs and services provided by an academic development center at a large research university in the United States. The analytics data, primary findings, have been critiqued and incorporated to enhance further staff and professional development at the center. The findings have also been benchmarked with relevant analytics data from other academic development centers in Europe and Australasia to provide comparative performance measures. The key contribution of the use of data analytics to academic development is its potential to catalyze a data-driven culture that would adequately respond to the 21st century accountability ethos of higher education with systematic, valid, and useful impact/performance measures.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, a fuzzy stochastic multi-objective programming model is presented for planning proper allocation of agricultural lands in hybrid uncertain environment so that optimal production of several seasonal crops in a planning year can be achieved. In India, demands of various seasonal crops are gradually increasing due to rapid growth of population, whereas agricultural lands are gradually decreasing due to urbanization. Therefore, it is a huge challenge to the planners to balance this situation by proper planning for the utilization of agricultural lands and resources. From that viewpoint, the methodology is developed in this chapter. To make the model more realistic, the resource parameters incorporated with the problem are considered either in the form of fuzzy numbers (FNs) or random variables having fuzzy parameters. The two main objectives of this agricultural land allocation model are considered as maximizing the production of seasonal agricultural crops and minimizing the total expenditure by utilizing total cultivable lands in a planning period. These objectives are optimized based on the constraints: land utilization, machine-hours, man-days, fertilizer requirements, water supply, etc. As the parameters associated with the constraints are imprecise and uncertain in nature, the constraints are represented using either FN or fuzzy random variables (FRVs). The reasons behind the consideration of fuzzy constraints or fuzzy chance constraints (i.e., the reason for considering the parameters associated with the constraints as FNs or FRVs in the model) are clarified in detail. As a study region, the District Nadia, West Bengal, India is taken into account for allocation of land. To illustrate the potential use of the approach, the model solutions are compared with the existing land allocation of the district.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, two methodologies for solving multi-objective linear fractional stochastic programming problems containing fuzzy numbers (FNs) and fuzzy random variables (FRVs) associated with the system constraints are developed. In the model formulation process, the fuzzy probabilistic constraints are converted into equivalent fuzzy constraints by applying chance constrained programming (CCP) technique in a fuzzily defined probabilistic decision-making situation. Then two techniques, -cut and defuzzification methods, are used to convert the model into the corresponding deterministic model. In the method of using -cut for FNs, the tolerance level of FNs is considered, and the constraints are reduced to constraints with interval coefficients. Alternatively, in using defuzzification method, FNs are replaced by their defuzzified values. Consequently, the constraints are modified into constraints in deterministic form. In the next step, the constraints with interval coefficients are customized into its equivalent form by using the convex combination of each interval. If the parameters of the objectives are triangular FNs, then on the basis of their tolerance ranges each objective is decomposed into three objectives with crisp coefficients. Then each objective is solved independently to find their best and worst values and those values are used to construct membership function of each objective. Finally, the compromise solution of multi-objective linear fractional CCP problems is obtained by applying any of the approaches: priority-based fuzzy goal programming (FGP) method, Zimmermann's approach, -connective process, or minimum bounded sum operator technique. To demonstrate the efficiency of the above-described techniques, two illustrative examples, studied previously, are solved, and the solutions are compared with the existing methodology.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter, fuzzy goal programming (FGP) technique is presented to solve fuzzy multi-objective chance constrained programming (CCP) problems having parameters associated with the system constrains following different continuous probability distributions. Also, the parameters of the models are presented in the form of crisp numbers or fuzzy numbers (FNs) or fuzzy random variables (FRVs). In model formulation process, the imprecise probabilistic problem is converted into an equivalent fuzzy programming model by applying CCP methodology and the concept of cuts of FNs, successively. If the parameters of the objectives are in the form of FRVs then expectation model of the objectives are employed to remove the probabilistic nature from multiple objectives. Afterwards, considering the fuzzy nature of the parameters involved with the problem, the model is converted into an equivalent crisp model using two different approaches. The problem can either be decomposed on the basis of tolerance values of the parameters; alternatively, an equivalent deterministic model can be obtained by applying different defuzzification techniques of FNs. In the solution process, the individual optimal value of each objective is found in isolation to construct the fuzzy goals of the objectives. Then the fuzzy goals are transformed into membership goals on the basis of optimum values of each objective. Then priority-based FGP under different priority structures or weighted FGP is used for achievement of the highest membership degree to the extent possible to achieve the ideal point dependent solution in the decision-making context. Finally, several numerical examples considering different types of probability distributions and different forms of FNs are considered to illustrate the developed methodologies elaborately.",

Kinematic—a fundamental and foremost design step—acts as the lynchpin of performance of a surgical robot. It plays a decisive role and defines the capabilities and viability of a robot vis-à-vis its application.

To study the thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties of the samples, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) testing, tensile testing, breakdown, and conductivity property were measured separately. Besides, the space charge behavior based on the PEA method was studied, and the carrier mobility was calculated by the space charge depolarization process. The experimental results indicate that PE modified by graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles and the voltage stabilizers demonstrate the suppression of space charge accumulation in PE insulation, which has less space charge accumulation than pure PE. The results show that graphene oxide and the preferred stabilizer have broad prospects in HVDC cable applications.",

Major failures were investigated including the breaking of the main shaft, bearing failure, and also entry of tramp iron in the crushing chamber. In solving these problems, analysis of stresses was done using solid works 2015, and condition monitoring techniques were applied using MATLAB 2015 to investigate the development of the crack in the shaft. The results showed that EN 19 has better physical properties than EN 9 and EN 26. EN 19 was recommended for the construction of the main shaft. Crack detection prediction by using MATLAB can be complemented and validated by the use of non-destructive testing.",

Increasing a sense of social connectedness encourages healthier emotional wellbeing among people, reducing potential feelings of isolation and chances of faster recovery from illness. Mobile social media access, participation, and messaging, be it face-to-face, peer-to-peer, group, or virtual, through intentional and unintentional social connectedness, may aid the improvement and performance among workers, students, and campaigns. Mobile engagement also offers possible improvement in performance and enhanced perceptions of emotional wellbeing. Engagement through social media networks, mostly accessed via mobile, including mobile gaming, or health monitoring, commenting or posting photos or short texts, increases the production and value of successful maintenance of reciprocal interpersonal relationships.",

One of the reasons for this success has to do with the synergy derived by the computational intelligent components, such as machine learning, fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms, or other intelligent algorithms and techniques. Each of the partial methodologies provides hybrid systems with complementary reasoning and searching methods that allow the use of domain knowledge and empirical data to solve complex problems.

    "abstract": "With rising urbanization and change in lifestyle and food habits of human beings, the amount of municipal solid wastes (MSWs) are now being increasing day by day, and the composition of wastes are now also being changed. Therefore, it is now becoming essential to develop a consistent mathematical model for managing those wastes in a systematic manner. In this context, fuzzy chance constrained programming (FCCP) model becomes useful to handle wastes efficiently through the process of selecting sorting stations, treatment facilities, etc. through an efficient way so that the net system cost of sorting and transporting the wastes would be minimized, and the revenue generated from different sorting stations and different treatment facilities would be to maximized. From that view point, in this chapter, a fuzzy chance constrained programming (CCP) model is developed for MSW management. Most of the parameters involved with this model are imprecisely defined and probabilistically uncertain. So, the parameters of the objectives are considered as FNs, and the right side parameters of the probabilistic constraints involve normally distributed fuzzy random variables (FRVs). To resolve the cases arising due to the multiple occurrences of fuzzy goals, a fuzzy goal programming (FGP) has been adopted. To expound the potential use of the approach, a modified version of a case example, studied previously, is considered and solved. The achieved model solution is discussed elaborately to illustrate the proposed methodology for MSW management.",

The necessary control conditions and rules to ensure that the control system is well-defined, including synchronization and conflict resolution, are provided as a conceptual model of machine task. Due to hierarchical decomposition of Petri net models, the structure of the whole control system as well as the contents of each machine task is easily understood so that the task planning, monitoring, and modification of the control system can be done effectively.",

    "abstract": "This chapter presents solution procedures for solving unbalanced multi-objective multi-choice stochastic transportation problems in a hybrid fuzzy uncertain environment. In this chapter, various types of unbalanced multi-objective fuzzy stochastic transportation models are considered with the assumption that the parameters representing supplies of the products at the origins and demands of the products at the destinations, capacity of the conveyances, associated with the system constraints are either fuzzy numbers (FNs) or fuzzy random variables (FRVs) with some known continuous fuzzy probability distributions. The multi-choice cost parameters are considered as FNs. In this chapter, two objectives are considered: total transportation cost and total transportation time. As the transportation cost mainly depends on fuel prices and since fuel prices are highly fluctuating, the cost parameters are taken as multi-choice cost parameters with possibilistic uncertain nature. The time of transportation mainly depends on vehicle conditions, quality of roads, and road congestion. Due to these uncertain natures, the parameters representing time of transportation are also taken as fuzzy uncertain multi-choice parameters. In this transportation model, these objectives are minimized satisfying the constraints: product availability constraints, requirement of the product constraints, and capacity of the conveyance constraints. Numerical examples are provided for the sake of illustration of the methodology presented in this chapter, and also achieved solutions are compared with the solutions obtained by some existing methodologies to establish its effectiveness.",

Therefore, knowing the current state of mobile devices and predicting their future states is a crucial issue in different domains, such as context-aware applications or ad-hoc networking. Several authors have proposed to use different machine learning methods for predicting some aspect of mobile devices' future states. This chapter aims at predicting mobile devices' battery charge, whether it is plugged to A/C, and screen and WiFi state. To fulfil this goal, the current state of a mobile device can be regarded as the consequence of the previous sequence of states, meaning that future states can be predicted by known previous ones. This chapter focuses on using recurrent neural networks for predicting future states.",

These include computer-mediated communication, community informatics, knowledge management, and internet marketing. Definitions from seminal research studies in these domains are subsequently synthesized to propose an interdisciplinary socio‐technical definition of VCs.

Based on the review, limitations of the current assessment are highlighted. It is argued that the existing method is inconsistent with the problem-solving nature of the software and is unable to assess students with high ability and advanced drawing skills. Recommendation and improvement directions are suggested in the chapter to optimize the quality of assessment. Other subjects which also involve assessment of computer skills and design may also benefit from the recommendations.",

Technology commercialization and detecting markets at an early stage of technology development have been considered in the research on technology management in recent years; however, all technologies, when it comes to the market, need to be embedded in sustainable business models. The research and concepts of business model innovations might offer support to identify market gaps which fit emerging technology and define requirements for its development; hence, the diffusion rate for new technology, as well as its scope for competitive advantage, can be increased. This chapter elaborates three main steps for developing new business models for emergent technologies through the management of technologies and influencing their development at an early stage.",

The direct current conductivity, breakdown strength, trap level distribution, space charge distribution, and charge mobility of nanocomposites were investigated. The experimental results show that the interface region between graphene and polymer introduces many deep traps in the forbidden band of nanocomposites, which can reduce the trapping process of charge and inhibit the accumulation of space charge. This indicates that the addition of nanoscale graphene has a significant improvement in the electrical performance of high voltage DC cables, which will provide a reference for production and application.",

Programming is a mathematical methodology to write a program and to encode the algorithm into a notation. It can be classified into two groups such as system and application programming. System programming is a branch of the general programming that is composed of low-level instructions which are used to operate and handle computer hardware. Application programming is considered as the improved version of the computer programs that can perform specific tasks. One of the application programming types is the object-oriented programming (OOP) which is about how information is represented in human mind. OOP is useful to provide easy modeling in design and developing real entities. This approach is aimed to model the entities and the relationships existing between them. OOP enables to define the required classes to create the objects and to apply modifications on them. The inherent properties of OOP are modularity, extensibility, and reusability.

Finite impulse response (FIR) filters can provide solutions with guaranteed stability and linear phase. However, the main disadvantage of conventional FIR filter designs is that they become computationally complex, especially in applications demanding narrow transition bandwidths. Therefore, designing FIR filters with very stringent specifications and a low complexity is currently an important challenge. In this chapter, a review of the recent methods to efficiently design low-complexity linear-phase FIR filters is presented. The chapter starts with an introduction to linear-phase FIR digital filters. Then, an overview of the design methods that have been developed in literature to design low-complexity FIR filters is presented. Finally, the most common and recent of these methods along with their corresponding special structures are explained.",

Many group processes influence online discussants' creation of correct, new ideas (micro-creativity) and use of social cues. New ideas, justifications, disagreements, and questions in recent messages facilitate micro-creativity. Moreover, new ideas and justifications tend to reduce both positive and negative social cues during online discussions. While agreements elicit positive social cues, disagreements invite negative ones. Meanwhile, participants with more past posts than others often show more micro-creativity. Together, these mechanisms show how sequences of online messages create a local context that influences participants' correct outcomes and social relationships. By understanding these discussion processes, designers can improve online forum interfaces, and educators can help students participate, cooperate, and learn in online forums more effectively.",

In the preceding chapters, the authors explain about linear, fractional, quadratic programming models with multiple conflicting objectives under fuzzy stochastic environment. But the chance constraints in these chapters are considered independently. However, in practical situations, the decision makers (DMs) face various uncertainties where the chance constraints occur jointly. By considering the above fact, the authors presented a solution methodology for fuzzy stochastic MOLP (FSMOLP) with joint probabilistic constraint following some continuous probability distributions. Like the other chapters, chance constrained programming (CCP) methodology is adopted for handling probabilistic constraints. But the difference is that in the earlier chapters chance constraints are considered independently, whereas in this chapter all the chance constraints are taken jointly. Then the transformed problem involving possibilistic uncertainty is converted into a comparable deterministic problem by using the method of defuzzification of the fuzzy numbers (FNs). Objectives are now solved independently under the set of modified system constraints to obtain the best solution of each objective. Then the membership function for each objective is constructed, and finally, a fuzzy goal programming (FGP) model is developed for the achievement of the highest membership goals to the extent possible by minimizing group regrets in the decision-making context.",

    "abstract": "The development of FACTS devices based on the advance of semiconductor technology opened up new opportunities for controlling the power flow and extending the load ability of the power transmission network. Amongst the various FACTS devices, the UPFC is considered the most versatile FACTS device that can simultaneously control bus voltage and both active and reactive power flow through the transmission line. This chapter discusses the implementation of grey wolf optimization (GWO), teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO), biogeography-based optimization (BBO), krill herd algorithm (KHA), chemical reaction optimization (CRO), and hybrid CRO (HCRO) approaches to find the optimal placement and parameter setting of unified power flow controller (UPFC) to achieve the optimal performance of optimal power flow (OPF) and optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) problems. Two test systems, namely IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 30 with valve-point non-linearity, are considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches.",

For this purpose, a factorial plan 2x2 was developed, and a mobile website, with two different alternatives, was designed especially for the experiment: positive contrast (yellow text on green background) and negative contrast (green text on yellow background). The research was conducted on French consumers. Three-hundred twelve valid responses were collected through online and personal survey questionnaires. Data was analysed using the method of structural equations. The results show the significant effects of mobile website's color contrast on behavioral intentions. Perceived dominance and trust towards the website have positive effects on behavioral intentions, whereas mood has non-significant effects on behavioral intentions.

In this research, the main control parameters in the boiler were identified as coal flows, temperatures in the combustion zone, air-to-fuel ratio and ash content, that is, the percentage of ash in raw coal, and mineral content. These parameters are monitored to avoid clinker formation in the super heater tubes of the boiler. Condition-based maintenance (CBM) approaches were used to monitor the boiler parameters.

    "abstract": "In information systems, not only do data change over time, but also database schemata evolve frequently as a response to evolving application requirements. In the literature, schema evolution and schema versioning are the two techniques that were proposed to support schema changes in a DBMS, without loss of extant data and with continued support of legacy applications. After applying schema changes, schema evolution keeps only the current schema version and retains the data which are adapted to such a schema. On the other hand, each time schema changes are applied, schema versioning creates a new schema version, while preserving old schema versions and their corresponding data. With schema versioning, data access through any schema version is supported, which avoids applications developed with past schemata to become obsolete. The main goal of this chapter is to present the recent research proposals that deal with schema versioning and to discuss the recent advances on schema versioning support in mainstream DBMSs.",

Business rules should be expressed in a form that is as close to the one in which business people perceive the rules. A business rules management system is needed to acquire, store, and allow modification of a business rules database. The rules are then handed over to a rules engine for enactment. The BRMS considered in this chapter uses an antecedent-consequent form for representing rules. These are based in a first order logic. Rules are formed with courses of actions and conditions in rules antecedents and courses of actions in rule consequents. It also introduces notions of state change in the business rule and temporal relation within rule and between different rules. Business rules are structured into atomic, complex, and abstract rules. The business rules are translated into enactment rules and converted to Java.",

In its initial days in the 1990s when object-oriented modeling was at its peak, an agent was treated as a special kind of “object” that had a persistent state and its own thread of execution. But since then, agent-based models have diversified enormously to even open new conceptual insights about the nature of systems in general. This chapter presents a perspective on the disparate ways in which our understanding of agency, as well as computational models of agency, have evolved. Advances in hardware like GPUs that brought neural networks back to life may also similarly infuse new life into agent-based models and pave the way for significant advancements in research on artificial general intelligence (AGI).",

The main problem being targeted in this chapter is that IoT systems are exposed to many structural and behavioral changes due to internal and external factors. This study is about the necessity of having a mechanism that enables IoT systems to perform without breaks or shutdowns regardless of context changes. The solution consists of a contextual dynamic reconfiguration process implemented by a reflexive multilayered architecture. This process is based on the autonomic computing loop. The authors also integrated evolution styles to make reusable the reconfigurations applied on the architecture of the system.

    "abstract": "With the increasing application of web services in our lives, selecting the right web service is becoming unprecedentedly difficult. Indeed, before paying the price of a web service, the customer always tries to make sure of his choice. One of the mechanisms used to put the customer in trust is to make available the opinions of other customers who have already used this web service. In the literature, many solutions for measuring the reputation of web services have been proposed. Unfortunately, they ignore certain aspects that we find important to ensure a more meaningful assessment of the reputation. Firstly, consumers do not always have the same satisfaction criteria, and as a result, they can judge the same web service differently. Thus, without knowing the consumer's preferences, it is almost impossible to give meaning to his opinion. Secondly, the qualities of a web service can be changed over time, and hence, the old ratings are no longer representative. In this chapter, the authors propose a novel reputation computation approach to deal with the problems mentioned above.",

    "abstract": "Access control models (ACM) offers the guarantee that only the qualified users can gain access to the artifacts contained in business processes. Business processes are designed, implemented, and operated using many industrial standards that challenge the interoperation with access control standards. Enterprise engineering (EE) introduces rigorous capabilities to design and implement the essential concepts related with the dynamic of business processes. ACM deals with the systematic design and implementation of dynamic and static access control concepts to qualify the access of the users to the artifacts. This chapter proposes an ontological integration between EE and ACM concepts in order to enable the discussion of access control in the deep structure of the business processes. ACM integrated with EE allow the run-time qualification of the actors while they perform all the business process steps and not only at invocation time. The proposal encompasses business process designed with DEMO ontology and role-based access control concepts using a mathematical model logic description.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy logic has been serving the industry for decades by resolving the ambiguities that appear as a result of imprecise environment. High-stake decision-making processes require inputs from various stakeholders to incorporate. If the risk is high, as in the case of high investment decision making, a robust system of incorporating opinions from multiple stakeholders must be set in place in order to avoid any inconsistency or bad decisions. Fuzzy matrices and arithmetic can play a rescuer in such situations. In this chapter, the authors demonstrate a decision-making framework incorporating the use of fuzzy numbers and arithmetic to make critical decisions in strategic marketing and new product development. Forecasting in the domains of new products is an utmost complex and critical process because no relevant history is available owing to the product's ‘one-of-its-kind' nature. In such cases, computation via analogy is an interesting paradigm, which is also discussed in the chapter.",

The soft set theory has recently gaining significance for finding rational and logical solutions to various real-life problems, which involve uncertainty, impreciseness, and vagueness.

    "abstract": "Traffic volume is an important measurement to design mobility strategies in cities such as traffic light configuration, civil engineering works, and others. This variable can be determined through different manual and automatic strategies. However, some street intersections, such as traffic circles, are difficult to determine their traffic volume and origin-destination matrices. In the case of manual strategies, it is difficult to count every single car in a mid to large-size traffic circle. On the other hand, automatic strategies can be difficult to develop because it is necessary to detect, track, and count vehicles that change position inside an intersection. This chapter presents a vehicle counting method to determine traffic volume and origin-destination matrix for traffic circle intersections using two main algorithms, Viola-Jones for detection and on-line boosting for tracking. The method is validated with an implementation applied to a top view video of a large-size traffic circle. The video is processed manually, and a comparison is presented.",

Techniques for translation of the guest MoC (OpenVX) constructs into the host MoC (VIPE) constructs were proposed. The approach described here leads to the end program that is fully conformant to the host MoC.

However, many gamified applications have failed to meet their objectives, and poor gamification design has been pointed out as a recurrent problem, despite a growing number of gamification frameworks and their valuable guidelines. Model-driven engineering approaches have been proposed as possible solutions to the deficient, and incoherent, inclusion of several dynamics and mechanics. They allow achieving a formalism that can avoid many errors and inconsistencies in the process. Moreover, these efforts are necessary to achieve a conceptualization of gamification that facilitates its inclusion in applications. Three proposals are analyzed, all based on domain-specific languages (DSL), which allows users to design complex gamification strategies without requiring programming skills.

    "abstract": "Software maintenance is an important phase in the lifespan of a software system. This chapter examines the effectiveness of Scrum and Kanban methods in terms of their impacts on project management factors for a software maintenance project. The six-point star model defines project management factors like schedule, scope, budget, risk, resources, quality, and study, and uses two other non-quantitative techniques such as team commitment and work organization. A quantitative survey was carried out together with the questionnaire distributed to IT industry professionals in Sri Lanka. Each question in the questionnaire was related to one of the above factors. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to find the correlation between the coefficients. A strong correlation was identified. Based on the results of multiple linear regression modeling, a model has been proposed. Scrum-based software maintenance projects can improve project quality by managing work organization and resources whereas Kanban-based can improve project quality by controlling the risk and scope of the project.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of distributed applications raises an integration problem that consists in how to satisfy the minimum interoperability requirements while reducing coupling as much as possible. Current integration technologies, such as Web Services and RESTful APIs, solve the interoperability problem but usually entail more coupling than required by the interacting applications. This is caused by sharing data schemas between applications, even if not all features of those schemas are actually exercised. This has its toll in application development agility. This chapter proposes compliance and conformance as the concepts to minimize coupling without impairing interoperability by sharing only the subset of the features of the data schema that are actually used. In addition, data binding between messages and the receiver's schema is done structurally in a universal and application-independent way. This eliminates the need for application-specific stubs and allows clients to use any server with which they comply and servers to replace any server to which they conform.",

To accomplish this goal, the authors write down the left- and the right-handed Weyl equations from first principles in this extended framework. Next, by coupling the two different fractional Weyl sectors by means of a mass parameter, they arrive at the fractional version of Dirac's equation, which, whenever coupled to an external electromagnetic field and reduced to the non-relativistic regime, yields a fractional Pauli-type equation. From the latter, they are able to present an explicit expression for the gyromagnetic ratio of charged fermions in terms of the fractionality parameter. They then focus their efforts to relate the coarse-grained property of space-time to fractionality and to the (g-2) anomalies of the different leptonic species. To do this, they build up an axiomatic local metric derivative that exhibits the Mittag-Leffler function as eigenfunction and is valid for low-level fractionality, whenever the order parameter is close to 1.",

In this chapter, the author firstly presents some generalized Montgomery identities for Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals, which are designed by using a new and special type of Peano kernels. Secondly, inequalities via convex function are also discussed. In addition, some general fractional representation formulae are studied for a function in terms of the fractional Riemann-Liouville integrals of different orders and its ordinary derivatives. Moreover, by utilizing Montgomery identities, some new fractional versions of Ostrowski's type integral inequalities are established.

So, dynamical behaviors of the resulting discrete-time model are studied such as local stability, existence of Neimark-Sacker, and flip bifurcations.

Here, a new hybrid gene selection-sample classification model (NHGSSC) is proposed for selection of relevant genes and classification of cancer samples. The NHGSSC performs two tasks-gene selection and sample classification. For gene selection, a new hybrid single filter and α-depth limited best first search based single wrapper method (SFα-BFSSW) is proposed. From these subsets, highly informative genes are selected by counting frequency of occurrence (FO) of every gene. Then SFα-BFSSW method-based ensemble classifier (SFα-BFSSWEC) is built by combining the classifiers created for the selected gene subsets.

It works from the perspective of the user in general with user satisfaction being the primary goal. The methodology that I adopted is thinking from the user's perspective and working towards user's satisfaction as the goal. Design thinking is a problem-solving technique evolved in different fields like architecture, engineering, and business.

This chapter presents a novel handoff technique for smart speakers to ensure playback continuity when the users move around in a smart space consisting of multiple discoverable speakers. Current implementations include Spotify Connect, which is service specific, thus lacking in discovery robustness. The proposed handoff discovers at the device level instead of service level to improve device visibility and interoperability through a self-learning topology discovery (SLTD) method. For timely handoff, a rapid preemptive handoff method (RPF) is designed to optimize the TCP handshake mechanism and a content pre-caching technique is used to minimize playback gaps during the soft handoff.",

With Moore-Hodgson Algorithm, the alternate optimal solutions cannot be easily generated from one optimal solution; however, with integer formulation, this is not a problem. Unfortunately, integer formulations are sometimes very difficult to handle as the number jobs increases. Therefore, the integer formulation presented in this chapter uses infeasibility to verify optimality with branch and bound related algorithms. Thus, the lower bound was obtained using pre-processing and shown to be highly accurate and on its own can be used in those situations where quick scheduling decisions are required.",

The effect of input parameters on model output is calibrated using sensitivity analysis. It shows that pore size is the most sensitive parameter followed by feed velocity. The optimum values of pore size, operating pressure, and feed velocity were calibrated and found to be 2.21µm, 1.31×10-03KPa, and 0.37m/sec, respectively.

    "abstract": "This chapter presents how root cause analysis based on fault tree technique can be used to study mal-operation of protective relay in a smart power grid. This approach is used to identify disturbances first and root cause of mal operation of protective relays which may lead to unnecessary tripping and hence to blackout. Once the critical root causes are identified, mitigation measures first such as blocking protection functions and digital filters may be used in view of increasing the reliability of the considered protection system. The proposed approach has many advantages as it allows obtaining an important quantitative figure (security). These permits to strongly strengthen the elements of the protecting system which are most likely appropriate to failure and hence the impact on the overall system's cost is significant. Another main advantage is that it takes into account the reliability of the software part of the system which is considered to have a significant contribution in the overall reliability of the protecting system.",

    "abstract": "A power transformer is protected against internal faults using a differential protection which is sensitive and a fast. However, during transformer magnetization (inrush current or over-excitation), the differential relay may operate unnecessarily. This phenomenon appears only when a transformer is first energized or after clearing external fault. During periodic magnetization condition due to over-excitation, the third and fifth harmonic components are largely noticed; however, during the normal apperiodic inrush conditions, the second harmonic is relatively high. In the conventional techniques, these harmonic components have been used to block differential protection to operate. However, in smart power transformer, these harmonic components are small even during the transformer magnetization; they cannot be used as block protection functions. The differential protection security has to be improved so that it can distinguish between differential current produced by magnetization and that produced by internal fault using the most advanced computer with most improved DSP algorithms.",

Scaling of MOSFETs becomes a huge problem for industries due to short channel effects (SCEs) and sub-threshold leakage current. So, nanowires become a good solution to SCEs due to their structure. This chapter is divided into three parts. The first part gives a brief introduction of nanowire and different materials that can replace Si (channel material) and SiO2 (oxide material) due to their superior performance over Si. In the second part, the device structure and device structural measurement is discussed. In the third part, transport properties are discussed. This chapter shows the behavior of nanowire on changing different device materials and device dimensions. Electrical characteristics of Si and III-V based nanowires FETs will be analyzed and compared. High-k dielectric as oxide material also helps in improving device performance. HfO2 shows improvement in device characteristics over SiO2 taken as an oxide material. Junctionless nanowire MOSFET has also been designed and analyzed.",

Identical to all other types of power generation plants, the integration of these renewable energy sources in smart power grid has an impact on its operation. Thus, when the electrical power is injected into the power grid by these energy sources, the system electrical parameters must be well monitored for synchronization purpose. This can be accomplished with the aid of synchro-phasors measurement units. The phase angle of the utility is a critical parameter for the operation of power devices feeding power into the grid such as PV and wind energy inverters. There are many techniques to obtain the grid phase angle such as the zero-crossing detection and the orthogonal phase locked loop. This research work discusses the use of PMUs (Phasor Measurement Unit) for providing this important parameter to system synchronization in the case of high penetration of solar or wind energy in the power grid.",

    "abstract": "Many models of phasor measurement units (PMU) have been implemented; however, few dynamic models have been developed when the power system parameters change. It is necessary to use a method that can somehow estimate the frequency and correct the phasors. The conventional way to determine frequency is to detect zero crossings per unit time. However, this method has many drawbacks such as high cost and low accuracy. Also, after the frequency determination, the phasor should be corrected by suitably modifying the algorithm without omitting any data. This chapter presents different estimation techniques such as discrete Fourier transform (DFT), smart discrete Fourier transform (SDFT) that may be used to estimate the phasors. These estimated values would be incorrect if the input signals are at an off-nominal frequency and the phase angles would drift away from the true values. To correct this issue, first of all, the off-nominal frequency has been estimated using different techniques such as least error squares and phasor measurement angle changing, and then it is used to correct the phasors.",

However, this type of filter does not provide the ability to reject sub-harmonics. This chapter presents the digital filtering design issue based on optimization approach for removing sub-harmonics and hence improving the measurement. The first point of view is to reach an unified accurate phasor measurement algorithm that is immune to nearly all disturbances (sub-harmonics) in power grid including FACT devices and renewable energy sources, simultaneously with required speed of convergence. The second point focuses on reducing the computational requirement and algorithm complexity through designing recursive digital filter with reduced order.",

Certain common behaviors observed at dyad and triad level (i.e., at a micro level) help social networks acquire similar structural features. These features constitute a significant part of the development dynamics of the network structure. Feedback from such common behavioral patterns balances the micro-level structure of the network. These structural balances play a determining role in the similarity or difference between behaviors, languages, current issues, or opinions regarding basic concepts and so on.",

    "abstract": "In social networks, an “inward gravitation” leading to a structure within which everyone is connected to one another does not occur. Instead, the network in question evolves into structural groups that are tightly connected within but with scarce ties between. An analogous situation is observed in all “complex” systems even if they are not social. We see a similar pattern in microbiological (concerning the interaction of molecular structures within the chemical system of the cell), macrobiological (regarding the interaction of species within an ecological system), and socio-economic (supply mechanisms and specialization of firms within a sector, organization of individuals in an office) systems. The factor underlying this pattern is the “specialization” of small systems through evolutionary processes. Owing to these relations, micro dynamics take place within the group while meso dynamics take place between groups. This chapter explores these groups and groupings.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, deep learning has achieved a significant breakthrough in development. In addition to the emergence of convolution, the most important is self-learning of deep neural networks. By self-learning methods, adaptive weights of kernels and built-in parameters or interconnections are automatically modified such that the error rate is reduced along the learning process, and the recognition rate is improved. Emulating mechanism of the brain, it can have accurate recognition ability after learning. One of the most important self-learning methods is back-propagation (BP). The current BP method is indeed a systematic way of calculating the gradient of the loss with respect to adaptive interconnections. The main core of the gradient descent method addresses on modifying the weights negatively proportional to the determined gradient of the loss function, subsequently reducing the error of the network response in comparison with the standard answer. The basic assumption for this type of the gradient-based self-learning is that the loss function is the first-order differential.",

Each active state is determined by a code that is formed by the state values of the cells of the neighborhood. Variants of the evolution of the universe based on the surroundings of von Neumann and Moore are considered.

The image of the figure is binarized and an active signal moves along its edges. At every moment in time, the active cell of an asynchronous cellular automaton generates a pulse signal. The shape of the generated pulse sequence describes the geometric shape of a flat figure. Methods for describing images of individual plane figures, as well as a method for describing images consisting of many separate geometric objects, are proposed. Cellular automaton is considered as an analogue of the retina of the human visual canal. The circuitry structures of cells of such asynchronous cellular automata are presented, and the software implementation of the proposed methods is also performed.

    "abstract": "The most important factor distinguishing firms is the possession of knowledge, and the core differentiating skill is the ability to deploy that knowledge to their competitive advantage (Scott, 1998). Products of the turbulent information industries (Mendelson and Kraemer, 1998), especially those facilitated by the Internet, show the hitherto unseen promise of increasing returns. The flexibility to survive in turbulent technological environments, however, can only be achieved if positive feedback is not suppressed (Hall, 1997). This chapter examines incremental development and maintenance of software products designed to be used, delivered, and maintained through the Internet. Complex software products often go through a process of iterative evolution across several rapidly delivered versions, and the opportunities for knowledge management and application that arise in the midst of their evolution are discussed. We describe how both development and maintenance/upgrading of Internet software must be addressed in ways extending beyond traditional methods used for “traditional” information systems maintenance. Drawing on a diverse theory base, including information economics, emergence theory, and knowledge-based innovation, characteristics of Internet-based software applications are described; linkages between application modularity and decomposability with process knowledge are first explored; feasibility of managing component knowledge and renewing architectural knowledge is discussed; and finally, a conceptual model for managing process knowledge across generations and versions of decomposable applications to support software maintenance and evolution is presented.",

This chapter suggests that despite the very important findings in the area of user satisfaction, very little is finding its way to the day-to-day practices. The chapter continues to suggest that even more alarming is the notion that most users expect that systems will be difficult to use and there is little demand by them for the inclusion of psychological and organisational aspects to be included in information systems. This is supported by results of a pilot study examining criteria used for repurchase of computing technology. Finally, the chapter briefly examines the organisational culture which appears to prevent users demanding more attention to user satisfaction criteria and proposes some necessary inclusions for an infrastructure; users will begin to expect and demand the inclusion of psychological and organisational aspects in the development and implementation of information systems.",

Consequently, training methods and approaches have focused almost exclusively on ensuring that a trainee acquires the skills required to use an IT tool, and in a specific domain. With the advent and increasing use of enterprise-wide IT architectures, such as client/server, integrated processes such as workflow systems and integrated packages such as SAP, this narrow view of training will prove to be inadequate in preparing the workforce of the future. To train such a workforce, we propose a re-conceptualization of training based on a hierarchy of knowledge levels that a trainee will need. We then use this hierarchy to propose an integrated framework that can be used to develop a comprehensive training strategy. We offer directions for research that are needed to use our model to develop effective training strategies.",

It is an age-old and excellent tool for dealing with uncertain information. As a result, intuitionistic fuzzy set theory was suggested. However, these theories are incapable of dealing with all forms of uncertainty, such as indeterminate and inconsistent data in various decision-making situations. To address this shortfall, Smarandache proposed the neutrosophic set theory by introducing a degree of indeterminacy as an independent component. In this current decade, neutrosophic environments are mainly interested by different fields of researchers. Recently, Smarandache introduced theNeutroAlgebra and AntiAlgebras. NeutroAlgebras and AntiAlgebras represent a new research subject that is based on real-world examples.

The use of theses uninorms suggests the possible application of NeutroGroups in fields such as decision making as can be found in the consulted literature, as well as for Expert Systems, among others.

The answer will be no; beyond different technical tools, there is a paradigm shift affecting in depth the research including epistemological choices, either explicit or implicit. In addition, part of these differences, which at first glance seem essentially methodological, are in fact partly due to a socio-cultural environment and religious values linked to the representation of the world, which is only rarely conscious.",

    "abstract": "The term “Internet of Things (IoT)” was coined at the start of this century when work was done on MIT Auto-ID Centre to make a smart identification technology, which would help to reduce the error rate, subsequently increasing efficiency. But since then, the concept of IoT has evolved rapidly in various ways, as now with the help of this huge number of small networks which can remain connected to one another and can directly communicate with the main network without any human interaction. In this chapter, the investigation has been carried out to design a printed monopole antenna, which is basically a printed microstrip rectangular patch to support such IoT devices. The proposed antenna was designed and simulated using CST MWS, which shows that the antenna is working effectively in the triple band of frequency. The proposed antenna has the capability to work in the range of 2.4 GHz to 6.9 GHz. The miniature size of the antenna makes it suitable for wireless IoT applications.",

Now the internet of things (IoT) and automation have opened the doors to accomplish improved efficiency and productivity. Ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID antenna is a kind of auto-identification method that recognizes, discovers, validates, and engrosses with other IoT devices to competently accomplish one or more tasks. UHF RFID antennas are one of the important termination components that are installed throughout plants, easing automation. These antennas are principally cast off in engineering atmospheres that necessitate enormous strength to grip impact, shock, vibration, and thermal shocks deprived of trading-off the RF performance.

    "abstract": "This responsibility provides a straightforward, financially sound foundation for complicated analyses of the field transmitted by a receiving wire. The proposed setup is based on a number of receiving wire tests identified with a number of stage contrast locaters and, in general, a control locater. Stage capacity appraisals are made to recuperate the hour of the radio wire under test. The major advantage of the proposed structure is that it doesn't need standard evaluation, making it reasonable for getting wire investigations in situ. Requirements like the measure of getting wires in the group (and thusly the quantity of stage contrast locaters) and organizing shortcomings are examined. The suggested design has been tested using off-the-shelf equipment for radio wire evaluation and diagnostics. The problems with the system's execution, as well as offered fixes for lowering its precision, have been incorporated. Diagnostics and radiation plan assessments, as well as those determined from another phaseless strate, emerge in the end.",

In this study, waste management performances of EU countries were evaluated using fuzzy data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. The data set for the period 2014-2018 was collected from Eurostat, and five input and five output variables were determined for the analyses. Then, the waste management performances of 28 EU countries were analyzed using the Kao-Liu model. Efficiency scores were calculated for 0, 0.5, and 1 α-cut levels, while triangular fuzzy numbers were used in the model. In the analysis, the output-oriented DEA model was preferred, and overall, technical and scale efficiency values were determined. According to the results of the analysis, only Luxembourg and Cyprus are efficient at the lower and upper bounds for 0, 0.5, and 1 α-cut levels in terms of overall efficiency. When the value given for the α-cut is increased, the number of efficient countries also increases.",

OFDM is one of the major players of multi-carrier communication systems in 5G networks due to its high spectral efficiency and is immune to multipath fading. However, the OFDM signal suffers from significant amplitude fluctuations resulting in a large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which is one of the main downsides of OFDM systems. Therefore, limiting the PAPR in OFDM systems is a key issue, as decreasing PAPR results in lower power consumption and hence an extended battery life. Reducing PAPR without degrading power usage efficiency and bit error rate (BER) is a challenging issue in improving communication performance. This chapter discusses the use of compressive sensing for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems to deploy in energy-efficient 5G networks.",

    "abstract": "A novel type of tunable attenuator on spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPP) waveguide based on hybrid metal-graphene structure for terahertz applications is proposed in this chapter. Two structures are analyzed and designed, where the first is composed of a graphene sheet at only one cell of the SSPP waveguide and the second at all cells. By varying the graphene chemical potential via a biased voltage, the surface conductivity of graphene can be adjusted. Therefore, the attenuation can also be adjusted. Moreover, an equivalent circuit model is proposed to facilitate the designs of the proposed attenuator and offer a general understanding of the attenuation mechanism. Numerical simulation results with the CST simulator and WCIP method have a good agreement with the theoretical results. The simulated results show that the attenuator can obtain an adjustment range from 6.02 to 14.32 dB for the first structure and from 1.58 to 30.93 dB for the second, as the chemical potential rises from 0 to 0.5 eV.",

Secondly, using the SolMet smart contract metrics measurement tool, the object-oriented software attributes (i.e., metrics) from each smart contract's source code has been extracted. Lastly, using the source code metrics and the vulnerability annotations (i.e., labels) as the input in supervised machine learning (classification) algorithms, the accuracy of each individual algorithm is evaluated against the accuracy of an ensemble classifier (namely voting). The model accuracies demonstrate the feasibility of identifying and prioritising smart contracts for further inspection prior to deployment to the blockchain network. The ensemble classifier performed better (accuracy = 0.79) compared to each classifier when used individually.",

    "abstract": "At present, the transistor size is reduced to a few tens of nanometers, as larger transistors demand a large die area and power. Power is an important design parameter in multi-gigahertz communication and ASIC/SOC designs. To deliver higher performance with lower power, various technologies are adopted in semiconductor industry. SOI is one such technology that helps in achieving higher performance. It offers a platform to integrate digital and RF circuit onto a single chip. Adopting SOI technology, faster chips with lesser power can be designed. This extends the battery life of handheld devices. The SOI structure is comparable to MOSFET except for an added buried oxide (Box) layer beneath the device region. The Box layer isolates the top and the base silicon layers and reduces the junction capacitances. This reduction accelerates the speed, lowers the power consumption, allows higher transistor stacking, and improves the device performance. These capabilities have led SOI usage in RF circuits. This chapter discusses the SOI technology in building energy- and power-efficient designs.",

For such applications, low voltage and low power operation is an essential prerequisite to prevent overheating and ensure reliable functioning. Low voltage operation curtails the total number, weight, and dimensions of batteries, and low power consumption extends battery life. The shrinking size of MOS transistors in CMOS processes necessitates the use of lower supply voltages. Since the threshold voltage of MOS transistor is not diminished at the same rate as the power supply voltage, analog designers face problems due to shrinking voltage headroom. One of the findings that can overcome the issues introduced by comparably high threshold voltages is based on the enactment of body bias approach. In such a solution, a relatively small potential is applied at body terminal of a MOS transistor to adjust its threshold voltage. This chapter discussed that body bias approach is an attractive opportunity for utilizing the body effect positively to improve the performance of low voltage-integrated circuits.",

    "abstract": "The performance and efficiency of a solar PV cell are greatly dependent on the precise estimation of its current-voltage (I-V) characteristic. Usually, it is very difficult to estimate accurate I-V characteristics of solar PV due to the nonlinear relation between current and voltage. Metaheuristic optimization techniques, on the other hand, are very powerful tools to obtain solutions to complex non-linear problems. Hence, this chapter presents two metaheuristic algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and harmony search (HS), to estimate the single-diode model parameters. The feasibility of the metaheuristic algorithms is demonstrated for a solar cell and its extension to a photovoltaic solar module, and the results are compared with the numerical method, namely the Newton Raphson method (NRM), in terms of the solution accuracy, consistency, absolute maximum power error, and computation efficiency. The results show that the metaheuristic algorithms were indeed capable of obtaining higher quality solutions efficiently in the parameter estimation problem.",

Activities modelled from assumptions and everyday knowledge can lead to incorrect recognition results of routine activities and possible failure to detect abnormal activity trends. A significant step to the accurate recognition of activities of daily living is the discovery of the object usage for specific routine activities. This chapter presents an approach that discovers object usage for routine activities using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modelling. The object usage discovery augments an activity ontology that enables recognition of simple activities of daily living in the home environment.

Accordingly, they implement a decision support system, which includes an ontology of cloud services knowledge within the proposed framework. Analytical hierarchical process (AHP) is used to determine the weight of each cloud service attribute, and a benchmark is set to determine the acceptability of each cloud service based on its ability to meet the acceptable benchmark for each criteria. It can also help in a healthy competition to improve the quality of service among cloud service providers.

This has become possible by watching a live TV program on handheld devices, as it facilitates real-time updates. Digital terrestrial television broadcasting aimed at transmitting two types of information: global and local content. The global content aims at broadcasting over the entire network, and the local content is location specific. Broadcasting the local content using multiple transmitters at different frequencies in multifrequency network requires additional spectrum. Global content can be transmitted through single frequency network. Therefore, if both global and local information are transmitted in a single frequency network (SFN), the system will become highly spectrally efficient and cost-effective.",

The printing performance of the solder paste is dependent on conditions such as paste deformation behavior, good paste roll, complete aperture filling, and paste release onto the substrate pads. Eighteen tests were performed using two types of lead-free solder paste. Three temperatures were investigated under three different time intervals. Results analysis showed that variability of the paste distribution was lowest and more uniform for paste stored at 25˚C for 48 hours. From the analysis, it is obvious that temperature has tremendous effects on the printing performance of solder paste. This study recommends 25˚C as a good temperature for solder paste printing.",

    "abstract": "The e-healthcare system maintains sensitive and private information about patients. In any e-healthcare system, exchanging health information is often required, making privacy and security a primary concern for e-healthcare systems. Another major issue is that existing e-healthcare systems use centralized servers. These centralized servers require high infrastructure and maintenance costs for day-to-day services. Along with that, server failure may affect the working of e-healthcare systems drastically and may create life-threatening situations for patients. Blockchain technology is a very useful way to provide decentralized, secure storage for healthcare information. A blockchain is a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. These blocks create a chain of immutable, tamper-proof blocks in a ledger. This chapter will discuss the different aspects of blockchain and its application in different fields of the e-healthcare system.",
