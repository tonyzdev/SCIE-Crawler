    "abstract": "The improvements in the crystal structure refinement program SHELXL have been closely coupled with the development and increasing importance of the CIF (Crystallographic Information Framework) format for validating and archiving crystal structures. An important simplification is that now only one file in CIF format (for convenience, referred to simply as `a CIF') containing embedded reflection data and SHELXL instructions is needed for a complete structure archive; the program SHREDCIF can be used to extract the .hkl and .ins files required for further refinement with SHELXL. Recent developments in SHELXL facilitate refinement against neutron diffraction data, the treatment of H atoms, the determination of absolute structure, the input of partial structure factors and the refinement of twinned and disordered structures. SHELXL is available free to academics for the Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems, and is particularly suitable for multiple-core processors.",

    "abstract": "The completion of a crystal structure determination is often hampered by the presence of embedded solvent molecules or ions that are seriously disordered. Their contribution to the calculated structure factors in the least-squares refinement of a crystal structure has to be included in some way. Traditionally, an atomistic solvent disorder model is attempted. Such an approach is generally to be preferred, but it does not always lead to a satisfactory result and may even be impossible in cases where channels in the structure are filled with continuous electron density. This paper documents the SQUEEZE method as an alternative means of addressing the solvent disorder issue. It conveniently interfaces with the 2014 version of the least-squares refinement program SHELXL [Sheldrick (2015). Acta Cryst. C71. In the press] and other refinement programs that accept externally provided fixed contributions to the calculated structure factors. The PLATON SQUEEZE tool calculates the solvent contribution to the structure factors by back-Fourier transformation of the electron density found in the solvent-accessible region of a phase-optimized difference electron-density map. The actual least-squares structure refinement is delegated to, for example, SHELXL. The current versions of PLATON SQUEEZE and SHELXL now address several of the unnecessary complications with the earlier implementation of the SQUEEZE procedure that were a necessity because least-squares refinement with the now superseded SHELXL97 program did not allow for the input of fixed externally provided contributions to the structure-factor calculation. It is no longer necessary to subtract the solvent contribution temporarily from the observed intensities to be able to use SHELXL for the least-squares refinement, since that program now accepts the solvent contribution from an external file (.fab file) if the ABIN instruction is used. In addition, many twinned structures containing disordered solvents are now also treatable by SQUEEZE. The details of a SQUEEZE calculation are now automatically included in the CIF archive file, along with the unmerged reflection data. The current implementation of the SQUEEZE procedure is described, and discussed and illustrated with three examples. Two of them are based on the reflection data of published structures and one on synthetic reflection data generated for a published structure.",

    "abstract": "By means of variable-compositional evolutionary algorithms, in combination with first-principles calculations, the compositions, structures and mechanical properties of the W-B system have been theoretically investigated. As well as confirming the experimental observations (including their crystal structures) for the four known compounds W2B, WB, WB2 and WB3, the new stable compound W8B7 and two nearly stable compounds, W2B3 and WB4, have also been predicted in the ground state. The elastic properties and estimated Vickers hardnesses of all these borides have been systematically derived. The results show that, among these borides, hP6-WB2 exhibits the largest ultra-incompressibility along the c axis, with the highest C33 value (953 GPa, comparable with that of the most incompressible diamond). hP16-WB3 exhibits the highest hardness of 36.9 GPa, in good agreement with the experimentally measured data from 28.1 to 43.3 GPa, close to the superhard threshold, and oC8-WB shows the highest bulk modulus of about 350 GPa. The new stable compound W8B7 crystallizes in the monoclinic mP15 phase, with infinite zigzag B chains running parallel to the W-atom layers, resulting in a relatively high estimated hardness of 19.6 GPa. The anisotropic Young's modulus E and torsion shear modulus G(t) have been derived for both oC8-WB and hP16-WB3. The current state of research and the historic inconsistency of the W-B system are briefly summarized, in particular clarifying the fact that the previous experimentally attributed hP20-WB4 is in fact the defect-containing hP16-WB3.",

Like the tolerance factor widely adopted for the perovskite structure, it is a compositional parameter derived from the geometrical relationship between multi-type polyhedra in the garnet structure, and the calculation only needs the information of the ionic radius. A survey of the tolerance factor over 130 garnet-type compounds reveals that the data points are scattered in a narrow range. The tolerance factor is helpful in understanding the crystal chemistry of some garnet-type compounds and could serve as a guide for predicting the stability of the garnet phase. The correlation between the tolerance factor and the garnet-phase stability could be utilized by machine learning or high-throughput screening methods in material design and discovery.",

The T(c) of LiH6 increases rapidly with pressure and reaches 82 K at 300 GPa due to enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling and the increased density of states at the Fermi level, while the T(c) of LiH8 remains almost constant.",

This model, used as a fitness function in conjunction with first-principles calculations and the global optimization evolutionary algorithm USPEX, efficiently leads to practically important results. We found a number of high-fitness structures of SiO2 and HfO2, some of which correspond to known phases and some of which are new. The results allow us to propose characteristics (genes) common to high-fitness structures--these are the coordination polyhedra and their degree of distortion. Our variable-composition searches in the HfO2-SiO2 system uncovered several high-fitness states. This hybrid algorithm opens up a new avenue for discovering novel high-k dielectrics with both fixed and variable compositions, and will speed up the process of materials discovery.",

X-ray diffraction analysis shows that complex 1 consists of dimeric units in which the dicl ligand exhibits a bidentate syn , syn -μ 2 coordination mode linking two copper(II) centres. Complexes 2 and 3 have mononuclear units with the general formula [Cu(dicl) 2 L 2 ] ( L is vim or im) in which the Cu II ions are octahedrally coordinated by two L and two dicl chelating ligands. The L and dicl ligands both occupy the trans positions of the coordination octahedron. The different coordination modes of dicl in the title complexes were revealed by Fourier transform IR (FT–IR) spectroscopy. The spin matching between the copper(II) centres in the dimeric [Cu 2 (μ-dicl) 4 (CH 3 OH) 2 ] units was also confirmed by magnetic data to be lower than the spin-only value and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra.

    "abstract": "Electron counting helped realize the resolution revolution in single-particle cryoEM and is now accelerating the determination of MicroED structures. Its advantages are best demonstrated by new direct electron detectors capable of fast (kilohertz) event-based electron counting (EBEC). This strategy minimizes the inaccuracies introduced by coincidence loss (CL) and promises rapid determination of accurate structures. We used the Direct Electron Apollo camera to leverage EBEC technology for MicroED data collection. Given its ability to count single electrons, the Apollo collects high-quality MicroED data from organic small-molecule crystals illuminated with incident electron beam flux densities as low as 0.01-0.045 e-/Å2/s. Under even the lowest flux density (0.01 e-/Å2/s) condition, fast EBEC data produced ab initio structures of a salen ligand (268 Da) and biotin (244 Da). Each structure was determined from a 100° wedge of data collected from a single crystal in as few as 50 s, with a delivered fluence of only ∼0.5 e-/Å2. Fast EBEC data collected with a fluence of 2.25 or 3.33 e-/Å2 also facilitated a 1.5 Å structure of thiostrepton (1665 Da). While refinement of these structures appeared unaffected by CL, a CL adjustment applied to EBEC data further improved the distribution of intensities measured from the salen ligand and biotin crystals. However, CL adjustment only marginally improved the refinement of their corresponding structures, signaling the already high counting accuracy of detectors with counting rates in the kilohertz range. Overall, by delivering low-dose structure-worthy data, fast EBEC collection strategies open new possibilities for high-throughput MicroED.",

An NMR crystallography approach was used to investigate the H-atom positions in the two crystallographically unique COOH-CONH hydrogen-bonded dimers. 1H solid-state NMR distinguished the two carboxyl protons, despite the very similar crystallographic environments. The nature of the hydrogen bonding was confirmed by solid-state NMR and density functional theory calculations.",

The most stable polymorphs, denoted Forms I and II, can be obtained easily and their crystal structures are known. Crystals of the orthorhombic, less stable, room-temperature Form III are difficult to grow; they need a special recipe to crystallize and suffer from severe preferred orientation. A crystal structure model of Form III has been proposed and solved from a combination of structure prediction and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) [Perrin et al. (2009). Chem. Commun. 22, 3181-3183]. The final Rwp value of 0.138 and the corresponding considerable residual trace were reasons to check its validity. A new structure determination of Form III using new high-resolution PXRD data led to a final Rwp value of 0.042 and an improvement of the earlier proposed model. In addition, a reversible phase transition was found at 170-220 K between the orthorhombic Form III and a novel monoclinic Form III-m. The crystal structure of Form III-m has been determined and refined from PXRD data to a final Rwp value of 0.059.",

New structures are reported for the following three cocrystals, all in the P 2 1 / c space group: acridine–1,3,5-trifluoro-2,4,6-triiodobenzene (1/1), C 6 F 3 I 3 ·C 13 H 9 N, 1,10-phenanthroline–1,3,5-trifluoro-2,4,6-triiodobenzene (1/1), C 6 F 3 I 3 ·C 12 H 8 N 2 , and 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine–1,3,5-trifluoro-2,4,6-triiodobenzene (1/1), C 6 F 3 I 3 ·C 8 H 12 N 2 . 13 C and 19 F solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR is shown to be a convenient method to characterize the structural features of the halogen-bond donor and acceptor, with chemical shifts attributable to cocrystal formation observed in the spectra of both nuclides. Cross polarization (CP) from 19 F to 13 C results in improved spectral sensitivity in characterizing the perfluorinated halogen-bond donor when compared to conventional 1 H CP. Gauge-including projector-augmented wave density functional theory (GIPAW DFT) calculations of magnetic shielding constants, along with optimization of the XRD structures, provide a final set of structures in best agreement with the experimental 13 C and 19 F chemical shifts. Data for carbons bonded to iodine remain outliers due to well-known relativistic effects.",

    "abstract": "Properties related to the size and shape of Hirshfeld surfaces provide insight into the nature and strength of interactions among the building blocks of molecular crystals. In this work, we demonstrate that functions derived from the curvatures of the surface at a point, namely, shape index (S) and curvedness (C), as well as the distances from the surface to the nearest external (de) and internal (di) nuclei, can be used to help understand metal-ligand interactions in coordination polymers. The crystal structure of catena-poly[[[(1,10-phenanthroline-κ2N,N')copper(II)]-μ-4-nitrophthalato-κ2O1:O2] trihydrate], {[Cu(C8H3NO6)(C12H8N2)]·3H2O}n, described here for the first time, was used as a prototypical system for our analysis. Decomposition of the coordination polymer into its metal centre and ligand molecules followed by joint analysis of the Hirshfeld surfaces generated for each part unveil qualitative and semi-quantitative information that cannot be easily obtained either from conventional crystal packing analysis or from Hirshfeld surface analysis of the entire polymeric units. The shape index function S is particularly sensitive to the coordination details and its mapping on the surface of the metallic centre is highly dependent on the nature of the ligand and the coordination bond distance. Correlations are established between the shape of the Hirshfeld surface of the metal and the geometry of the metal-ligand contacts in the crystals. This could be applied not only to estimate limiting coordination distances in metal-organic compounds, but also to help establish structure-property relationships potentially useful for the crystal engineering of such materials.",

This compound was crystallized as a zwitterion {2-[(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)azaniumyl]-3-phenylpropanoate, C 20 H 19 NO 2 }, as an anion in a sodium salt ( catena -poly[[diaquasodium(I)-di-μ-aqua] 2-[(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)amino]-3-phenylpropanoate monohydrate], {[Na(H 2 O) 4 ](C 20 H 18 NO 2 )·H 2 O} n ), as a cation in a chloride salt [(1-carboxy-2-phenylethyl)(naphthalen-2-&lt;!?tlsb=-0.2pt&gt;ylmethyl)azanium chloride acetic acid monosolvate, C 20 H 20 NO 2 + ·Cl − ·CH 3 COOH], and additionally acting as a ligand in the pentacoordinated zinc compound aquabis{2-[(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)amino]-3-phenylpropanoato-κ O }zinc(II), [Zn(C 20 H 18 NO 2 ) 2 (H 2 O)] or [Zn( PN ) 2 (H 2 O)], denoted ( PN-Zn ), with the amino acid derivative in its carboxylate form. Interestingly, both enantiomers of the zinc complex co-exist within the crystalline structure, one constructed by the ligands with the L (or S ) configuration and the other with the ligands having the D (or R ) configuration, represented as L,L- PN-Zn and D,D- PN-Zn , respectively. Also, in the structure of the zwitterion, the racemate L,D is observed. These results imply that chirality inversion of the amino acid derivative synthesized from enantiomerically pure L-phenylalanine is taking place, a phenomenon known as oscillatory transenantiomerization. The analysis of these crystal structures reveals that they are primarily stabilized through electrostatic interactions assisted by hydrogen bonds. An interesting finding is that the conformation of PN varies along this family: it is unfolded in the zwitterionic and cationic forms, and folded in the anionic form. To evaluate such conformational differences, we propose the use of a dimensionless Shape Factor quantity defined as the Structural Aspect Ratio (SA R ), computed from the geometrical features of the parallelepiped that tightly encloses a conformer constructed by rigid spheres. This parameter provides a simple but useful tool to distinguish conformational differences, providing insights that complement traditional structural analyses. The study of the structural features, conformational diversity, chirality and supramolecular properties of these compounds is also supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",

The original discovery of this class of crystals occurred at a time when crystallography was in its infancy, data collection and processing were tedious and limited by X-ray equipment, and computing power was indeed limited. Therefore, this interesting class of crystalline molecules, potentially having useful biological uses, is today one of those scientific orphans largely ignored in the crystallographic realm. As proof of this, to date, you cannot systematically search for this class in databases. Thus, for the time being, there are few satisfactory examples of high-quality crystal structures of both members of such pairs which have been highlighted in the literature. Finally, being largely undocumented, there are no useful clues to guide you as to how to guess the classes of compounds likely to produce such pairs. The question then is, how do we go about searching for potential cases of such crystallization modes using information already in print? Herein, we provide some suggestions we believe are useful, and to the extent possible with such data, to illustrate the possibilities offered by such an approach.",

As a model reaction, 4,4'-dimethoxythiobenzophenone and diazocyclohexane were used to prepare [bis(4-methoxyphenyl)methylidene]cyclohexane, C21H24O2. The crystal structure of the latter, as well as that of the intermediate thiirane, 2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-thiaspiro[2.5]octane, C21H24O2S, have been determined and their molecular conformations and geometries are generally consistent with those of related structures in the literature. Variations in the influence of four substituents on crowded thiirane rings are minimal and the main differences are noted in the presence of bulky tert-butyl substituents. The conformation of the intermediate thiirane is influenced by weak intramolecular C-H...S interactions. A three-dimensional supramolecular structure of the methylene cyclohexane compound results from the combination of three distinct weak C-H...π interactions. Under similar reaction conditions, 5-phenyl-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione has been transformed into 3-[bis(4-methoxyphenyl)methylidene]-5-phenyl-3H-1,2-dithiole, C24H20O2S2, by treatment with bis(4-methoxyphenyl)diazomethane. The crystal structure of the 1,2-dithiole product reveals a molecule with an all-trans 2,4-hexadiene core, in which the Csp2-Csp2 bond lengths display an alternating character that suggests little delocalization of the double bonds. The 1,2-dithiole ring is nearly planar, with just a slight puckering into an envelope form. Two weak C-H...π and one C-H...O interaction link the molecules into thick two-dimensional supramolecular layers.",

The coordinating behaviour of allyl derivatives of 1,3,4-thiadiazoles with respect to transition metal ions has been little studied. Five new crystalline copper(I) π-complexes have been obtained by means of an alternating current electrochemical technique and have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy.

The structure of the ligand 5-methyl-N-(prop-2-en-1-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amine (Mepeta), C6H9N3S, was also structurally characterized. Both Mepeta and 5-[(prop-2-en-1-yl)sulfanyl]-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amine (Pesta) (denoted L) reveal a strong tendency to form dimeric {Cu2L2}2+ fragments, being attached to the metal atom in a chelating-bridging mode via two thiadiazole N atoms and an allylic C=C bond. Flexibility of the {Cu2(Pesta)2}2+ unit allows the CuI atom site to be split into two positions with different metal-coordination environments, thus enabling the competitive participation of different molecules in bonding to the metal centre. The Pesta ligand in (4) allows the CuI atom to vary between water O-atom and hexafluorosilicate F-atom coordination, resulting in the rare case of a direct CuI...FSiF52- interaction. Extensive three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding patterns are formed in the reported crystal structures. Complex (5) should be considered as the first known example of a CuI(C6H5SO3) coordination compound. To determine the hydrogen-bond interactions in the structures of (1) and (2), a Hirshfeld surface analysis has been performed.",

This transition, called the breathing effect, is observed upon changes in temperature or external pressure, as well as with the adsorption of guest molecules, such as H2O, within the pores. We show here how these different pore openings can be detected by observing the dephasing of 13C magnetization under 13C-27Al dipolar couplings using Rotational-Echo Saturation-Pulse Double-Resonance (RESPDOR) solid-state NMR experiments with Simultaneous Frequency and Amplitude Modulation (SFAM) recoupling. These double-resonance NMR experiments between 13C and 27Al nuclei, which have close Larmor frequencies, are feasible thanks to the use of a frequency splitter. The experimental SFAM-RESPDOR signal fractions agree well with those simulated from the MIL-53(Al)-lp and -np crystal structures obtained from powder X-ray diffraction analysis. Hence, these 13C-27Al solid-state NMR experiments validate these structures and confirm their rigidity. A similar agreement is reported for the framework ligands in the as-synthesized (as) MIL-53(Al), in which the pores contain free ligands. Furthermore, in this case, 13C-{27Al} SFAM-RESPDOR experiments allow an estimation of the average distance between the free ligands and the 27Al nuclei of the framework.",

Three asymmetric BAPs, namely (5 E )-3-(4- tert -butylbenzylidene)-5-(4-fluorobenzylidene)-1-methylpiperidin-4-one, C 24 H 26 FNO, ( 5 ), (5 E )-3-(4- tert -butylbenzylidene)-5-(3,5-dimethoxybenzylidene)-1-methylpiperidin-4-one, C 26 H 31 NO 3 , ( 6 ), and (5 E )-3-{3-[( E )-(2,3-dihydroxybenzylidene)amino]benzylidene}-5-(2-fluorobenzylidene)-1-methylpiperidin-4-one, C 27 H 23 FN 2 O 3 , ( 12 ), were generated by Claisen–Schmidt condensation. They are characterized by NMR and FT–IR spectroscopies, and elemental analysis. Single-crystal structure analysis reveals that the two arylidene rings on both sides of the BAP structures adopt an E stereochemistry of the olefinic double bonds and the compounds are E , E isomers. Molecules of ( 5 ) and ( 12 ) generate one-dimensional chains through intermolecular hydrogen bonds, while compound ( 6 ) generates a two-dimensional network through hydrogen bonds.

Because both sides of α,β-unsaturated ketones (6) or (7) can be attacked by guanidine, we obtained a pair of isomers in (8) and (9). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction indicates that each isomer has a chiral C atom and both (8) and (9) crystallize in the achiral space group P21/c. The chloride ion, as a hydrogen-bond acceptor, plays an important role in the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds. Thus, adjacent molecules are connected through intermolecular hydrogen bonds to generate a banded structure. Furthermore, these bands are linked into an interesting 3D network via hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions. Fortunately, the solubilities of (8) and (9) were distinctly improved and can exceed 50 mg ml-1 in water or PBS buffer system (pH 7.4) at room temperature. In addition, the results of an investigation of anti-inflammatory activity show that (8) and (9), with o- and p-fluoro substituents, respectively, display more potential for inhibitory effects on LPS-induced NO secretion than starting ketones (6) and (7).",

The single-crystal XRD results show that the chalcogenodiazole molecules interact with the electron donors through two σ-holes on each of the chalcogen atoms, which results in highly directional and moderately strong chalcogen bonds. Powder XRD confirms that the crystalline phases are preserved upon moderate grinding of the samples for solid-state NMR experiments. Measurement of 77Se and 125Te chemical shift tensors via magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy confirms the number of magnetically unique chalcogen sites in each asymmetric unit and reveals the impact of chalcogen-bond formation on the local electronic structure.

Although analysing the crystallographic results with available software tools can catch many types of errors, others can be detected only by combining knowledge of both crystallography and chemistry. We discuss several such examples from the published literature, and for each of them we identify what lessons they teach us. The examples are categorized by the type of error: correct crystallography but incorrect chemistry, mis-assignment of atoms, high-symmetry superstructures with included guest molecules, incorrect choice of space group, incorrect choice of unit-cell size, and unresolved problems. These examples are intended to counteract the aura of infallibility that crystal structures sometimes assume and to alert the reader to features to look for in detecting pathological structures.",

The local structure of 3BrY molecules in the clusters is then compared with the low-temperature crystal structure of 3BrY, as well as with an alternative 3BrY high-pressure crystal packing obtained through Parrinello-Rahaman molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the interactions between the aromatic cores of 3BrY represent the main supramolecular motif observed in both the local structure of the prenucleation clusters and in the crystalline state. Within the clusters, these interactions lead to the presence of dimers and trimers locally arranged in crystal-like configurations.",

    "abstract": "Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is a well-established and versatile technique for studying the structural and dynamic properties of solids, and there is considerable potential to exploit the power and versatility of solid-state NMR for in-situ studies of chemical processes. However, a number of technical challenges are associated with adapting this technique for in-situ studies, depending on the process of interest. Recently, an in-situ solid-state NMR strategy for monitoring the evolution of crystallization processes has been developed and has proven to be a promising approach for identifying the sequence of distinct solid forms present as a function of time during crystallization from solution, and for the discovery of new polymorphs. The latest development of this technique, called `CLASSIC' NMR, allows the simultaneous measurement of both liquid-state and solid-state NMR spectra as a function of time, thus yielding complementary information on the evolution of both the liquid phase and the solid phase during crystallization from solution. This article gives an overview of the range of NMR strategies that are currently available for in-situ studies of crystallization processes, with examples of applications that highlight the potential of these strategies to deepen our understanding of crystallization phenomena.",

In contrast, the C atoms of the four methoxy groups bound to the chromene ring are out of the plane, making the molecule conformationally chiral. A comparison of the crystal structures of nobiletin revealed that it could adopt a variety of different conformations through rotation of the covalent bond between the chromene and arene rings, and the orientations of methoxy groups bound to the chromene ring.",

    "abstract": "Copper(II)–Schiff base complexes have attracted extensive interest due to their structural, electronic, magnetic and luminescence properties. The title novel monomeric Cu II complex, [Cu(C 10 H 11 N 2 O 4 ) 2 ], has been synthesized by the reaction of 3-{[(3-hydroxypropyl)imino]methyl}-4-nitrophenol (H 2 L ) and copper(II) acetate monohydrate in methanol, and was characterized by elemental analysis, UV and IR spectroscopies, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and a photoluminescence study. The Cu II atom is located on a centre of inversion and is coordinated by two imine N atoms, two phenoxy O atoms in a mutual trans disposition and two hydroxy O atoms in axial positions, forming an elongated octahedral geometry. In the crystal, intermolecular O—H...O hydrogen bonds link the molecules to form a one-dimensional chain structure and π–π contacts also connect the molecules to form a three-dimensional structure. The solid-state photoluminescence properties of the complex and free H 2 L have been investigated at room temperature in the visible region. When the complex and H 2 L are excited under UV light at 349 nm, the complex displays a strong green emission at 520 nm and H 2 L displays a blue emission at 480 nm.",

Two 1:1 cocrystals of 5-fluorouracil (5FU), namely 5-fluorouracil-4-methylbenzoic acid (5FU-MBA), C4H3FN2O2·C8H8O2, (I), and 5-fluorouracil-3-nitrobenzoic acid (5FU-NBA), C4H3FN2O2·C7H5NO4, (II), have been prepared and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

The reaction of copper sulfate with succinic acid (H 2 succ) and N , N- diethylethylenediamine (deed) in basic solution produces the complex catena -poly[[[( N , N -diethylethylenediamine-κ 2 N , N ′)copper(II)]-μ-succinato-κ 2 O 1 : O 4 ] tetrahydrate], {[Cu(C 4 H 4 O 4 )(C 6 H 16 N 2 )]·4H 2 O} n or {[Cu(succ)(deed)]·4H 2 O} n . Each carboxylate group of the succinate ligand coordinates to a Cu II atom in a monodentate fashion, giving rise to a square-planar coordination environment. The succinate ligands bridge the Cu II centres to form one-dimensional polymeric chains. Hydrogen bonds between the ligands and water molecules link these chains into sheets that lie in the ab plane. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to support the experimental data. From these calculations, a good linear correlation was observed between the experimental and theoretically predicted structural and spectroscopic parameters ( R 2 ∼ 0.97).",

In this study, the crystal structures of the di- and trihydrates of lithium chloride, lithium bromide and lithium iodide, and the pentahydrates of lithium chloride and lithium bromide have been determined. In each hydrate, the lithium cation is coordinated octahedrally. The dihydrates crystallize in the NaCl·2H 2 O or NaI·2H 2 O type structure. Surprisingly, in the tri- and pentahydrates of LiCl and LiBr, one water molecule per Li + ion remains uncoordinated. For LiI·3H 2 O, the LiClO 4 ·3H 2 O structure type was confirmed and the H-atom positions have been fixed. The hydrogen-bond networks in the various structures are discussed in detail.

(2010). Acta Cryst. B66, 615-621]. The molecule is tautomeric, and was reported as an amine tautomer [systematic name: N-(5-ethyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-p-toluenesulfonamide], rather than the correct imine tautomer. The protonation site on the molecule's 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring is indicated by the intermolecular contacts in the crystal structure: N-H...O hydrogen bonds are established at the correct site, while the alternative protonation site does not establish any notable intermolecular interactions. The two tautomers provide essentially identical Rietveld fits to laboratory PXRD data, and therefore they cannot be directly distinguished in this way. However, the correct tautomer can be distinguished from the incorrect one by previously reported quantitative criteria based on the extent of structural distortion on optimization of the crystal structure using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations. Calculation of the (13)C SS-NMR spectrum based on the correct imine tautomer also provides considerably better agreement with the measured (13)C SS-NMR spectrum.",

The resulting structural model revealed interaction between monomeric [Zr(PW 11 O 39 )] 4− ( 1 ), which is a postulated catalytically active species, and the protein in two positions in the asymmetric unit. The first position (occupancy 36%) confirms the previously observed binding sites on the protein surface, whereas the second position (occupancy 14%) provides novel insights into the hydrolytic mechanisms of Zr IV -substituted polyoxometalates. The new interaction site occurs at the Asn65 residue, which is directly next to the Asp66–Gly67 peptide bond that was identified recently as a cleavage site in the polyoxometalate-catalysed hydrolysis of HEWL. Furthermore, in this newly discovered binding site, the monomeric polyoxometalate 1 is observed to bind directly to the side chain of the Asn65 residue. This binding of Zr IV as a Lewis-acid metal to the carbonyl O atom of the Asn65 side chain is very similar to the intermediate state proposed in density functional theory (DFT) studies in which Zr IV activates the peptide bond via interaction with its carbonyl O atom, and can be thus regarded as a model for interaction between Zr IV and a peptide bond.",

In particular, the present investigation has been directed at the rhombohedral sodium rare earth sulfides. The observed dependence of the fractional coordinate z(S(2-)) on the identity of the rare earth element in the newly determined structures is in agreement with the known structures of the potassium and rubidium analogues.

    "abstract": "Single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations are solid-state phase transitions between different crystalline states in which the crystal integrity and the long-range structural order are retained through the whole transformation process. Such a phenomenon constitutes the structural response that some compounds afford when being exposed to a given external stimulus (temperature, pressure, light, etc .) and, therefore, its study has become a relevant focus of interest within crystal engineering because it allows for monitoring how certain properties (colour, magnetism, luminescence, porosity) of the stimuli-responsive material are modified as the structure evolves into the activated form. A range of organic, inorganic and hybrid systems have been found to undergo such phase transitions, but these examples only include a small number of compounds that incorporate polyoxometalate anions, among which the removal of guest solvent molecules (dehydration) stands out as the most common external stimulus able to induce the occurrence of a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. This feature article compiles the examples of dehydration-triggered single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation studies that have been reported to date for polyoxometalate-based compounds and reviews some of their most relevant structural aspects.",

    "abstract": "At one extreme of the proton-transfer spectrum in cocrystals, proton transfer is absent, whilst at the opposite extreme, in salts, the proton-transfer process is complete. However, for acid–base pairs with a small Δp K a (p K a of base − p K a of acid), prediction of the extent of proton transfer is not possible as there is a continuum between the salt and cocrystal ends. In this context, we attempt to illustrate that in these systems, in addition to Δp K a , the crystalline environment could change the extent of proton transfer. To this end, two compounds of salicylic acid (SaH) and adenine (Ad) have been prepared. Despite the same small Δp K a value (≈1.2), different ionization states are found. Both crystals, namely adeninium salicylate monohydrate, C 5 H 6 N 5 + ·C 7 H 5 O 3 − ·H 2 O, I , and adeninium salicylate–adenine–salicylic acid–water (1/2/1/2), C 5 H 6 N 5 + ·C 7 H 5 O 3 − ·2C 5 H 5 N 5 ·C 7 H 6 O 3 ·2H 2 O, II , have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (C, H and N) techniques. In addition, the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions of compounds I and II have been investigated and quantified in detail on the basis of Hirshfeld surface analysis and fingerprint plots. Throughout the study, we use crystal engineering, which is based on modifications of the intermolecular interactions, thus offering a more comprehensive screening of the salt–cocrystal continuum in comparison with pure p K a analysis.",

The conformation adopted by the side chain is extended in (1) and folded in (2).

    "abstract": "Most applications of high-resolution NMR to questions of short-range order/disorder in inorganic materials have been made in systems where ions with unpaired electron spins are of negligible concentration, with structural information extracted primarily from chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling parameters, and nuclear dipolar couplings. In some cases, however, the often-large additional resonance shifts caused by interactions between unpaired electron and nuclear spins can provide unique new structural information in materials with contents of paramagnetic cations ranging from hundreds of ppm to several per cent and even higher. In this brief review we focus on recent work on silicate, phosphate, and oxide materials with relatively low concentrations of paramagnetic ions, where spectral resolution can remain high enough to distinguish interactions between NMR-observed nuclides and one or more magnetic neighbors in different bonding configurations in the first, second, and even farther cation shells. We illustrate the types of information available, some of the limitations of this approach, and the great prospects for future experimental and theoretical work in this field. We give examples for the effects of paramagnetic transition metal, lanthanide, and actinide cation substitutions in simple oxides, pyrochlore, zircon, monazite, olivine, garnet, pyrochlores, and olivine structures.",

In I, there are two 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) molecules (5FC-A and 5FC-B) in the asymmetric unit, with one of the protons disordered between them. 5FC-A and 5FC-B are linked by triple hydrogen bonds, generating two fused rings [two R22(8) ring motifs]. The 5FC-A molecules form a self-complementary base pair [R22(8) ring motif] via a pair of N-H...O hydrogen bonds and the 5FC-B molecules form a similar complementary base pair [R22(8) ring motif]. The combination of these two types of pairing generates a supramolecular ribbon. The 5FC molecules are further hydrogen bonded to the sulfanilate anions and sulfanilic acid molecules via N-H...O hydrogen bonds, generating R44(22) and R66(36) ring motifs. In cocrystal II, two types of base pairs (homosynthons) are observed via a pair of N-H...O/N-H...N hydrogen bonds, generating R22(8) ring motifs. The first type of base pair is formed by the interaction of an N-H group and the carbonyl O atom of 5FC molecules through a couple of N-H...O hydrogen bonds. Another type of base pair is formed via the amino group and a pyrimidine ring N atom of the 5FC molecules through a pair of N-H...N hydrogen bonds. The base pairs (via N-H...N hydrogen bonds) are further bridged by the carboxyl OH group of indole-3-propionic acid and the O atom of 5FC through O-H...O hydrogen bonds on either side of the R22(8) motif. This leads to a DDAA array. In salt III, one of the N atoms of the pyrimidine ring is protonated and interacts with the carboxylate group of the anion through N-H...O hydrogen bonds, leading to the primary ring motif R22(8). Furthermore, the 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidinium (TAP) cations form base pairs [R22(8) homosynthon] via N-H...N hydrogen bonds. A carboxylate O atom of the 3-nitrobenzoate anion bridges two of the amino groups on either side of the paired TAP cations to form another ring [R32(8)]. This leads to the generation of a quadruple DADA array. The crystal structures are further stabilized by π-π stacking (I and III), C-H...π (I and II), C-F...π (I) and C-O...π (II) interactions.",

The structural, electronic and optical properties of this compound were investigated under pressure through the plane wave pseudopotential approach within the framework of density functional theory. A comparison between the computed crystal structure parameters and the corresponding experimental counterparts shows a very good agreement between them. Fitting the pressure–volume data using the third-order Birch–Murnaghan equation of state yielded a bulk modulus B 0 = 38.17 GPa and a pressure derivative of bulk modulus B ' 0 = 8.2 for hexagonal ZrSe 2 . The relationship between the band structure and pressure is revealed. We calculated the total density of state (TDOS) under different pressures and partial density of state (PDOS) from 0 to 10 GPa. According to our calculations, metallization of hexagonal ZrSe 2 is predicted to occur at around 10 GPa and pressure-induced band-gap engineering reveals the transformation of the indirect to direct band gap with increasing pressure. Furthermore, optical properties, such as the complex dielectric function, refractive index and reflectivity spectra of this compound, were studied for incident electromagnetic waves in an energy range up to 45 eV. The contributions to various transition peaks in the optical spectra are analyzed and discussed with the help of the energy-dependent imaginary part of the dielectric function.",

Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) searches were used to understand the structural characteristics of the PEPPSI complexes in comparison with the usual N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes. The presence of weak C—H...Cl-type hydrogen-bond and π–π stacking interactions between benzene rings were verified using NCI plots and Hirshfeld surface analysis. The preferred method in the CDA of PEPPSI complexes is to separate their geometries into only two fragments, i.e. the bulky NHC ligand and the remaining fragment. In this study, the geometry of the PEPPSI complex is separated into five fragments, namely benzimidazol-2-ylidene (Bimy), two chlorides, pyridine (Py) and the Pd II ion. Thus, the individual roles of the Pd atom and the Py ligand in the donation and back-donation mechanisms have been clearly revealed. The NHC ligand in the PEPPSI complex in this study acts as a strong σ-donor with a considerable amount of π-back-donation from Pd to C carbene . The electron-poor character of Pd II is supported by π-back-donation from the Pd centre and the weakness of the Pd—N(Py) bond. According to CSD searches, Bimy ligands in PEPPSI complexes have a stronger σ-donating ability than imidazol-2-ylidene ligands in PEPPSI complexes.",

The comparison of binding, activation and product release energies over a large range of interaction distances and angles suggests that four-coordinate short Zn(II)-Nsp(3) bond distances favor a rapid turnover for CO2 hydration. This design strategy is then confirmed by computationally characterizing the reactivity of a known mimic over a range of metal-nitrogen bond lengths.

There are no anomalies pertaining to the atomic displacement parameter of the Ti site, previously reported based on a powder X-ray diffraction analysis of this compound. The anionic substructure contains columns of face-sharing TiBi6 octahedra and linear Bi chains. Due to a significant La(5d) and Bi(6p) orbital mixing, a perfectly one-dimensional character of the Bi chains is not realised, while a three-dimensional electronic structure is established instead. The latter fact explains the stability of the polyanionic pnictide units against Peierls distortions. The hypervalent bonding in the Bi chains is reflected in a rather long Bi-Bi distance of 3.2264 (4) Å and a typical pattern of bonding and antibonding interactions, as revealed by electronic structure calculations.",

The formation of the rhombohedral CuZr 2 Te 4 phase, which is stable in the temperature range 300–700 °C, has been observed. The copper intercalation at room temperature leads to the formation of a phase in which the Cu atoms occupy only octahedral sites in the interlayer space. At temperatures above the decay temperature of the rhombohedral CuZr 2 Te 4 , a layered phase with Cu atoms uniformly distributed between octahedral and tetrahedral sites in the interlayer space is stable. The changes in the crystal structure independent of temperature are in agreement with the previously proposed model, according to which the stability of the layered or the rhombohedral phase is determined by the entropy factor associated with the distribution of the intercalated atoms between the octahedral and tetrahedral sites in the interlayer space.",

The energies associated with the interactions, including the contribution of the different forces, have been evaluated. In general, the π–π stacking interactions are stronger than those reported for conventional π–π complexes, which is attributed to the influence of the metal coordination, which is stronger for Zn than either Cd or Hg.

The complex exhibits a supramolecular three-dimensional framework structure in the crystal lattice. Compound 1 was structurally characterized by elemental analyses, IR and UV–Vis (diffuse reflectance) spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In this compound, aspartic acid acts as a bridge between the two Co atoms and the Mo centres, with the –CH 2 COOH side chain directly linked to the Mo centre in γ-[Mo 8 O 26 ] 4− and the α-carboxylate side chain bound to the Co centre. Commonly, the binding of transition-metal complexes to POMs involves coordination of the metal to a terminal O atom of the POM so that 1 , with a bridging ligand between Mo and Co atoms, belongs to a separate class of hybrid materials. While the starting materials are both chiral and one might expect them to form a chiral hybrid, the decomposition of the chiral Evans–Showell-type POM and its conversion to the centrosymmetric γ-octamolybdate POM, plus the presence of two aspartate ligands centrosymmetrically placed on either side of the POM, leads to the formation of an achiral hybrid. We have studied energetically by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and using the Bader's `atoms-in-molecules' analysis the electrostatically enhanced hydrogen bonds (EEHBs) observed in the solid state of 1 , which are crucial for the formation of one-dimensional supramolecular assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Experimental electron-density studies based on high-resolution diffraction experiments allow halogen bonds between heavy halogens to be classified. The topological properties of the electron density in Cl...Cl contacts vary smoothly as a function of the interaction distance. The situation is less straightforward for halogen bonds between iodine and small electronegative nucleophiles, such as nitrogen or oxygen, where the electron density in the bond critical point does not simply increase for shorter distances. The number of successful charge–density studies involving iodine is small, but at least individual examples for three cases have been observed. ( a ) Very short halogen bonds between electron-rich nucleophiles and heavy halogen atoms resemble three-centre–four-electron bonds, with a rather symmetric heavy halogen and without an appreciable σ hole. ( b ) For a narrow intermediate range of halogen bonds, the asymmetric electronic situation for the heavy halogen with a pronounced σ hole leads to rather low electron density in the (3,−1) critical point of the halogen bond; the properties of this bond critical point cannot fully describe the nature of the associated interaction. ( c ) For longer and presumably weaker contacts, the electron density in the halogen bond critical point is only to a minor extent reduced by the presence of the σ hole and hence may be higher than in the aforementioned case. In addition to the electron density and its derived properties, the halogen–carbon bond distance opposite to the σ hole and the Raman frequency for the associated vibration emerge as alternative criteria to gauge the halogen-bond strength. We find exceptionally long C—I distances for tetrafluorodiiodobenzene molecules in cocrystals with short halogen bonds and a significant red shift for their Raman vibrations.",

The new form, denoted (Ib), was observed unexpectedly during an attempt to cocrystallize cytosine with catechol.

The previously known form, denoted (Ia), crystallizes in the orthorhombic noncentrosymmetric space group P212121. The cytosine molecule is planar in both forms.

To take advantage of each of the inherent characteristics of the two aforementioned functional groups, 2-nicotinamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole, C8H6N4OS, was synthesized. Since defining chemical connectivity is paramount in understanding biological activity, in this report, the structural characterization of 2-nicotinamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole has been carried out using X-ray crystallographic methods. The NMR-derived assignments were made possible by utilizing one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) NMR techniques. In addition, UV-Visible and IR spectroscopies, and elemental analysis were used to fully characterize the product synthesized by the one-step reaction between nicotinoyl chloride hydrochloride and 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole. Computational parameters related to blood-brain barrier permeability are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Ocotillol-type saponins have a wide spectrum of biological activities. Previous studies indicated that the configuration at the C24 position may be responsible for their stereoselectivity in pharmacological action and pharmacokinetics. Natural ocotillol-type saponins share a 20(S)-form but it has been found that the 20(R)-stereoisomers have different pharmacological effects. The semisynthesis of 20(R)-ocotillol-type saponins has not been reported and it is therefore worthwhile clarifying their crystal structures. Two C24 epimeric 20(R)-ocotillol-type saponins, namely (20R,24S)-20,24-epoxydammarane-3β,12β,25-triol, C30H52O4, (III), and (20R,24R)-20,24-epoxydammarane-3β,12β,25-triol monohydrate, C30H52O4·H2O, (IV), were synthesized, and their structures were elucidated by spectral studies and finally confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The (Me)C-O-C-C(OH) torsion angle of (III) is 146.41 (14)°, whereas the corresponding torsion angle of (IV) is -146.4 (7)°, indicating a different conformation at the C24 position. The crystal stacking in (III) generates an R4(4)(8) motif, through which the molecules are linked into a one-dimensional double chain. The chains are linked via nonclassical C-H...O hydrogen bonds into a two-dimensional network, and further stacked into a three-dimensional structure. In contrast to (III), epimer (IV) crystallizes as a hydrate, in which the water molecules act as hydrogen-bond donors linking one-dimensional chains into a two-dimensional network through intermolecular O-H...O hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen-bonded chains extend helically along the crystallographic a axis and generate a C4(4)(8) motif.",

The chelating characteristics of the L-DM(2-) ligand results in the formation of a Cu(II) dimer with a double phenolate bridge in the asymmetric unit.

    "abstract": "This report presents a comprehensive investigation into the synthesis and characterization of Schiff base compounds derived from benzenesulfonamide. The synthesis process, involved the reaction between N -cycloamino-2-sulfanilamide and various substituted o -salicylaldehydes, resulted in a set of compounds that were subjected to rigorous characterization using advanced spectral techniques, including 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and FT–IR spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, an in-depth assessment of the synthesized compounds was conducted through Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) analysis, in conjunction with docking studies, to elucidate their pharmacokinetic profiles and potential. Impressively, the ADMET analysis showcased encouraging drug-likeness properties of the newly synthesized Schiff bases. These computational findings were substantiated by molecular properties derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the B3LYP/6-31G* method within the Jaguar Module of Schrödinger 2023-2 from Maestro (Schrodinger LLC, New York, USA). The exploration of frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) enabled the computation of global reactivity descriptors (GRDs), encompassing charge separation ( E gap ) and global softness ( S ). Notably, within this analysis, one Schiff base, namely, 4-bromo-2-{ N -[2-(pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]carboximidoyl}phenol, 20 , emerged with the smallest charge separation (Δ E gap = 3.5780 eV), signifying heightened potential for biological properties. Conversely, 4-bromo-2-{ N -[2-(piperidine-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]carboximidoyl}phenol, 17 , exhibited the largest charge separation (Δ E gap = 4.9242 eV), implying a relatively lower propensity for biological activity. Moreover, the synthesized Schiff bases displayed remarkeable inhibition of tankyrase poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzymes, integral in colon cancer, surpassing the efficacy of a standard drug used for the same purpose. Additionally, their bioavailability scores aligned closely with established medications such as trifluridine and 5-fluorouracil. The exploration of molecular electrostatic potential through colour mapping delved into the electronic behaviour and reactivity tendencies intrinsic to this diverse range of molecules.",

    "abstract": "Poly-stoichiometry of hydrated phases is relatively uncommon for organic materials and extended libraries of such species adopting different aqua-to-substrate ratios are still rare. The kinetically controlled higher hydrates could be particularly interesting for their structural relationships, which presumably may imprint some features of the substrate/substrate and aqua/substrate bonding in solutions, and provide insights into the nucleation stage. Two metastable high hydrates are prepared by crash crystallization. The crystal structures of 3,3′,5,5′-tetranitro-4,4′-bipyrazole tetrahydrate, C 6 H 2 N 8 O 8 ·4H 2 O, (1), and 3,3′,5,5′-tetranitro-4,4′-bipyrazole pentahydrate, C 6 H 2 N 8 O 8 ·5H 2 O, (2), are intrinsically related to the previously reported anhydrate and monohydrate, while displaying natural evolution of the patterns upon progressive watering. The accumulation of the water molecules causes their clustering, with the generation of one-dimensional tapes and two-dimensional layers in the genuine channel hydrates (1) and (2), respectively, versus the pocket hydrate structure of C 6 H 2 N 8 O 8 ·H 2 O. The hydration primarily affects the pyrazole sites. It conditions the emergence of N—H...O and O—H...N hydrogen bonds, which is a destructive factor for pyrazole/pyrazole N—H...N hydrogen bonding. At the same time, extensive noncovalent interactions of the organic molecules, namely, lone pair–π-hole O...N interactions of the NO 2 /NO 2 and NO 2 /pyrazole types, are more competitive to the hydrogen bonding and the motifs of mutual organic/organic stacks remain intact with the increase in hydration. These trends agree with the results of Hirshfeld surface analysis. The contributions of the contacts involving H atoms are increased in line with the growing number of water molecules, while the fraction of O...N/N...O (NO 2 ) contacts is nearly invariant. One may postulate the significance of the lone pair–π-hole interactions to the aggregation of nitro species in solutions and their relevance for the sebsequent development of the solid-state patterns through nucleation.",

    "abstract": "Ab initio prediction of sensible crystal structures can be regarded as a crucial task in the quickly-developing methodology of NMR crystallography. In this contribution, an evolutionary algorithm was used for the prediction of magnesium (poly)sulfide crystal structures with various compositions. The employed approach successfully identified all three experimentally detected forms of MgS, i.e. the stable rocksalt form and the metastable wurtzite and zincblende forms. Among magnesium polysulfides with a higher content of sulfur, the most probable structure with the lowest formation energy was found to be MgS 2 , exhibiting a modified rocksalt structure, in which S 2− anions were replaced by S 2 2− dianions. Magnesium polysulfides with even larger fractions of sulfur were not predicted to be stable. For the lowest-energy structures, 25 Mg quadrupolar coupling constants and chemical shift parameters were calculated using the density functional theory approach. The calculated NMR parameters could be well rationalized by the symmetries of the local magnesium environments, by the coordination of magnesium cations and by the nature of the surrounding anions. In the future, these parameters could serve as a reference for the experimentally determined 25 Mg NMR parameters of magnesium sulfide species.",

    "abstract": "Metoprolol {systematic name: ( RS )-1-isopropylamino-3-[4-(2-methoxyethyl)phenoxy]propan-2-ol}, C 15 H 25 NO 3 , is a cardioselective β 1 -adrenergic blocking agent that shares part of its molecular skeleton with a large number of other β-blockers. Results from its solid-state characterization by single-crystal and variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry are presented. Its molecular and crystal arrangements have been further investigated by molecular modelling, by a Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) survey and by Hirshfeld surface analysis. In the crystal, the side arm bearing the isopropyl group, which is common to other β-blockers, adopts an all-trans conformation, which is the most stable arrangement from modelling data. The crystal packing of metoprolol is dominated by an O—H...N/N...H—O pair of hydrogen bonds (as also confirmed by a Hirshfeld surface analysis), which gives rise to chains containing alternating R and S metoprolol molecules extending along the b axis, supplemented by a weaker O...H—N/N—H...O pair of interactions. In addition, within the same stack of molecules, a C—H...O contact, partially oriented along the b and c axes, links homochiral molecules. Amongst the solid-state structures of molecules structurally related to metoprolol deposited in the CSD, the β-blocker drug betaxolol shows the closest analogy in terms of three-dimensional arrangement and interactions. Notwithstanding their close similarity, the crystal lattices of the two drugs respond differently on increasing temperature: metoprolol expands anisotropically, while for betaxolol, an isotropic thermal expansion is observed.",

    "abstract": "Dexketoprofen [(2S)-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propanoic acid], C16H14O3, is the S-enantiomer of ketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties, and finds applications for the short-term treatment of mild to moderate pain. A new crystalline phase of dexketoprofen is reported. Its solid-state structure was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). The molecular structure of the two independent molecules found in the asymmetric unit of this new phase (DXKP-β) were compared to those of the already known crystal form of dexketoprofen (DXKP-α) and with the S-enantiomer of the racemic compound. The three different conformers of dexketoprofen found in DXKP-α and DXKP-β were then investigated by computational methods. The optimized structures are very close to the corresponding starting geometries and do not differ significantly in energy. The crystal packing of DXKP-β was studied by means of Hirshfeld surface (HS) analysis; interaction energies were also calculated. A comparison with DXKP-α shows close similarities between the two crystal forms, i.e. in both cases, molecules assemble through the catemer O-H...O synthon of the carboxylic acid stabilized by additional C-H...O contacts and, accordingly, the interaction energies, as well as the contributions to the HS area, are very similar. Finally, the thermal behaviour of the two polymorphs of dexketoprofen was assessed by means of XRD (both from single crystal and microcrystalline powder) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); both crystal forms are stable under the experimental conditions adopted (air, 300-350 K for DXKP-α and 300-340 K DXKP-β) and no solid-solid phase transition occurs between the two crystal forms in the investigated temperature range (from 100 K up to ca 350 K).",

    "abstract": "Metal oxides have a large storage capacity when employed as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, they often suffer from poor capacity retention due to their low electrical conductivity and huge volume variation during the charge–discharge process. To overcome these limitations, fabrication of metal oxides/carbon hybrids with hollow structures can be expected to further improve their electrochemical properties. Herein, ZnO-Co 3 O 4 nanocomposites embedded in N-doped carbon (ZnO-Co 3 O 4 @N-C) nanocages with hollow dodecahedral shapes have been prepared successfully by the simple carbonizing and oxidizing of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Benefiting from the advantages of the structural features, i.e. the conductive N-doped carbon coating, the porous structure of the nanocages and the synergistic effects of different components, the as-prepared ZnO-Co 3 O 4 @N-C not only avoids particle aggregation and nanostructure cracking but also facilitates the transport of ions and electrons. As a result, the resultant ZnO-Co 3 O 4 @N-C shows a discharge capacity of 2373 mAh g −1 at the first cycle and exhibits a retention capacity of 1305 mAh g −1 even after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g −1 . In addition, a reversible capacity of 948 mAh g −1 is obtained at a current density of 2 A g −1 , which delivers an excellent high-rate cycle ability.",

The molecule of (I) has crystallographically imposed mirror symmetry ( Z ′ = 0.5). All three solid-state structures are slightly nonplanar, the dihedral angles between the planes of the arene and pyrrole rings ranging from 0.40 (7)° in (III) to 1.82 (18)° in (II). Nevertheless, a density functional theory (DFT) study predicts completely planar conformations for the isolated molecules. To estimate the influence of nitro-group substitution on aromaticity, the HOMA (harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity) descriptor of π-electron delocalization has been calculated in each case. The HOMA indices for the isolated and solid-state molecules are relatively consistent and decrease in value for aromatic rings that are substituted with a π-electron-withdrawing nitro group. Substitution of the arene ring influences the π-electron delocalization in the ring only weakly, showing strong resistance to a perturbation of its geometry, contrary to what is observed for nitro substitution of the five-membered heterocyclic pyrrole ring. In (II), the molecules are arranged in near-planar dimers connected to each other by strong N—H...O hydrogen bonds that stack parallel to the crystallographic b axis. A similar stacking arrangement is observed in (III), although here the stacked structure is formed by stand-alone molecules.",

The templating role of the 2ap cation in all of the reported crystalline substances is governed by the formation of characteristic charge-assisted hydrogen-bonded pairs with sulfate anions and the presence of π–π interactions between the cations. Additionally, both coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules are involved in hydrogen-bond formation. As a consequence, extensive three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding patterns are formed in the reported crystal structures.",

    "abstract": "Square-planar complexes are commonly formed by transition metal ions having a d 8 electron configuration. Planar cyanometallate anions have been used extensively as design elements in supramolecular coordination systems. In particular, square-planar tetracyanometallate(II) ions, i.e. [ M (CN) 4 ] 2− ( M II = Ni, Pd or Pt), are used as good building blocks for bimetallic Hofmann-type assemblies and their analogues. Square-planar tetracyanonickellate(II) complexes have been extensively developed with N -donor groups as additional co-ligands, but studies of these systems using O -donor ligands are scarce. A new cyanide-bridged Cu II –Ni II heterometallic compound, poly[[diaquatetra-μ 2 -cyanido-κ 8 C : N -nickel(II)copper(II)] monohydrate], {[Cu II Ni II (CN) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ]·H 2 O} n , has been synthesized and characterized by X-ray single-crystal diffraction analyses, vibrational spectroscopy (FT–IR), thermal analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetic moment measurements. The structural analysis revealed that it has a two-dimensional grid-like structure built up of cationic [Cu(H 2 O) 2 ] 2+ and anionic [Ni(CN) 4 ] 2− units connected through bridging cyanide ligands. The overall three-dimensional supramolecular network is expanded by a combination of interlayer O—H...N and intralayer O—H...O hydrogen-bond interactions. The first decomposition reactions take place at 335 K under a static air atmosphere, which illustrates the existence of guest water molecules in the interlayer spaces. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum confirms that the Cu II cation has an axial coordination symmetry and that the unpaired electrons occupy the d _{{{{x}^2}-y^2} orbital. In addition, magnetic investigations showed that antiferromagnetic interactions exist in the Cu II atoms through the diamagnetic [Ni(CN) 4 ] 2− ion.",

Within this controlled set, we make comparisons of the isotropic chemical shifts and the principal values of the chemical shift tensor. The dispersion at 14.1 T (600 MHz 1 H) shows crystallographic splittings in some of the resonances in the magic angle spinning spectra. By comparing the isotropic chemical shifts of individual C atoms across the four cocrystals, we are able to identify pronounced effects on the local electronic structure at some sites. We perform a similar analysis of the principal values of the chemical shift tensors for the anisotropic C atoms (most of the ring C atoms for the API mimics and the carbonyl C atoms of the diacid coformers) and link them to differences in the known crystal structures. We discuss the future prospects for extending this type of study to incorporate the full chemical shift tensor, including its orientation in the crystal frame of reference.",

High-throughput solid-form screening was performed to screen for new solid forms with improved pharmaceutically relevant properties. During polymorph screening, we obtained two solvates with methanol (CH 3 OH) and ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH). Binary systems with caffeine (systematic name: 3,7-dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1 H -purine-2,6-dione, C 8 H 10 N 4 O 2 ) and nicotinamide (C 6 H 6 N 2 O), polymorphs with urea (CH 4 N 2 O) and eutectics with similar drugs, like allopurinol and febuxostat, were prepared using the crystal engineering approach. All these novel solid forms were confirmed by XRD, DSC and FT–IR. The crystal structures were solved by single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction. The crystal structures indicate that the lesinurad molecule is highly flexible and the triazole moiety, along with the rotatable thioacetic acid (side chain) and cyclopropane ring, is almost perpendicular to the planar naphthalene moiety. The carboxylic acid–triazole heterosynthon in the drug is interrupted by the presence of methanol and ethanol molecules in their crystal structures and forms intermolecular macrocyclic rings. The caffeine cocrystal maintains the consistency of the acid–triazole heterosynthons as in the drug and, in addition, they are bound by several auxiliary interactions. In the binary system of nicotinamide and urea, the acid–triazole heterosynthon is replaced by an acid–amide synthon. Among the urea cocrystal polymorphs, Form I ( P \\overline{1}, 1:1) consists of an acid–amide (urea) heterodimer, whereas in Form II ( P 2 1 / c , 2:2), both acid–amide heterosynthons and urea–urea dimers co-exist. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further support the experimentally observed synthon hierarchies in the cocrystals. Aqueous solubility experiments of lesinurad and its binary solids in pH 5 acetate buffer medium indicate the apparent solubility order lesinurad–urea Form I (43-fold) &gt; lesinurad–caffeine (20-fold) &gt; lesinurad–allopurinol (12-fold) ≃ lesinurad–nicotinamide (11-fold) &gt; lesinurad, and this order is correlated with the crystal structures.",

    "abstract": "The name `bath salts', for an emerging class of synthetic cathinones, is derived from an attempt to evade prosecution and law enforcement. These are truly illicit drugs that have psychoactive CNS (central nervous system) stimulant effects and they have seen a rise in abuse as recreational drugs in the last few years since first having been seen in Japan in 2006. The ease of synthesis and modification of specific functional groups of the parent cathinone make these drugs particularly difficult to regulate. MDPV (3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone) is commonly encountered as its hydrochloride salt (C16H21NO3·HCl), in either the hydrated or the anhydrous forms. This `bath salt' has various names in the US, e.g. `Super Coke', `Cloud Nine', and `Ivory Wave', to name just a few. We report here the structures of two forms of the HCl salt, one as a mixed bromide/chloride salt, C16H22NO3(+)·0.343Br(-)·0.657Cl(-) [systematic name: 1-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-2-(pyrrolidin-1-ium-1-yl)pentan-1-one bromide/chloride (0.343/0.657)], and the other with the H7O3(+) cation, as well as the HCl counter-ion [systematic name: hydroxonium 1-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-2-(pyrrolidin-1-ium-1-yl)pentan-1-one dichloride, H7O3(+)·C16H22NO3(+)·2Cl(-)]. This is one of a very few structures (11 to be exact) in which we have a new example of a precisely determined hydroxonium cation. During the course of researching the clandestine manufacture of MDPV, we were surprised by the fact that a common precursor of this illicit stimulant is known to be the fragrant species piperonal, which is present in the fragrances of orchids, most particularly in the case of the vanilla orchid. We found that MDPV can be made by a Grignard reaction of this heliotropin. This may also explain the unexpected appearance of the bromide counter-ion in some of the salts we encountered (C16H21NO3·HBr), one of which is presented here [systematic name: 1-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-2-(pyrrolidin-1-ium-1-yl)pentan-1-one bromide, C16H22NO3(+)·Br(-)]. Complexation of MDPV with a forensic crystallizing reagent, HAuCl4, yields the tetrachloridoaurate salt of this drug, (C16H22NO3)[AuCl4]. The heavy-metal complexing agent HAuCl4 has been used for over a century to identify common quarternary nitrogen-containing drugs via microscopic identification. Another street drug, called ethylone (3,4-methylenedioxyethylcathinone), is regularly sold and abused as its hydrochloride salt (C12H15NO3·HCl), and its structure is herein described (systematic name: N-{1-[(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)carbonyl]ethyl}ethanaminium chloride, C12H16NO3(+)·Cl(-)). Marketed and sold as a `bath salt', `plant feeder', or `cleaning product', this drug is nothing more than a slight chemical modification of the banned drug methylone (3,4-methylenedioxymethcathinone). As with previously popular synthetic cathinones, the abuse of ethylone has seen a recent increase due to regulatory efforts on previous generations of cathinones that are now banned.",

    "abstract": "Ag I -containing coordination complexes have attracted attention because of their photoluminescence properties and antimicrobial activities and, in principle, these properties depend on the nature of the structural topologies. A novel two-dimensional silver(I) complex with the anti-inflammatory diclofenac molecule, namely bis{μ-2-[2-(2,6-dichloroanilino)phenyl]acetato-κ 3 O , O ′: O }bis(μ-2,5-dimethylpyrazine-κ 2 N : N ′)silver(I), [Ag 2 (C 14 H 10 Cl 2 NO 2 ) 2 (C 6 H 8 N 2 )] n , (I), has been synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing that the Ag I ions are chelated by the carboxylate groups of the anionic 2-[2-(2,6-dichloroanilino)phenyl]acetate (dicl) ligand in a μ 3 -η 1 :η 2 coordination mode. Each dicl ligand links three Ag I atoms to generate a one-dimensional infinite chain. Adjacent chains are connected through 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (dmpyz) ligands to form a two-dimensional layer structure parallel to the crystallographic bc plane. The layers are further connected by C—H...π interactions to generate a three-dimensional supramolecular structure. Additionally, the most striking feature is that the structure contains an intramolecular C—H ...Ag anagostic interaction. Furthermore, the title complex has been tested for its in vitro antibacterial activity and is determined to be highly effective on the studied microorganisms.",

However, the comparatively stable phenyl-substituted compounds have not been fully characterized yet, offering a promising backbone. Attempts to isolate the benzoacylium cation have only been carried out starting from the acyl chloride with weaker chloride-based Lewis acids. Therefore, only adducts of 1,4-stabilized acyl cations could be obtained. Due to the low melting point of benzoyl fluoride, together with its volitality and sensitivity toward hydrolysis, the structures of the acyl fluoride and its acylium cation have not been determined. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of benzoyl fluoride, C 7 H 5 FO or PhCOF (monoclinic P 2 1 / n , Z = 8) and the benzoacylium undecafluorodiarsenate, C 7 H 5 O + ·As 2 F 11 − or [PhCO] + [As 2 F 11 ] − (monoclinic P 2 1 / n , Z = 4).

    "abstract": "Lithium–sulfur batteries are a promising candidate for the next generation of rechargeable batteries. Despite extensive research on this system over the last decade, a complete understanding of the phase transformations has remained elusive. Conventional in-situ powder X-ray diffraction has struggled to determine the unit cell and space group of the polysulfides formed during charge and discharge cycles due to the high solubility of these solid products in the liquid electrolyte. With the improvement in in-situ electrochemical set-ups dedicated to transmission electron microscopes, three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has the potential to capture the crystal structures of the polysulfides during cycling. In this work, the structure solution and refinement from 3D ED data of elemental sulfur, known to sublimate in the vacuum of transmission electron microscopes, is enabled through the use of an environmental cell with a micro-electromechanical system. This work represents the first step in characterizing sulfur's transformation into lithium polysulfides using in-situ 3D ED.",

Single crystals of sufficient size and quality were recovered from a starting mixture with an Rb 2 O:CaO:SiO 2 molar ratio of 2:1:3. The educts were confined in a lid-covered platinum crucible and gradually cooled from 1050 °C at a rate of 0.3 °C min −1 to 800 °C before being finally quenched in air to ambient conditions. The crystal structure was investigated at −80 and 15 °C from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, with structure determination performed using direct methods. The compound was found to be of orthorhombic symmetry, belonging to the space group Pmmn (No. 59), with a = 5.7363 (6), b = 13.8532 (12), c = 9.9330 (10) Å, V = 789.34 (13) Å 3 and Z = 4 (at 15 °C). The final refinement calculations at ambient temperature converged at R 1 = 0.030 and wR 2 = 0.076 for 773 observed reflections with I &gt; 2σ( I ). The silicate anion is based on pyrosilicate units of composition [Si 2 O 7 ] 6− with point-group symmetry m ( C s ). Charge compensation is achieved by the incorporation of rubidium and calcium cations distributed among a total of five independent sites within the asymmetric unit. Two of the nontetrahedrally coordinated cation sites ( M 4 and M 5) are exclusively occupied by calcium cations, which are surrounded by six O atoms in the form of octahedra or trigonal prisms, respectively. The rubidium cations on the M 1– M 3 sites show more complex coordination environments. The M 2 site, for example, is characterized by a tricapped trigonal prism polyhedron. Notably, the M 3 site exhibits a 50% population of Ca 2+ and Rb + , respectively. The compound shows closer structural resemblances with K 2 Ca 2 Si 2 O 7 and can be derived from a hexagonal aristotype with space-group symmetry P 6 3 / mmc by displacements of the atoms. The corresponding distortion modes can be classified by certain irreducible representations of the high-symmetry parent phase. Structural investigations were completed by determining the thermal expansion tensor for the temperature interval between −80 and 15 °C.",

The mixed cocrystal, namely, (C6I2Cl4)0.75·(C6ICl5)0.25·(BPE), is achieved since both halogen-bond donors are similar in shape and are interchangeable at equivalent crystallographic positions. The combination of I...N and Cl...N halogen bonds generates one-dimensional chains that engage in homogeneous π-stacks, thereby positioning a pair of reactant molecules in a suitable location to photoreact.

In previous work, 1-hydroxy-5-methyl-7-phenylpyrido[3,4- d ]pyridazin-4(3 H )-one ( PM ) was found to display anticancer activity. In the next step of our studies, we synthesized a new derivative of PM , introducing a Cl atom into the PM structure, obtaining CPM , which showed not only anticancer but also anti-inflammatory activity. CPM and the new semi-products of each step of the synthesis were examined by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and FT–IR spectroscopic analyses, and mass spectrometry. CPM forms ( I ) and ( II ) crystallize in the triclinic P 1 and monoclinic C 2/ c space groups, respectively, and differ in the stoichiometry of the CPM and DMSO molecules in the crystal lattice, being 1:1 and 1:1.5 for ( I ) and ( II ), respectively. A powder X-ray diffraction analysis was performed only for solvate ( I ) due to the lack of stability of solvate ( II ). The potential cytotoxicity of CPM was evaluated against the normal cell lines L929 and RPTEC, as well as the cancer cell lines A172, AGS, CACO-2 and HepG2. The anti-inflammatory activity of CPM was also evaluated using colorimetric assay for the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2. The same biological tests were carried out for PM to compare the activities of both compounds. The biological studies revealed that CPM does not exhibit more activity than PM . Moreover, in silico analysis of the bioavailability and molecular docking were performed.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative phase analysis (QPA) by X-ray diffraction is widely used in materials, minerals, metallurgy, etc. But when preferred orientation exists in samples, QPA by single peaks in diffraction patterns will be seriously affected and becomes less exact, for example, for phosphate materials. As an alternative, whole pattern methods (especially the Rietveld method) can be utilized positively and the effect of preferred orientation can be solved mathematically. But application of the Rietveld method generally takes a lot of time, not only in high-accuracy pattern acquisition, but also in continuously refining many parameters for multiple iterative computation, which is not applicable to situations where rapid or automatic QPA is required, such as industrial production, customs inspection, and so on. In this article, a new mathematical method was developed and discussed, and was then reasonably simplified for convenient operation. The simplified method was tested and examined using the N 2 H 9 PO 4 phase, which can produce preferred orientation easily. The results indicated that the QPA deviation is reduced from about 33% using the single-peak method to less than 1% using the new simplified method. Use of the new method and its simplified version is recommended when preferred orientation exists and rapid or automatic QPA is required.",

Crystallizing in the monoclinic space group P 2 1 / c , the compound was analyzed using X-ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the B3LYP functional and 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The results demonstrated a strong correlation between the experimental and theoretical geometrical parameters, with one of the tautomeric forms (denoted K, the NH/C=O tautomer) showing greater stability. Hirshfeld surface analysis revealed significant H...H, C...H and O...H interactions. Energy framework analysis indicated that dispersion forces play a crucial role in crystal stability. The vibrational and UV spectra were consistent between the experimental and theoretical data. The small energy gap in the K tautomeric form suggests higher polarizability, making it a promising candidate for optically active materials. Chemical reactivity descriptors highlighted the enhanced reactivity of the K tautomer. Reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis showed stronger hydrogen bonding in the second tautomer (denoted E, the N=N/C—OH tautomer), while molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) analysis identified high electron density around the O atoms, suggesting electrophilic sites. The high first-order hyperpolarizability of the compound points to potential nonlinear optical (NLO) applications. Biological studies suggested potential antipyretic activity, with COX-2 identified as a promising target for inhibition due to its strong binding affinity and effectiveness.

    "abstract": "The pyrazole-based Schiff base (E)-3-tert-butyl-N-[(2-nitrophenyl)methylidene]-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine, C20H20N4O2, was synthesized in a straightforward manner via a solventless maceration technique, and its structure elucidated through spectroscopic characterization and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The compound exhibits a degree of coplanarity, influenced by the ortho-nitro group on a phenyl ring. Crystal structure analysis, complemented by Hirshfeld surface analysis and QTAIM-C calculations, reveals that the crystal packing is mainly stabilized by a network of π-stacking and dispersion interactions. Notably, H...C π-stacking interactions, particularly those between ortho- and para-C-H atoms of phenyl groups, play a significant role in the packing motif. The Hirshfeld surface also reveals a 5.8% contribution from H...N contacts, involving aliphatic H atoms interacting with a pyrazole N atom. CE-B3LYP calculations highlight the dominance of dispersion forces in the crystal, with the strongest interaction energy calculated to be -58.9 kJ mol-1 between the central molecule and the molecular pair related by the identity symmetry operation (x, y, z). These findings provide insights into the structure-property relationships of this compound and contribute to understanding crystal engineering principles for designing new materials.",

Classical hydrogen bonds are not observed in the crystals of the investigated complexes. Weak intermolecular C-H...F contacts and, as shown by the Hirshfeld surface analysis, H...H interactions have the dominant contributions in the molecular packing in both structures.

At 77 K in frozen methanol/ethanol glass, the complexes exhibit strong luminescence of MLCT origin.

The higher data quality provided by modern diffractomers has enabled a reliable analysis (absent from the earlier reports) of the hydrogen bonding. However, conventional refinement of the structure of 2 was unsatisfactory because of the large number of extremely badly-fitting reflections, leading to many checkCIF `ALERT A' messages that might be detrimental to ease of publication. A refinement using nonspherical scattering factors effectively eliminated this problem. There are three independent molecules of 2 in the asymmetric unit; two are directly connected by two N-H...S hydrogen bonds, forming a dimer with the well-known R22(8) motif. The other molecule forms a topologically identical but inversion-symmetric dimer. Each type of dimer occupies a different region parallel to the ac plane (molecule 1, y ≃ 0; molecules 2 and 3, y ≃ 1/3 and 2/3). All three molecules lie in planes parallel to (031). The title compound is effectively isotypic to 1-ethyl-3-phenylthiourea (another known structure for which the hydrogen bonding was not analysed) because its EtNH group, like the EtO group of 2, is not involved in hydrogen bonding.",

In the crystal structure, proton transfer from the carboxylic acid group of the 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (DNBA) molecule to the thiazole N atom of the 2-aminothiazole (AT) molecule results in salt formation. The protonation is supported by a widened C-N(H)-C ring bond angle. The primary supramolecular synthon is a heterodimeric R22(8) ring motif formed via N-H...O hydrogen bonds. The lattice water molecules play a key role in assembling tetrameric [R42(9)] and hexameric [R65(17)] motifs through N-H...O, OW-HW...O, OW-HW...OW and C-H...OW interactions. These units propagate into hydrogen-bonded chains along the b axis via water-water interactions, which are further linked through C-H...O contacts to generate a 3D network incorporating a large R88(40) ring motif. The crystal structure is further stabilized by carbonyl-π interactions. Hirshfeld surface analysis reveals prominent red spots in the dnorm mapping, indicating strong O-H...O and N-H...O contacts. 2D fingerprint plots confirm the dominance of O...H/H...O interactions, supporting their important role in the cohesion and stability of the crystal structure.",

Biological processes can have very selective activity towards different elements. We investigated the use of microalgae for this purpose by looking at the interaction of Ce, Gd and Yb with the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , which has been induced to form polyphosphate granules. X-ray absorption spectroscopy with XANES and EXAFS at the Ce L 3 -edge, Gd L 3 -edge and Yb L 3 -edge was used to characterize the interaction between the lanthanides and the phosphate-containing algae. All three of the lanthanides, added as the chloride salt to the algae, appeared to react to form phosphate compounds. These form both in the presence of phosphate granules or when there is only a low level of P present. CePO 4 could be determined by XANES, but the structures of GdPO 4 and YbPO 4 were determined by EXAFS analysis without reference to the XAS spectra of the standard compounds. It is proposed that C. reinhardtii or other similar microalgae may be useful in the selective removal of rare earths from solution.",

Different positions of the functional groups relative to each other are of fundamental importance in the way the molecules of these compounds are packed in the unit cells and have an impact on the interactions of the molecules of the compounds with each other. The changes that occur in the crystal structures when O atoms are replaced with S atoms in the functional groups are compared. A characteristic feature of the compounds studied is the lack of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between adjacent –OH or –SH groups.",

The complex was structurally characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Single-crystal structure analysis revealed that the mta 2− anions and ipp ligands are connected according to AABB and ABAB modes to form four distinct helical chains. These helical chains further construct a three-dimensional (3D) framework. Owing to the similar geometries of mta 2− and ipp, combined with the low coordination numbers of the Co II centres, the resulting 3D framework exhibits a fivefold interpenetrating structure. Topological analysis indicates that HU29 can be simplified as a four-connected dia net. UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy shows a broad absorption band in the UV–Vis region and a band gap of 2.72 eV based on the Kubelka–Munk method, indicating semiconductor behaviour. Moreover, a magnetic study reveals that antiferromagnetic interactions occur in HU29 between 300 and 2 K.",

    "abstract": "In coordination chemistry and crystal engineering, many factors influence the construction of coordination polymers and the final frameworks depend greatly on the organic ligands used. The diverse coordination modes of N-donor ligands have been employed to assemble metal-organic frameworks. Carboxylic acid ligands can deprotonate completely or partially when bonding to metal ions and can also act as donors or acceptors of hydrogen bonds; they are thus good candidates for the construction of supramolecular architectures. We synthesized under reflux or hydrothermal conditions two new alkaline earth(II) complexes, namely poly[(1,10-phenanthroline-κ2N,N')bis(μ-3-phenylprop-2-enoato-κ3O,O':O)calcium(II)], [Ca(C10H7O2)2(C10H8N2)]n, (1), and poly[(1,10-phenanthroline-κ2N,N')(μ3-3-phenylprop-2-enoato-κ4O:O,O':O')(μ-3-phenylprop-2-enoato-κ3O,O':O)barium(II)], [Ba(C10H7O2)2(C10H8N2)]n, (2), and characterized them by FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopies, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, as well as by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis. Complex (1) features a chain topology of type 2,4 C4, where the Ca atoms are connected by O and N atoms, forming a distorted bicapped trigonal prismatic geometry. Complex (2) displays chains of topology type 2,3,5 C4, where the Ba atom is nine-coordinated by seven O atoms of bridging/chelating carboxylate groups from two cinnamate ligands and by two N atoms from one phenanthroline ligand, forming a distorted tricapped prismatic arrangement. Weak C-H...O hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions between phenanthroline ligands are responsible to the formation of a supramolecular three-dimensional network. The thermal decompositions of (1) and (2) in the temperature range 297-1173 K revealed that they both decompose in three steps and transform to the corresponding metal oxide.",

    "abstract": "During the past decade, isopolyoxotungstates (iso-POTs) and their derivatives have been greatly developed due to their unique structures and potential applications in luminescence, magnetism, catalysis etc . This brief review is principally focused on the main research progress on iso-POTs, iso-POT-based transition-metal derivatives, iso-POT-based rare-earth derivatives, iso-POT-based organometallic derivatives and iso-POT-based heterometallic derivatives, and gives a summary of some representative examples of their syntheses, structures and related properties. In addition, an outlook on the future of this area is presented in the final section. We believe that this systematic commentary on iso-POTs and their derivatives will not only disclose a rich set of iso-POT structures, but also reveal a more promising direction for the further functionalization of iso-POTs.",

The ability of AP to form solvates has been investigated and three solvatomorphs of AP, namely, the AP ethyl acetate hemisolvate, C22H24N2O7S·0.5C4H8O2, the AP toluene hemisolvate, C22H24N2O7S·0.5C7H8, and the AP dichloromethane monosolvate, C22H24N2O7S·CH2Cl2, were obtained. The three AP solvatomorphs were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was used to analyze the structures, crystal symmetry, packing modes, stoichiometry and hydrogen-bonding interactions of the solvatomorphs. In addition, dissolution analyses were performed to study the dissolution rates of different AP solvatomorph tablets in vitro and to make comparisons with commercial apremilast tablets (produced by Celgene); all three solvatomorphs showed similar dissolution rates and similar values of the similarity factor f2 in a comparison of their dissolution profiles.",

The molecular packing in the three EMX salts was studied by means of solid-state density functional theory (DFT), followed by QTAIMC (quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals) analysis. It was found that the major contribution to the packing energy comes from pyridine–carboxylate and hydroxy–carboxylate heterosynthons forming infinite one-dimensional ribbons, with [EMX+Adp] additionally stabilized by hydrogen-bonded C (9) chains of Adp − ions. The melting processes of the [EMX+Mlt] (1:1), [EMX+Mln] (1:1) and [EMX+Adp] (1:1) salts were studied and the fusion enthalpy was found to increase with the increase of the calculated lattice energy. The dissolution process of the EMX salts in buffer (pH 7.4) was also studied.

The complexes form centrosymmetric dimers that are linked into one-dimensional columns by C—H...Cl and N—O...H interactions in (I) and (II), respectively. C—H...Cl interactions in (II) generate two R 2 1 (7) loops that merge into a single R 2 1 (10) loop. These interactions involve the alkene, pyrazole and benzene rings, hence restricting the ligand rotation and giving rise to a planar conformation. Unlike (II), complex (I) exhibits a twisted conformation of the ligand and a pair of molecules forms a centrosymmetric dimer with an R 2 2 (10) loop via C—H...O interactions. The unique supramolecular structures of (I) and (II) are determined by their planarity and weak interactions. The planar conformation of (II) provides a base for appreciable π–π stacking interactions compared to (I). In addition, an N—O...π interaction stabilizes the supramolecular structure of (II). We report herein the first n →π* interactions of Re I tricarbonyl complexes, which account for 0.33 kJ mol −1 . Intermolecular C—H...Cl and C—H...O interactions are present in both complexes, with (II) showing a greater preference for these interactions compared to (I), with cumulative contributions of 48.7 and 41.5%, respectively. The influence of inductive (fluoro) and/or resonance (nitro) effects on the π-stacking ability was further supported by LOLIPOP (localized orbital locator-integrated π over plane) analysis. The benzene ring of (II) demonstrated a higher π-stacking ability compared to that of (I), which is supported by the intrinsic planar geometry. The HOMA (harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity) index of (I) revealed more aromaticity with respect to (II), suggesting that NO 2 greatly perturbed the aromaticity. The Hirshfeld fingerprint (FP) plots revealed the preference of (II) over (I) for π–π contacts, with contributions of 6.8 and 4.4%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Proton conduction in crystalline porous materials has received much attention from basic scientific research through to practical applications. Polyoxometalates (POMs) can efficiently transport protons because of their small superficial negative charge density. A simple method for enhancing proton conductivity is to introduce NH 4 + into the crystal structure, because NH 4 + can form hydrogen bonds and function as a proton carrier. According to these considerations, NH 4 + was introduced into the porous structure of A 2 [Cr 3 O(OOCH) 6 (etpy) 3 ] 2 [α-SiW 12 O 40 ]· n H 2 O ( A = Li, Na, K and Cs; etpy = 4-ethylpyridine) ( I-A + ) via topotactic cation exchange.

The proton conductivity and activation energy greatly decreased and increased, respectively, with the decrease in RH, suggesting that protons migrate as NH 4 + and/or H 3 O + under low RH (vehicle mechanism).",

    "abstract": "The design and preparation of chiral metal–organic frameworks (CMOFs) from achiral ligands are a big challenge. Using 3-nitro-4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoic acid (H L ) as a new linker, a total of eight chiral lanthanide–organic frameworks (LOFs), namely poly[diaquatris[μ 2 -3-nitro-4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoato-κ 2 O : O ′]lanthanide(III)], L- and D-[Ln(C 12 H 7 N 2 O 4 ) 3 (H 2 O) 2 ] n [( 1 ), Ln = Eu; ( 2 ), Ln = Gd; ( 3 ), Ln = Dy; ( 4 ), Ln = Tb], were hydrothermally synthesized without chiral reagents and determined by X-ray crystallography. Crystal structure analyses show that L-( 1 )–( 4 ) crystallize in the hexagonal P 6 5 space group and are isomorphous and isostructural, while the enantiomers D-( 1 )–( 4 ) crystallize in the hexagonal P 6 1 space group. All Ln III ions are octacoordinated by six carboxyl O atoms of six 3-nitro-4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoate ligands and two water molecules in a dodecahedral geometry. A one-dimensional neutral helical [Ln 2 (CO 2 ) 3 ] n chain is observed in ( 1 )–( 4 ) as a chiral origin. These helical chains are further interconnected via directional hydrogen-bonding interactions between pyridyl groups and water molecules to construct a three-dimensional (3D) homochiral network with hex topology. The present CMOF structure is the first chiral 3D hydrogen-bonded hex -net and shows good water stability. Solid-state circular dichroism (CD) signals revealed that ( 1 )–( 4 ) crystallized through spontaneous resolution. Furthermore, ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) display a strong red and green photoluminescence at room temperature, respectively, but their intensities reduce to almost half at 200 °C. Notably, upon excitation under visible light (463 nm), a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of ( 1 ) in the solid state is observed for the first time, with a g lum value of 2.61 × 10 −2 .",

By introducing electron-donating groups, such as NH 2 , the electron density of the molecule is changed and thus interactions with the bromine substituent may alter. Herein, the crystal structures of meta -bromonitrobenzene and its NH 2 -substituted derivatives are analyzed. In all four described structures, namely m -bromonitrobenzene [Charlton &amp; Trotter (1963).

The Hirshfeld surface analysis (HS) and Reduced Density Gradient NonCovalent Interaction (RDG NCI) plots are used to prove the relevance, directionality and stabilizing nature of these interactions. Their modifications have been associated with the position of the amino group in the molecular structure and its influence on charge distribution analyzed with electrostatic potential surfaces (EPS). The diversification of the interactions has been correlated with a σ-hole potential value that enables a switching of the Br-atom character from electrophilic to nucleophilic.",

With this in mind, a systematic knowledge of the structural and supramolecular features in recognition of those properties is essential. This work is the first comprehensive summary of noncovalent interactions combined with a library of supramolecular synthon patterns in all crystal structures of amino acids with the Fmoc moiety reported so far. Moreover, a new Fmoc-protected amino acid, namely, 2-{[(9H-fluoren-9-ylmethoxy)carbonyl](methyl)amino}-3-{4-[(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)oxy]phenyl}propanoic acid or N-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-O-tert-butyl-N-methyltyrosine, Fmoc-N-Me-Tyr(t-Bu)-OH, C29H31NO5, was successfully synthesized and the structure of its unsolvated form was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structural, conformational and energy landscape was investigated in detail by combined experimental and in silico approaches, and further compared to N-Fmoc-phenylalanine [Draper et al. (2015). CrystEngComm, 42, 8047-8057]. Geometries were optimized by the density functional theory (DFT) method either in vacuo or in solutio. The polarizable conductor calculation model was exploited for the evaluation of the hydration effect. Hirshfeld surface analysis revealed that H...H, C...H/H...C and O...H/H...O interactions constitute the major contributions to the total Hirshfeld surface area in all the investigated systems. The molecular electrostatic potentials mapped over the surfaces identified the electrostatic complementarities in the crystal packing. The prediction of weak hydrogen-bonded patterns via Full Interaction Maps was computed. Supramolecular motifs formed via C-H...O, C-H...π, (fluorenyl)C-H...Cl(I), C-Br...π(fluorenyl) and C-I...π(fluorenyl) interactions are observed. Basic synthons, in combination with the Long-Range Synthon Aufbau Modules, further supported by energy-framework calculations, are discussed. Furthermore, the relevance of Fmoc-based supramolecular hydrogen-bonding patterns in biocomplexes are emphasized, for the first time.",

The results of DFT calculations demonstrate that the strongest/weakest interactions belong to Be 2+ /K + complexes.

In the structure of the ammonium salt, (I), the ammonium cations, arsonate anions and water molecules interact through inter-species N-H...O and arsonate and water O-H...O hydrogen bonds, giving the common two-dimensional layers lying parallel to (010). These layers are extended into three dimensions through bridging hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the para-amine group acting both as a donor and an acceptor. In the structure of the sodium salt, (II), the Na(+) cation is coordinated by five O-atom donors, one from a single monodentate arsonate ligand, two from monodentate water molecules and two from bridging water molecules, giving a very distorted square-pyramidal coordination environment. The water bridges generate one-dimensional chains extending along c and extensive interchain O-H...O and N-H...O hydrogen-bonding interactions link these chains, giving an overall three-dimensional structure. The two structures reported here are the first reported examples of salts of p-arsanilic acid.",

    "abstract": "Structural studies have been carried out of two solid forms of niclosamide [5-chloro-N-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide, NCL], a widely used anthelmintic drug, namely niclosamide methanol monosolvate, C13H8Cl2N2O4·CH3OH or NCL·MeOH, and niclosamide monohydrate, denoted HA. The structure of the methanol solvate obtained from single-crystal X-ray diffraction is reported for the first time, elucidating the key host-guest hydrogen-bonding interactions which lead to solvate formation. The essentially planar NCL host molecules interact via π-stacking and pack in a herringbone-type arrangement, giving rise to channels along the crystallographic a axis in which the methanol guest molecules are located. The methanol and NCL molecules interact via short O-H...O hydrogen bonds. Laboratory powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements reveal that the initially phase-pure NCL·MeOH solvate readily transforms into NCL monohydrate within hours under ambient conditions. PXRD further suggests that the NCL monohydrate, HA, is isostructural with the NCL·MeOH solvate. This is consistent with the facile transformation of the methanol solvate into the hydrate when stored in air. The crystal packing and the topology of guest-molecule inclusion are compared with those of other NCL solvates for which the crystal structures are known, giving a consistent picture which correlates well with known experimentally observed desolvation properties.",

    "abstract": "Materials with strong electronic correlations are at the cutting edge of experimental and theoretical studies, capturing the attention of researchers for a great variety of interesting phenomena: metal-insulator, phase and magnetic spin transitions, `heavy fermion' systems, interplay between magnetic order and superconductivity, appearance and disappearance of local magnetic moments, and transport property anomalies. It is clear that the richness of physical phenomena for these compounds is a result of partially filled 3d, 4f or 5f electron shells with local magnetic moments preserved in the solid state. Strong interactions of d and f electrons with each other and with itinerant electronic states of the material are responsible for its anomalous properties. Electronic structure calculations for strongly correlated materials should explicitly take into account Coulombic interactions between d or f electrons. Recent advances in this field are related to the development of the LDA+DMFT method, which combines local density approximation (LDA) with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to account for electronic correlation effects. In recent years, LDA+DMFT has allowed the successful treatment not only of simple systems but also of complicated real compounds. Nowadays, the LDA+DMFT method is the state-of-the-art tool for investigating correlated metals and insulators, spin and metal-insulator transitions (MIT) in transition-metal compounds in paramagnetic and magnetically ordered phases.",

In the structure of magnesium salt (I), the centrosymmetric octahedral [Mg(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ cation, the two hydrogen p -arsanilate anions and the four water molecules of solvation form a three-dimensional network structure through inter-species O—H and N—H hydrogen-bonding interactions with water and arsonate O-atom and amine N-atom acceptors. In one-dimensional coordination polymer (II), the distorted octahedral CaO 6 coordination polyhedron comprises two trans -related water molecules and four arsonate O-atom donors from bridging hydrogen arsanilate ligands. One bridging extension is four-membered via a single O atom and the other is eight-membered via O : O ′-bridging, both across inversion centres, giving a chain coordination polymer extending along the [100] direction. Extensive hydrogen-bonding involving O—H...O, O—H...N and N—H...O interactions gives an overall three-dimensional structure. The structures of the polymeric Sr and Ba complexes (III) and (IV), respectively, are isotypic and are based on irregular M O 7 coordination polyhedra about the M 2+ centres, which lie on twofold rotation axes along with one of the coordinated water molecules. The coordination centres are linked through inversion-related arsonate O : O ′-bridges, giving eight-membered ring motifs and forming coordination polymeric chains extending along the [100] direction. Inter-chain N—H...O and O—H...O hydrogen-bonding interactions extend the structures into three dimensions and the crystal packing includes π–π ring interactions [minimum ring centroid separations = 3.4666 (17) Å for (III) and 3.4855 (8) Å for (IV)].",

The lattice parameters, the individual and average bond lengths involving M1, and the distortion parameters scale well with the ionic radius of the M1 cation. NaGaGe2O6 has more distorted M1 sites and more extended tetrahedral chains than NaInGe2O6, in which a high degree of kinking is required to maintain the connection between the octahedral and tetrahedral building units of the pyroxene structure. An exceptional case is NaMnGe2O6, in which the strong Jahn-Teller effect of Mn(3+) results in more distorted octahedral sites than expected according to linear extrapolation from the other NaM(3+)Ge2O6 pyroxenes. In contrast with the literature, minor incorporations of V(5+) in the tetrahedral site and a corresponding reduction of Mn(3+) to Mn(2+) in the octahedral sites in the present sample lower the Jahn-Teller distortion and stabilize the Mn-bearing pyroxene, even allowing its synthesis at ambient pressure.",

The present study aimed to synthesize cocrystals of the heterocyclic antitubercular agent pyrazinamide ( PYZ , 1 , BCS III) and the commercially available anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine ( CBZ , 2 , BCS class II) to study the effect of cocrystallization on the stability and biological activities of these drugs. Two new cocrystals, namely, pyrazinamide–homophthalic acid (1/1) ( PYZ:HMA , 3 ) and carbamazepine–5-chlorosalicylic acid (1/1) ( CBZ:5-SA , 4 ), were synthesized. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction-based structure of carbamazepine– trans -cinnamic acid (1/1) ( CBZ:TCA , 5 ) was also studied for the first time, along with the known cocrystal carbamazepine–nicotinamide (1/1) ( CBZ:NA , 6 ). From a combination drug perspective, these are interesting pharmaceutical cocrystals to overcome the known side effects of PYZ ( 1 ) therapy, and the poor biopharmaceutical properties of CBZ ( 2 ). The purity and homogeneity of all the synthesized cocrystals were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction and FT–IR analysis, followed by thermal stability studies based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Detailed intermolecular interactions and the role of hydrogen bonding towards crystal stability were evaluated quantitatively via Hirshfeld surface analysis. The solubility of CBZ at pH 6.8 and 7.4 in 0.1 N HCl and H 2 O were compared with the values of cocrystal CBZ:5-SA ( 4 ). The solubility of CBZ:5-SA was found to be significantly improved at pH 6.8 and 7.4 in H 2 O. All the synthesized cocrystals 3 – 6 exhibited a potent urease inhibition (IC 50 values range from 17.32 ± 0.89 to 12.3 ± 0.8 µ M ), several times more potent than standard acetohydroxamic acid (IC 50 = 20.34 ± 0.43 µ M ). PYZ:HMA ( 3 ) also exhibited potent larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti . Among the synthesized cocrystals, PYZ:HMA ( 3 ) and CBZ:TCA ( 5 ) were found to possess antileishmanial activity against the miltefosine-induced resistant strain of Leishmania major , with IC 50 values of 111.98 ± 0.99 and 111.90 ± 1.44 µ M , respectively, in comparison with miltefosine (IC 50 = 169.55 ± 0.20 µ M ).",

The formation of cocrystal (I) and salts (II) and (III) was confirmed through the widening of the C-N-C bond angle of the triazine moiety of 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine and the difference in the C-O bond distances between the carboxyl and carboxylate groups of the respective carboxylic acids. Cocrystal (I) and salt (II) form robust homomeric and heteromeric R22(8) ring motifs through primary acid-base interactions and complementary base pairing. In cocrystal (I), the complementary base pair exists as wave-like supramolecular strands, whereas in salt (II), it exists as a discrete pair. Salt (II) exhibits DDDAAD sextuple and DADA quadruple hydrogen-bonded arrays (D is donor and A is acceptor) through acid-base interactions and generates a supramolecular rosette-like architecture. In salt (III), the presence of carboxyl-carboxylate interactions and acid-base interactions led to the development of a supramolecular sheet and tunnel-like architecture. Cocrystal (I) and salt (III) are stabilized through offset aromatic π-π stacking interactions and C-H...π interactions, and salts (II) and (III) are stabilized via weak carbonyl-π and C-H...O hydrogen bonds. Macrocyclic R1212(64) and R33(24) motifs are present in salts (II) and (III), respectively. Hirshfeld surface analysis of (I)-(III) reinforces the fact that N...H/H...N, O...H/H...O and C...H/H...C interactions contribute to the crystal packing and stability.",

    "abstract": "Noncovalent interactions have received much attention in the fields of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering. Hydrogen bonding and weak interaction forces affect crystal stacking. Crown-ether-based host–guest inclusion compounds with hydrogen bonding and weak intermolecular interaction forces deserve our attention. In addition, Xiong and co-workers have proposed a molecular design strategy of H/F substitution. Based on this H/F substitution strategy, it is possible to develop halogen substitution, also known as the halogenation effect. Here, using benzylamine as an organic parent, the molecular design strategy of the halogenation effect was used. That is, halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br and I) were used to replace H atoms at the para site of the aromatic ring, and four halogenated benzylamine compounds were obtained, namely, 4-fluorobenzylaminium di(methanesulfonyl)amidate–18-crown-6 (1/1), C 7 H 9 FN + ·C 2 H 6 NO 4 S 2 − ·C 12 H 24 O 6 or [(4-FBA)(18-crown-6)][DMSA], 1 ; 4-chlorobenzylaminium di(methanesulfonyl)amidate–18-crown-6 (1/1), C 7 H 9 ClN + ·C 2 H 6 NO 4 S 2 − ·C 12 H 24 O 6 or [(4-ClBA)(18-crown-6)][DMSA], 2 ; 4-bromobenzylaminium di(methanesulfonyl)amidate–18-crown-6 (1/1), C 7 H 9 BrN + ·C 2 H 6 NO 4 S 2 − ·C 12 H 24 O 6 or [(4-BrBA)(18-crown-6)][DMSA], 3 ; and 4-iodobenzylaminium di(methanesulfonyl)amidate–18-crown-6 (1/1), C 7 H 9 IN + ·C 2 H 6 NO 4 S 2 − ·C 12 H 24 O 6 or [(4-IBA)(18-crown-6)][DMSA], 4 .

    "abstract": "Isoguanine nucleosides constructed by different heterocyclic skeletons play a significant role in the context of genetic code expansion, as well as for purine–purine base pairing. However, with respect to structure analysis, only limited information is available on this class of nucleosides. In this study, the single-crystal X-ray structure of 8-ethynyl-2′-deoxyisoguanosine, C 12 H 13 N 5 O 4 ·C 12 H 13 N 5 O 4 ·2H 2 O ( 1 ), has been investigated. In the crystal of 1 , the N1-H and N3-H tautomers exist together. They are connected by O3′—H to O3′ hydrogen bonds. The conformation at the glycosylic bond is syn for both tautomeric forms. This conformation is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds from N3 or N3—H of the pyrimidine ring to the 5′-OH group of the sugar residue. For both tautomers, the sugar conformation adopts a C2′- endo –C3′- exo twist ( 2 T 3 ; S -type), with P = 165.0 and 163.9°. A synclinal orientation is observed around the C4—C5′ bond. Crystal packing is controlled by a tridentate purine–purine pair of 8-ethynyl-2′-deoxyisoguanosine that is enabled by a tautomeric shift of the proton from N1 to N3 of the nucleobase. Additional stability to the 3D network is contributed by water molecules connecting different layers in the solid state. A Hirshfeld surface analysis was performed confirming the existence of the purine–purine pair and the impact of the water molecules on hydrogen bonding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first X-ray analysis on a nucleoside with two different tautomeric forms in the crystal unit that form a purine–purine base pair.",

The compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The X-ray diffraction analyses showed that Cou01 crystallized in the orthorhombic space group Pna21, while Cou02 crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/c. The packing of both derivatives is controlled by C-H...O hydrogen-bond networks between the coumarin nuclei and the substituent groups at the 7-position. In silico evaluation through density functional theory (DFT) calculations afforded an investigation of the electronic properties, showing that the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps correlate with the formation of hydrogen bonds in the derivatives at the highest and lowest electronic density sites (O and H atoms). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO-LUMO gap indicate that Cou01 has good reactivity and electron-donating potential. Global reactivity analysis confirms that this derivative is more reactive (nucleophilic) and polarized. Finally, predictions of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactivities reveal that the substituent group in the 7-position has a significant influence on the bioactivity score predictions and the improvement of toxicological and side effects. Results suggest that Cou01 is a novel and promising molecule with good potential as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.",

Both compounds crystallize in the space group P 1 with no solvent in the unit cell. There are two crystallographically unique, but geometrically similar, molecules in the asymmetric unit of FAP . N—H...O hydrogen bonds in FAP link the molecules into a linear chain lying along the b axis. The asymmetric unit in TAP is a disordered molecule containing contributions from two conformers with different orientations of the thiophenyl ring. N—H...O hydrogen bonds in TAP link the molecules into a linear chain lying along the a axis. Conformations of the gas-phase isolated conformers were predicted with density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level. The conformers in FAP possess similar twist angles with respect to their calculated isolated conformers.

The π-stacking ring interactions between hydrogen-bonded molecules in the two crystal structures are not the same and are related to the difference in the magnitude of the dispersion and electrostatic interactions in the FAP and TAP environments.&lt;!?tpb=-2pt&gt;",

The crystal structures are new in that they have both structural features of different types of organic Dirac electron systems (ODES), i.e. α- and α'-type iodine-centred trihalide (IX2-) salts of BETS-related electron-donor molecules. The former often produces zero-gap semiconductors, while the latter is related to nodal-line semimetals, i.e. classes of ODES different from each other. The band structure calculation suggests that BETS2AuX2 are close to zero-gap semiconductors, indicating that the α-type structural feature governs the band structures in these salts. Although the dimensions and geometries of the constituents are close to each other between BETS2IX2 and BETS2AuX2, the strength of the BETS-anion interaction resulted in a difference in the crystal structures between the α- and α'-type molecular arrangements. Our findings show that the crystal and band structures are affected by the electronic states of the constituents sometimes more than one would expect based on their geometrical features.",

In contrast, here we compare the applicability of the HAR and transferable aspherical atom model (TAAM) approaches for the structure refinement, as well as for the reconstruction of electron-density distribution in a series of quinoic compounds, known for their pronounced single–double bond alternation. A set of five quinone-like compounds has been crystallized and investigated using single-crystal X-ray diffraction at standard resolution and subjected to various structure refinement approaches, namely, 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorocyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione (Cl4Q), C 6 Cl 4 O 2 , 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorocyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione (F4Q), C 6 F 4 O 2 , 2-[4-(dicyanomethylidene)cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]propanedinitrile (TCNQ), C 12 H 4 N 4 , 2-[4-(dicyanomethylidene)-2,5-difluorocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]propanedinitrile (F2TCNQ), C 12 H 2 F 2 N 4 , and 2-[4-(dicyanomethylidene)-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]propanedinitrile (F4TCNQ), C 12 F 4 N 4 . The HAR results quantitatively reproduce the alternating electron-density effects in the studied compounds, while the electron densities from the TAAM approach, utilizing pseudoatom parameters averaged over a large number of chemical compounds, do not perform as well in capturing bond alternation. As a consequence of the differences in the electron-density models, the two refinement approaches also yield distinct atomic displacement parameters (ADPs).",

Although 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) is a widely used method for determining crystalline polymorphs, even in a mixture, it sometimes fails if the molecular conformations are similar. On the other hand, ED can, in principle, differentiate crystalline forms with different lattice parameters, even when they have very similar molecular conformations. However, its application is usually limited to inorganic molecules only. This is because the ED measurements of organic molecules are very challenging due to degradation of the sample by electron irradiation. We overcame these difficulties by the use of 1H double-quantum/single-quantum correlation experiments at very fast magic angle spinning, together with ED observations under mild electron irradiation. The experiments were demonstrated on L-histidine samples in L-histidine·HCl·H2O, orthorhombic L-histidine and monoclinic L-histidine.",

In this work, we report the crystallization of Gefitinib to form a methanol solvate [systematic name: N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-methoxy-6-[3-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]quinazolin-4-amine methanol hemisolvate, C22H24ClFN4O3·0.5CH3OH] that was theoretically and experimentally investigated. The unit cell is composed of two independent Gefitinib molecules (A and B) that form a stable molecular complex with methanol in the crystal lattice. To understand the crystal lattice stabilization, a combination of techniques, namely X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), Hirshfeld surface analysis and CLP-PIXEL methods were used. The analysis of the crystal structure of this dimer revealed a three-dimensional isostructurality with the already reported form II. The A and B molecules are connected via trifurcated C-H...O and N-H...O hydrogen bonding. In addition, the presence of the methanol molecule stabilizes the crystal structure via C-H...O, N-H...O and C-H...Cl interactions between the two monomers. The IR analysis of the dimer has shown characteristic fingerprint values when compared to the commercial form. The TG-DSC analysis of the solvated dimer is in good agreement with the patent reporting cocrystals of Gefitinib. Finally, theoretical calculations by the CLP-PIXEL method and Hirshfeld surface and two-dimensional (2D) fingerprint plot analysis were carried out in order to quantify the different intermolecular interactions and their energies in the crystal packing.",

The Ag1O6 and Ag2O6 prisms are located at levels of z ≈ 1/12, 1/4, 5/12, 7/12, 3/4 and 11/12, and can facilitate two-dimensional ionic conductivity. The 12-coordinate Rb atoms are in the framework cavities. The structure of Rb2AgIn(MoO4)3 is a member of the series of rhombohedral 3D framework molybdate structure types with a ≈ 9–10 Å and long c axes, which contain rods of face-shared filled and empty coordination polyhedra around threefold axes. Electrical conductivity of ceramics is measured by impedance spectroscopy. Rb2AgIn(MoO4)3 undergoes a `blurred' first-order phase transition at 535 K with increasing electrical conductivity up to 1.1 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 720 K. Thus, the compound may be of inter­est for developing new materials with high ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The phase Na 5 FeSi 4 O 12 [pentasodium iron(III) silicate] crystallizes readily from the Na 2 O–Fe 2 O 3 –SiO 2 glass system in a relatively large compositional range. However, its crystal structure and properties have not been studied in detail since its discovery in 1930. In this work, the Na 5 FeSi 4 O 12 phase was crystallized from a host glass with 5Na 2 O·Fe 2 O 3 ·8SiO 2 stoichiometry, and both the glass and the crystal were studied. It was found that the Na 5 FeSi 4 O 12 phase crystallizes at ∼720 °C from the glass and melts at ∼830 °C when heated at a rate of 10 °C min −1 . The crystal structure was solved using single-crystal X-ray diffraction and the refined data are reported for the first time for the Na 5 FeSi 4 O 12 phase. It exhibits trigonal symmetry, space group R \\overline{3} c , with a = 21.418 and c = 12.2911 Å. The Na atoms located between adjacent structural channels exhibit positional disorder and splitting which was only refined by using low-temperature data collection (150 K). While ∼7% of the total Fe cations occur as Fe 2+ in the glass, four-coordinated Fe 3+ constitutes ∼93% of the total Fe cations. However, iron in the crystal, which exhibits a paramagnetic behavior, is solely present as six-coordinated Fe 3+ . The magnetic and vibrational properties of the glass and crystal are discussed to provide additional insight into the structure.",

A single-crystal X-ray structure analysis of the inclusion complex β-cyclodextrin-chlorogenic acid-water (2/2/17), 2C42H70O35·2C16H18O9·17H2O, reveals that CGA threads through β-CD and assembles via O-H...O hydrogen bonds and parallel-displaced π-π interactions in the twofold symmetry-related dimer yielding a [4]pseudorotaxane, which is crystallographically observed for the first time in CD inclusion complexes. The encapsulation of the aromatic ring and C=C-C(=O)O chain in the β-CD dimeric cavity indicates that the CFA moiety plays a determinant role in complexation. This is in agreement with the DFT-derived relative thermodynamic stabilities of the trimodal β-CD-CGA inclusion complexes, that is, β-CD complexed with different CGA components: C=C-C(=O)O chain > cyclohexane ring > aromatic ring. The complexation stability is further enhanced in the dimeric β-CD-CGA complex, with the CFA moiety totally enclosed in the β-CD dimeric cavity.",

The crystal structures obtained by crystallization from tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile include the Cl − ion in the lattice structures, while the Cl − ion is missing from the crystal structure obtained by crystallization from nitromethane (PTZ-oxalic). In order to explain the formation of the two types of supramolecular configurations with oxalic acid, the intermolecular interaction energies were calculated in the presence of the two solvents and the equilibrium configurations were determined using density functional theory (DFT). The cocrystals were studied by X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Additionally, a stability test under special conditions and water solubility were also investigated. PTZ-Cl-succinic, PTZ-Cl-fumaric and PTZ-Cl-adipic crystallized having similar lattice parameter values, and showed a 2:1 PTZ-Cl to dicarboxylic acid stoichiometry.

    "abstract": "The use of supramolecular synthons as a strategy to control crystalline structure is a crucial factor in developing new solid forms with physicochemical properties optimized by design. However, to achieve this objective, it is necessary to understand the intermolecular interactions in the context of crystal packing. The feasibility of a given synthon depends on its flexibility to combine the drug with a variety of coformers. In the present work, the imidazole–hydroxy synthon is investigated using as the target molecule benzoylmetronidazole [BZMD; systematic name 2-(2-methyl-5-nitro-1 H -imidazol-1-yl)ethyl benzoate], whose imidazole group seems to be a suitable acceptor for hydrogen bonds. Thus, coformers with carboxylic acid and phenol groups were chosen. According to the availability of binding sites presented in the coformer, and considering the proposed synthon and hydrogen-bond complementarity as major factors, different drug–coformer stoichiometric ratios were explored (1:1, 2:1 and 3:1). Thirteen new solid forms (two salts and eleven cocrystals) were produced, namely BZMD–benzoic acid (1/1), C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·C 7 H 6 O 2 , BZMD–β-naphthol (1/1), C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·C 10 H 8 O, BZMD–4-methoxybenzoic acid (1/1), C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·C 8 H 8 O 3 , BZMD–3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (1/1), C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·C 7 H 4 N 2 O 6 , BZMD–3-aminobenzoic acid (1/1), C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·C 7 H 7 NO 2 , BZMD–salicylic acid (1/1), C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·C 7 H 6 O 3 , BZMD–maleic acid (1/1) {as the salt 1-[2-(benzoyloxy)ethyl]-2-methyl-5-nitro-1 H -imidazol-3-ium 3-carboxyprop-2-enoate}, C 13 H 14 N 3 O 4 + ·C 4 H 3 O 4 − , BZMD–isophthalic acid (1/1), C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·C 8 H 6 O4, BZMD–resorcinol (2/1), 2C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·C 6 H 6 O 2 , BZMD–fumaric acid (2/1), C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·0.5C 4 H 4 O 4 , BZMD–malonic acid (2/1), 2C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·C 3 H 2 O 4 , BZMD–2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (1/1) {as the salt 1-[2-(benzoyloxy)ethyl]-2-methyl-5-nitro-1 H -imidazol-3-ium 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate}, C 13 H 14 N 3 O 4 + ·C 7 H 5 O 4 − , and BZMD–3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3/1), 3C 13 H 13 N 3 O 4 ·C 7 H 6 O 4 , and their crystalline structures elucidated, confirming the robustness of the selected synthon.",

Within these chains, H atoms are sandwiched between neighbouring polyanions. Na and Rb atoms and H2O molecules occupy interstices flanked by the anionic chains providing additional crosslinking in the structure. This compound is the second decavanadate with P2/n symmetry.

A new high-Z' polymorph (denoted Form II) is described, with four molecules in the asymmetric unit in the space group P2/n. The structure exhibits pseudosymmetry, including local translations and screw-type operations. The niclosamide molecules are linked by O-H...O hydrogen bonds into chains, and the chains are packed so that the molecules form face-to-face (stacking) and end-to-end interactions within layers perpendicular to the chains. There are two different layer arrangements, giving a structure that is relatively complex. In the acetone and acetonitrile solvates, the incorporated solvent molecules accept hydrogen bonds from the OH groups of niclosamide, and the niclosamide molecules are stacked in a face-to-face manner. In the acetone solvate, C13H8Cl2N2O4·C3H6O, V-shaped arrangements are formed in which the nitrobenzene ends of the niclosamide molecules are brought into face-to-face contact. In the acetonitrile solvate, C13H8Cl2N2O4·CH3CN, stacking occurs by translation along a short axis (ca 3.8 Å) and the crystals are frequently observed to be twinned by twofold rotation around that axis. The acetonitrile molecules occupy channels in the structure. A complete structure is provided for niclosamide monohydrate, C13H8Cl2N2O4·H2O, polymorph HA, obtained by Rietveld refinement against laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data. It has been suggested that this compound is related to the methanol solvate of niclosamide [Harriss, Wilson & Radosevljevic Evans (2014). Acta Cryst. C70, 758-763], but it is found that the two are not fully isostructural: they contain isostructural two-dimensional layers, but the layers are arranged differently in the two structures. This suggests that HA may have the potential for polytypism, and features in the Rietveld difference curve indicate that a polytype fully isostructural with the methanol solvate might be present.",

    "abstract": "The results of seven cocrystallization experiments of the antithyroid drug 6-methyl-2-thiouracil (MTU), C 5 H 6 N 2 OS, with 2,4-diaminopyrimidine, 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine and 6-amino-3 H -isocytosine ( viz. 2,6-diamino-3 H -pyrimidin-4-one) are reported. MTU features an ADA ( A = acceptor and D = donor) hydrogen-bonding site, while the three coformers show complementary DAD hydrogen-bonding sites and therefore should be capable of forming an ADA / DAD N—H...O/N—H...N/N—H...S synthon with MTU. The experiments yielded one cocrystal and six cocrystal solvates, namely 6-methyl-2-thiouracil–2,4-diaminopyrimidine–1-methylpyrrolidin-2-one (1/1/2), C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·C 4 H 6 N 4 ·2C 5 H 9 NO, (I), 6-methyl-2-thiouracil–2,4-diaminopyrimidine (1/1), C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·C 4 H 6 N 4 , (II), 6-methyl-2-thiouracil–2,4-diaminopyrimidine– N , N -dimethylacetamide (2/1/2), 2C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·C 4 H 6 N 4 ·2C 4 H 9 NO, (III), 6-methyl-2-thiouracil–2,4-diaminopyrimidine– N , N -dimethylformamide (2/1/2), C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·0.5C 4 H 6 N 4 ·C 3 H 7 NO, (IV), 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidinium 6-methyl-2-thiouracilate–6-methyl-2-thiouracil– N , N -dimethylformamide (1/1/2), C 4 H 8 N 5 + ·C 5 H 5 N 2 OS − ·C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·2C 3 H 7 NO, (V), 6-methyl-2-thiouracil–6-amino-3 H -isocytosine– N , N -dimethylformamide (1/1/1), C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·C 4 H 6 N 4 O·C 3 H 7 NO, (VI), and 6-methyl-2-thiouracil–6-amino-3 H -isocytosine–dimethyl sulfoxide (1/1/1), C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·C 4 H 6 N 4 O·C 2 H 6 OS, (VII). Whereas in cocrystal (I) an R 2 2 (8) interaction similar to the Watson–Crick adenine/uracil base pair is formed and a two-dimensional hydrogen-bonding network is observed, the cocrystals (II)–(VII) contain the triply hydrogen-bonded ADA / DAD N—H...O/N—H...N/N—H...S synthon and show a one-dimensional hydrogen-bonding network. Although 2,4-diaminopyrimidine possesses only one DAD hydrogen-bonding site, it is, due to orientational disorder, triply connected to two MTU molecules in (III) and (IV).",

The five consecutive N-C bond lengths are all of similar lengths [1.316 (6)-1.358 (6) Å], indicating substantial delocalization along these bonds. The Se···O distance of 2.302 (3) Å, combined with a longer than usual amide C=O bond of 2.252 (5) Å, suggest a significant interaction between the amide O atom and its adjacent Se atom. An analysis of related structures containing an Se-Se···X unit (X = Se, S, O) shows a strong correlation between the Se-Se bond length and the strength of the Se···X interaction. When X = O, the strength of the Se···O interaction also correlates with the carbonyl C=O bond length. Weak intermolecular Se···Se, Se···O, C-H···O, C-H···π and π-π interactions each serve to link the molecules into ribbons or chains, with the C-H···O motif being a double helix, while the combination of all interactions generates the overall three-dimensional supramolecular framework.",

The former dominate in the title compounds; the four symmetrically independent pyridinium N-H groups in each compound act as donors in charge-assisted hydrogen bonds, with halogen ligands and the tetrahedral metallate anions as acceptors. The M-X coordinative bonds in the latter are significantly longer if the halide ligand is engaged in a classical X...H-N hydrogen bond.

The structure of BATZM can be described as a V-shaped molecule with reasonable chemical geometry and no disorder. The specific molar heat capacity ( C p,m ) of BATZM was determined using the continuous C p mode of a microcalorimeter and theoretical calculations, and the C p,m value is 211.19 J K −1 mol −1 at 298.15 K. The relative deviations between the theoretical and experimental values of C p,m , H T – H 298.15K and S T – S 298.15K of BATZM are almost equivalent at each temperature. The detonation velocity ( D ) and detonation pressure ( P ) of BATZM were estimated using the nitrogen equivalent equation according to the experimental density; BATZM has a higher detonation velocity (7954.87 ± 3.29 m s −1 ) and detonation pressure (25.72 ± 0.03 GPa) than TNT.",

The value of the atomic displacement parameter (mean-square displacement) of each atom in NiSe was larger than that in Ni 3 Se 2 . The larger amplitude of the atoms in NiSe corresponds to longer Ni—Se and Ni—Ni bond lengths in NiSe than in Ni 3 Se 2 . The Debye temperatures, θ D , estimated from observed mean-square displacements for Ni and Se in Ni 3 Se 2 , were 322 and 298 K, respectively, while those for Ni and Se in NiSe were 246 and 241 K, respectively.

The deformation of the aromatic ring around the -NEt2 group in N,N,N',N'-tetraethyl-4,4'-(diazenediyl)dianiline, C20H28N4, (I), may be caused by steric hindrance and the π-electron-donating effects of the amine group. In this structure, one of the amine N atoms demonstrates clear sp(2)-hybridization and the other is slightly shifted from the plane of the surrounding atoms. The molecule of the second azobenzene, diethyl 4,4'-(diazenediyl)dibenzoate, C18H18N2O4, (II), lies on a crystallographic inversion centre. Its geometry is normal and comparable with homologous compounds. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to analyse the changes in the geometry of the studied compounds in the crystalline state and for the isolated molecules. The most significant changes are observed in the values of the N=N-C-C torsion angles, which for the isolated molecules are close to 0.0°. The HOMA (harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity) index, calculated for the benzene ring, demonstrates a slight decrease of the aromaticity in (I) and no substantial changes in (II).",

    "abstract": "The structures of 4-chloro-3-nitroaniline, C6H5ClN2O2, (I), and 4-iodo-3-nitroaniline, C6H5IN2O2, (II), are isomorphs and both undergo continuous (second order) phase transitions at 237 and 200 K, respectively. The structures, as well as their phase transitions, have been studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and difference scanning calorimetry experiments. Both high-temperature phases (293 K) show disorder of the nitro substituents, which are inclined towards the benzene-ring planes at two different orientations. In the low-temperature phases (120 K), both inclination angles are well maintained, while the disorder is removed. Concomitantly, the b axis doubles with respect to the room-temperature cell. Each of the low-temperature phases of (I) and (II) contains two pairs of independent molecules, where the molecules in each pair are related by noncrystallographic inversion centres. The molecules within each pair have the same absolute value of the inclination angle. The Flack parameter of the low-temperature phases is very close to 0.5, indicating inversion twinning. This can be envisaged as stacking faults in the low-temperature phases. It seems that competition between the primary amine-nitro N-H···O hydrogen bonds which form three-centred hydrogen bonds is the reason for the disorder of the nitro groups, as well as for the phase transition in both (I) and (II). The backbones of the structures are formed by N-H···N hydrogen bonding of moderate strength which results in the graph-set motif C(3). This graph-set motif forms a zigzag chain parallel to the monoclinic b axis and is maintained in both the high- and the low-temperature structures. The primary amine groups are pyramidal, with similar geometric values in all four determinations. The high-temperature phase of (II) has been described previously [Garden et al. (2004). Acta Cryst. C60, o328-o330].",

Benzo[b]pyrimido[5,4-f]azepines (BPAs), which also contain a privileged 6-7-6 ring system, are less well investigated, probably because of a lack of straightforward and versatile methods for their synthesis. A simple and versatile synthetic approach to BPAs based on intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation has been developed. A group of closely-related benzo[b]pyrimido[5,4-f]azepine derivatives, namely (6RS)-4-chloro-6,11-dimethyl-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo[b]pyrimido[5,4-f]azepine, C14H14ClN3, (I), (6RS)-4-chloro-8-hydroxy-6,11-dimethyl-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo[b]pyrimido[5,4-f]azepine, C14H14ClN3O, (II), (6RS)-4-chloro-8-methoxy-6,11-dimethyl-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo[b]pyrimido[5,4-f]azepine, C15H16ClN3O, (III), and (6RS)-4-chloro-8-methoxy-6,11-dimethyl-2-phenyl-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo[b]pyrimido[5,4-f]azepine, C21H20ClN3O, (IV), has been prepared and their structures compared with the recently published structure [Acosta-Quintero et al.

All five compounds crystallize as racemic mixtures and they have very similar molecular conformations, with the azepine ring adopting a boat-type conformation in each case, although the orientation of the methoxy substituent in each of (III) and (IV) is different. The supramolecular assemblies in (II) and (IV) depend upon hydrogen bonds of the O-H...N and C-H...π(arene) types, respectively, those in (I) and (V) depend upon π-π stacking interactions involving pairs of pyrimidine rings, and that in (III) depends upon a π-π stacking interaction involving pairs of phenyl rings.

The 2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]-1H-benzimidazole (tmb) ligand has four potential N-atom donors and can act in monodentate, chelating, bridging and tridentate coordination modes in the construction of complexes, and can also act as both a hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor. In addition, the tmb ligand can adopt different coordination conformations, resulting in complexes with helical structures due to the presence of the flexible methylene spacer. A new three-dimensional coordination polymer, poly[[bis(μ2-benzene-1,4-dicarboxylato)-κ(4)O(1),O(1'):O(4),O(4');κ(2)O(1):O(4)-bis{μ2-2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl-κN(4)]-1H-benzimidazole-κN(3)}dizinc(II)] trihydrate], {[Zn(C8H4O4)(C10H9N5)]·1.5H2O}n, has been synthesized by the reaction of ZnCl2 with tmb and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2bdic) under solvothermal conditions. There are two crystallographically distinct bdic(2-) ligands [bdic(2-)(A) and bdic(2-)(B)] in the structure which adopt different coordination modes. The Zn(II) ions are bridged by tmb ligands, leading to one-dimensional helical chains with different handedness, and adjacent helices are linked by bdic(2-)(A) ligands, forming a two-dimensional network structure. The two-dimensional layers are further connected by bdic(2-)(B) ligands, resulting in a three-dimensional framework with the topological notation 6(6).

Although obtained serendipitously, its intra- and intermolecular features match expectations from database searches and theoretical calculations. O-H...O hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimers represent the building blocks in both polymorphs. For steric reasons and in agreement with a calculated potential energy surface, the carboxylic acid and nitro groups cannot simultaneously be coplanar with the benzene ring but have to tilt. In the well established crystal form, this out-of-plane torsion is more pronounced for the nitro substituent. In contrast, the new polymorph is characterized by a major tilt of the carboxylic acid group. The molecules in both alternative crystal forms achieve a similar compromise with respect to acceptable intramolecular O...O contacts.",

There is proton transfer between the piperidine ring of vandetanib and the carboxyl group of bumetanide to form the salt. In the vandetanib cation, the arene and pyrimidine rings are not coplanar, their planes subtending a dihedral angle of 60.47 (14)°. The roles of the intermolecular interactions in the crystal packing were clarified using Hirshfeld surface analysis, and two-dimensional fingerprint plots indicate that the most important contributions to the crystal packing are from H...H (40.5%), O...H/H...C (20.7%), C...H/ H...C (18.8%) and N...C/C...N (9.0%) contacts.",

    "abstract": "3D electron diffraction (3D ED), or microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), has become an alternative technique for determining the high-resolution crystal structures of compounds from sub-micron-sized crystals. Here, we considered L-alanine, α-glycine and urea, which are known to form good-quality crystals, and collected high-resolution 3D ED data on our in-house TEM instrument. In this study, we present a comparison of independent atom model (IAM) and transferable aspherical atom model (TAAM) kinematical refinement against experimental and simulated data. TAAM refinement on both experimental and simulated data clearly improves the model fitting statistics ( R factors and residual electrostatic potential) compared to IAM refinement. This shows that TAAM better represents the experimental electrostatic potential of organic crystals than IAM. Furthermore, we compared the geometrical parameters and atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) resulting from the experimental refinements with the simulated refinements, with the periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and with published X-ray and neutron crystal structures. The TAAM refinements on the 3D ED data did not improve the accuracy of the bond lengths between the non-H atoms. The experimental 3D ED data provided more accurate H-atom positions than the IAM refinements on the X-ray diffraction data. The IAM refinements against 3D ED data had a tendency to lead to slightly longer X —H bond lengths than TAAM, but the difference was statistically insignificant. Atomic displacement parameters were too large by tens of percent for L-alanine and α-glycine. Most probably, other unmodelled effects were causing this behaviour, such as radiation damage or dynamical scattering.",

However, because FT–Raman spectroscopy carries no information about the topological features of extended polyiodides, the two techniques should therefore be applied in combination to enhance the analysis of this kind of compounds.",

Copper extraction offers significant economic and social benefits due to its strategic importance across various industries.

This limited understanding stems from the poorly understood structure and reactivity of chalcopyrite surfaces. This study reviews recent contributions using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with periodic boundary conditions and slab models to elucidate chalcopyrite surface properties.

    "abstract": "Over the last three decades, the technology that makes it possible to follow chemical processes in the solid state in real time has grown enormously. These studies have important implications for the design of new functional materials for applications in optoelectronics and sensors. Light-matter interactions are of particular importance, and photocrystallography has proved to be an important tool for studying these interactions. In this technique, the three-dimensional structures of light-activated molecules, in their excited states, are determined using single-crystal X-ray crystallography. With advances in the design of high-power lasers, pulsed LEDs and time-gated X-ray detectors, the increased availability of synchrotron facilities, and most recently, the development of XFELs, it is now possible to determine the structures of molecules with lifetimes ranging from minutes down to picoseconds, within a single crystal, using the photocrystallographic technique. This review discusses the procedures for conducting successful photocrystallographic studies and outlines the different methodologies that have been developed to study structures with specific lifetime ranges. The complexity of the methods required increases considerably as the lifetime of the excited state shortens. The discussion is supported by examples of successful photocrystallographic studies across a range of timescales and emphasises the importance of the use of complementary analytical techniques in order to understand the solid-state processes fully.",

Polynuclear PtII and PdII complexes with linear alkylamines as bridging ligands are a class of potential antineoplastic agents that have shown promising cytotoxicity against low-prognosis human cancers, such as metastatic breast adenocarcinoma and osteosarcoma. The present study reports an analysis of [μ-N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)butane-1,4-diamine-κ4N,N':N'',N''']bis[dichloridoplatinum(II)], [Pt2Cl4(C10H26N4)], denoted Pt2Spm (Spm is spermine), by vibrational spectroscopy coupled to theoretical calculations. Within the latter, the Density Functional Theory (DFT - mPW1PW/6-31G*) and Effective Core Potential (ECP - LANL2DZ) approaches were used, in order to ensure the most accurate representation of the molecule and achieve a maximum agreement with the experimental data. The solid-state geometry of Pt2Spm corresponds to Ci symmetry, displaying 132 vibrational modes. A complete assignment of the experimental vibrational profile of the system was attained through the combined application of complementary Raman, FT-IR and Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) techniques. INS allowed an unequivocal identification of the CH2 and NH2 rocking modes, not clearly detected by the optical techniques, while Raman measurements led to a clear discrimination of the Pt-N stretching frequencies from the two distinct Pt-N moieties within the chelate. The metal-to-metal distances calculated for the molecule under study were found to allow the establishment of effective inter- and intrastrand crosslinks with DNA. These results will hopefully help to clarify the mode of action of the compound, at the molecular level, contributing to the development of improved cisplatin-like chemotherapeutic drugs having a higher efficacy and specificity coupled to lower acquired resistance and deleterious side effects.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we demonstrate a simple approach for growing 1D (one-dimensional) inorganic chains of K(C 6 H 16 N) 3 Mo 8 O 26 ·H 2 O polyoxometalates (POMs) from its colloidal soft-oxometalate (SOM) phase through the variation of pH. The structure is composed mainly of a 1D inorganic chain with a β-Mo 8 O 26 4− binding node linked using K + via Mo—O—K linkages, which results in a cuboctahedral geometry for the K + ions. Crystal structure and Hirshfeld surface studies reveal the role of triethylammonium cations in restricting the growth of the 1D chain into 2D/3D (two-/three-dimensional) structures. During the nucleation process from the heterogeneous SOM phase, some of the intermolecular interactions in the dispersion phase are retained in the crystal structure, which was evidenced from residual O...O interactions. The crystallization of the species from its colloidal form as a function of pH was studied by the use of Raman spectroscopy and it was found that the increase in volume fraction of the β-Mo 8 O 26 4− species in the crystallizing colloidal mixture with the decrease in pH is responsible for the nucleation. This was monitored by time-dependent DLS (dynamic light scattering) measurement and zeta-potential studies, revealing the co-existence of both the crystal and the colloidal forms at pH 3–2. This brings us to the conclusion that in the crystallization of POMs, the colloidal SOM phase precedes the crystalline POM phase which occurs via a phase transition. This work could open up avenues for the study of POM formation from the stand-point of colloidal chemistry and SOMs.",

    "abstract": "This work reports a new acetonitrile (ACN)-solvated cocrystal of piroxicam (PRX) and succinic acid (SA), 2C 15 H 13 N 3 O 4 S·0.5C 4 H 6 O 4 ·C 2 H 3 N or PRX:SA:ACN (4:1:2), which adopts the triclinic space group P \\overline{1}. The outcome of crystallization from ACN solution can be controlled by varying only the PRX:SA ratio, with a higher PRX:SA ratio in solution unexpectedly favouring a lower stoichiometric ratio in the solid product. In the new solvate, zwitterionic (Z) and non-ionized (NI) PRX molecules co-exist in the asymmetric unit. In contrast, the nonsolvated PRX–SA cocrystal contains only NI-type PRX molecules. The ACN molecule entrapped in PRX–SA·ACN does not form any hydrogen bonds with the surrounding molecules. In the solvated cocrystal, Z-type molecules form dimers linked by intermolecular N—H...O hydrogen bonds, whereas every pair of NI-type molecules is linked to SA via N—H...O and O—H...N hydrogen bonds. Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry suggest that thermal desolvation of the solvate sample occurs at 148 °C, and is followed by recrystallization, presumably of a multicomponent PRX–SA structure. Vibrational spectra (IR and Raman spectroscopy) of PRX–SA·ACN and PRX–SA are also used to demonstrate the ability of spectroscopic techniques to distinguish between NI- and Z-type PRX molecules in the solid state. Hence, vibrational spectroscopy can be used to distinguish the PRX–SA cocrystal and its ACN solvate.",

    "abstract": "Carboxylate molecular crystals have been of interest due to the presence of hydrogen bonding, which plays a significant role in chemical and crystal engineering, as well as in supramolecular chemistry. Acid–base adducts possess hydrogen bonds which increase the thermal and mechanical stability of the crystal. 2,2′-Thiodiacetic acid (Tda) is a versatile ligand that has been widely explored, employing its multidendate and chelating coordination abilities with many metals; however, charge-transfer complexes of thiodiacetic acid have not been reported. Two salts, namely ethylenediaminium 2,2′-thiodiacetate, C 2 H 10 N 2 2+ ·C 4 H 4 O 4 S 2 2− , denoted Tdaen, and 2-aminoanilinium 2-(carboxymethylsulfanyl)acetate, C 6 H 9 N 2 + ·C 4 H 5 O 4 S − , denoted Tdaophen, were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopies, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In these salts, Tda reacts with the aliphatic (ethylenediamine) and aromatic ( o -phenylenediamine) diamines, and deprotonates them to form anions with different valencies and different supramolecular networks. In Tdaen, the divalent Tda 2− anions form one-dimensional linear supramolecular chains and these are extended into a three-dimensional sandwich-type supramolecular network by interaction with the ethylenediaminium cations. However, in Tdaophen, the monovalent Tda − anions form one-dimensional zigzag supramolecular chains, which are extended into a three-dimensional supramolecular network by interaction with the 2-aminoanilinium cations. Thus, both three-dimensional structures display different ring motifs. The structures of these diamines, which are influenced by hydrogen-bonded assemblies in the molecular crystals, are discussed in detail.",

    "abstract": "The aluminophosphate (AlPO) JDF-2 is prepared hydrothermally with methylammonium hydroxide (MAH + ·HO − , MAH + = CH 3 NH 3 + ), giving rise to a microporous AEN-type framework with occluded MAH + cations and extra-framework (Al-bound) HO − anions. Despite the presence of these species within its pores, JDF-2 can hydrate upon exposure to atmospheric moisture to give AlPO-53(A), an isostructural material whose crystal structure contains one molecule of H 2 O per formula unit. This hydration can be reversed by mild heating (such as the frictional heating from magic angle spinning). Previous work has shown good agreement between the NMR parameters obtained experimentally and those calculated from the (optimized) crystal structure of JDF-2. However, several discrepancies are apparent between the experimental NMR parameters for AlPO-53(A) and those calculated from the (optimized) crystal structure ( e.g. four 13 C resonances are observed, rather than the expected two). The unexpected resonances appear and disappear reversibly with the respective addition and removal of H 2 O, so clearly arise from AlPO-53(A). We investigate the ambient hydration of JDF-2 using quantitative 31 P MAS NMR to follow the transformation over the course of ∼3 months. The structures of JDF-2 and AlPO-53(A) are also investigated using a combination of multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy to characterize the samples, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate a range of possible structural models in terms of calculated NMR parameters and energetics. The published structure of JDF-2 is shown to be a good representation of the dehydrated material, but modification of the published structure of AlPO-53(A) is required to provide calculated NMR parameters that are in better agreement with experiment. This modification includes reorientation of all the MAH + cations and partial occupancy of the H 2 O sites.",

    "abstract": "The resonant-scattering contributions to single-crystal X-ray diffraction data enable the absolute structure of crystalline materials to be determined. Crystal structures can be determined even if they contain considerably disordered regions because a correction is available via a discrete Fourier transform of the residual electron density to approximate the X-ray scattering from the disordered region. However, the corrected model cannot normally account for resonant scattering from atoms in the disordered region. Straightforward determination of absolute structure from crystals where the strongly resonantly scattering atoms are not resolved has therefore not been possible. Using an approximate resonant-scattering correction to the X-ray scattering from the disordered regions, we have developed and tested a procedure (HUG) to recover the absolute structure using conventional Flack x refinement or other post-refinement determination methods. Results show that in favourable cases the HUG method works well and the absolute structure can be correctly determined. It offers no useful improvement in cases where the original correction for the disordered region scattering density is problematic, for example, when a large fraction of the scattering density in the crystal is disordered, or when voids are not occupied equally by the disordered species. Crucially, however, if the approach does not work for a given structure, the statistics for the absolute structure measures are not improved, meaning it is unlikely to lead to misassignment of absolute structure.",

Crystal structure determination shows that DPHM crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/c space group with high coplanarity and a zigzag layered structure. In addition, its thermal behaviour was investigated by DSC and TG-DTG methods. The thermal safety of DPHM was evaluated by self-accelerating decomposition temperature (TSADT), critical temperature of thermal explosion (Tb), entropy of activation (ΔS=), enthalpy of activation (ΔH=) and free energy of activation (ΔG=).

Furthermore, the complex exhibits a strong green luminescence emission in the solid state at room temperature, as can be seen from the (CIE) chromaticity diagram, and hence the complex may be a promising green OLED (organic light-emitting diode) in the development of electroluminescent materials for flat-panel-display applications.",

A new one-dimensional coordination polymer, namely catena -poly[[diaquacadmium(II)]-μ 3 -2,2′-(1,2-phenylene)bis(1 H -imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylato)], [Cd(C 16 H 6 N 4 O 8 ) 0.5 (H 2 O) 2 ] n or [Cd(H 2 Phbidc) 1/2 (H 2 O) 2 ] n , has been synthesized by the reaction of Cd(OAc) 2 ·2H 2 O (OAc is acetate) with 2,2′-(1,2-phenylene)bis(1 H -imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid) (H 6 Phbidc) under solvothermal conditions. In the polymer, one type of Cd ion (Cd1) is six-coordinated by two N atoms and two O atoms from one H 2 Phbidc 4− ligand and by two O atoms from two water molecules, forming a significantly distorted octahedral CdN 2 O 4 coordination geometry. In contrast, the other type of Cd ion (Cd2) is six-coordinated by two N atoms and two O atoms from two symmetry-related H 2 Phbidc 4− ligands and by two O atoms from two symmetry-related water molecules, leading to a more regular octahedral coordination geometry. The Cd1 and Cd2 ions are linked by H 2 Phbidc 4− ligands into a one-dimensional chain which runs parallel to the b axis. In the crystal, the one-dimensional chains are connected through hydrogen bonds, generating a two-dimensional layered structure parallel to the ab plane. Adjacent layers are further linked by hydrogen bonds, forming a three-dimensional structure in the solid state.",

The three hybrids consist of supramolecular networks built up by noncovalent interactions between {Fe[P 4 Mo 6 V O 31 ] 2 } 22− polyanions and protonated organic cations. This kind of hybrid polyoxometalate could be applied as heterogeneous molecular catalysts for the reduction of Cr VI . It was found that the organic moiety plays a vital role in influencing the catalytic activity of the polyanions. Organic bpp-containing hybrids 1 and 2 are highly active in the catalytic reduction of heavy metal Cr VI ions using HCOOH as reductant, while bpe-containing hybrid 3 is inactive to this reaction. This work is significant for the design of new catalysts, as well as the exploration of reaction mechanisms at a molecular level.",

Furthermore, the crystal structure of free 3-hydroxyflavone, C 15 H 10 O 3 , 4 , was redetermined at 100 K in order to compare the packing trends and solid-state NMR spectroscopy with that of the solvate flavone molecule in 3 . The compounds were characterized in solution by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, and in the solid state by 13 C NMR spectroscopy using the cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) technique.

Molecules of 1 and 3 generate one-dimensional chains formed through intermolecular interactions. A comparison of the coordinated 3-hydroxyflavone ligand with the uncoordinated solvate molecule and free molecule 4 shows that the last two are virtually completely planar due to hydrogen-bonding interactions, as opposed to the former, which is able to rotate more freely. The differences between the solid- and solution-state 13 C NMR spectra of 3 and 4 are ascribed to inter- and intramolecular interactions.

The structure is isotypic with the Zr 6 CoAl 2 structure, which is a variant of the ZrNiAl structure and its binary prototype Fe 2 P (Pearson code hP 9, Wyckoff sequence g f d a ). As such, the structure is best viewed as an array of tricapped trigonal prisms of Gd atoms centered alternately by Fe and Bi. The magnetic-ordering temperature of this compound ( ca 350 K) is much higher than that of other rare-earth metal-rich phases with the same or related structures. It is also higher than the ordering temperature of many other Gd-rich ternary phases, where the magnetic exchange is typically governed by Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) interactions. First-principles calculations reveal a larger than expected Gd magnetic moment, with the additional contribution arising from the Gd 5 d electrons. The electronic structure analysis suggests strong Gd 5 d –Fe 3 d hybridization to be the cause of this effect, rather than weak interactions between Gd and Bi. These details are of importance for understanding the magnetic response and explaining the high ordering temperature in this material.",

The structure analysis indicates that complex (I) crystallizes in the trigonal space group R 3 and exhibits an infinite one-dimensional chain structure, in which the Eu 3+ ion is surrounded by six O atoms from six D-HDTTA − ligands and three O atoms from three coordinated methanol molecules, thus forming a tricapped trigonal prism geometry. The D-H 2 DTTA ligand is partially deprotonated and adopts a μ 1,6 -coordination mode via two carboxylate groups to link adjacent Eu 3+ ions, affording an infinite one-dimensional propeller-shaped coordination polymer chain along the c axis, with an Eu...Eu distance of 7.622 (1) Å. Moreover, C—H...π interactions lead to the formation of helical chains running along the c axis and the whole structure displays a snowflake pattern in the ab plane. The circular dichroism spectrum confirms the chirality of complex (I). The solid-state photoluminescence properties were also investigated at room temperature and (I) exhibits characteristic red emission bands derived from the Eu 3+ ion (CIE 0.63, 0.32), with a reasonably long lifetime of 0.394 ms, indicating effective energy transfer from the ligand to the metal centre. In addition, a magnetic investigation reveals single-ion magnetic behaviour. The spin-orbit coupling parameter (λ) between the ground and excited states is fitted to be 360 (2) cm −1 through Zeeman perturbation.

    "abstract": "Molecular crystals exhibiting polar symmetry are important paradigms for developing new electrooptical materials. Though accessing bulk polarity still presents a significant challenge, in some cases it may be rationalized as being associated with the specific molecular shapes and symmetries and subtle features of supramolecular interactions. In the crystal structure of 3,5,7-trinitro-1-azaadamantane, C 9 H 12 N 4 O 6 , the polar symmetry of the molecular arrangement is a result of complementary prerequisites, namely the C 3 v symmetry of the molecules is suited to the generation of polar stacks and the inherent asymmetry of the principal supramolecular bonding, as is provided by NO 2 (lone pair)...NO 2 (π-hole) interactions. These bonds arrange the molecules into a trigonal network. In spite of the apparent simplicity, the structure comprises three unique molecules ( Z ′ = 1 \\over 3 + 1 \\over 3 + 1 \\over 3), two of which are donors and acceptors of three N...O interactions and the third being primarily important for weak C—H...O hydrogen bonding. These distinct structural roles agree with the results of Hirshfeld surface analysis. A set of weak C—H...O and C—H...N hydrogen bonds yields three kinds of stacks. The orientation of the stacks is identical and therefore the polarity of each molecule contributes additively to the net dipole moment of the crystal. This suggests a special potential of asymmetric NO 2 (lone pair)...NO 2 (π-hole) interactions for the supramolecular synthesis of acentric materials.",

The com­pound crystallizes in a laminar structure in the triclinic space group P\\overline{1}, where the two sites are a free europium(III) ion and an [Eu(DOTA)(H2O)]− com­plex. The crystal structure was determined using com­plex data treatment due to nonmerohedral twinning. Experimental data sets were recorded with large redundancy and separated according to scattering domains in order to obtain a reliable structure. In the first site, the [Eu(DOTA)(H2O)]− com­plex was found to adopt a capped twisted square-anti­prismatic (cTSAP) conformation, where a capping water mol­ecule increased the coordination number of the europium(III) site to nine (CN = 9). In the second site, the europium(III) ion was found to be coordinated by two water mol­ecules, one hydroxide group and five oxide groups from neighbouring [Eu(DOTA)(H2O)]− com­plexes. The coordination geometry of this site was found to be a com­pressed square anti­prism (SAP) and the coordination number of the europium(III) ion was found to be eight (CN = 8). A large increase in the rate constant of luminescence was observed for EuIII in [Eu(DOTA)(H2O)]− in solid-state luminescence spectroscopy measurements com­pared to in solution, which led to investigations of single crystals in deuterated media to exclude additional effects of quenching. We conclude that the most probable cause of the decrease in the observed luminescence lifetimes is the high asymmetry of the coordination environment of [Eu(DOTA)(D2O)]− in the [Eu(μ-O)5(OD)(D2O)2][Eu(DOTA)(D2O)]2 crystals.",

The X-ray crystal structures of sulfameter solvates have been determined to be conformational polymorphs. Both 1,4-dioxane and tetrahydrofuran form solvates with sulfameter in a 1:1 molar ratio. 4-Amino- N -(5-methoxypyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide (polymorph III), C 11 H 12 N 4 O 3 S, (1), has two molecules of sulfameter in the asymmetric unit cell. 4-Amino- N -(5-methoxypyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide 1,4-dioxane monosolvate, C 11 H 12 N 4 O 3 S·C 4 H 8 O 2 , (2), and 4-amino- N -(5-methoxypyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide tetrahydrofuran monosolvate, C 11 H 12 N 4 O 3 S·C 4 H 8 O, (3), crystallize in the imide form. Hirshfeld surface analyses and fingerprint analyses were performed to study the nature of the interactions and their quantitative contributions towards the crystal packing. Finally, Hirshfeld surfaces, fingerprint plots and structural overlays were employed for a comparison of the two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit of (1), and also for a comparison of (2) and (3) in the monoclinic crystal system. A three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding network exists in all three structures, involving one of the sulfone O atoms and the aniline N atom. All three structures are stabilized by strong intermolecular N—H...N interactions. The tetrahydrofuran solvent molecule also takes part in forming significant intermolecular C—H...O interactions in the crystal structure of (3), contributing to the stability of the crystal packing.",

However, the presence of 4,4'-bipyridine molecules in its cocrystal, C21H18O8·C10H8N2, (1)·BP, inhibits the intermolecular benzoyl-group transfer reaction. In (1), molecules are assembled around the crystallographic twofold screw axis (b axis) to form a helical self-assembly through conventional O-H···O hydrogen-bonding interactions. This helical association places the reactive C6-O-benzoyl group (electrophile, El) and the C4-hydroxy group (nucleophile, Nu) in proximity, with a preorganized El···Nu geometry favourable for the acyl transfer reaction. In the cocrystal (1)·BP, the dibenzoate and bipyridine molecules are arranged alternately through O-H···N interactions. The presence of the bipyridine molecules perturbs the regular helical assembly of the dibenzoate molecules and thus restricts the solid-state reactivity. Hence, unlike the parent dibenzoate crystals, the cocrystals do not exhibit benzoyl-transfer reactions. This approach is useful for increasing the stability of small molecules in the crystalline state and could find application in the design of functional solids.",

In (I), the Cs(+) cations of the two individual irregular coordination polyhedra in the asymmetric unit (one CsO7 and the other CsO8) are linked by bridging carboxylate O-atom donors from the two ligand molecules, both of which are involved in bidentate chelate Ocarboxy,Ophenoxy interactions, while only one has a bidentate carboxylate O,O'-chelate interaction.

In hydrated complex (II), the irregular nine-coordination about the Cs(+) cation comprises a single monodentate water molecule, a bidentate Ocarboxy,Ophenoxy chelate interaction and six bridging carboxylate O-atom bonding interactions, giving a Cs···Cs separation of 4.2473 (3) Å.

The duplex ligand species lie across crystallographic inversion centres, linked through a short O-H···O hydrogen bond involving the single acid H atom.

    "abstract": "The previous structure determination of the title compound, [Fe(C36H44N4)Cl], was of a monoclinic polymorph [Senge (2005). Acta Cryst. E61, m399-m400]. The crystal structure of a new triclinic polymorph has been determined based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction data collected at 100 K. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of the high-spin square-pyramidal iron(III) porphyrinate. The structure exhibits distinct nonstatistical alternative positions for most atoms and was consequently modeled as a whole-molecule disorder. The compound is characterized by an average Fe-N bond length of 2.065 (2) Å, an Fe-Cl bond length of 2.225 (4) Å, and the iron(III) cation displaced by 0.494 (4) Å from the plane of the 24-atom porphyrinate core, essentially the same as in the previously determined polymorph. Common features of the porphyrin plane-plane stacking involve two types of synthons, each of which can be further stabilized with additional H···Cl interactions to the axial chloride ligand, exhibiting concerted interactions of H atoms from the ethyl groups with the π-cloud electron density of adjacent molecules; the shortest methylene H-atom contacts are in the range 2.75-2.91 Å, resulting in plane-plane separations of 3.407 (4) and 3.416 (4) Å, and the shortest methyl H-atom contacts are 2.56-2.95 Å, resulting in plane-plane separations of 4.900 (5) and 4.909 (5) Å in the monoclinic polymorph. The plane-to-plane stacking synthons in the triclinic polymorph are similar, but at greater distances; the shortest methylene H-atom contacts are 2.86-2.94 Å, resulting in plane-plane separations of 3.45 (2) and 3.45 (3) Å, and the shortest methyl H-atom contacts are 2.89-3.20 Å, resulting in plane-plane separations of 5.081 (13) and 5.134 (13) Å, consistent with the density of the triclinic polymorph being 1.5% lower, suggesting lesser packing efficiency and lower stability in the triclinic polymorph. The major molecular differences found in the polymorphs is in three different orientations of the ethyl-group side chains on the periphery of the porphyrin core.",

The compound has been crystallized as polymorphic form I and as the monohydrate, C 21 H 15 ClF 4 N 4 O 3 ·H 2 O. The regorafenib molecule consists of biarylurea and pyridine-2-carboxamide units linked by an ether group. A comparison of both forms shows that they differ in the relative orientation of the biarylurea and pyridine-2-carboxamide units, due to different rotations around the ether group, as measured by the C—O—C bond angles [119.5 (3)° in regorafenib and 116.10 (15)° in the monohydrate]. Meanwhile, the conformational differences are reflected in different hydrogen-bond networks. Polymorphic form I contains two intermolecular N—H...O hydrogen bonds, which link the regorafenib molecules into an infinite molecular chain along the b axis. In the monohydrate, the presence of the solvent water molecule results in more abundant hydrogen bonds. The water molecules act as donors and acceptors, forming N—H...O and O—H...O hydrogen-bond interactions. Thus, R 4 2 (28) ring motifs are formed, which are fused to form continuous spiral ring motifs along the a axis.

    "abstract": "Purine 3':5'-cyclic nucleotides are very well known for their role as the secondary messengers in hormone action and cellular signal transduction. Nonetheless, their solid-state conformational details still require investigation. Five crystals containing purine 3':5'-cyclic nucleotides have been obtained and structurally characterized, namely adenosine 3':5'-cyclic phosphate dihydrate, C10H12N5O6P·2H2O or cAMP·2H2O, (I), adenosine 3':5'-cyclic phosphate 0.3-hydrate, C10H12N5O6P·0.3H2O or cAMP·0.3H2O, (II), guanosine 3':5'-cyclic phosphate pentahydrate, C10H12N5O7P·5H2O or cGMP·5H2O, (III), sodium guanosine 3':5'-cyclic phosphate tetrahydrate, Na(+)·C10H11N5O7P(-)·4H2O or Na(cGMP)·4H2O, (IV), and sodium inosine 3':5'-cyclic phosphate tetrahydrate, Na(+)·C10H10N4O7P(-)·4H2O or Na(cIMP)·4H2O, (V). Most of the cyclic nucleotide zwitterions/anions [two from four cAMP present in total in (I) and (II), cGMP in (III), cGMP(-) in (IV) and cIMP(-) in (V)] are syn conformers about the N-glycosidic bond, and this nucleobase arrangement is accompanied by Crib-H...Npur hydrogen bonds (rib = ribose and pur = purine). The base orientation is tuned by the ribose pucker. An analysis of data obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database made in the context of syn-anti conformational preferences has revealed that among the syn conformers of various purine nucleotides, cyclic nucleotides and dinucleotides predominate significantly. The interactions stabilizing the syn conformation have been indicated. The inter-nucleotide contacts in (I)-(V) have been systematized in terms of the chemical groups involved. All five structures display three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded networks.",

    "abstract": "Luminescent metal complexes are used in photooptical devices. Zinc(II) complexes are of interest because of the ability to tune their color, their high thermal stability and their favorable carrier transport character. In particular, some zinc(II) complexes with aryl diimine and/or heterocyclic ligands have been shown to emit brightly in the blue region of the spectrum. Zinc(II) complexes bearing derivatized imidazoles have been explored for possible optoelectronic applications. The structures of two zinc(II) complexes of 5,6-dimethyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1-[(pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-1H-benzimidazole (L), namely dichlorido(dimethylformamide-κO){5,6-dimethyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl-κN)-1-[(pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-1H-benzimidazole-κN(3)}zinc(II) dimethylformamide monosolvate, [ZnCl2(C20H18N4)(C3H7NO)]·C3H7NO, (I), and bis(acetato-κ(2)O,O'){5,6-dimethyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl-κN)-1-[(pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-1H-benzimidazole-κN(3)}zinc(II) ethanol monosolvate, [Zn(C2H3O2)2(C20H18N4)]·C2H5OH, (II), are reported. Complex (I) crystallized as a dimethylformamide solvate and exhibits a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The coordination sphere consists of a bidentate L ligand spanning axial to equatorial sites, two chloride ligands in equatorial sites, and an O-bound dimethylformamide ligand in the remaining axial site. The other complex, (II), crystallized as an ethanol solvate. The Zn(II) atom has a distorted trigonal prismatic coordination geometry, with two bidentate acetate ligands occupying two edges and a bidentate L ligand occupying the third edge of the prism. Complexes (I) and (II) emit in the blue region of the spectrum. The results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the luminescence of L results from π*←π transitions and that the luminescence of the complexes results from interligand charge-transfer transitions. The orientation of the 2-(pyridin-2-yl) substituent with respect to the benzimidazole system was found to have an impact on the calculated HOMO-LUMO gap (HOMO is highest occupied molecular orbital and LUMO is lowest unoccupied molecular orbital).",

To examine the influence of interactive substituent groups in the aromatic rings of benzoic acids upon secondary structure generation, the anhydrous salts of morpholine with salicylic acid, C 4 H 10 NO + ·C 7 H 5 O 3 − , (I), 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid, C 4 H 10 NO + ·C 7 H 3 N 2 O 7 − , (II), 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid, C 4 H 10 NO + ·C 7 H 3 N 2 O 6 − , (III), and 4-nitroanthranilic acid, C 4 H 10 NO + ·C 7 H 5 N 2 O 4 − , (IV), have been prepared and their hydrogen-bonded crystal structures are described. In the crystal structures of (I), (III) and (IV), the cations and anions are linked by moderately strong N—H...O carboxyl hydrogen bonds, but the secondary structure propagation differs among the three, viz. one-dimensional chains extending along [010] in (I), a discrete cyclic heterotetramer in (III), and in (IV), a heterotetramer with amine N—H...O hydrogen-bond extensions along b , giving a two-layered ribbon structure. With the heterotetramers in both (III) and (IV), the ion pairs are linked though inversion-related N—H...O carboxylate hydrogen bonds, giving cyclic R 4 4 (12) motifs. With (II), in which the anion is a phenolate rather than a carboxylate, the stronger assocation is through a symmetric lateral three-centre cyclic R 1 2 (6) N—H...(O,O′) hydrogen-bonding linkage involving the phenolate and nitro O-atom acceptors of the anion, with extension through a weaker O—H...O carboxyl hydrogen bond. This results in a one-dimensional chain structure extending along [100]. In the structures of two of the salts [ i.e. (II) and (IV)], there are also π–π ring interactions, with ring-centroid separations of 3.5516 (9) and 3.7700 (9) Å in (II), and 3.7340 (9) Å in (IV).",

    "abstract": "Kryptoracemates are racemic compounds (pairs of enantiomers) that crystallize in Sohnke space groups (space groups that contain neither inversion centres nor mirror or glide planes nor rotoinversion axes). Thus, the two symmetry-independent molecules cannot be transformed into one another by any symmetry element present in the crystal structure. Usually, the conformation of the two enantiomers is rather similar if not identical. Sometimes, the two enantiomers are related by a pseudosymmetry element, which is often a pseudocentre of inversion, because inversion symmetry is thought to be favourable for crystal packing. We obtained crystals of two kryptoracemates of two very similar compounds differing in just one residue, namely rac-N-[(1S,2R,3S)-2-methyl-3-(5-methylfuran-2-yl)-1-phenyl-3-(pivalamido)propyl]benzamide, C27H32N2O3, (I), and rac-N-[(1S,2S,3R)-2-methyl-3-(5-methylfuran-2-yl)-1-phenyl-3-(propionamido)propyl]benzamide dichloromethane hemisolvate, C25H28N2O3·0.5CH2Cl2, (II).

However, since the space groups [P212121 for (I) and P1 for (II)] contain neither inversion centres nor mirror or glide planes nor rotoinversion axes, there are both enantiomers in the asymmetric unit, which is a rather uncommon phenomenon. In addition, it is remarkable that (II) contains two pairs of enantiomers in the asymmetric unit. In the crystal, molecules are connected by intermolecular N-H...O hydrogen bonds to form chains or layered structures.",

    "abstract": "Careful choice of the organic ligands is one of the most important parameters in the rational design and synthesis of coordination polymers. Aromatic polycarboxylates have been widely used in the preparation of metal–organic polymers since they can utilize various coordination modes to form diverse structures and can act as hydrogen-bond acceptors and donors in the assembly of supramolecular structures. Nitrogen-heterocyclic organic compounds have also been used extensively as ligands for the construction of polymers with interesting structures.

The dicarboxylate ligands bridge metal ions forming a polymeric chain. The 2-[(1 H -imidazol-1-yl)methyl]-6-methyl-1 H -benzimidazole ligands coordinate to the Co II or Ni II centres in monodentate modes through an imidazole N atom and are pendant on opposite sides of the main chain. The two structures are isomorphous. In the crystal, the one-dimensional chains are further connected through O—H...O, O—H...N and N—H...O hydrogen bonds, leading to a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture. In addition, the IR spectroscopic properties, PXRD patterns, thermogravimetric behaviours and fluorescence properties of both polymers have been investigated.",

In their structures, chiral one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded architectures are formed along [100], mediated by relatively strong N—H...O(P) and N—H...O(C) hydrogen bonds. Both assemblies include the noncentrosymmetric graph-set motifs R 2 2 (10), R 2 1 (6) and C 2 2 (8), and the compounds crystallize in the chiral space group P 1. Due to the data collection of L-1 at 120 K and of D-1 at 95 K, the unit-cell dimensions and volume show a slight difference; the contraction in the volume of D-1 with respect to that in L-1 is about 0.3%. The asymmetric units of both structures consist of two independent phosphoric triamide molecules, with the main difference being seen in one of the torsion angles in the OPNHCH(CH 3 )(C 6 H 5 ) part. The Hirshfeld surface maps of these levo and dextro isomers are very similar; however, they are near mirror images of each other. For both structures, the full fingerprint plot of each symmetry-independent molecule shows an almost asymmetric shape as a result of its different environment in the crystal packing. It is notable that NMR spectroscopy could distinguish between compounds L-1 and D-1 that have different relative stereocentres; however, the differences in chemical shifts between them were found to be about 0.02 to 0.001 ppm under calibrated temperature conditions. In each molecule, the two chiral parts are also different in NMR media, in which chemical shifts and P–H and P–C couplings have been studied.",

In both structures, chiral one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded architectures, along [010], are mediated by N-H...OP interactions. The statistically identical assemblies include the noncentrosymmetric graph-set motif C(4) and the compounds crystallize in the chiral space group P21. As a result of synergistic co-operation from C-H...O interactions, a two-dimensional superstructure is built including a noncentrosymmetric R44(22) hydrogen-bonded motif. A Cambridge Structural Database survey was performed on (O)2P(O)(N)-based structures in order to review the frequency of space groups observed in this family of compounds; the hydrogen-bond motifs in structures with chiral space groups and the types of groups inducing chirality are discussed.

The X-ray structure analysis of 1 revealed a copper complex with square-pyramdial geometry containing two O-donor nitrate ligands along with an N,N'-donor PPTA ligand and one O-donor ethanol ligand. In the binuclear structure of 2, formed by the bridging of two PPTA ligands, each Ag atom has an AgN3O environment and square-planar geometry. In addition to the four dative interactions, each Ag atom interacts with two O atoms of two nitrate ligands on adjacent complexes to complete a pseudo-octahedral geometry. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the geometry around the Cu and Ag atoms in 1opt and 2opt (opt is optimized) for an isolated molecule is the same as the experimental results. In 1, O-H...O hydrogen bonds form R12(4) motifs. In the crystal network of the complexes, in addition to the hydrogen bonds, there are π-π stacking interactions between the aromatic rings (phenyl, pyridine and triazine) of the ligands on adjacent complexes. The ability of the ligand and complexes 1 and 2 to interact with ten selected biomacromolecules (BRAF kinase, CatB, DNA gyrase, HDAC7, rHA, RNR, TrxR, TS, Top II and B-DNA) was investigated by docking studies.

The host celecoxib structure contains one-dimensional channel voids accommodating the solvent molecules, which accept hydrogen bonds from the NH2 groups of two celecoxib molecules. The solvent binding sites have local twofold rotation symmetry, which is consistent with the point symmetry of the solvent molecule in 4 and 5, but introduces orientational disorder for the solvent molecules in 1, 2, 3 and 6. Despite the isostructurality of 1-6, the unit-cell volume and solvent-accessible void space show significant variation. In particular, 4 and 5 show an enlarged and skewed unit cell, which can be attributed to a specific interaction between an N-CH3 group in the solvent molecule and the toluene group of celecoxib. Intermolecular interaction energies calculated using the PIXEL method show that the total interaction energy between the celecoxib and solvent molecules is broadly correlated with the molecular volume of the solvent, except in 6, where the increased polarity of the S=O bond leads to greater overall stabilization compared to the similarlysized DMF molecule in 1. In the structures showing disorder, the most stable orientations of the solvent molecules make C-H center dot center dot O contacts to the S=O groups of celecoxib.",

The structure has monoclinic (P21/m) symmetry. It is of interest in the field of energetic compounds because nitrogen-rich azoles are the backbone of high-density energetic compounds, and salt-based energetic materials can exhibit preferential energy-release behaviour. The bond angles of the 1,2,4-triazolium cation in this study were similar to those of a cationic triazole ring reported previously and were different from those of the neutral triazole ring. This study contributes to the available data that can be used to analyse the relationship between the structures and properties of energetic materials.",

The electron density of the cation was determined by single-crystal X-ray refinements using aspherical structure factors from wavefunction calculations. The detailed picture of the electronic density allowed us to assess the extent and directionality of the Jahn-Teller distortion of the Cr(II) cation away from idealized octahedral symmetry. The topological analysis of the aspherical d-electron density about the Cr(II) cation showed that there are significant valence charge concentrations along the axial Cr-N axes. Likewise, there were significant valence charge depletions about the Cr(II) cation along the equatorial Cr-N bonds. These charge concentrations are in accordance with a Jahn-Teller-distorted six-coordinate complex.",

All these structures feature alternate layers of cations and of anions where any solvent is associated with the anion layers. The two sulfonate salts are protonated at the aniline N atom and the amide N atom of sulfadiazine, a tautomeric form of the sulfadiazine cation that has not been crystallographically described before. All the other salt forms are instead protonated at the aniline group and on one N atom of the pyrimidine ring. Whilst all eight species are based upon hydrogen-bonded centrosymetric dimers with graph set R 2 2 (8), the two sulfonate structures also differ in that these dimers do not link into one-dimensional chains of cations through NH 3 -to-SO 2 hydrogen-bonding interactions, whilst the other six species do. The chloride methanol hemisolvate and the tetraiodide are isostructural and a packing analysis of the cation positions shows that the chloride monohydrate structure is also closely related to these.",

The tools and theories of crystal engineering are indispensable for the rational design of (pharmaceutical) cocrystals.

Using five different sets of crystallization conditions resulted in four different complexes which can be further used as starting compounds for the synthesis of Pt complexes with promising anticancer activities. In the case of vapour diffusion with the binary chloroform–diethyl ether or methylene chloride–diethyl ether systems, no change of the molecular structure was observed. Using evaporation from acetonitrile (at room temperature), dimethylformamide (DMF, at 313 K) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, at 313 K), however, resulted in the displacement of a chloride ligand by the solvent, giving, respectively, the mononuclear complexes (acetonitrile-κ N )(η 2 -2-allyl-4-methoxy-5-{[(propan-2-yloxy)carbonyl]methoxy}phenyl-κ C 1 )chloridoplatinum(II) monohydrate, [Pt(C 15 H 19 O 4 )Cl(CH 3 CN)]·H 2 O, (η 2 -2-allyl-4-methoxy-5-{[(propan-2-yloxy)carbonyl]methoxy}phenyl-κ C 1 )chlorido(dimethylformamide-κ O )platinum(II), [Pt(C 15 H 19 O 4 )Cl(C 2 H 7 NO)], and (η 2 -2-allyl-4-methoxy-5-{[(propan-2-yloxy)carbonyl]methoxy}phenyl-κ C 1 )chlorido(dimethyl sulfoxide-κ S )platinum(II), determined as the analogue {η 2 -2-allyl-4-methoxy-5-[(ethoxycarbonyl)methoxy]phenyl-κ C 1 }chlorido(dimethyl sulfoxide-κ S )platinum(II), [Pt(C 14 H 17 O 4 )Cl(C 2 H 6 OS)]. The crystal structures confirm that acetonitrile interacts with the Pt II atom via its N atom, while for DMSO, the S atom is the coordinating atom. For the replacement, the longest of the two Pt—Cl bonds is cleaved, leading to a cis position of the solvent ligand with respect to the allyl group. The crystal packing of the complexes is characterized by dimer formation via C—H...O and C—H...π interactions, but no π–π interactions are observed despite the presence of the aromatic ring.",

The crystal structures of two new polymorphs of 5,6-dimethyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1-[(pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-1 H -benzimidazole, C 20 H 18 N 4 , are reported. The previously reported polymorph, (1) [Geiger &amp; DeStefano (2014). Acta Cryst.

The molecular structures of the three forms differ in their orientations of the 2-(pyridin-2-yl)- and 1-[(pyridin-2-yl)methyl]- substituents. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the relative energies of the molecule in the three conformations follows the order (1) &lt; (2) &lt; (3), with a spread of 10.6 kJ mol −1 . An analysis of the Hirshfeld surfaces shows that the three polymorphs exhibit intermolecular C—H...N interactions, which can be classified into six types. Based on DFT calculations involving pairs of molecules having the observed interactions, the C—H...N energy in the systems explored is approximately −11.2 to −14.4 kJ mol −1 .",

Recently, organic polymers have received attention regarding their NLO properties and fast nonlinear response, and clusters involving delocalized dπ-pπ systems and conjugated dπ-pπ systems are expected to be a new class of NLO materials. Metal-organic coordination polymers combine the advantages of the organic and inorganic species. Thus far, tuning the third-order NLO properties of these materials has been a significant challenge. A two-dimensional coordination polymer, namely poly[(μ-benzene-1,2-dicarboxylato-κ3O1,O1':O3){μ-1,2-bis[(1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]benzene-κ2N3:N3'}cobalt(II)], [Co(C8H4O4)(C14H14N4)]n, was synthesized by hydrothermal methods. In the structure, the CoII ion is pentacoordinated by two N atoms from two different 1,2-bis[(1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]benzene (1,2-BIB) ligands and three O atoms from two symmetry-related benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate (isophthalate, PA) anions. The pentacoordinated CoII ions are linked by PA ligands to form a chain structure parallel to the c axis. Adjacent chains are further connected by 1,2-BIB ligands to produce a two-dimensional layered structure. The compound exhibits strong third-order nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refraction effects as a thin film. The third-order susceptibility χ(3) is calculated to be 1.07 × 10-8 esu, which is much larger than the values found for pure inorganic semiconductors and some polymers.",

It acts as a bidentate ligand coordinating via the imine N atoms to the Cu(I) atom in complex (2), in which the ethylenediamine unit necessarily adopts a somewhat flattened gauche conformation, resulting in a rather bowed shape overall for the ligand.

The extended structure exhibits two separate N-H···NC hydrogen-bonding motifs, which result in a sheet structure parallel to (010), and weak C-H···NC hydrogen bonds form joined rings. Two types of multicenter CN···π interactions are observed between the bpyH2(2+) rings and tcnoet(-) anions. An additonal CN···π interaction between adjacent tcnoet(-) anions is observed.

    "abstract": "Luminescent cuprous complexes are an important class of coordination compounds due to their relative abundance, low cost and ability to display excellent luminescence. The title ionic trinuclear Cu3I2 complex, tris[μ2-diphenyl(pyridin-2-yl)phosphane-κ2P:N]di-μ3-iodido-tricopper(I)(3 Cu-Cu) hexafluoridophosphate, [Cu3I2(C39H32NP)3]PF6, conventionally abbreviated as [Cu3I2(Ph2PPy)3]PF6, is described. Each CuI atom is coordinated by two μ3-iodide ligands and by a P and an N atom from two Ph2PPy ligands, giving rise to a CuI2PN tetrahedral coordination geometry about each CuI centre. The electronic absorption and photoluminescence properties of this trinuclear cluster have been studied on as-synthesized samples, which had been examined previously by powder X-ray diffraction. A detailed time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) study was carried out and showed a green emission derived from a halide-to-ligand charge transfer and metal-to-ligand charge transfer 3(X+M)LCT excited state.",

    "abstract": "Using polynuclear metal clusters as nodes, many high-symmetry high-connectivity nets, like 8-connnected bcu and 12-connected fcu , have been attained in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). However, construction of low-symmetry high-connected MOFs with a novel topology still remains a big challenge. For example, a uninodal 8-connected lsz network, observed in inorganic ZrSiO 4 , has not been topologically identified in MOFs. Using 2,2′-difluorobiphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (H 2 L ) as a new linker and 1,2,4-triazole (Htrz) as a coligand, a novel three-dimensional Cd II –MOF, namely poly[tetrakis(μ 4 -2,2′-difluorobiphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato-κ 5 O 1 , O 1′ : O 1′ : O 4 : O 4′ )tetrakis( N , N -dimethylformamide-κ O )tetrakis(μ 3 -1,2,4-triazolato-κ 3 N 1 : N 2 : N 4 )hexacadmium(II)], [Cd 6 (C 14 H 6 F 2 O 4 ) 4 (C 2 H 2 N 3 ) 4 (C 3 H 7 NO) 4 ] n , (I), has been prepared. Single-crystal structure analysis indicates that six different Cd II ions co-exist in (I) and each Cd II ion displays a distorted [CdO 4 N 2 ] octahedral geometry with four equatorial O atoms and two axial N atoms. Three Cd II ions are connected by four carboxylate groups and four trz − ligands to form a linear trinuclear [Cd 3 (COO) 4 (trz) 4 ] cluster, as do the other three Cd II ions. Two Cd 3 clusters are linked by trz − ligands in a μ 1,2,4 -bridging mode to produce a two-dimensional Cd II –triazolate layer with (6,3) topology in the ab plane. These two-dimensional layers are further pillared by the L 2− ligands along the c axis to generate a complicated three-dimensional framework. Topologically, regarding the Cd 3 cluster as an 8-connected node, the whole architecture of (I) is a uninodal 8-connected lsz framework with the Schläfli symbol (4 22 ·6 6 ). Complex (I) was further characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and a photoluminescence study. MOF (I) has a high thermal and water stability.",

The triclinic form has only one level of organization, namely a chain/column, while the monoclinic form has two levels of organization, with a chain/column as the primary basic structural motif and a layer as the secondary basic structural motif.",

The crystals obtained for this series of compounds show a balance between C—OH...O=P chain-linked packing and the dimeric types of hydrogen-bond bridges of intermolecular pairs of such functions. The description is based on primary graph-set descriptors. Using graph-set descriptors one level deeper ( i.e. secondary graph sets of the C—H...O type) revealed a similarity in the graph-set descriptors, suggesting a fine interplay of substituent- and shape-dependent effects on strong–weak interactions. It seems that the formation of chains or dimers is governed not only by the presence of a tertiary Cα atom, but also by the nature and crowding of the ortho substituents of the α-aryl group.",

The various noncovalent intermolecular interactions of different strengths were found to be realized in the hydrophilic parts of the crystal packing ( i.e. O—H...Cl, N—H...Cl, C—H...Cl, C—H...O and C—H...π). The hydrophobic parts are built up exclusively by van der Waals H...H contacts. Quantification of the interaction energies using calculated electron-density distribution revealed that the total energy of the contacts within the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions are comparable in value. The organic MR cation adopts the bent conformation with the head group tilted back to the long-chain alkyl tail in both the crystalline and the isolated state due to stabilization of this geometry by several intramolecular C—H...π, C—H...N and H...H interactions. This conformation preference is hypothesized to play an important role in the interaction of MR with biomembranes.",

Both complexes have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, elemental analysis, IR spectra, powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. Complex (I) is a 3D framework constructed from trinuclear structural units and tcpb 3− ligands in a μ 5 -coordination mode. The central Cd II atom of the trinuclear unit is located on a crystallographic inversion centre and adopts an octahedral geometry. The metal atoms are bridged by four syn – syn carboxylate groups and two μ 2 -water molecules to form trinuclear [Cd 3 (COO) 4 (μ 2 -H 2 O) 2 ] secondary building units (SBUs). These SBUs are incorporated into clusters by bridging carboxylate groups to produce pillars along the c axis. The one-dimensional inorganic pillars are connected by tcpb 3− linkers in a μ 5 -coordination mode, thus forming a 3D network; its topology corresponds to the point symbol (4 2 .6 2 .8 2 )(4 4 .6 2 ) 2 (4 5 .6 6 .8 4 ) 2 . In contrast to (I), complex (II) is characterized by a 3D framework based on dinuclear cadmium SBUs, i.e. [Cd 2 (COO) 3 ]. The two symmetry-independent Cd II ions display different coordinated geometries, namely octahedral [CdN 2 O 4 ] and monocapped octahedral [CdO 7 ]. The dinuclear SBUs are incorporated into clusters by bridging formate groups to produce pillars along the c axis. These pillars are further bridged either by tcpb 3− ligands into sheets or by 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)benzene ligands into undulating layers, and finally these two-dimensional surfaces interweave, forming a 3D structure with the point symbol (4.6 2 )(4 7 .6 14 ). Compound (II) exhibits reversible I 2 uptake of 56.8 mg g −1 with apparent changes in the visible colour and the UV–Vis and fluorescence spectra, and therefore may be regarded as a potential reagent for the capture and release of I 2 .",

The title compound, poly[aquatris(μ 3 -4,4-diphenyl-2,5-dioxoimidazolidin-1-ido)trimethanoltrisodium(I)], [Na 3 (C 15 H 11 N 2 O 2 ) 3 (CH 4 O) 3 (H 2 O) 1.08 ] n , a methanol solvate and hydrate of phenytoin sodium, forms a modulated crystal structure that consists of a supercell made up of three close-to-identical repeat units. Each of the basic fragments consists of one phenytoin anion, a sodium cation, and either a methanol, or a methanol and a water molecule coordinated to the sodium ion, yielding a formula unit of Na(C 15 H 11 N 2 O 2 )(CH 3 OH) x (H 2 O) y for each of the three segments ( x , y = 0 or 1; x + y = 1 or 2). Modulation along the b axis is introduced due to the presence or absence of water or methanol molecules at sodium and by the alternating torsion angles of one of the two phenytoin phenyl rings. Individual segments within the asymmetric unit are linked by covalent Na—O and Na—N bonds, with each sodium ion coordinated to one anionic amide N atom and three keto O atoms. The Na—N and one of the Na—O bonds connect (C 15 H 11 N 2 O 2 )·Na units along the modulation direction, creating an infinite [(C 15 H 11 N 2 O 2 )·Na]_{\\infty} chain that is further stabilized by intramolecular N—H...O hydrogen bonding parallel to [010]. The second Na—O bond connects this chain with a symmetry-equivalent copy of itself created by a screw-axis operation, yielding double strands of [(C 15 H 11 N 2 O 2 )·Na]_{\\infty} chains. Two of these double strands, propagating in opposite directions, constitute the content of the unit cell. Neighboring double strands are connected with each other to form layers perpendicular to the a axis, tethered together via O—H...O hydrogen bonds involving the water and methanol molecules. In addition to modulation, each of the repeat units also exhibits disorder of the modulated segments. Phenyl rings of each repeat unit are rotationally disordered, and sodium-coordinated methanol and water molecules are also positionally disordered and/or partially occupied. The solvated structure reported here, while not matching the patterns reported for any of the known forms of phenytoin sodium, does provide a first insight into the complications and complexities involved in resolving the structure of anhydrous phenytoin sodium.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, viologens and their derivatives have received much attention due to their various potential applications, ranging from electro- or photochromic devices to clean energy. Generally, viologen compounds exhibit a colour change upon being subjected to an external stimulus. However, the chromic mechanism is still ambiguous, because there are many electron-transfer pathways for a chromic compound that need to be considered. Thus, exploring new chromic viologen-based compounds with one pathway should be important and meaningful. In this article, two new viologen-based derivatives, namely 1-(2-cyanobenzyl)-4,4′-bipyridinium chloride ( o -CBbpy·Cl), C 18 H 14 N 3 + ·Cl − ( 1 ), and 1-(2-cyanobenzyl)-4,4′-bipyridinium bromide ( o -CBbpy·Br), C 18 H 14 N 3 + ·Br − ( 2 ), have been synthesized and characterized. Interestingly, both isomorphic compounds possess only one electron-transfer pathway, in which 1-(2-cyanobenzyl)-4,4′-bipyridinium cations ( o -CBbpy) and halide anions are employed as electron donors and acceptors, respectively. Salts 1 and 2 consist of o -CBbpy cations involved in π–π interactions and hydrogen-bond interactions, and halide anions weakly hydrogen bonded to the viologen cations. The salts show different photoresponsive characteristics under identical conditions, which should be mainly related to the distances between the halide cations and the cationic N atoms of o -CBbpy but not the electronegativities of the halogen atoms. These results should not only help in understanding that the distance of the electron-transfer pathway plays an important role in viologen-based photochromism, but should also guide the design and synthesis of additional photochromic materials.",

The NHC 7 H 13 group in ( I ) provides two significant hydrogen-donor sites in N—H...O and C—H...O hydrogen bonds, needed for a one-dimensional hydrogen-bond pattern along [100] in the crystal, while ( II ), with a (C 6 H 5 CH 2 ) 2 N moiety, lacks these hydrogen bonds, but its three-dimensional supramolecular structure is mediated by C—H...π interactions. The conformational behaviour of the phenyl rings in ( I ), ( II ) and analogous structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) were studied in terms of flexibility, volume of the other group attached to phosphorus and packing forces. From this study, synclinal (± sc ), anticlinal (± ac ) and antiperiplanar (± ap ) conformations were found to occur. In the structure of ( II ), there is an intramolecular C ortho —H...O interaction that imposes a + sc conformation for the phenyl ring involved. For the structures from the CSD, the + sc and ± ap conformations appear to be mainly imposed by similar C ortho —H...O intramolecular interactions. The large contribution of the C...H/H...C contacts (32.3%) in the two-dimensional fingerprint plots of ( II ) is a result of the C—H...π interactions. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses exhibit peak temperatures ( T m ) at 109 and 81 °C for ( I ) and ( II ), respectively, which agree with the strengths of the intermolecular contacts and the melting points.",

The porphyrin macrocycle shows a distorted saddle geometry, with the four pyrrole rings slightly distorted in an alternating mode either upwards or downwards. The copper ions show three-coordinated triangular and four-coordinated square-planar geometries. Every copper–porphyrin unit connects to 12 others via four μ 4 -bridging Cu 2 Cl moieties to complete the three-dimensional framework of compound 1 , with isolated CuCl 2 (H 2 O) units located in the voids. This copper porphyrin displays a red photoluminescence. Electrochemical measurements showed that compound 1 has two redox waves ( E 1/2 = −160 and 91 mV).",

However, three mutually inconsistent orthorhombic space groups, i.e. A 2 1 am , Fmm 2 and Pnn 2, have been reported for the room-temperature phase of Bi 5 Ti 3 FeO 15 by X-ray and neutron diffraction investigations. Here, electron diffraction results are presented and discussed for the first time to unambiguously clarify the room-temperature space group of ceramic Bi 5 Ti 3 FeO 15 . It has been found that all the observed reflections from the ceramic agree with those expected in A 2 1 am , while the observed reflections 011, 013 and 015 should be forbidden in the case of Fmm 2, and no 107 and 109 reflections were observed although allowed for Pnn 2. The present study has demonstrated that the space group of Bi 5 Ti 3 FeO 15 ceramic is A 2 1 am rather than Fmm 2 or Pnn 2, an identification that proved to be a challenge for X-ray diffraction. On the basis of the space group A 2 1 am , the lattice parameters of the Bi 5 Ti 3 FeO 15 ceramic were calculated from its X-ray diffraction data.",

    "abstract": "Crystals of the rare earth metal polytelluride LaTe 1.82(1) , namely, lanthanum telluride (1/1.8), have been grown by molten alkali halide flux reactions and vapour-assisted crystallization with iodine. The two-dimensionally incommensurately modulated crystal structure has been investigated by X-ray diffraction experiments. In contrast to the tetragonal average structure with unit-cell dimensions of a = 4.4996 (5) and c = 9.179 (1) Å at 296 (1) K, which was solved and refined in the space group P 4/ nmm (No. 129), the satellite reflections are not compatible with a tetragonal symmetry but enforce a symmetry reduction. Possible space groups have been derived by group–subgroup relationships and by consideration of previous reports on similar rare earth metal polychalcogenide structures. Two structural models in the orthorhombic superspace group, i.e. Pmmn (α,β,1 \\over 2)000(−α,β,1 \\over 2)000 (No. 59.2.51.39) and Pm 2 1 n (α,β,1 \\over 2)000(−α,β,1 \\over 2)000 (No. 31.2.51.35), with modulation wave vectors q 1 = α a * + β b * + 1 \\over 2 c * and q 2 = −α a * + β b * + 1 \\over 2 c * [α = 0.272 (1) and β = 0.314 (1)], have been established and evaluated against each other. The modulation describes the distribution of defects in the planar [Te] layer, coupled to a displacive modulation due to the formation of different Te anions. The bonding situation in the planar [Te] layer and the different Te anion species have been investigated by density functional theory (DFT) methods and an electron localizability indicator (ELI-D)-based bonding analysis on three different approximants. The temperature-dependent electrical resistance revealed a semiconducting behaviour with an estimated band gap of 0.17 eV.",

The Ba 2 ZnP 2 compound was determined to crystallize in a body-centered orthorhombic space group, Ibam (No. 72). Formally, this crystallographic arrangement belongs to the K 2 SiP 2 structure type. Therefore, the structure can be best described as infinite [ZnP 2 ] 4− polyanionic chains with divalent Ba 2+ cations located between the chains. All valence electrons are partitioned, which conforms to the Zintl–Klemm concept and suggests that Ba 2 ZnP 2 is a valence-precise composition. The electronic band structure of this new compound, computed with the aid of the TB–LMTO–ASA code, shows that Ba 2 ZnP 2 is an intrinsic semiconductor with a band gap of ca 0.6 eV.",

    "abstract": "Bedaquiline [systematic name: 1-(6-bromo-2-methoxyquinolin-3-yl)-4-(dimethylamino)-2-(naphthalen-1-yl)-1-phenylbutan-2-ol, C 32 H 31 BrN 2 O 2 ] is one of two important new drugs for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). It is marketed in the US as its fumarate salt {systematic name: [4-(6-bromo-2-methoxyquinolin-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(naphthalen-1-yl)-4-phenylbutyl]dimethylazanium 3-carboxyprop-2-enoate, C 32 H 32 BrN 2 O 2 + ·C 4 H 3 O 4 − }, and about a dozen other salts of bedaquiline have been described in patent literature, but none have so far been structurally described. In a first communication, we present the crystal structure of bedaquilinium fumarate and of two new benzoate salts, as well as that of a degradation product of the reaction of bedaquilinium fumarate with sodium ethoxide, 3-benzyl-6-bromo-2-methoxyquinoline, C 17 H 14 BrNO. The fumarate and benzoate salts both feature cations monoprotonated at the dimethylamino group. The much less basic quinoline N atom remains unprotonated. Both salts feature a 1:1 cation-to-anion ratio, with the fumarate being present as monoanionic hydrofumarate. The conformations of the cations are compared to that of free base bedaquiline and with each other. The flexible backbone of the bedaquiline structure leads to a landscape of conformations with little commonalities between the bedaquiline entities in the various structures. The conformations are distinctively different for the two independent molecules of the free base, the two independent molecules of the hydrofumarate salt, and the one unique cation of the benzoate salt. Packing of the salts is dominated by hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen-bonding motifs, as well as the larger hydrogen-bonded entities within the salts, are quite similar for the salts, despite the vastly differing conformations of the cations, and both the hydrofumarate and the benzoate structure feature chains of hydrogen-bonded anions that are surrounded by and hydrogen bonded to the larger bedaquilinium cations, leading to infinite broad ribbons of anions, cations, and (for the benzoate salt) water molecules. The benzoate salt was isolated in two forms: as a 1.17-hydrate (C 32 H 32 BrN 2 O 2 + ·C 7 H 5 O 2 − ·1.166H 2 O), obtained from acetone or propanol solution, with one fully occupied water molecule tightly integrated into the hydrogen-bonding network of anions and cations, and one partially occupied water molecule [refined occupancy 16.6 (7)%], only loosely hydrogen bonded to the quinoline N atom. The second form is an acetonitrile solvate (C 32 H 32 BrN 2 O 2 + ·C 7 H 5 O 2 − ·0.742CH 3 CN·H 2 O), in which the partially occupied water molecule is replaced by a 74.2 (7)%-occupied acetonitrile molecule. The partial occupancy induces disorder for the benzoate phenyl ring. The acetonitrile solvate is unstable in atmosphere and converts into a form not distinguishable by powder XRD from the 1.17-hydrate.",

In solvated salt (II), the self-assembly of H2PO4(-) anions forms a two-dimensional supramolecular architecture with open channels projecting along the [001] direction. The 2-(pyridin-2-yl)pyridinium cations are trapped between the open channels by N-H...O and C-H...O hydrogen bonds. From a study of previously reported structures, dihydrogen phosphate anions show a supramolecular flexibility depending on the nature of the cations.

Compound (II) differs from the others not only in the molar ratio of base and acid (1:2), but also in its hydrogen-bonding pattern, which is based on chain motifs. In (I), (III) and (IV), the most prominent feature is the presence of an R2(2)(8) graph-set motif formed by N-H···O and O-H···N hydrogen bonds, which are present in all structures except for (I), where only a pair of N-H···O hydrogen bonds is present, in agreement with the greater acidity of oxalic acid. There are nonbonding S···O interactions present in all four structures. The difference electron-density maps show a lack of electron density about the S atom along the S···O vector. In all four structures, the carboxylic acid H atoms are present in a rare configuration with a C-C-O-H torsion angle of ∼0°. In the structures of (II)-(IV), the C-C-O-H torsion angle of the second carboxylic acid group has the more common value of ∼|180|°.

All three salts form hydrogen-bonded polymeric structures, viz. three-dimensional in (I) and two-dimensional in (II) and (III).

Structure extension involves N—H...O hydrogen bonds to both carboxylate and nitro O-atom acceptors.

The layers lie parallel to (100). The structures of salt hydrates (II) and (III), displaying two-dimensional layered arrays through conjoined hydrogen-bonded nets, provide further illustration of a previously indicated trend among ammonium salts of carboxylic acids, but the anhydrous three-dimensional structure of (I) is inconsistent with that trend.",

They can play an important role in assembling different coordination structures and yield an interesting variety of one-, two- and three-dimensional polymeric metal-thiocyanate supramolecular frameworks. The structure of a new zinc thiocyanate-aminopyrimidine organic-inorganic compound, (C6H9ClN3)2[Zn(NCS)4]·2C6H8ClN3·2H2O, is reported. The asymmetric unit consist of half a tetrathiocyanatozinc(II) dianion, an uncoordinated 4-amino-5-chloro-2,6-dimethylpyrimidinium cation, a 4-amino-5-chloro-2,6-dimethylpyrimidine molecule and a water molecule. The Zn(II) atom adopts a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry and is coordinated by four N atoms from the thiocyanate anions. The Zn(II) atom is located on a special position (twofold axis of symmetry). The pyrimidinium cation and the pyrimidine molecule are not coordinated to the Zn(II) atom, but are hydrogen bonded to the uncoordinated water molecules and the metal-coordinated thiocyanate ligands. The pyrimidine molecules and pyrimidinium cations also form base-pair-like structures with an R2(2)(8) ring motif via N-H...N hydrogen bonds. The crystal structure is further stabilized by intermolecular N-H...O, O-H...S, N-H...S and O-H...N hydrogen bonds, by intramolecular N-H...Cl and C-H...Cl hydrogen bonds, and also by π-π stacking interactions.",

The asymmetric unit of each salt consists of a 4-[(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl]anilinium monocation, the corresponding sulfonate anion and a water molecule. The cation, anion and water molecule form hydrogen-bonded networks through N—H...O=S, N—H...O water and O water —H...O=S hydrogen bonds. For both salts, the water molecules interact with one sulfonate anion and two anilinium cations. The benzenesulfonate salt forms a two-dimensional network, while the hydrogen bonding within the methanesulfonate salt results in a three-dimensional network.",

    "abstract": "The coordination chemistry of mixed-ligand complexes continues to be an active area of research since these compounds have a wide range of applications. Many coordination polymers and metal–organic framworks are emerging as novel functional materials. Aminopyrimidine and its derivatives are flexible ligands with versatile binding and coordination modes which have been proven to be useful in the construction of organic–inorganic hybrid materials and coordination polymers. Thiophenecarboxylic acid, its derivatives and their complexes exhibit pharmacological properties. Cobalt(II) and copper(II) complexes of thiophenecarboxylate have many biological applications, for example, as antifungal and antitumor agents. Two new cobalt(II) and copper(II) complexes incorporating thiophene-2-carboxylate (2-TPC) and 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine (OMP) ligands have been synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction studies, namely (2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine-κ N )aquachlorido(thiophene-2-carboxylato-κ O )cobalt(II) monohydrate, [Co(C 5 H 3 O 2 S)Cl(C 6 H 9 N 3 O 2 )(H 2 O)]·H 2 O, (I), and catena -poly[copper(II)-tetrakis(μ-thiophene-2-carboxylato-κ 2 O : O ′)-copper(II)-(μ-2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine-κ 2 N 1 : N 3 )], [Cu 2 (C 5 H 3 O 2 S) 4 (C 6 H 9 N 3 O 2 )] n , (II). In (I), the Co II ion has a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment involving one O atom from a monodentate 2-TPC ligand, one N atom from an OMP ligand, one chloride ligand and one O atom of a water molecule. An additional water molecule is present in the asymmetric unit. The amino group of the coordinated OMP molecule and the coordinated carboxylate O atom of the 2-TPC ligand form an interligand N—H...O hydrogen bond, generating an S (6) ring motif. The pyrimidine molecules also form a base pair [ R 2 2 (8) motif] via a pair of N—H...N hydrogen bonds. These interactions, together with O—H...O and O—H...Cl hydrogen bonds and π–π stacking interactions, generate a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture. The one-dimensional coordination polymer (II) contains the classical paddle-wheel [Cu 2 (CH 3 COO) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ] unit, where each carboxylate group of four 2-TPC ligands bridges two square-pyramidally coordinated Cu II ions and the apically coordinated OMP ligands bridge the dinuclear copper units. Each dinuclear copper unit has a crystallographic inversion centre, whereas the bridging OMP ligand has crystallographic twofold symmetry. The one-dimensional polymeric chains self-assemble via N—H...O, π–π and C—H...π interactions, generating a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture.",

    "abstract": "The crystal engineering of coordination polymers has aroused interest due to their structural versatility, unique properties and applications in different areas of science. The selection of appropriate ligands as building blocks is critical in order to afford a range of topologies. Alkali metal cations are known for their mainly ionic chemistry in aqueous media. Their coordination number varies depending on the size of the binding partners, and on the electrostatic interaction between the ligands and the metal ions. The two-dimensional coordination polymer poly[tetra-μ-aqua-[μ4-4,4'-(diazenediyl)bis(5-oxo-1H-1,2,4-triazolido)]disodium(I)], [Na2(C4H2N8O2)(H2O)4]n, (I), was synthesized from 4-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5(4H)-one (ATO) and its single-crystal structure determined. The mid-point of the imino N=N bond of the 4,4'-(diazenediyl)bis(5-oxo-1H-1,2,4-triazolide) (ZTO(2-)) ligand is located on an inversion centre. The asymmetric unit consists of one Na(+) cation, half a bridging ZTO(2-) ligand and two bridging water ligands. Each Na(+) cation is coordinated in a trigonal antiprismatic fashion by six O atoms, i.e. two from two ZTO(2-) ligands and the remaining four from bridging water ligands. The Na(+) cation is located near a glide plane, thus the two bridging O atoms from the two coordinating ZTO(2-) ligands are on adjacent apices of the trigonal antiprism, rather than being in an anti configuration. All water and ZTO(2-) ligands act as bridging ligands between metal centres. Each Na(+) metal centre is bridged to a neigbouring Na(+) cation by two water molecules to give a one-dimensional [Na(H2O)2]n chain. The organic ZTO(2-) ligand, an O atom of which also bridges the same pair of Na(+) cations, then crosslinks these [Na(H2O)2]n chains to form two-dimensional sheets. The two-dimensional sheets are further connected by intermolecular hydrogen bonds, giving rise to a stabile hydrogen-bonded network.",

    "abstract": "A path to new synthons for application in crystal engineering is the replacement of a strong hydrogen-bond acceptor, like a C=O group, with a weaker acceptor, like a C=S group, in doubly or triply hydrogen-bonded synthons. For instance, if the C=O group at the 2-position of barbituric acid is changed into a C=S group, 2-thiobarbituric acid is obtained. Each of the compounds comprises two ADA hydrogen-bonding sites (D = donor and A = acceptor). We report the results of cocrystallization experiments of barbituric acid and 2-thiobarbituric acid, respectively, with 2,4-diaminopyrimidine, which contains a complementary DAD hydrogen-bonding site and is therefore capable of forming an ADA/DAD synthon with barbituric acid and 2-thiobarbituric acid. In addition, pure 2,4-diaminopyrimidine was crystallized in order to study its preferred hydrogen-bonding motifs. The experiments yielded one ansolvate of 2,4-diaminopyrimidine (pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, DAPY), C4H6N4, (I), three solvates of DAPY, namely 2,4-diaminopyrimidine-1,4-dioxane (2/1), 2C4H6N4·C4H8O2, (II), 2,4-diaminopyrimidine-N,N-dimethylacetamide (1/1), C4H6N4·C4H9NO, (III), and 2,4-diaminopyrimidine-1-methylpyrrolidin-2-one (1/1), C4H6N4·C5H9NO, (IV), one salt of barbituric acid, viz. 2,4-diaminopyrimidinium barbiturate (barbiturate is 2,4,6-trioxopyrimidin-5-ide), C4H7N4(+)·C4H3N2O3(-), (V), and two solvated salts of 2-thiobarbituric acid, viz. 2,4-diaminopyrimidinium 2-thiobarbiturate-N,N-dimethylformamide (1/2) (2-thiobarbiturate is 4,6-dioxo-2-sulfanylidenepyrimidin-5-ide), C4H7N4(+)·C4H3N2O2S(-)·2C3H7NO, (VI), and 2,4-diaminopyrimidinium 2-thiobarbiturate-N,N-dimethylacetamide (1/2), C4H7N4(+)·C4H3N2O2S(-)·2C4H9NO, (VII).

However, no coordination compounds have been reported for the multifunctional amino-substituted sulfobenzoate ligand 2-amino-5-sulfobenzoic acid (H 2 asba). We expected that H 2 asba could be a suitable building block for the assembly of supramolecular networks due to its interesting structural characteristics. The reaction of cadmium(II) nitrate with H 2 asba in the presence of the auxiliary flexible dipyridylamide ligand N , N ′-bis[(pyridin-4-yl)methyl]oxamide (4bpme) under ambient conditions formed a new mixed-ligand coordination compound, namely bis(3-amino-4-carboxybenzenesulfonato-κ O 1 )diaquabis{ N , N ′-bis[(pyridin-4-yl)methyl]oxamide-κ N }cadmium(II)– N , N ′-bis[(pyridin-4-yl)methyl]oxamide–water (1/1/4), [Cd(C 7 H 6 NO 5 S) 2 (C 14 H 14 N 4 O 2 ) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ]·C 14 H 14 N 4 O 2 ·4H 2 O, (1), which was characterized by single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD), FT–IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TG), and UV–Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopic analyses in the solid state.

Interestingly, complex (1) further extends into a threefold polycatenated 0D→2D (0D is zero-dimensional and 2D is two-dimensional) interpenetrated supramolecular two-dimensional (4,4) layer through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The interlayer hydrogen bonding further links adjacent threefold polycatenated two-dimensional layers into a three-dimensional network. The optical properties of complex (1) indicate that it may be used as a potential indirect band gap semiconductor material. Complex (1) exhibits an irreversible dehydration–rehydration behaviour.

    "abstract": "Cocrystals are molecular solids composed of at least two types of neutral chemical species held together by noncovalent forces. Crystallization of thymine [systematic name: 5-methylpyrimidine-2,4(1 H ,3 H )-dione] with four phenolic coformers resulted in cocrystal formation, viz. catechol (benzene-1,2-diol) giving thymine–catechol (1/1), C 5 H 6 N 2 O 2 ·C 6 H 6 O 2 , (I), resorcinol (benzene-1,3-diol) giving thymine–resorcinol (2/1), 2C 5 H 6 N 2 O 2 ·C 6 H 6 O 2 , (II), hydroquinone (benzene-1,4-diol) giving thymine–hydroquinone (2/1), 2C 5 H 6 N 2 O 2 ·C 6 H 6 O 2 , (III), and pyrogallol (benzene-1,2,3-triol) giving thymine–pyrogallol (1/2), C 5 H 6 N 2 O 2 ·2C 6 H 6 O 3 , (IV). The resorcinol molecule in (II) occupies a twofold axis, while the hydroquinone molecule in (III) is situated on a centre of inversion. Thymine–thymine base pairing is common across all four structures, albeit with different patterns. In (I)–(III), the base pair is propagated into an infinite one-dimensional ribbon, whereas it exists as a discrete dimeric unit in (IV). In (I)–(III), the two donor N atoms and one carbonyl acceptor O atom of thymine are involved in thymine–thymine base pairing and the remaining carbonyl O atom is hydrogen bonded to the coformer. In contrast, in (IV), just one donor N atom and one acceptor O atom are involved in base pairing, and the remaining donor N atom and acceptor O atom of thymine form hydrogen bonds to the coformer molecules. Thus, the utilization of the donor and acceptor atoms of thymine in the hydrogen bonding is influenced by the coformers.",

The coordination geometry of the Bi(III) cation is distorted pentagonal-bipyramidal (BiO4N2Cl), with one bridging carboxylate O atom and one Cl atom located in the axial positions.

Intermolecular π-π stacking interactions are observed, with centroid-to-centroid distances of 3.678 (4) Å, which further stabilize the structure.

    "abstract": "Psilocybin {systematic name: 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-indol-4-yl dihydrogen phosphate} is a zwitterionic tryptamine natural product found in numerous species of fungi known for their psychoactive properties. Following its structural elucidation and chemical synthesis in 1959, purified synthetic psilocybin has been evaluated in clinical trials and has shown promise in the treatment of various mental health disorders. In a recent process-scale crystallization investigation, three crystalline forms of psilocybin were repeatedly observed: Hydrate A, Polymorph A, and Polymorph B. The crystal structure for Hydrate A was solved previously by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. This article presents new crystal structure solutions for the two anhydrates, Polymorphs A and B, based on Rietveld refinement using laboratory and synchrotron X-ray diffraction data, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Utilizing the three solved structures, an investigation was conducted via Rietveld method (RM) based quantitative phase analysis (QPA) to estimate the contribution of the three different forms in powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns provided by different sources of bulk psilocybin produced between 1963 and 2021. Over the last 57 years, each of these samples quantitatively reflect one or more of the hydrate and anhydrate polymorphs. In addition to quantitatively evaluating the composition of each sample, this article evaluates correlations between the crystal forms present, corresponding process methods, sample age, and storage conditions. Furthermore, revision is recommended on characterizations in recently granted patents that include descriptions of crystalline psilocybin inappropriately reported as a single-phase `isostructural variant.' Rietveld refinement demonstrated that the claimed material was composed of approximately 81% Polymorph A and 19% Polymorph B, both of which have been identified in historical samples. In this article, we show conclusively that all published data can be explained in terms of three well-defined forms of psilocybin and that no additional forms are needed to explain the diffraction patterns.",

    "abstract": "It has been observed that when electron-rich naphthyl rings are present in chalcones they can participate in π–π stacking interactions, and this can play an important role in orientating inhibitors within the active sites of enzymes, while chalcones containing heterocyclic substituents additionally exhibit fungistatic and fungicidal properties. With these considerations in mind, three new chalcones containing 2-naphthyl substituents were prepared. 3-(4-Fluorophenyl)-1-(naphthalen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one, C 19 H 13 FO, (I), crystallizes with Z ′ = 2 in the space group P -1 and the four molecules in the unit cell adopt an arrangement which resembles that in the space group P 2 1 / a . Although 3-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(naphthalen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one, C 19 H 13 BrO, (II), with Z ′ = 1, is not isostructural with (I), the molecules of (I) and (II) adopt very similar conformations.

    "abstract": "PhotoCORMs (photo-active CO-releasing molecules) have emerged as a class of CO donors where the CO release process can be triggered upon illumination with light of appropriate wavelength. We have recently reported an Mn-based photoCORM, namely [MnBr(pbt)(CO) 3 ] [pbt is 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,3-benzothiazole], where the CO release event can be tracked within cellular milieu by virtue of the emergence of strong blue fluorescence. In pursuit of developing more such trackable photoCORMs, we report herein the syntheses and structural characterization of two Mn I –carbonyl complexes, namely fac -tricarbonylchlorido[2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,3-benzothiazole-κ 2 N , N ′]manganese(I), [MnCl(C 12 H 8 N 2 S)(CO) 3 ], (1), and fac -tricarbonylchlorido[2-(quinolin-2-yl)-1,3-benzothiazole-κ 2 N , N ′]manganese(I), [MnCl(C 16 H 10 N 2 S)(CO) 3 ], (2). In both complexes, the Mn I center resides in a distorted octahedral coordination environment. Weak intermolecular C—H...Cl contacts in complex (1) and Cl...S contacts in complex (2) consolidate their extended structures. These complexes also exhibit CO release upon exposure to low-power broadband visible light. The apparent CO release rates for the two complexes have been measured to compare their CO donating capacity. The fluorogenic 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,3-benzothiazole and 2-(quinolin-2-yl)-1,3-benzothiazole ligands provide a convenient way to track the CO release event through the `turn-ON' fluorescence which results upon de-ligation of the ligands from their respective metal centers following CO photorelease.",

Zinc–3-hydroxyflavonolate compounds, including those of quercetin, kampferol, and morin, generally exhibit bidentate coordination to a single Zn II center. The bipyridine-ligated zinc–flavonolate compound reported herein, namely bis(μ-4-oxo-2-phenyl-4 H -chromen-3-olato)-κ 3 O 3 : O 3 , O 4 ;κ 3 O 3 , O 4 : O 3 -bis[(2,2′-bipyridine-κ 2 N , N ′)zinc(II)] bis(perchlorate), {[Zn 2 (C 15 H 9 O 3 ) 2 (C 10 H 8 N 2 ) 2 ](ClO 4 ) 2 } n , ( 1 ), provides an unusual example of bridging 3-hydroxyflavonolate ligation in a dinuclear metal complex. The symmetry-related Zn II centers of ( 1 ) exhibit a distorted octahedral geometry, with weak coordination of a perchlorate anion trans to the bridging deprotonated O atom of the flavonolate ligand. Variable-concentration conductivity measurements provide evidence that, when ( 1 ) is dissolved in CH 3 CN, the complex dissociates into monomers. 1 H NMR resonances for ( 1 ) dissolved in d 6 -DMSO were assigned via HMQC to the H atoms of the flavonolate and bipyridine ligands. In CH 3 CN, ( 1 ) undergoes quantitative visible-light-induced CO release with a quantum yield [0.004 (1)] similar to that exhibited by other mononuclear zinc–3-hydroxyflavonolate complexes. Mass spectroscopic identification of the [(bpy) 2 Zn( O -benzoylsalicylate)] + ion provides evidence of CO release from the flavonol and of ligand exchange at the Zn II center.",

The purity of the bulk sample was confirmed by elemental analysis and X-ray powder diffraction. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the Cd II ions adopt a five-coordinated distorted trigonal–bipyramidal geometry, coordinated by three O atoms from three different 1,3,5-HBTC 2− ligands and two N atoms from two different 1,4-btbe ligands; the latter are situated on centres of inversion. The Cd II centres are bridged by 1,3,5-HBTC 2− and 1,4-btbe ligands into an overall three-dimensional framework. When the Cd II centres and the tetradentate 1,4-btbe ligands are regarded as nodes, the three-dimensional topology can be simplified as a binodal 4,6-connected network.

    "abstract": "A cinnamamide (3-phenylprop-2-enamide) core is present in many pharmacologically active compounds. We report three new crystal structures of N-substituted cinnamamide derivatives which were screened for anticonvulsant activity, namely (R,S)-(2E)-N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-phenylprop-2-enamide, C12H15NO2, (1), (R,S)-(2E)-N-(1-hydroxybutan-2-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-enamide, C13H17NO2, (2), and (2E)-1-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-en-1-one, C14H17NO2, (3). Compounds (1) and (2) crystallize in the Pbca space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, whereas compound (3) crystallizes in the P21/c space group with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. All the crystal structures are stabilized by intermolecular O-H...O hydrogen bonds and additionally by N-H...O hydrogen bonds in the structures of (1) and (2). The investigated compounds possess fragments that are considered as beneficial for anticonvulsant activity. The conformations of these compounds were analyzed in comparison with the characteristic features of the proposed pharmacophore model of anticonvulsants active in the maximal electroshock test, i.e. a phenyl ring or other hydrophobic unit, an electron-donor atom and a hydrogen-bond acceptor/donor domain. In the reported series, two calculated distances fitted the reference model, while the third did not. Structure-activity analysis suggests that anticonvulsant properties may be related to the N-atom substituent. It is beneficial to combine an electron-donor atom (e.g. an O atom) with an H atom in the substituent to ensure appropriate interactions with the molecular target. We analyzed the intermolecular interactions in order to find an appropriate spatial arrangement of the important features responsible for anticonvulsant activity.",

GCV is an achiral molecule in the sense that its individual conformers, which are generally chiral objects, undergo fast interconversion in the liquid state and cannot be isolated. In the crystalline state, GCV exists as two inversion-related conformers in Form I and as a single chiral conformer in Form II. This situation is similar to that observed for glycine, also an achiral molecule, whose α-polymorph contains two inversion-related conformers, while the γ-polymorph contains a single conformer that is chiral. The hydrogen bonds are exclusively intermolecular in Form I, but both inter- and intramolecular in Form II, which accounts for the different molecular conformations in the two polymorphs.",

In order to study the influence of the environment on the conformation of ( Z )-5-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]-3 H -imidazol-4(5 H )-one, ( 3 ), two different salts were prepared, namely with picolinic acid {systematic name: 4-[( Z )-4-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-5-oxo-3,4-dihydro-1 H -imidazol-2-yl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-ium pyridine-2-carboxylate, C 16 H 20 ClN 4 O 2 + ·C 6 H 4 NO 2 − , ( 3 a )} and 4-nitrophenylacetic acid {systematic name: 4-[( Z )-4-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-5-oxo-3,4-dihydro-1 H -imidazol-2-yl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-ium 2-(4-nitrophenyl)acetate, C 16 H 20 ClN 4 O 2 + ·C 8 H 6 NO 4 − , ( 3 b )}. The crystal structures of the new salts were determined by X-ray diffraction. In both crystal structures, the molecule of ( 3 ) is protonated at an N atom of the piperazine ring by proton transfer from the corresponding acid. The carboxylate group of picolinate engages in hydrogen bonds with three molecules of the cation of ( 3 ), whereas the carboxylate group of 4-nitrophenylacetate engages in hydrogen bonds with only two molecules of ( 3 ). As a consequence of these interactions, different orientations of the hydroxyethyl group of ( 3 ) are observed. The crystal structures are additionally stabilized by both C—H...N [in ( 3 a )] and C—H...O [in ( 3 a ) and ( 3 b )] intermolecular interactions.

The tautomer observed in the crystal structures presented here, namely 3 H -imidazol-4(5 H )-one [systematic name: 1 H -imidazol-5(4 H )-one], is also that most frequently observed in other structures containing this heterocycle.",

In Rb complex (II), the same basic MO6 coordination is found in the repeat unit, but it is expanded to RbO9 through a slight increase in the accepted Rb-O bond-length range and includes an additional Rb-O(carboxylate) bond, completing a bidentate O,O'-chelate interaction, and additional bridging Rb-O(nitro) and Rb-O(water) bonds. The comparative K-O and Rb-O bond-length ranges are 2.7352 (14)-3.0051 (14) and 2.884 (2)-3.182 (2) Å, respectively.

The amine group para to the nitro group in (I) adopts an approximately planar geometry, whereas the meta amine group is decidedly pyramidal. In the hydrogen halide salts (II) and (III), the amine group meta to the nitro group is protonated. Compound (I) displays a pleated-sheet hydrogen-bonded two-dimensional structure with R2(2)(14) and R4(4)(20) rings. The sheets are joined by additional hydrogen bonds, resulting in a three-dimensional extended structure. Hydrohalide salt (II) has two formula units in the asymmetric unit that are related by a pseudo-inversion center. The dominant hydrogen-bonding interactions involve the chloride ion and result in R4(2)(8) rings linked to form a ladder-chain structure. The chains are joined by N-H···Cl and N-H···O hydrogen bonds to form sheets parallel to (010). In hydrated hydrohalide salt (III), bromide ions are hydrogen bonded to amine and ammonium groups to form R4(2)(8) rings. The water behaves as a double donor/single acceptor and, along with the bromide anions, forms hydrogen bonds involving the nitro, amine, and ammonium groups. The result is sheets parallel to (001) composed of alternating R5(5)(15) and R6(4)(24) rings. Ammonium N-H···Br interactions join the sheets to form a three-dimensional extended structure. Energy-minimized structures obtained using DFT and MP2 calculations are consistent with the solid-state structures. Consistent with (II) and (III), calculations show that protonation of the amine group meta to the nitro group results in a structure that is about 1.5 kJ mol(-1) more stable than that obtained by protonation of the para-amine group. DFT calculations on single molecules and hydrogen-bonded pairs of molecules based on structural results obtained for (I) and for 3-nitrobenzene-1,2-diamine, (IV) [Betz & Gerber (2011). Acta Cryst.

Benzimidazole (I) displays two sets of aromatic interactions, each of which involves pairs of molecules in a head-to-tail arrangement. The first, denoted set (Ia), exhibits both intermolecular C-H···π interactions between the 2-(furan-2-yl) (abbreviated as Fn) and 1-(furan-2-ylmethyl) (abbreviated as MeFn) substituents, and π-π interactions involving the Fn substituents between inversion-center-related molecules. The second, denoted set (Ib), involves π-π interactions involving both the benzene ring (Bz) and the imidazole ring (Im) of benzimidazole. Hydrated salt (II) exhibits N-H···OH2···Cl hydrogen bonding that results in chains of molecules parallel to the a axis. There is also a head-to-head aromatic stacking of the protonated benzimidazole cations in which the Bz and Im rings of one molecule interact with the Im and Fn rings of adjacent molecules in the chain.

For (Ia), the analysis was used to partition the interaction energies into the C-H···π and π-π components, which are 9.4 and 24.1 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Energy-minimized structures were used to determine the optimal interplanar spacing, the slip distance along the major molecular axis, and the slip distance along the minor molecular axis for 2-(furan-2-yl)-1H-benzimidazole.",

Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 53, 662-671], are reported. For (I), the bond-angle sum at one of the N atoms [359 (1)°] shows a nearly planar configuration, while the other two show a nonplanar geometry with bond-angle sums of 342 (1) and 347 (1)°. The location of the atoms attached to the nonplanar N atoms suggests an anti orientation of the corresponding lone electron pairs (LEPs) on these N atoms with respect to the P=S group. For 74 structures with a P(S)[N]3 skeleton and with the N atom in a three-coordinate geometry, the bond-angle sums at the N atoms were found to be in the range 293-360°. Among 307 such three-coordinate N atoms, 39% (120 N atoms) have bond-angle sums in the range 359-360°, in accordance with sp(2) hybridization, and 45% (138 N atoms) have bond-angle sums in the range 352-359°, with hybridization close to sp(2).

    "abstract": "Glycine (Gly) is incorporated in roughly half of all known peptaibiotic (nonribosomally biosynthesized antibiotic peptides of fungal origin) sequences and is the residue with the greatest conformational flexibility. The conformational space of Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid) is severely restricted by the second methyl group attached to the Cα atom. Most of the crystal structures containing Aib are N-terminal protected. Deprotection of the N- or C-terminus of peptides may alter the hydrogen-bonding scheme and/or the structure and may facilitate crystallization. The structure reported here for glycyl-α-aminoisobutyrylglycyl-α-aminoisobutyric acid tert-butyl ester, C16H30N4O5, describes the first N-terminal-unprotected (Gly-Aib)n peptide. The achiral peptide could form an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the C=O group of Gly1 and the N-H group of Aib4. This hydrogen bond is found in all tetrapeptides and N-terminal-protected tripeptides containing Aib, apart from one exception. In the present work, this hydrogen bond is not observed (N...O = 5.88 Å). Instead, every molecule is hydrogen bonded to six other symmetry-related molecules with a total of eight hydrogen bonds per molecule. The backbone conformation starts in the right-handed helical region (and the left-handed helical region for the inverted molecule) and reverses the screw sense in the last two residues.",

    "abstract": "Azole compounds have attracted commercial interest due to their high bactericidal and plant-growth-regulating activities. Uniconazole [or 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-(1 H -1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)pent-1-en-3-ol] is a highly active 1,2,4-triazole fungicide and plant-growth regulator with low toxicity. The pharmacological and toxicological properties of many drugs are modified by the formation of their metal complexes. Therefore, there is much interest in exploiting the coordination chemistry of triazole pesticides and their potential application in agriculture. However, reports of complexes of uniconazole are rare. A new cobalt(II) complex of uniconazole, namely dichloridotetrakis[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-(1 H -1,2,4-triazol-1-yl-κ N 4 )pent-1-en-3-ol]cobalt(II), [CoCl 2 (C 15 H 18 ClN 3 O) 4 ], was synthesized and structurally characterized by element analysis, IR spectrometry and X-ray single-crystal diffraction. The crystal structural analysis shows that the Co II atom is located on the inversion centre and is coordinated by four uniconazole and two chloride ligands, forming a distorted octahedral geometry. The hydroxy groups of an uniconazole ligands of adjacent molecules form hydrogen bonds with the axial chloride ligands, resulting in one-dimensional chains parallel to the a axis. The complex was analysed for its antifungal activity by the mycelial growth rate method. It was revealed that the antifungal effect of the title complex is more pronounced than the effect of fungicide uniconazole for Botryosphaeria ribis , Wheat gibberellic and Grape anthracnose .",

    "abstract": "The significant variety in the crystal structures of rare-earth carboxylate complexes is due to both the large coordination numbers of the rare-earth cations and the ability of the carboxylate anions to form several types of bridges between rare-earth metal atoms.

The interaction of LnCl3(thf)x (Ln = Eu or Y; thf is tetrahydrofuran) with sodium or diethylammonium diphenylacetate in methanol followed by recrystallization from a DME/THF/hexane solvent mixture (DME is 1,2-dimethoxyethane) leads to crystals of the non-isomorphic dinuclear complexes tetrakis(μ-2,2-diphenylacetato)-κ(4)O:O';κ(3)O,O':O';κ(3)O:O,O'-bis[(1,2-dimethoxyethane-κ(2)O,O')(2,2-diphenylacetato-κ(2)O,O')europium(III)], [Eu(C14H11O2)6(C4H10O2)2], (I), and tetrakis(μ-2,2-diphenylacetato)-κ(4)O:O';κ(3)O,O':O';κ(3)O:O,O'-bis[(1,2-dimethoxyethane-κ(2)O,O')(2,2-diphenylacetato-κ(2)O,O')yttrium(III)], [Y(C14H11O2)6(C4H10O2)2], (II), possessing monoclinic (P21/c) symmetry. The [Ln(Ph2CHCOO)3(dme)]2 molecule (Ln = Eu or Y) lies on an inversion centre and exhibits three different coordination modes of the diphenylacetate ligands, namely bidentate κ(2)O,O'-terminal, bidentate μ2-κ(1)O:κ(1)O'-bridging and tridentate μ2-κ(1)O:κ(2)O,O'-semibridging. The terminal and bridging ligands in (I) are disordered over two positions, with an occupancy ratio of 0.806 (2):0.194 (2). The interaction of EuCl3(thf)2 with Na[Ph3CCOO] in methanol followed by crystallization from hot methanol produces crystals of tetrakis(methanol-κO)tris(2,2,2-triphenylacetato)-κ(4)O:O';κO-europium(III) methanol disolvate, [Eu(C19H15O2)3(CH3OH)4]·2CH3OH, (III)·2MeOH, with triclinic (P-1) symmetry. The molecule of (III) contains two O,O'-bidentate and one O-monodentate terminal triphenylacetate ligand. (III)·2MeOH possesses one intramolecular and four intermolecular hydrogen bonds, forming a [(III)·2MeOH]2 dimer with two bridging methanol molecules.",

The original poly(pyrazol-1-yl)borates, christened `scorpionates', were pioneered by the late Professor Swiatoslaw Trofimenko and have expanded to include various borate ligands with N-, P-, O-, S-, Se- and C-donors. Scorpionate ligands with boron–carbon bonds, rather than the normal boron–nitrogen bonds, have been developed and in these new types of scorpionate ligands, amines and azoles, such as pyridines, imidazoles and oxazolines, have been employed as N-donors instead of pyrazoles. Furthermore, a variety of bis- and tris(oxazolinyl)borate ligands, including chiral ones, have been developed. Tris(oxazolin-2-yl)borates work as facially capping tridentate chelating ligands in the same way as tris(pyrazol-1-yl)borates. In the title compound, [Ni(C 21 H 29 BN 3 O 3 )Cl], the Ni II ion is coordinated by three N atoms from the facially capping tridentate chelating tris(4,4-dimethyloxazolin-2-yl)phenylborate ligand and a chloride ligand in a highly distorted tetrahedral geometry.

Cd(II) ions are connected by two kinds of crystallographically independent succinate ligands to generate a two-dimensional layered structure with bimt ligands located on each side of the layer. Adjacent layers are further connected by hydrogen bonding, leading to a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture in the solid state. Thermogravimetric analysis of the title polymer shows that it is stable up to 529 K and then loses weight from 529 to 918 K, corresponding to the decomposition of the bimt ligands and succinate groups. The polymer exhibits a strong fluorescence emission in the solid state at room temperature.",

Detailed geometry analysis via density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that the 1:1 cocrystal stoichiometry is sustained by N—H...O hydrogen bonding between the amine (–NH 2 ) groups of thiourea and the carbonyl group of coumarin. The synthesized cocrystal exhibited potent antioxidant activity (IC 50 = 127.9 ± 5.95 µ M ) in a DPPH radical scavenger assay in vitro in comparison with the standard N -acetyl-L-cysteine (IC 50 = 111.6 ± 2.4 µ M ).

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected and used to solve and refine the structure. Li 4 CdGe 2 S 7 is a member of the small, but growing, class of I 4 –II–IV 2 –VI 7 diamond-like materials. The compound adopts the Cu 5 Si 2 S 7 structure type, which is a derivative of lonsdaleite. Crystallizing in the polar space group Cc , Li 4 CdGe 2 S 7 contains 14 crystallographically unique ions, all residing on general positions. Like all diamond-like structures, the compound is built of corner-sharing tetrahedral units that create a relatively dense three-dimensional assembly. The title compound is the major phase of the reaction product, as evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction and optical diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. While the compound exhibits a second-harmonic generation (SHG) response comparable to that of the AgGaS 2 (AGS) reference material in the IR region, its laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is over an order of magnitude greater than AGS for λ = 1.064 µm and τ = 30 ps. Bond valence sums, global instability index, minimum bounding ellipsoid (MBE) analysis, and electronic structure calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were used to further evaluate the crystal structure and electronic structure of the compound and provide a comparison with the analogous I 2 –II–IV–VI 4 diamond-like compound Li 2 CdGeS 4 . Li 4 CdGe 2 S 7 appears to be a better IR nonlinear optical (NLO) candidate than Li 2 CdGeS 4 and one of the most promising contenders to date. The exceptional LIDT is likely due, at least in part, to the wider optical bandgap of ∼3.6 eV.",

The lattice constants of the BaZrS3 structure are well reproduced from our first-principles calculations and are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements. Moreover, the values of mechanical parameters, such as the elastic constant, increased under applied pressure. The electronic parameters indicate that the chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3 has a direct band gap of 1.75 eV. To understand the optical response, the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of BaZrS3 have been studied, as well as the absorption coefficient, reflectivity and extinction coefficient. The induced pressure is found to enhance the optical parameters in the different energy regions. Our calculations predict that the studied chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3 could be a candidate in photovoltaic, optoelectronic and mechanical applications.",

This strong interaction results in significant lengthening of the internal N—Se distance, consistent with significant population of the Se—N σ* antibonding orbital. Much weaker intermolecular O...Se chalcogen bonding occurs between the amide-like O atom in 2 and the less polarized C—Se bond in this structure. Charge density analysis of 2 using multipole refinement of high-resolution data allowed the electrostatic surface potential for 2 to be mapped, and clearly reveals the σ-hole at the extension of the Se—N bond as an area of positive electrostatic potential. Topological analysis of the electron-density distribution in 2 was carried out within the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) framework and revealed bond paths and (3,−1) bond critical points (BCPs) for the N...Se—N moiety consistent with a closed-shell interaction; however, the potential energy term is suggestive of electron sharing. Analysis of the electron localization function (ELF) for the strong N...Se and the weak O...Se chalcogen-bonding interactions in the structure of 2 suggest significant electron sharing in the former interaction, and a largely electrostatic interaction in the latter. Conversion of 2 to its N -methylated derivatives by reaction with methyl iodide [1-methyl-3-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzoselenazol-2-yl)pyridin-1-ium iodide, C 13 H 11 N 2 OSe + ·I − ] and methyl tosylate [1-methyl-3-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzoselenazol-2-yl)pyridin-1-ium toluenesulfonate trihydrate, C 13 H 11 N 2 OSe + ·C 7 H 7 O 3 S − ·3H 2 O] removes the possibility of N...Se chalcogen bonding and instead structures are obtained where the iodide and tosylate counter-ions fulfill the role of chalcogen-bond acceptors, with a strong I − ...Se interaction in the iodide salt and a weaker p -Tol-SO 3 − ...Se interaction in the tosylate salt.",

    "abstract": "The title benzimidazole compounds, namely, 2-(4-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)-1 H -benzo[ d ]imidazole, C 18 H 14 N 2 O ( I ) and 2-(4-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)-1-[(4-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)methyl]-1 H -benzo[ d ]imidazole ethanol monosolvate, C 30 H 24 N 2 O 2 ·C 2 H 6 O ( II ), were synthesized by the condensation reaction of benzene-1,2-diamine with 4-methoxynaphthalene-1-carbaldehyde in the ratios 1:1 and 1:2, respectively. In I , the mean plane of the naphthalene ring system is inclined to that of the benzimidazole ring by 39.22 (8)°, while in II , the corresponding dihedral angle is 64.76 (6)°. This difference is probably influenced by the position of the second naphthalene ring system in II ; it is inclined to the benzimidazole ring mean plane by 77.68 (6)°. The two naphthalene ring systems in II are inclined to one another by 75.58 (6)°. In the crystal of I , molecules are linked by N—H...N hydrogen bonds to form chains propagating along the a -axis direction. Inversion-related molecules are also linked by a C—H...π interaction linking the chains to form layers lying parallel to the ac plane. In the crystal of II , the disordered ethanol molecule is linked to the molecule of II by an O—H...N hydrogen bond. There are a number of C—H...π interactions present, both intra- and intermolecular. Molecules related by an inversion centre are linked by C—H...π interactions, forming a dimer. The dimers are linked by further C—H...π interactions, forming ribbons propagating along the b -axis direction. The interatomic contacts in the crystal structures of both compounds were explored using Hirshfeld surface analysis. The molecular structures of I and II were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the M062X/6-311+g(d) level of theory and compared with the experimentally determined molecular structures in the solid state. Local and global reactivity descriptors were computed to predict the reactivity of the title compounds. Both compounds were shown to exhibit significant anticorrosion properties with respect to iron and copper.",

These are dopamine [2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethan-1-aminium] benzoate, C 8 H 12 NO 2 + ·C 7 H 5 O 2 − , I , dopamine 4-nitrobenzoate, C 8 H 12 NO 2 + ·C 7 H 4 NO 4 − , II , dopamine ethanedisulfonate, 2C 8 H 12 NO 2 + ·C 2 H 4 O 6 S 2 2− , III , and dopamine 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate monohydrate, C 8 H 12 NO 2 + ·C 6 H 5 O 4 S − ·H 2 O, IV . In all four structures, the dopamine cation adopts an extended conformation. Intermolecular interaction motifs that are common in the salt forms of tyramine can be found in related dopamine structures, but hydrogen bonding in the dopamine structures appear to be more variable and less predictable than for tyramine. Packing analysis discovered three dopamine-containing groups of structures that can be described as isostructural with regards to the cation positions. Two of these groups contain both dopamine and tyramine species, and one of these is also highly variable in other ways too, containing anhydrous and hydrated forms, different anion types and ionized and neutral phenylethylamine species. As such, the group illustrates that packing behaviour can be robust and similar even where intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds are very different.",

The structures of vanadate garnets are subject to geometric constraints similar to those of silicate garnets.

However, the vanadate garnet Ca2NaCd2V3O12 exhibits the normal structural feature, similar to pyralspite (pyrope, almandine and spessartine) garnets, namely that the dodecahedral-dodecahedral shared edge length is shorter than the unshared dodecahedral edge length.

The polymorphs were isolated from slow-evaporation conditions or from cocrystallization attempts. The main differences between the polymorphs involve differences in packing rather than differences in conformation, owing to the limited conformational freedom of the three molecules. 4-Hydroxybenzophenone is the exception, exhibiting almost identical packing arrangements in the two polymorphs, with the only major changes being in the interplanar orientations. The lattice energies of the respective polymorphs of the three compounds reported here are all within 1 kcal mol −1 of each other. The existence of nine further polymorphic benzophenone derivatives in the literature suggests that there is a good deal of polymorphic space in this class of compounds.",

The second polymorph is also monoclinic, but with different unit-cell parameters. A comparison of both polymorphic forms shows that the difference is thus not in the molecular conformation but in the arrangements of molecules in the crystal packing. The crystal morphology of two forms was predicted with the BFDH model in Materials Studio and inferred that the powder of the new polymorph has better flowability than the original polymorph.

    "abstract": "In addition to their wide-ranging applications in the pharmaceutical industry, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) derivatives are also known to possess applications in engineering and materials science. 20 TBA derivatives, with diversity at the N and C-5 positions through acylation, Schiff base formation, Knoevenagel condensation, thioamide and enamine formation, were studied.

In A13 , the presence of two intramolecular hydrogen bonds was observed. The stabilization of the enol form over the keto form was confirmed by computation. In order to convert the keto form to the enol form, an energy barrier of 55.05 kcal mol −1 needs to be overcome, as confirmed by transition-state calculations.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biologists demonstrate their command over natural biology by reproducing the behaviors of natural living systems on synthetic biomolecular platforms. For nucleic acids, this is being done stepwise, first by adding replicable nucleotides to DNA, and then removing its standard nucleotides. This challenge has been met in vitro with `six-letter' DNA and RNA, where the Watson-Crick pairing `concept' is recruited to increase the number of independently replicable nucleotides from four to six. The two nucleobases most successfully added so far are Z and P, which present a donor-donor-acceptor and an acceptor-acceptor-donor pattern, respectively. This pair of nucleobases are part of an `artificially expanded genetic information system' (AEGIS). The Z nucleobase has been already crystallized, characterized, and published in this journal [Matsuura et al. (2016). Acta Cryst. C72, 952-959]. More recently, variants of Taq polymerase have been crystallized with the pair P:Z trapped in the active site. Here we report the crystal structure of the nucleobase 2-aminoimidazo[1,2-a][1,3,5]triazin-4-one (trivially named P) as the monohydrate, C5H5N5O·H2O. The nucleobase P was crystallized from water and characterized by X-ray diffraction. Interestingly, the crystal structure shows two tautomers of P packed in a Watson-Crick fashion that cocrystallized in a 1:1 ratio.",

    "abstract": "Pyrimethamine is an antimalarial drug. The cocrystal salt form of pyrimethamine with 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in water solvent has been synthesized, namely 2,4-diamino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-6-ethylpyrimidin-1-ium 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate hemihydrate, C12H14ClN4+·C7H5O4-·0.5H2O. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature. Refinement of the crystal structure was carried out using the classical Independent Atom Model (IAM), while the electrostatic properties were studied by transferring electron-density parameters from an electron-density database. The Cl atom was refined anharmonically. The results of both refinement methods were compared. Topological analyses were carried out using Bader's theory of Atoms in Molecules (AIM). The three-dimensional Hirshfeld surface analysis and the two-dimensional fingerprint maps of individual molecules revealed that the crystal structures are dominated by H...O/O...H and H...H contacts. Other close contacts are also present, including weak C...H/H...C contacts. Charge transfer between the pyrimethamine and 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid molecules results in a molecular assembly based on strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This is further validated by the calculation of the electrostatic potential based on transferred electron-density parameters. The current work proves the significance of the transferability principle in studying the electron-density-derived properties of molecules in cases where high-resolution diffraction data at low temperature are not available.",

    "abstract": "The design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much interest due to the intriguing diversity of their architectures and topologies. However, building MOFs with different topological structures from the same ligand is still a challenge. Using 3-nitro-4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoic acid (HL) as a new ligand, three novel MOFs, namely poly[[(N,N-dimethylformamide-κO)bis[μ2-3-nitro-4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoato-κ3O,O':N]cadmium(II)] N,N-dimethylformamide monosolvate methanol monosolvate], {[Cd(C12H7N2O4)2(C3H7NO)]·C3H7NO·CH3OH}n, (1), poly[[(μ2-acetato-κ2O:O')[μ3-3-nitro-4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoato-κ3O:O':N]bis[μ3-3-nitro-4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoato-κ4O,O':O':N]dicadmium(II)] N,N-dimethylacetamide disolvate monohydrate], {[Cd2(C12H7N2O4)3(CH3CO2)]·2C4H9NO·H2O}n, (2), and catena-poly[[[diaquanickel(II)]-bis[μ2-3-nitro-4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoato-κ2O:N]] N,N-dimethylacetamide disolvate], {[Ni(C12H7N2O4)2(H2O)2]·2C4H9NO}n, (3), have been prepared. Single-crystal structure analysis shows that the CdII atom in MOF (1) has a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal [CdN2O5] coordination geometry. The [CdN2O5] units as 4-connected nodes are interconnected by L- ligands to form a fourfold interpenetrating three-dimensional (3D) framework with a dia topology. In MOF (2), there are two crystallographically different CdII ions showing a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal [CdNO6] and a distorted octahedral [CdN2O4] coordination geometry, respectively. Two CdII ions are connected by three carboxylate groups to form a binuclear [Cd2(COO)3] cluster. Each binuclear cluster as a 6-connected node is further linked by acetate groups and L- ligands to produce a non-interpenetrating 3D framework with a pcu topology. MOF (3) contains two crystallographically distinct NiII ions on special positions. Each NiII ion adopts an elongated octahedral [NiN2O4] geometry. Each NiII ion as a 4-connected node is linked by L- ligands to generate a two-dimensional network with an sql topology, which is further stabilized by two types of intermolecular OW-HW...O hydrogen bonds to form a 3D supramolecular framework. MOFs (1)-(3) were also characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetic analysis. Furthermore, the solid-state photoluminescence of HL and MOFs (1) and (2) have been investigated. The photoluminescence of MOFs (1) and (2) are enhanced and red-shifted with respect to free HL. The gas adsorption investigation of MOF (2) indicates a good separation selectivity (71) of CO2/N2 at 273 K (i.e. the amount of CO2 adsorption is 71 times higher than N2 at the same pressure).",

CP1 has been investigated for its magnetic properties and magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out in the range 2.0–300 K. The results of the magnetic measurements show weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the Gd III ions in CP1 .

    "abstract": "2,4,6-Tris(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (tpt), as an organic molecule with an electron-deficient nature, has attracted considerable interest because of its photoinduced electron transfer from neutral organic molecules to form stable anionic radicals. This makes it an excellent candidate as an organic linker in the construction of photochromic complexes. Such a photochromic three-dimensional (3D) metal-organic framework (MOF) has been prepared using this ligand. Crystallization of tpt with Cd(NO3)2·4H2O in an N,N-dimethylacetamide-methanol mixed-solvent system under solvothermal conditions afforded the 3D MOF poly[[bis(nitrato-κ2O,O')cadmium(II)]-μ3-2,4,6-tris(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-κ3N2:N4:N6], [Cd(NO3)2(C18H12N6)]n, which was characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The X-ray diffraction crystal structure analysis reveals that the asymmetric unit contains one independent CdII cation, one tpt ligand and two coordinated NO3- anions. The CdII cations are connected by tpt ligands to generate a 3D framework. The single framework leaves voids that are filled by mutual interpenetration of three independent equivalent frameworks in a fourfold interpenetrating architecture. The compound shows a good thermal stability and exhibits a reversible photochromic behaviour, which may originate from the photoinduced electron-transfer generation of radicals in the tpt ligand.",

Knowledge of the conformation and crystal packing of various macrocyclic metal complexes has become important in developing new effective anti-HIV drugs. The synthesis and preparation of single crystals of a new Cu 2+ -doped macrocyclic compound, (3,14-diethyl-2,6,13,17-tetraazatricyclo[16.4.0.0 7,12 ]docosane)copper(II) bis(perchlorate)–3,14-diethyl-2,13-diaza-6,17-diazoniatricyclo[16.4.0.0 7,12 ]docosane bis(perchlorate) (0.69/0.31), {[Cu(C 22 H 44 N 4 )](ClO 4 ) 2 } 0.69 ·(C 22 H 46 N 4 2+ ·2ClO 4 − ) 0.31 , is reported. Characterization by X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the asymmetric unit contains half of a centrosymmetric molecule.

The Cu—N distances of 2.015 (3) and 2.047 (3) Å are normal, but the long axial Cu—O bond of 2.795 (3) Å may be due to a combination of the Jahn–Teller effect and the strong in-plane ligand field. The crystal structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between secondary N—H groups, the N atoms of the macrocycle and the O atoms of the perchlorate anions. Hirshfeld surface analysis with 2D (two-dimensional) fingerprint plots indicates that the main contributions to the crystal packing are from H...H (58.0%) and H...O/O...H (41.9%) interactions.

The molecular and supramolecular structures of the compounds were studied by X-ray diffractometry. The asymmetric unit of 3 is formed from CdBr 3 and M (phpy2NS)(MeOH) units, where the metal centre M has a 76% occupancy of Zn II and 24% of Cd II . The M 2+ centre of the cation, located on a crystallographic inversion centre, is hexacoordinated and appears as a slightly distorted octahedral [ M N 4 O 2 ] 2+ cation. The Cd centre of the anion is coordinated by two terminal bromide ligands and two bridging bromide ligands that generate [Cd 2 Br 6 ] 2− cadmium–bromide clusters. These clusters display crystallographic inversion symmetry forming two edge-shared tetrahedra and serve as agents that direct the structure in the formation of supramolecular assemblies. In mononuclear complex 4 , the coordination geometry around the Hg 2+ ion is distorted tetrahedral and comprises two chloride ligands and two N-atom donors from the phpy2NS ligand, viz. one pyridine N atom and the other from triazole. In the crystal packing, all four compounds exhibit weak intermolecular interactions, which facilitate the formation of three-dimensional architectures. Along with the noncovalent interactions, the structural diversity in the complexes can be attributed to the metal centre and to the coordination geometry, as well as to its ionic or neutral character.",

    "abstract": "A new coordination polymer (CP), namely poly[(μ-4,4′-bipyridine)(μ 3 -3,4′-oxydibenzoato)cobalt(II)], [Co(C 14 H 8 O 5 )(C 10 H 8 N 2 )] n or [Co(3,4′-obb)(4,4′-bipy)] n ( 1 ), was prepared by the self-assembly of Co(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O with the rarely used 3,4′-oxydibenzoic acid (3,4′-obbH 2 ) ligand and 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-bipy) under solvothermal conditions, and has been structurally characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray crystallography and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that each Co II ion is six-coordinated by four O atoms from three 3,4′-obb 2− ligands, of which two function as monodentate ligands and the other as a bidentate ligand, and by two N atoms from bridging 4,4′-bipy ligands, thereby forming a distorted octahedral CoN 2 O 4 coordination geometry. Adjacent crystallographically equivalent Co II ions are bridged by the O atoms of 3,4′-obb 2− ligands, affording an eight-membered Co 2 O 4 C 2 ring which is further extended into a two-dimensional [Co(3,4′-obb)] n sheet along the ab plane via 3,4′-obb 2− functioning as a bidentate bridging ligand. The planes are interlinked into a three-dimensional [Co(3,4′-obb)(4,4′-bipy)] n network by 4,4′-bipy ligands acting as pillars along the c axis. Magnetic investigations on CP 1 disclose an antiferromagnetic coupling within the dimeric Co 2 unit and a metamagnetic behaviour at low temperature resulting from intermolecular π–π interactions between the parallel 4,4′-bipy ligands.",

CP ( I ) exhibits a twofold interpenetrated 3D+3D→3D skeleton with a 3 , 5 - conn topology constructed from triangular trinuclear [Zn 3 (COO) 4 (μ 3 -OH)] clusters, in which the H 3 L ligand adopts three different coordination modes. CP ( II ) exhibits a 1D infinite chain and stacking that gives a 3D structure mediated by hydrogen bonds and weak interactions. CP ( III ) is an interesting 3D 3 , 4 , 8 - conn network including linear tetranuclear [Zn 4 (μ 2 -OH) 2 (HCOO) 2 (COO) 2 ] clusters with a new {4·6 2 } 2 {4·6 4 ·8}{4 6 ·6 19 ·8 3 } topological symbol.

The solid-state fluorescence spectra of CPs ( I )–( III ) were recorded at room temperature and all show better fluorescence performances than H 3 L . In particular, ( II ) can act as a potential multifunctional fluorescent material for sensing hexavalent chromium ions in aqueous solution with high stability, selectivity and sensitivity. Under ultraviolet light of 365 nm from a UV lamp, a signal response of fluorescence from turning on to off can be observed with the naked eye. It was found that the detection for hexavalent chromium ( i.e. Cr 2 O 7 2− ) by ( II ) has a high selectivity [ K SV = 1.61 × 10 4 M −1 and limit of detection (LOD) = 0.434 µ M ] in aqueous solution.

    "abstract": "The cyanide ligand can act as a strong σ-donor and an effective π-electron acceptor that exhibits versatile bridging abilities, such as terminal, μ 2 - C : N , μ 3 - C : C : N and μ 4 - C : C : N : N modes. These ligands play a key role in the formation of various copper(I) cyanide systems, including one-dimensional (1D) chains, two-dimensional (2D) layers and three-dimensional (3D) frameworks. According to the literature, numerous coordination polymers based on terminal, μ 2 - C : N and μ 3 - C , C , N bridging modes have been documented so far. However, systems based on the μ 4 - C : C : N : N bridging mode are relatively rare. In this work, a novel cyanide-bridged 3D Cu I coordination framework, namely poly[(μ 2 -2,2′-biimidazole-κ 2 N 3 : N 3′ )(μ 4 -cyanido-κ 4 C : C : N : N )(μ 2 -cyanido-κ 2 C : N )dicopper(I)], [Cu 2 (CN) 2 (C 6 H 6 N 4 )] n , (I), was synthesized hydrothermally by reaction of environmentally friendly K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ], CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O and 2,2′-biimidazole (H 2 biim). It should be noted that cyanide ligands may act as reducing agents to reduce Cu II to Cu I under hydrothermal conditions. Compound (I) contains diverse types of bridging ligands, such as μ 4 - C : C : N : N -cyanide, μ 2 - C : N -cyanide and μ 2 -biimidazole. Interestingly, the [Cu 2 ] dimers are bridged by rare μ 4 - C : C : N : N -mode cyanide ligands giving rise to the first example of a 1D dimeric {[Cu 2 (μ 4 - C : C : N : N )] n + } n infinite chain. Furthermore, adjacent dimer-based chains are linked by μ 2 - C : N bridging cyanide ligands, generating a neutral 2D wave-like (4,4) layer structure. Finally, the 2D layers are joined together via bidentate bridging H 2 biim to create a 3D cuprous cyanide network. This arrangement leads to a systematic variation in dimensionality from 1D chain→2D sheet→3D framework by different types of bridging ligands. Compound (I) was further characterized by thermal analysis, solid-state UV–Vis diffuse-reflectance and photoluminescence studies. The solid-state UV–Vis diffuse-reflectance spectra show that compound (I) is a wide-gap semiconductor with band gaps of 3.18 eV. The photoluminescence study shows a strong blue–green photoluminescence at room temperature, which may be associated with metal-to-ligand charge transfer.",

    "abstract": "While a certain compound can be considered as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in controlled situations, it may fail as a medicine due to problems related to its physical, chemical or biological properties.Moisture, heat or oxygen may jeopardize the chemical or physical stability of the compound, compromising its long-term storage.On the other hand, the form in which the compound is available may present poor solubility in water, preventing its absorption by the human body.The preparation of cocrystals is among the solutions that have been used to circumvent these kinds of problems.If one of the components of a cocrystal is an API, the crystal is classified as a pharmaceutical cocrystal.Conversely, the other component is called a coformer.It is the screening of the vast number of available coformers that allows the optimization of the target parameter (e.g.improving stability toward moisture).In spite of berberine (BBR) being a water-soluble drug with a wide spectrum of medical applications, it presents poor intestine absorption via oral administration (Fratter & De Servi, 2014).Additionally, this API is highly hygroscopic and presents an extremely bitter taste.Cocrystals have been prepared in attempts to solve these problems (Lu et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2016).Recently, in Acta Crystallographica Section C, Sun et al. (2019) proposed a possible solution for improving the water solubility of BBR by the formation of multicomponent pharmaceutical salts (or ionic cocrystals in a wider definition; Kumar & Nanda, 2018) with diclofenac (DIC), another known API, as coformer.Thus, they managed to prepare DIC salts of BBR as a dihydrate (denoted I) and four other solvates [hemidichloromethane dihydrate (II), ethanol (III) and methanol (IV and V, mono-and disolvates, respectively)].These salts were readily prepared by slow evaporation of mixtures containing the corresponding solvents.All crystals show an N-HÁ Á ÁO hydrogen-bond interaction between the amino group of DIC and the carboxylate group of BBR comprising an S(7) graph-set motif.Additionally, O-HÁ Á ÁO hydrogen-bond interactions are also present in I, II and V, comprising rings with R 4 4 ( 12) and R 4 6 (12) graph-set motifs in I, a one-dimensional chain in II and an isolated hydrogen bond in V. Additionally,interactions are also present in all the compounds, except for II.Sun et al. (2019) have contributed to the library extension of berberine presentations.Further studies may result in the use of the prepared compounds for new formulations of berberine with improved properties.",

C 75 , 837–850] to a subset of Z ′ = 4 structures in the literature revealed a number of suggestive properties in many of the cases analysed, which allowed us to conclude that: (i) very few of those structures showed no pseudosymmetry (PS) whatsoever linking any of the possible moiety pairs in the asymmetric unit (AU), the vast majority disclosing, instead, at least two (and frequently more) molecules linked by these PS operations; (ii) on occasion, two pairs of molecules were related, each by the same PS element, enabling the resulting pair of dimers to be viewed locally as a Z ′ = 2 rather than a Z ′ = 4 case; (iii) sometimes all four moieties in the AU appeared interrelated by PS relationships, closely suggesting a distribution of symmetry operations as found in real space groups; (iv) in many cases, this resemblance was of a superior quality, leading to surprising local replicas of real space groups in the reduced realm of the AU, thus locally reducing the description to a Z ′ = 1 one. Through a systematic application of the MP procedure, we analyze in this article a number of these latter cases, which proved to be surprisingly common, far beyond any original expectation, and leaving open the question about the eventual reasons for the phenomenon, which would certainly merit appropriate theoretical attention.",

The conformations are considered based on the N-P=O-Sn torsion angles for (I) and the C-C-C-N, C-C-N-C, C-N-C-C and N-C-C-C torsion angles for the two symmetry-independent [CH3CH2CH2NH2CH2CH2CH3]+ cations in (II), and the ±ac±sp±ac (ac = anticlinal and sp = synperiplanar) and ±ap±ap±ap±ap (ap = antiperiplanar) conformations are observed, respectively. In both structures, the four atoms in the corners of the square-planar segment of the octahedral shape around the Sn atom participate in normal hydrogen-bonding interactions as acceptors, which include two O and two Cl atoms for (I), and four Cl atoms for (II). However, the phosphoric triamide ligands block the environment around the Sn atom and limit the hydrogen-bond pattern to form a supramolecular ribbon assembly, while in the presence of small organic cations in (II), a two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded architecture is achieved. The weak interactions π-π, C-H...π and C-Cl...π in (I), and C-H...Cl in (II) do not change the dimensionality of the hydrogen-bond pattern. The 62 CSD structures analogous to (I), i.e. with an SnOPN3 segment (including 83 entries) fall into four categories of conformations based on the N-P=O-Sn torsion angles. The 132 [(CH3CH2CH2)2NH2]+ cations from 85 CSD structures are classified into seven groups based on the torsion angles noted for (II). Most of the CSD structures adopt the same associated conformations noted for (I) and (II). 15 [Sn(CH3)2Cl4]2- anions extracted from the CSD are compared with the structure of (II).",

Hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C for 28 d induces a phase transition in the Al-stabilized compound from the commonly observed cubic Ia \\overline{3} d structure to the acentric I \\overline{4}3 d subtype. Li I ions at the interstitial octahedrally (4 + 2-fold) coordinated 48 e site are most easily extracted and Al III ions order onto the tetrahedral 12 a site. Deep hydration induces a distinct depletion of Li I at this site, while the second tetrahedral site, 12 b , suffers only minor Li I loss. Charge balance is maintained by the incorporation of H I , which is bonded to an O atom. Hydration of Ga-stabilized LLZO induces similar effects, with complete depletion of Li I at the 48 e site. The Li I /H I exchange not only leads to a distinct increase in the unit-cell size, but also alters some bonding topology, which is discussed here.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing number of organocalcium and organomagnesium complexes under development, there is a real need to be able to characterize in detail their local environment in order to fully rationalize their reactivity. For crystalline structures, in cases when diffraction techniques are insufficient, additional local spectroscopies like 25Mg and 43Ca solid-state NMR may provide valuable information to help fully establish the local environment of the metal ions. In this current work, a prospective DFT investigation on crystalline magnesium and calcium complexes involving low-coordination numbers and N-bearing organic ligands was carried out, in which the 25Mg and 43Ca NMR parameters [isotropic chemical shift, chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) and quadrupolar parameters] were calculated for each structure. The analysis of the calculated parameters in relation to the local environment of the metal ions revealed that they are highly sensitive to very small changes in geometry/distances, and hence that they could be used to assist in the refinement of crystal structures. Moreover, such calculations provide a guideline as to how the NMR measurements will need to be performed, revealing that these will be very challenging.",

Two cadmium(II) fluorous coordination compounds formed from 2,2′-bipyridine, 4,4′-bipyridine and pentafluorobenzoate ligands, namely catena -poly[[aqua(2,2′-bipyridine-κ 2 N , N ′)(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzoato-κ O )cadmium(II)]-μ-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzoato-κ 2 O : O ′], [Cd(C 7 F 5 O 2 ) 2 (C 10 H 8 N 2 )(H 2 O)] n , (1), and catena -poly[[diaquabis(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzoato-κ O )cadmium(II)]-μ-4,4′-bipyridine-κ 2 N : N ′], [Cd(C 7 F 5 O 2 ) 2 (C 10 H 8 N 2 )(H 2 O) 2 ] n , (2), have been synthesized solvothermally and structurally characterized.

Compound (2) displays a one-dimensional linear chain structure formed by Cd—N coordination interactions involving the 4,4′-bipyridine ligand. Adjacent one-dimensional chains are extended into two-dimensional sheets by O—H...O hydrogen bonds between the coordinated water molecules and adjacent carboxylate groups. Moreover, the chains are further linked by C—H...F—C interactions to afford a three-dimensional network. In both structures, hydrogen bonding involving the coordinated water molecules is a primary driving force in the formation of the supramolecular structures.",

The experimentally determined structure agreed well with the computationally obtained geometry at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The preferred syn conformation of these 1-arylurazole dimers results in the two aromatic rings being proximate and nearly parallel, which leads to some interesting shielding effects of certain signals in the 1 H NMR spectrum.

    "abstract": "There are few examples of single-crystal structure determinations of gelators, as gel formation requires that the dissolved gelator self-assemble into a three-dimensional network structure incorporating solvent via noncovalent interactions rather than self-assembly followed by crystallization. In the solid-state structures of the isostructural compounds 4,4′-bis[5-(methoxycarbonyl)pentyloxy]biphenyl (BBO6-Me), C 26 H 34 O 6 , and 4,4′-bis[5-(ethoxycarbonyl)pentyloxy]biphenyl (BBO6-Et), C 28 H 38 O 6 , the molecules sit on a crystallographically imposed center of symmetry, resulting in strictly coplanar phenyl rings. BBO6-Me behaves as an organogelator in various alcohol solvents, whereas BBO6-Et does not. The extended structure reveals bundles of molecules that form a columnar superstructure. Framework-energy calculations reveal much stronger interaction energies within the columns (−52 to −78 kJ mol −1 ) than between columns (−2 to −16 kJ mol −1 ). The intracolumnar interactions are dominated by a dispersion component, whereas the intercolumnar interactions have a substantial electrostatic component.",

A new quaternary arsenate, sodium calcium trinickel aluminium triarsenate, NaCa1-xNi3-2xAl2x(AsO4)3 (x = 0.23), was synthesized using the flux method in air at 1023 K and its crystal structure was determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. This material was also characterized by qualitative energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis and IR spectroscopy. The crystal structure belongs to the α-CrPO4 type with the space group Imma. The structure is described as a three-dimensional framework built up of corner-edge-sharing NiO6, (Ni,Al)O6 and AsO4 polyhedra, with channels running along the [100] and [010] directions, in which the sodium and calcium cations are located. The proposed structural model has been validated by bond-valence-sum (BVS) and charge-distribution (CHARDI) tools. The sodium ionic conduction pathways in the anionic framework were investigated by means of the bond-valence site energy (BVSE) model, which predicted that the studied material will probably be a very poor Na+ ion conductor (bond-valence activation energy ∼7 eV).",

The targeted drug action of pharmaceuticals containing this functionality is likely to depend heavily on molecular recognition processes involving hydrogen bonding. Crystallization of an equimolar mixture of 4-amino-5-chloro-2,6-dimethylpyrimidine and 5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzoic acid yielded two forms of the 1:1 salt, C 6 H 9 ClN 3 + ·C 7 H 4 ClO 3 − , each containing a different tautomeric form of the cation. 6-Amino-5-chloro-2,4-dimethylpyrimidin-1-ium 5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzoate, (I), crystallizes in the space group P \\overline{1}, with Z ′ = 2, and all of the component ions are fully ordered. 4-Amino-5-chloro-2,6-dimethylpyrimidin-1-ium 5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzoate, (II), also crystallizes with Z ′ = 2, but in the space group P 2 1 / c and as a merohedral twin which closely mimics an orthorhombic unit cell.

The bond lengths in the cations of (I) and (II) provide evidence for o -quinonoid and p -quinonoid bond fixation, respectively.

The preference for the formation of different hetrosynthons is verified based on theoretical calculations. The syn – anti conformation of boronic acid has been found to be the most favourable in the formation of intermolecular interactions with urea. Moreover, the distortions present in the boron coordination sphere have been described quantitatively based on experimental data according to bond-valence vector model calculations. The results revealed that the deformation of the sphere is typical for a syn – anti conformation of boronic acids. The supramolecular structure of the cocrystal is composed of large synthons in the form of layers made up of O—H...O and N—H...O hydrogen bonds.

    "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) has recently been identified as a gaseous signaling molecule that exerts various salutary effects in mammalian pathophysiology. Photoactive metal carbonyl complexes (photoCORMs) are ideal exogenous candidates for more controllable and site-specific CO delivery compared to gaseous CO. Along this line, our group has been engaged for the past few years in developing group-7-based photoCORMs towards the efficient eradication of various malignant cells. Moreover, several such complexes can be tracked within cancerous cells by virtue of their luminescence. The inherent luminecscent nature of some photoCORMs and the change in emission wavelength upon CO release also provide a covenient means to track the entry of the prodrug and, in some cases, both the entry and CO release from the prodrug. In continuation of the research circumscribing the development of trackable photoCORMs and also to graft such molecules covalently to conventional delivery vehicles, we report herein the synthesis and structures of three rhenium carbonyl complexes, namely, fac-tricarbonyl[2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,3-benzothiazole-κ2N,N'](4-vinylpyridine-κN)rhenium(I) trifluoromethanesulfonate, [Re(C7H7N)(C12H8N2S)(CO)3](CF3SO3), (1), fac-tricarbonyl[2-(quinolin-2-yl)-1,3-benzothiazole-κ2N,N'](4-vinylpyridine-κN)rhenium(I) trifluoromethanesulfonate, [Re(C7H7N)(C16H10N2S)(CO)3](CF3SO3), (2), and fac-tricarbonyl[1,10-phenanthroline-κ2N,N'](4-vinylpyridine-κN)rhenium(I) trifluoromethanesulfonate, [Re(C7H7N)(C12H8N2)(CO)3](CF3SO3), (3). In all three complexes, the ReI center resides in a distorted octahedral coordination environment. These complexes exhibit CO release upon exposure to low-power UV light. The apparent CO release rates of the complexes have been measured to assess their comparative CO-donating capacity. The three complexes are highly luminescent and this in turn provides a convenient way to track the entry of the prodrug molecules within biological targets.",

Such a photochromic two-dimensional coordination polymer has been prepared using N , N ′-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (DPMNI). In crystallization tubes, upon slow diffusion of an MeOH solution of cadmium perchlorate into a CHCl 3 solution of DPMNI, the complex poly[[bis[μ 2 -2,7-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)benzo[ imn ][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2 H ,7 H )-tetrone-κ 2 N : N ′]bis(perchlorato-κ O )cadmium(II)] chloroform tetrasolvate], {[Cd(C 26 H 16 N 4 O 4 ) 2 (ClO 4 ) 2 ]·4CHCl 3 } n , (I), was obtained. The asymmetric unit contains one Cd 2+ cation, two DPMNI ligands, two coordinated ClO 4 − anions and four CHCl 3 solvent molecules. Each Cd 2+ cation is interconnected by four DPMNI linkers to generate a neutral two-dimensional naphthalenediimide coordination network with all the ClO 4 − anions above or below this plane. Strong interlaminar anion–π interactions between the coordinated ClO 4 − anions and the imide rings of an adjacent layer lead to a three-dimensional supramolecular structure. Compound (I) exhibits reversible photochromic behaviour and photocontrolled tunable luminescence properties, which may originate from the photoinduced electron-transfer generation of radicals in the DPMNI ligand.",

    "abstract": "Bimetallic macrocyclic complexes have attracted the attention of chemists and various organic ligands have been used as molecular building blocks, but supramolecular complexes based on semi-rigid organic ligands containing 1,2,4-triazole have remained rare until recently. It is easier to obtain novel topologies by making use of asymmetric semi-rigid ligands in the self-assembly process than by making use of rigid ligands. A new semi-rigid ligand, 3-[(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)sulfanyl]-5-(quinolin-2-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-amine (L), has been synthesized and used to generate two novel bimetallic macrocycle complexes, namely bis{μ-3-[(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)sulfanyl]-5-(quinolin-2-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-amine}bis[(methanol-κO)(nitrato-κ(2)O,O')nickel(II)] dinitrate, [Ni2(NO3)2(C17H14N6S)2(CH3OH)2](NO3)2, (I), and bis{μ-3-[(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)sulfanyl]-5-(quinolin-2-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-amine}bis[(methanol-κO)(nitrato-κ(2)O,O')zinc(II)] dinitrate, [Zn2(NO3)2(C17H14N6S)2(CH3OH)2](NO3)2, (II), by solution reactions with the inorganic salts M(NO3)2 (M = Ni and Zn, respectively) in mixed solvents. In (I), two Ni(II) cations with the same coordination environment are linked by L ligands through Ni-N bonds to form a bimetallic ring. Compound (I) is extended into a two-dimensional network in the crystallographic ac plane via N-H...O, O-H...N and O-H...O hydrogen bonds, and neighbouring two-dimensional planes are parallel and form a three-dimensional structure via π-π stacking. Compound (II) contains two bimetallic rings with the same coordination environment of the Zn(II) cations. The Zn(II) cations are bridged by L ligands through Zn-N bonds to form the bimetallic rings. One type of bimetallic ring constructs a one-dimensional nanotube via O-H...O and N-H...O hydrogen bonds along the crystallographic a direction, and the other constructs zero-dimensional molecular cages via O-H...O and N-H...O hydrogen bonds. They are interlinked into a two-dimensional network in the ac plane through extensive N-H...O hydrogen bonds, and a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture is formed via π-π interactions between the centroids of the benzene rings of the quinoline ring systems.",

Multicarboxylate ligands are of particular interest due to their strong coordination activity towards metal ions, as well as their various coordination modes and versatile conformations. The structural chemistry of dicarboxylate-based coordination polymers of transition metals has been developed through the grafting of N-containing organic linkers into carboxylate-bridged transition metal networks. A new luminescent two-dimensional zinc(II) coordination polymer containing bridging 2,2-dimethylsuccinate and 4,4′-bipyridine ligands, namely poly[[aqua(μ 2 -4,4′-bipyridine-κ 2 N : N ′)bis(μ 3 -2,2-dimethylbutanedioato)-κ 4 O 1 , O 1′ : O 4 : O 4′ ;κ 5 O 1 : O 1 , O 4 : O 4 , O 4′ -dizinc(II)] dihydrate], {[Zn 2 (C 6 H 8 O 4 ) 2 (C 10 H 8 N 2 )(H 2 O)]·2H 2 O} n , has been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and elemental, IR and thermogravimetric analyses. In the structure, the 2,2-dimethylsuccinate ligands link linear tetranuclear Zn II subunits into one-dimensional chains along the c axis. 4,4′-Bipyridine acts as a tethering ligand expanding these one-dimensional chains into a two-dimensional layered structure. Hydrogen-bonding interactions between the water molecules (both coordinated and free) and carboxylate O atoms strengthen the packing of the layers. Furthermore, the luminescence properties of the complex were investigated. The compound exhibits a blue photoluminescence in the solid state at room temperature and may be a good candidate for potential hybrid inorganic–organic photoactive materials.",

X-ray powder diffraction analysis reveals that the trihydrate phase is monoclinic (space group P 2 1 / n ), with a unit-cell metric very similar to that of recently identified Gly·CoSO 4 ·3H 2 O [Tepavitcharova et al. (2012). J. Mol. Struct . 1018 , 113–121]. In order to obtain an accurate determination of all structural parameters, including the locations of H atoms, and to better understand the relationship between the pentahydrate and the trihydrate, neutron powder diffraction measurements of both (fully deuterated) phases were carried out at 10 K at the ISIS neutron spallation source, these being complemented with X-ray powder diffraction measurements and Raman spectroscopy. At 10 K, glycine magnesium sulfate pentahydrate, structurally described by the `double' formula [Gly( d 5 )·MgSO 4 ·5D 2 O] 2 , is triclinic (space group P \\overline{1}, Z = 1), and glycine magnesium sulfate trihydrate, which may be described by the formula Gly( d 5 )·MgSO 4 ·3D 2 O, is monoclinic (space group P 2 1 / n , Z = 4). In the pentahydrate, there are two symmetry-inequivalent MgO 6 octahedra on sites of \\overline 1 symmetry and two SO 4 tetrahedra with site symmetry 1. The octahedra comprise one [tetraaquadiglcyinemagnesium] 2+ ion (centred on Mg1) and one [hexaaquamagnesium] 2+ ion (centred on Mg2), and the glycine zwitterion, NH 3 + CH 2 COO − , adopts a monodentate coordination to Mg2. In the trihydrate, there are two pairs of symmetry-inequivalent MgO 6 octahedra on sites of \\overline 1 symmetry and two pairs of SO 4 tetrahedra with site symmetry 1; the glycine zwitterion adopts a binuclear–bidentate bridging function between Mg1 and Mg2, whilst the Mg2 octahedra form a corner-sharing arrangement with the sulfate tetrahedra. These bridged polyhedra thus constitute infinite polymeric chains extending along the b axis of the crystal. A range of O—H...O, N—H...O and C—H...O hydrogen bonds, including some three-centred interactions, complete the three-dimensional framework of each crystal.",

The structures were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy. Compounds (1) and (2) both present one-dimensional chain structures and two-dimensional supramolecular layer structures constructed by weak hydrogen bonds. It is interesting to note that the carboxylate ligands reveal stable trans configurations in both compounds. The fluorescence properties of (1) and (2) in the solid state were also investigated.",

    "abstract": "Orthophthalaldehyde (o-phthalaldehyde, OPA) is an aromatic dialdehyde bearing two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. The reactions of OPA with primary amines are broadly applied for the synthesis of important heterocyclic compounds with biological relevance. A number of such reactions have been investigated recently and several structures of condensation products have been reported, however, the complex reaction mechanism is still not fully understood and comprises concurrent as well as consecutive reactions. The reaction products depend on the primary amine which reacts with OPA, the reaction environment (solvent) and the proportion of the reactants. The title molecule, C11H13NO, the product of the reaction of OPA with isopropylamine, contains a five-membered pyrrole C4N ring with a carbonyl substituent, which forms part of the isoindolinone unit. Though this pyrrole ring contains one C atom in the sp(3)-hybridized state, it is fairly planar. The title molecule has been compared with similar structures retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Database in order to study this phenomenon. The planarity of this fragment has been explained by the presence of partially delocalized C-C, C-N and C-O bonds, and by an inner angle in the planar pentagonal ring (∼108°), which is close to the ideal tetrahedral value for the sp(3)-hybridized state of the constituent C atom. Due to this propitious angle, this C atom can be present in states intermediate between sp(3)- and sp(2)-hybridized in different structures, while still maintaining the planarity of the ring. There are only weak intermolecular C-H...O hydrogen bonds and C-H...π-electron ring interactions in the structure. In particular, it is the pyrrole ring which is involved in these interactions.",

    "abstract": "In coordination chemistry and crystal engineering, many factors influence the construction of coordination polymers and the final frameworks depend greatly on the organic ligands used. N-Donor ligands with diverse coordination modes and conformations have been employed to assemble metal-organic frameworks. Carboxylic acid ligands can deprotonate completely or partially when bonding to metal ions and can also act as donors or acceptors of hydrogen bonds and are thus good candidates for the construction of supramolecular architectures. Two new transition metal complexes, namely poly[diaqua(μ4-1,4-bis{[1-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-1H-benz[d]imidazol-2-yl]methoxy}benzene)bis(μ2-isophthalato)dicobalt(II)], [Co(C8H4O4)(C34H28N6O2)0.5(H2O)]n, (1), and poly[diaqua(μ4-1,4-bis{[1-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-1H-benz[d]imidazol-2-yl]methoxy}benzene)bis(μ2-isophthalato)dicadmium(II)], [Cd(C8H4O4)(C34H28N6O2)0.5(H2O)]n, have been constructed using a symmetric N-donor ligand and a carboxylate ligand under hydrothermal conditions. X-ray crystallographic studies reveal that complexes (1) and (2) are isostructural, both of them exhibiting three-dimensional supramolecular architectures built by hydrogen bonds in which the coordinated water molecules serve as donors, while the O atoms of the carboxylate groups act as acceptors. Furthermore, (1) and (2) have been characterized by elemental, IR spectroscopic, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermogravimetric analyses. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of complex (1) has also been investigated.",

    "abstract": "The Sr-Ge-O system has an earth-scientific importance as a potentially good low-pressure analog of the Ca-Si-O system, one of the major components in the constituent minerals of the Earth's crust and mantle. However, it is one of the germanate systems that has not yet been fully examined in the phase relations and structural properties. The recent findings that the SrGeO3 high-pressure perovskite phase is the first Ge-based transparent electronic conductor make the Sr-Ge-O system interesting in the field of materials science. In the present study, we have revealed the existence of a new high-pressure strontium germanate, SrGe2O5. Single crystals of this compound crystallized as a co-existent phase with SrGeO3 perovskite single crystals in the sample recovered in the compression experiment of SrGeO3 pseudowollastonite conducted at 6 GPa and 1223 K. The crystal structure consists of germanium-oxygen framework layers stacked along [001], with Sr atoms located at the 12-coordinated cuboctahedral site; the layers are formed by the corner linkages between GeO6 octahedra and between GeO6 octahedra and GeO4 tetrahedra. The present SrGe2O5 is thus isostructural with the high-pressure phases of SrSi2O5 and BaGe2O5. Comparison of these three compounds leads to the conclusion that the structural responses of the GeO6 and GeO4 polyhedra to cation substitution at the Sr site are much less than that of the SrO12 cuboctahedron to cation substitution at the Ge sites. Such a difference in the structural response is closely related to the bonding nature.",

    "abstract": "Tris(pyrazolyl)hydroborate ligands have been utilized in the fields of inorganic and coordination chemistry due to the ease of introduction of steric and electronic substitutions at the pyrazole rings. The development and use of the tris(pyrazolyl)hydroborate ligand, called a `scorpionate', were pioneered by the late Professor Swiatoslaw Trofimenko. He developed a second generation for his ligand system by the introduction of 3- tert -butyl and 3-phenyl substituents and this new ligand system accounted for many remarkable developments in inorganic and coordination chemistry in stabilizing monomeric species while maintaining an open coordination site. Bismuth is remarkably harmless among the toxic heavy metal p -block elements and is now becoming popular as a replacement for highly toxic metal elements, such as lead. Two bismuth(III) complexes of the anionic sulfur-containing tripod tris(3- tert -butyl-2-sulfanylidene-1 H -imidazol-1-yl)hydroborate ligand were prepared. By recrystallization from MeOH/CH 2 Cl 2 , orange crystals of dichlorido(methanol-κ O )[tris(3- tert -butyl-2-sulfanylidene-1 H -imidazol-1-yl-κ S )hydroborato]bismuth(III), [Bi(C 21 H 34 BN 6 S 3 )Cl 2 (CH 4 O)], (I), were obtained, manifesting a mononuclear structure. By using a noncoordinating solvent, red crystals of the binuclear structure with bridging Cl atoms were obtained, namely di-μ-chlorido-bis{chlorido[tris(3- tert -butyl-2-sulfanylidene-1 H -imidazol-1-yl-κ S )hydroborato]bismuth(III)}, [Bi 2 (C 21 H 34 BN 6 S 3 ) 2 Cl 4 ], (II). These complexes show {Bi III S 3 Cl 2 O} and {Bi III S 3 Cl 3 } coordination geometries with average Bi III —S bond lengths of 2.73 and 2.78 Å in (I) and (II), respectively. The overall Bi III coordination geometry is distorted octahedral due to stereochemically active lone pairs. The three Bi III —S bond lengths are almost equal in (I) but show considerable differences in (II), with one long and two shorter distances that also correlate with changes in the UV–Vis and 1 H NMR spectra. For direct measurements of the Bi—S/Cl coordination, ligand K-edge X-ray absorption measurements were carried out in combination with ground and excited-state electronic structure analyses. For p -block elements, these sulfur-containing ligands are useful for preparing the appropriate complexes due to their flexible coordination geometry.",

    "abstract": "Sulfonamides display a wide variety of pharmacological activities. Sulfamethazine [abbreviated as SMZ; systematic name 4-amino-N-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide], one of the constitutents of the triple sulfa drugs, has wide clinical use. Pharmaceutical solvates are crystalline solids of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) incorporating one or more solvent molecules in the crystal lattice, and these have received special attention, as the solvent molecule can impart characteristic physicochemical properties to APIs and solvates, therefore playing a significant role in drug development. The ability of SMZ to form solvates has been investigated. Both pyridine and 3-methylpyridine form solvates with SMZ in 1:1 molar ratios. The pyridine monosolvate, C12H14N4O2S·C5H5N, crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pna21, with Z = 8 and two molecules per assymetric unit, whereas the 3-methylpyridine monosolvate, C12H14N4O2S·C6H7N, crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121, with Z = 4. Crystal structure analysis reveals intramolecular N-H...N hydrogen bonds between the molecules of SMZ and the pyridine solvent molecules. The solvent molecules in both structures play an active part in strong intermolecular interactions, thereby contributing significantly to the stability of both structures. Three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding networks exist in both structures involving at least one sulfonyl O atom and the amine N atom. In the pyridine solvate, there is a short π-π interaction [centroid-centroid distance = 3.926 (3) Å] involving the centroids of the pyridine rings of two solvent molecules and a weak intermolecular C-H...π interaction also contributes to the stability of the crystal packing.",

The occupancies of the crystallographic positions were studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction for three samples of different composition. The sites with m \\overline{3} m symmetry are occupied by atoms with a smaller scattering power than the atoms located on 4/ mmm sites. Two extreme structure models were refined. Within the first, the occupation type changes from (Au,In,Pd) 3 (Pd,In) to (Au,Pd) 3 (In,Pd,Au) with an increase in the Au gross content. For the second model, the occupation type (Au,In,Pd) 3 (Pd,Au) remains essentially unchanged for all Au concentrations. Although the diffraction data do not allow the choice of one of these models, the latter model, where Au substitutes In on 4/ mmm sites, seems to be preferable, since it agrees with the fact that the homogeneity range of the τ phase is inclined to the Au corner and provides the same occupation type for all the studied samples of different compositions.",

In order to study the correlations between anticonvulsant activity and molecular structure, the crystal structures of three new cinnamamide derivatives with proven anticonvulsant activity were determined by X-ray diffraction, namely (R,S)-(2E)-N-(2-hydroxybutyl)-3-phenylprop-2-enamide-water (3/1), C13H17NO2·0.33H2O, (1), (2E)-N-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-enamide, C13H17NO2, (2), and (R,S)-(2E)-N-(1-hydroxy-3-methyl-butan-2-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-enamide, C14H19NO2, (3).

A disorder of the substituent at the N atom occurs in the crystal structures of (2) and (3).

We have prepared new derivatives of 1 by modification of the (9β H )-pimarane backbone and report here the semisynthesis and absolute configuration of a novel rearranged 19,20-δ-lactone (9β H )-pimarane. Our approach was the reduction of the carbonyl groups of 1 with sodium borohydride, at positions C15 (no stereoselectivity) and C3 (stereoselective reduction), followed by rearrangement of the 6,19-γ-lactone ring into the six-membered 19,20-δ-lactone ring in 4a (3β,6β,16-trihydroxy-7-pimaren-19,20β-olide monohydrate, C 20 H 30 O 6 ·H 2 O). The absolute structure of the new compound, 4a , was determined unambiguously with a Flack parameter x of −0.01 (11), supporting the stereochemistry assignment of 1 redetermined here. Besides the changes in the pattern of covalent bonds caused by reduction and lactone rearrangement, the conformation of one of the three fused cyclohexane rings is profoundly different in 4a , adopting a chair conformation instead of the boat shape found in 1 .

    "abstract": "The substituted acetylacetone 3-[2-(pyridin-4-yl)ethyl]pentane-2,4-dione, C12H15NO2, (1), with an ethylene bridge between the acetylacetone moiety and the heteroaromatic ring, represents an attractive linker for mixed-metal coordination polymers. In the crystal, (1) adopts an antiperiplanar conformation with respect to the C-C bond in the central ethylene group and almost coplanar acetylacetone and pyridyl groups. The ditopic molecule exists as the enol tautomer, with proton disorder in the short intramolecular hydrogen bond. Single-crystal neutron diffraction at 2.5 K indicated site occupancies of 0.602 (17) and 0.398 (17). The geometry of the acetylacetone moiety is in agreement with such a site preference of the bridging hydrogen: the O atom associated with the preferred H-atom site subtends the longer [1.305 (2) Å] and the more carbonyl-like O atom the shorter [1.288 (2) Å] C-O bond. Based on structure-factor calculations for the alternative H-atom sites, reflections particularly sensitive for proton distribution were identified and measured in a second neutron data collection at 170 K. At this temperature, 546 independent neutron intensities were used to refine positional and isotropic displacement parameters for a structure model in which parameters for C and O atoms were constrained to those obtained by single-crystal X-ray diffraction at the same temperature. The site occupancies for the disordered proton do not significantly differ from those at 2.5 K.",

The existence of two forms, i.e. Form I (block, Z' = 1) and Form II (needle, Z' = 2), was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of the energetics of the different intermolecular interactions was carried out via the energy decomposition method (PIXEL), which corroborates with inputs from the energy framework and looks at the topology of the various intermolecular interactions present in both forms. The unequivocally distinguished contribution of strong N-H...O hydrogen bonds along with other interactions, such as C-H...O, C-H...F, π-π and C-H...π, mapped on the Hirshfeld surface is depicted by two-dimensional fingerprint plots. Apart from the major electrostatic contribution from N-H...O hydrogen bonds, the crystal structures are stabilized by contributions from the dispersion energy. The closely related melting points and opposite trends in the calculated lattice energies are interesting to investigate with respect to the thermodynamic stability of the observed dimorphs. The significant variation in the torsion angles in both forms helps in classifying them in the category of conformational polymorphs.",

In addition, differences in the conformations, the positions of the acetonitrile solvent molecules and the pattern of intermolecular interactions were observed. Hirshfeld surface analysis permits a qualitative inspection of the differences in the intermolecular space in the two polymorphs.

    "abstract": "The first silver bismuth borate, AgBi 2 B 5 O 11 (silver dibismuth pentaborate), has been prepared via glass crystallization in the Ag 2 O–Bi 2 O 3 –B 2 O 3 system and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Its structure is derived from that of centrosymmetric Bi 3 B 5 O 12 by ordered substitution of one Bi 3+ ion for Ag + , which results in the disappearance of the mirror plane and inversion centre. Second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements confirm the acentric crystal structure. It is formed by [Bi 2 B 5 O 11 ] ∞ layers stretched along c and comprised of vertex-sharing B 5 O 10 and BiO 3 groups which incorporate the Ag + cations. The new compound was characterized by thermal analysis, high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction, and vibrational and UV–Vis–NIR (near infrared) spectroscopy. Its thermal expansion is strongly anisotropic due to the presence of rigid B 5 O 10 groups aligned in a parallel manner. The minimal value is observed along their axis [parallel to c , α c = 3.1 (1) × 10 −6 K −1 ], while maximal values are observed in the ab plane [α a = 20.4 (2) and α b = 7.8 (2) × 10 −6 K −1 ]. Upon heating, AgBi 2 B 5 O 11 starts to decay above 684 K due to partial reduction of silver; incongruent melting is observed at 861 K. According to density functional theory (DFT) band-structure calculations, the new compound is a semiconductor with an indirect energy gap of 3.57 eV, which agrees with the experimental data (absorption onset at 380 nm).",

HL acts as an N,N',O-tridentate ligand in both complexes. Complex (I) crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcn and has a mononuclear structure, the azide co-ligand is not involved in crystallization and the Ni2+ centre lies in a distorted {N4O2} octahedral coordination environment. Complex (II) crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 and is a centrosymmetric binuclear complex with a crystallographically independent Cu2+ centre coordinating to three donor atoms from the deprotonated L- ligand and to two N atoms belonging to two bridging azide anions. The two- and one-dimensional supramolecular structures are constructed by hydrogen-bonding interactions in (I) and (II), respectively. The in vitro urease inhibitory evaluation revealed that complex (II) showed a better inhibitory activity, with the IC50 value being 1.32±0.4 µM. Both complexes can effectively bind to bovine serum albumin (BSA) by 1:1 binding, which was assessed via tryptophan emission-quenching measurements.

A systematic characterization of TAPC-OMe , including 1 H and 13 C NMR, elemental analysis, UV–Vis absorption, fluorescence emission, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, was performed. TAPC-OMe crystallized in the triclinic space group P \\overline{1}, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The dihedral angles between the central amine triangular planes and those of the phenyl groups varied from 26.56 (9) to 60.34 (8)° due to the steric hindrance of the central cyclohexyl ring. This arrangement might be induced by weak hydrogen bonds and C—H...π(Ph) interactions in the extended structure. The emission maxima of TAPC-OMe showed a significant bathochomic shift compared to that of TAPC . A strong dependency of the oxidation potentials on the nature of the electron-donating ability of substituents was confirmed by comparing oxidation potentials with known Hammett parameters (σ).",

In this work, SnS2-SnO2 heterostructures were successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. Due to the enhanced visible-light absorption and efficient separation of photo-generated holes and electrons, the SnS2-SnO2 heterostructures display excellent photocatalytic performance for the degradation of rhodamine (RhB) under visible-light irradiation. Additionally, it is found that the introduction of graphene into the heterostructures further improved photocatalytic activity and stability. In particular, the optimized SnS2-SnO2/graphene photocatalyst can degrade 97.1% of RhB within 60 min, which is about 1.38 times greater than that of SnS2-SnO2 heterostructures. This enhanced photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the high surface area and the excellent electron accepting and transporting properties of graphene, which served as an acceptor of the generated electrons to suppress charge recombination. These results provide a new insight for the design and development of hybrid photocatalysts.",

Different chains are linked to each other by metacetamol–water and metacetamol–metacetamol hydrogen bonds, the latter type being also present in polymorph I.

The compound has a lamellar structure with polymeric layers oriented parallel to the (10-2) plane, which are in turn linked via hydrogen bonds involving protonated carboxylic acid groups of the ligand. Bulk compounds I·DMF and II·H2O were characterized by FT-IR and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and thermogravimetry, which provide evidence of their structural differences.",

    "abstract": "The dipharmacophore compound 3-cyclopropyl-5-(2-hydrazinylpyridin-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole, C10H11N5O, was studied on the assumption of its potential biological activity. Two concomitant polymorphs were obtained on crystallization from isopropanol solution and these were thoroughly studied. Identical conformations of the molecules are found in both structures despite the low difference in energy between the four possible conformers. The two polymorphs differ crucially with respect to their crystal structures. A centrosymmetric dimer formed due to both stacking interactions of the `head-to-tail' type and N-H...N(π) hydrogen bonds is the building unit in the triclinic structure. The dimeric building units form an isotropic packing. In the orthorhombic polymorphic structure, the molecules form stacking interactions of the `head-to-head' type, which results in their organization in a column as the primary basic structural motif. The formation of N-H...N(lone pair) hydrogen bonds between two neighbouring columns allows the formation of a double column as the main structural motif. The correct packing motifs in the two polymorphs could not be identified without calculations of the pairwise interaction energies. The triclinic structure has a higher density and a lower (by 0.60 kcal mol-1) lattice energy according to periodic calculations compared to the orthorhombic structure. This allows us to presume that the triclinic form of 3-cyclopropyl-5-(2-hydrazinylpyridin-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole is the more stable.",

The asymmetric unit contains three conformationally similar complex cations and three perchlorate anions.

Ligand field analysis based on the angular overlap model, and IR and electronic spectroscopic properties, are also discussed.",

One of the adenine molecules and one of the phosphonate groups of the zoledronate anion of (II) are protonated on a 50% basis. The zoledronate group displays its usual zwitterionic character, with a protonated imidazole ring; however, the ionization state of the phosphonate groups of the anion for (I) and (II) are different. In (I), the anion has both singly and doubly deprotonated phosphonate groups, while in (II), it has one singly deprotonated phosphonate group and a partially deprotonated phosphonate group. In (I), the cations form an R 2 2 (10) base pair, while in (II), they form R 2 2 (8) and R 2 2 (10) base pairs. Two water molecules in (I) and five water molecules in (II) are involved in water–water interactions. The presence of an additional two water molecules in the structure of (II) might influence the different ionization state of the anion as well as the different packing mode compared to (I).",

The most striking of the complementary features for each of the FPs of the dications is the broad green spike in the region d e &gt; d i , without the presence of a corresponding spike in the region d e &lt; d i , reflecting the absence of O...H contacts.

This polymorph, denoted form (A), appears in crystallizations performed above 308 K. The originally reported form (B) [Wood et al. (2015). Acta Cryst. C71, 32-38] crystallizes preferentially at room temperature. The conformations of the cations in the two forms differ by a 180° rotation about the C-C bond linking the side chain to the aromatic ring. Hydrogen bonding links the cations and anions in both forms into similar extended chains in which any one chain contains only a single enantiomer of the chiral cation, but the packing of the ions is different. In form (A), the aromatic rings of adjacent chains interleave, but pack equally well if neighbouring chains contain the same or opposite enantiomorph of the cation. The consequence of this is then near perfect inversion twinning in the structure. In form (B), neighbouring chains are always inverted, leading to a centrosymmetric space group. The question as to why the polymorphs crystallize at slightly different temperatures has been examined by density functional theory (DFT) and lattice energy calculations and a consideration of packing compactness. The free energy (ΔG) of the crystal lattice for polymorph (A) lies some 52 kJ mol(-1) above that of polymorph (B).",

    "abstract": "In our ongoing development of ferrocene ligands, 1-dimethylamino-2-(diphenylphosphinothioyl)ferrocene is being used as a convenient building block to obtain racemic or enantiomerically pure ligands. Using this building block in large excess allowed the formation of several by-products, two of which have already been reported; the structure of a third by-product, namely 1-(diphenylphosphinothioyl)-2-{[(diphenylphosphinothioyl)sulfanyl]methyl}ferrocene, [Fe(C 5 H 5 )(C 30 H 25 P 2 S 3 )], is presented here. The crystal structure is built up from a ferrocene unit, with one of the cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings substituted in the 1- and 2-positions by a protected diphenylphosphinothioyl group and a [(diphenylphosphinothioyl)sulfanyl]methyl fragment, –CH 2 SP(=S)Ph 2 . There are C—H...S interactions which result in the formation of chains parallel to the c axis. After desulfurization, the crude material was then reacted with Pd and Pt ( M ) precursors [ M Cl 2 (CH 3 CN) 2 ] to yield two isostructural dinuclear complexes arranged around twofold axes, namely ( R , R / S , S )-bis{μ-[2-(diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocen-1-yl]methanethiolato-κ 3 P , S : S }bis[chloridopalladium(II)] pentane disolvate, [Pd 2 {Fe(C 5 H 5 )(C 18 H 15 PS)} 2 Cl 2 ]·2C 5 H 12 , and the platinum(II) analogue, ( R , R / S , S )-bis{μ-[2-(diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocen-1-yl]methanethiolato-κ 3 P , S : S }bis[chloridoplatinum(II)] toluene monosolvate, [Pt 2 {Fe(C 5 H 5 )(C 18 H 15 PS)} 2 Cl 2 ]·C 7 H 8 , in which the two metal atoms present a slightly distorted square-planar geometry formed by two bridging S atoms and P and Cl atoms. The P , S -chelating ligand results from the rupture of one of the P—S bonds in the starting ligand. These dinuclear complexes display a butterfly geometry.

In both complexes, the central Zn(II) cation adopts an octahedral geometry, coordinated by four N- and two S-donor atoms. Notably, trithiocyanurate (ttcH2(-)) adopts the same bidentate chelating coordination mode in each complex and exists in the thione tautomeric form. The 3-bpt co-ligand in (1) adopts a monodentate coordination mode and serves as a terminal pendant ligand, whereas the 4,4'-bipyridine (bpy) ligand in (2) adopts a bidentate-bridging coordination mode. The different coordination characters of the different N-donor auxiliary ligands lead to structural diversity for complexes (1) and (2).

The complex also presnts two `semicoordination' contacts, one from a pendant ethanol solvent molecule and a second one from an S atom of a centrosymmetrically related molecule. This latter interaction complements two π-π interactions between tsac rings to form a dimeric entity which is the elemental unit that builds up the crystal structure. These dinuclear units are connected to each other via a second type of π-π interaction, generating chains along [111]. Two ethanol molecules, one of them of full occupancy at a general position and semicoordinated to the central cation, and a second one depleted and disordered around a symmetry centre, stabilize the structure. The complex was studied theoretically and the vibrational assignations were confirmed by employing theoretical density functional theory (DFT) methods.",

The compound is self-assembled by C=O...C=O and amide-π interactions into stacked columns along the b-axis direction. The concurrence of both interactions seems to be responsible for stabilizing the observed syn conformation between the carbonyl groups. The second dimension, along the a-axis direction, is developed by soft C-H...O hydrogen bonding.

Monoclinic salts (I) and (II) have a 1:1 ratio of cation to anion. In monoclinic salt (III), two cation-anion pairs and two water molecules constitute the asymmetric unit. In all three molecular salts, the amidinium fragments and the carboxylate groups are completely delocalized, and the delocalization favours the aggregation of the molecular components into nonplanar dimers with an R(2)(2)(8) graph-set motif by N(+)-H···O(-) (±) charge-assisted hydrogen bonding (CAHB). Of the three molecular salts, (I) and (II) show similar conformations of the anionic components and exhibit bidimensional isostructurality, which consists of alternating R(2)(2)(8) and R(6)(4)(16) rings resulting in a corrugated sheet propagated parallel to the crystallographic ab plane. In molecular salt (III), the R(2)(2)(8) synthon is retained but the supramolecular structure is different, due to the presence of three bulky methoxy substituents and a water molecule. The structures reported here further demonstrate the robustness of R(2)(2)(8) hydrogen-bonded synthons having the benzamidinium cation as a building block, whereas N(+)-H···O(-) hydrogen bonds external to the salt bridge contribute to the overall structure organization.",

The monohydrate structures are mutually isostructural, with the cations and anions lying on crystallographic mirror planes ( Z ′ = 1\\over 2). The main intermolecular interaction motif is a hydrogen-bonding network in the same mirror plane. The tetrafluoroborate structure is based on planar hydrogen-bonded theopylline cation dimers; the anions interact with the dimers in a pendant fashion. The anhydrous chloride structure has Z ′ = 2 and in contrast to the other species it does not form planar hydrogen-bonded constructs, instead one-dimensional chains of cations and anions propagate parallel to the crystallographic c direction. An earlier report claiming to describe an anhydrous structure of theophylline hydrochloride is re-examined in light of these results. It is concluded that the earlier structure has been reported in the wrong space group and that it has been chemically misidentified.",

    "abstract": "Crystal engineering can be described as the understanding of intermolecular interactions in the context of crystal packing and the utilization of such understanding to design new solids with desired physical and chemical properties. Free-energy differences between supramolecular isomers are generally small and minor changes in the crystallization conditions may result in the occurrence of new isomers. The study of supramolecular isomerism will help us to understand the mechanism of crystallization, a very central concept of crystal engineering. Two supramolecular isomers of dichloridobis(1,10-phenanthroline-κ(2)N,N')cobalt(II), [CoCl2(C12H8N2)2], i.e. (IA) (orthorhombic) and (IB) (monoclinic), and two supramolecular isomers of dichloridobis(1,10-phenanthroline-κ(2)N,N')cobalt(II) N,N-dimethylformamide monosolvate, [CoCl2(C12H8N2)2]·C3H7NO, i.e. (IIA) (orthorhombic) and (IIB) (monoclinic), were synthesized in dimethylformamide (DMF) and structurally characterized. Of these, (IA) and (IIA) have been prepared and structurally characterized previously [Li et al. (2007). Acta Cryst. E63, m1880-m1880; Cai et al. (2008). Acta Cryst. E64, m1328-m1329]. We found that the heating rate is a key factor for the crystallization of (IA) or (IB), while the temperature difference is responsible for the crystallization of (IIA) or (IIB). Based on the crystallization conditions, isomerization behaviour, the KPI (Kitajgorodskij packing index) values and the density data, (IB) and (IIA) are assigned as the thermodynamic and stable kinetic isomers, respectively, while (IA) and (IIB) are assigned as the metastable kinetic products. The 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) ligands interact with each other through offset face-to-face (OFF) π-π stacking in (IB) and (IIB), but by edge-to-face (EF) C-H...π interactions in (IA) and (IIA). Meanwhile, the DMF molecules in (IIB) connect to neighbouring [CoCl2(phen)2] units through two C-H...Cl hydrogen bonds, whereas there are no obvious interactions between DMF molecules and [CoCl2(phen)2] units in (IIA). Since OFF π-π stacking is generally stronger than EF C-H...π interactions for transition-metal complexes with nitrogen-containing aromatic ligands, (IIA) is among the uncommon examples that are stable and densely packed but that do not following Etter's intermolecular interaction hierarchy.",

Our earlier studies concluded that the planarity of a molecule correlates well with its tuberculostatic activity. According to our hypothesis, only derivatives whose molecules are capable of adopting a planar conformation may show tuberculostatic activity. The structures of three new potentially tuberculostatic compounds, namely N'-[bis(methylsulfanyl)methylidene]-N-methyl-4-nitrobenzohydrazide (denoted G1), C11H13N3O3S2, N'-[bis(benzylsulfanyl)methylidene]-N-methyl-4-nitrobenzohydrazide (denoted G2), C23H21N3O3S2, and N'-[(benzylsulfanyl)(methylsulfanyl)methylidene]-4-nitrobenzohydrazide (denoted G3), C16H15N3O3S2, were determined by X-ray diffraction. The significant distortion from planarity caused by the methyl substituent at the N atom of the hydrazide group or the NO2 substituent in the aromatic ring leads to the loss of tuberculostatic activity for G1, G2 and G4 {systematic name: N'-[bis(methylsulfanyl)methylidene]-2-nitrobenzohydrazide}. A similar effect is observed when there are large substituents at the S atoms (G2 and G3).",

    "abstract": "The crystal structures of three products of the reaction of 2-phenylphenol and BCl3 have been determined. The structures show intriguing packing patterns and an interesting case of pseudosymmetry. In addition, one of the two polymorphs has a primitive monoclinic crystal system, but it is twinned and emulates an orthorhombic C-centred structure. Tris(biphenyl-2-yl) borate, C36H27BO3, (III), crystallizes with only one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The dihedral angles between the planes of the aromatic rings in the biphenyl moieties are 50.47 (13), 44.95 (13) and 42.60 (13)°. The boron centre is in a trigonal planar coordination with two of the biphenyl residues on one side of the BO3 plane and the remaining biphenyl residue on the other side. One polymorph of 10-oxa-9-boraphenanthren-9-ol, C12H9BO2, (Va), crystallizes with two almost identical molecules (r.m.s. deviation of all non-H atoms = 0.039 Å) in the asymmetric unit. All non-H atoms lie in a common plane (r.m.s. deviation = 0.015 Å for both molecules in the asymmetric unit). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are connected into dimers via O-H···O hydrogen bonds. A second polymorph of 10-oxa-9-boraphenanthren-9-ol, (Vb), crystallizes as a pseudo-merohedral twin with two almost identical molecules (r.m.s. deviation of all non-H atoms = 0.035 Å) in the asymmetric unit. All non-H atoms lie in a common plane (r.m.s. deviation = 0.012 Å for molecule 1 and 0.014 Å for molecule A). Each of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit is connected into a centrosymmetric dimer via O-H···O hydrogen bonds. The main difference between the two polymorphic structures is that in (Va) the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are hydrogen bonded to each other, whereas in (Vb), each molecule in the asymmetric unit forms a hydrogen-bonded dimer with its centrosymmetric equivalent. 9-[(Biphenyl-2-yl)oxy]-10-oxa-9-boraphenanthrene, C24H17BO2, (VI), crystallizes with four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The main differences between them are the dihedral angles between the ring planes. Apart from the biphenyl moiety, all non-H atoms lie in a common plane (r.m.s. deviations = 0.026, 0.0231, 0.019 and 0.033 Å for molecules 1, A, B and C, respectively). This structure shows pseudosymmetry; molecules 1 and A, as well as molecules B and C, are related by a pseudo-translation of about 1/2 in the direction of the b axis. Molecules 1 and B, as well as molecules A and C, are related by a pseudo-inversion centre at 1/4,1/8,1/2. Neither between molecules 1 and C nor between molecules A and B can pseudosymmetry be found.",

By comparing these structures with those of four other known uranium(IV) sulfate x-hydrates, the effect of additional coordinated water molecules on their structures has been elucidated. As the number of coordinated water molecules increases, the sulfate bonds are displaced, thus changing the binding mode of the sulfate ligands to the uranium centre. As a result, uranium(IV) sulfate x-hydrate changes from being fully crosslinked in three dimensions in the anhydrous compound, through sheet and chain linking in the tetra- and hexahydrates, to fully unlinked molecules in the octa- and nonahydrates. It can be concluded that coordinated waters play an important role in determining the structure and connectivity of U(IV) sulfate complexes.",

The cocrystal formed between 3,5-diethynylpyridine and N -iodosuccinimide (C 4 H 4 INO 2 ·C 9 H 5 N) also features an I...N halogen bond and two C—H...O hydrogen bonds.

    "abstract": "The crystal structures of three mixed-valence copper cyanide alkanolamine polymers are presented, together with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and electron spin resonance (ESR) data. In all three structures, a Cu II moiety on a crystallographic center of symmetry is coordinated by two alkanolamines and links two Cu I CN chains via cyanide bridging groups to form diperiodic sheets. The sheets are linked together by cuprophilic Cu I –Cu I interactions to form a three-dimensional network. In poly[bis(μ-3-aminopropanolato)tetra-μ-cyanido-dicopper(I)dicopper(II)], [Cu 4 (CN) 4 (C 3 H 8 NO) 2 ] n , 1 , propanolamine bases have lost their hydroxyl H atoms and coordinate as chelates to two Cu II atoms to form a dimeric Cu II moiety bridged by the O atoms of the bases with Cu II atoms in square-planar coordination. The ESR spectrum is very broad, indicating exchange between the two Cu II centers. In poly[bis(2-aminopropanol)tetra-μ-cyanido-dicopper(I)copper(II)], [Cu 3 (CN) 4 (C 3 H 9 NO) 2 ] n , 2 , and poly[bis(2-aminoethanol)tetra-μ-cyanido-dicopper(I)copper(II)], [Cu 3 (CN) 4 (CH 7 NO) 2 ] n , 3 , a single Cu II atom links the Cu I CN chains together via CN bridges. The chelating alkanolamines are not ionized, and the OH groups form rather long bonds in the axial positions of the octahedrally coordinated Cu II atoms. The coordination geometries of Cu II in 2 and 3 are almost identical, except that the Cu—O distances are longer in 2 than in 3 , which may explain their somewhat different ESR spectra. Thermal decomposition in 2 and 3 , but not in 1 , begins with the loss of HCN(g), and this can be correlated with the presence of OH protons on the ligands in 2 and 3 , which are not present in 1 .",

    "abstract": "The influence of the crystal synthesis method on the crystallographic structure of caffeine–citric acid cocrystals was analyzed thanks to the synthesis of a new polymorphic form of the cocrystal. In order to compare the new form to the already known forms, the crystal structure of the new cocrystal (C 8 H 10 N 4 O 2 ·C 6 H 8 O 7 ) was solved by powder X-ray diffraction thanks to synchrotron experiments. The structure determination was performed using `GALLOP', a recently developed hybrid approach based on a local optimization with a particle swarm optimizer, particularly powerful when applied to the structure resolution of materials of pharmaceutical interest, compared to classical Monte-Carlo simulated annealing. The final structure was obtained through Rietveld refinement, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to locate the H atoms. The symmetry is triclinic with the space group P -1 and contains one molecule of caffeine and one molecule of citric acid per asymmetric unit. The crystallographic structure of this cocrystal involves different hydrogen-bond associations compared to the already known structures. The analysis of these hydrogen bonds indicates that the cocrystal obtained here is less stable than the cocrystals already identified in the literature. This analysis is confirmed by the determination of the melting point of this cocrystal, which is lower than that of the previously known cocrystals.",

Hirshfeld surface analysis, fingerprint analysis, electronic properties and energetic characterization reveal that intermolecular C—H...O hydrogen bonds play a crucial role in the noncovalent bonding interactions by connecting molecules into two- and three-dimensional networks. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) map of the monascin molecule demonstrates that negatively charged regions located at four O atoms are favoured binding sites for more positively charged amino acid residues during molecular recognition. In addition, powder X-ray diffraction confirms that no transformation occurs during the crystallization of monascin.",

The loss of the three-dimensional periodicity is ascribed to the occupational modulation of one positionally disordered solvent water molecule, where the two positions are related by a small translation [ ca 0.666 (9) Å] and ∼168 (5)° rotation about one of its O—H bonds, with an average 0.624 (3):0.376 (3) occupancy ratio.

Although pyrroles without substituents at the α-position with respect to the N atom are very air sensitive and tend to polymerize, we succeeded in growing an adequate crystal for X-ray diffraction analysis. Further derivatization using sodium nitrite afforded a nitrosyl pyrrole derivative, which crystallized in the triclinic space group P \\overline{1} with Z = 6. Thus, herein we report the first crystal structure of a nitrosyl pyrrole. Interestingly, the co-operative hydrogen bonds in this NO-substituted pyrrole lead to a trimeric structure with bifurcated halogen bonds at the ends, forming a two-dimensional (2D) layer with interstitial voids having a radius of 5 Å, similar to some reported macrocyclic porphyrins.",

The synthesis of NTFC was carried out and good-quality crystals were obtained and studied by NMR ( 1 H and 13 C), DEPT 135, UV–Vis, IR, MS and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure of NTFC consists of two rings, thiazole and furan, and a central C—N—C(=O)—C segment, which appears to be planar. This central amide segment forms angles of 2.61 (10) and 7.97 (11)° with the planes of the thiazole and furan rings, respectively. The crystal structure of NTFC exhibits N—H...N, N—H...O and C—H...O hydrogen bonds, and C—H...π and π–π interactions that facilitate self-assembly and the formation of hydrogen-bonded dimers, which implies the appearance of R 2 2 (8) graph-set motifs in this interaction. The stability of the dimeric unit is complemented by the formation of strong intramolecular C—S...O interactions of chalcogen character, with an S...O distance of 2.6040 (18) Å. Hirshfeld surface (HS) analysis revealed that O...H/H...O interactions were dominant, accounting for 36.8% of the total HS, and that N—H...N interactions were fundamental to the formation of the dimeric structure. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) map showed a maximum energy of 46.73 kcal mol −1 and a minimum of −36.06 kcal mol −1 . The interaction energies of molecular pairs around NTFC are highest for those interactions linked by N—H hydrogen bonds.

The Schiff base was synthesized by reacting dipyridylmethanone hydrazone with indole-2-formaldehyde, while the cadmium complex was prepared by combining CdCl 2 and 2-DPHI in methanol at room temperature. Both compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against three human cancer cell lines (A375, A549 and HeLa) and a normal cell line (HFF-1). The ligand 2-DPHI exhibited notable antitumour activity, with an IC 50 value of 12.22 µ M against A375 and 15.17 µ M against A549 after 48 h, while the pCd2 complex showed an even stronger inhibition of A375 cells, with an IC 50 value of 4.88 µ M , outperforming both 2-DPHI and CdCl 2 . Both compounds demonstrated lower toxicity towards normal cells compared to cancer cells. The structures of 2-DPHI and pCd2 were fully characterized using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, high-resolution mass spectrometry and FT–IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and UV–Vis spectroscopy.",

The crystals have the composition Fe 3 O(OAc) 7 (HOAc) (HOAc is acetic acid) and include the well-known [Fe 3 O(OAc) 6 ] + unit, in which the Fe III centres are linked to a central coplanar μ 3 -oxido ligand. Acetate ions provide bridges between pairs of Fe III centres. These individual [Fe 3 O(OAc) 6 ] + units are linked by additional bridging acetate anions to form zigzag chains. The bridging acetate ions coordinate to a position trans to the oxido group on two of the Fe III centres. Remarkably, the trans site on the third Fe III centre is occupied by the carbonyl group of an acetic acid molecule. This is the first reported case of an acetic acid molecule coordinating to an Fe III centre. Not surprisingly, the acetic acid molecule is only weakly coordinating, resulting in a short Fe—O(oxido) bond trans to the carbonyl group. The trans influence apparent in this structure provides an interesting contrast with the structurally similar Mn III analogue, in which the corresponding pair of trans bonds are both elongated because of the Jahn–Teller effect.",

The effect of different proportions (1/12, 1/6 and 1/3) of Eu 3+ doping on BSO crystals was investigated using the virtual crystal approximation method. Through Mulliken charge analysis, it is found that a high proportion of Eu 3+ doping will destroy the symmetry of the crystal structure. With an increase of the Eu 3+ -doping ratio, the Eu—O bond length first increased and then decreased, showing the characteristics of covalent bonds, and the Eu—O bond length reached the minimum value when the Eu 3+ -doping ratio was increased to 1/3. With an increase in the Eu 3+ -doping ratio, the Bi—O bond length decreases sequentially and also reaches the minimum value when the Eu 3+ -doping ratio was increased to 1/3. This indicates that the covalence between the Eu—O and Bi—O atoms is enhanced when the doping ratio is 1/3 when BSO crystals are doped with Eu 3+ .",

    "abstract": "Prompted by visionary political leaders and a flowering economy, the University of La Plata was founded in 1905, the third Argentinian university after the Universities of Cordoba (1613) and Buenos Aires (1821). Differing from the older universities, more prone to professional formation, the new university was oriented towards teaching and scientific research following western European academic tradition. Along with the university was created the Institute of Physics, the first of its kind in Latin America. To pursue the foundational plan, the university recruited distinguished German physicists, some of whom became the first directors. From the start, the institute became acquainted with Röntgen rays, their generation and use, initially for radiographic images and later in occasional diffraction studies. The first dedicated crystallographic X-ray diffraction laboratory was set up in the early 1970s, when it solved the first molecular structures. Soon the fascination brought about by a methodology that afforded the visualization of atoms, molecules and crystals lured the local and national physical chemistry communities. In close partnership with an equally oriented laboratory at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and in collaboration with several physical chemistry laboratories from Argentina and the Latin American region, and also from Europe, we undertook studies on the crystal structures and physicochemical and spectroscopic properties of a wide range of materials, including inorganic, organic, bioinorganic, metal–organic, organic–metal, supramolecular, pharmaceutical, organic minerals and liquid crystals. The present essay is a personal account of the origin and development of structural X-ray crystallography at the University of La Plata and its impact on the scientific research of Argentina and Latin America.",

Structure analysis revealed that these layered structures were due to charge transfer, π–π interactions and hydrogen bonding. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that fluoranthene–TCNB and fluoranthene–TFP have charge-transfer properties, while fluoranthene–OFN does not, indicating that fluoranthene–OFN has arene–perfluoroarene (AP) interactions, which was also demonstrated by spectroscopic analysis, which shows that the photophysical properties of luminescent materials can be tuned by forming cocrystals. These results all prove that utilizing supramolecular cocrystals to develop new fluorescent materials is an effective strategy, which has much potential in optoelectronic applications.",

In such cases, NMR crystallography strategies involving a combination of solid-state NMR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and computational chemistry methods can often reveal structural details that cannot be acquired from diffraction alone. We present here the structure determination of a surfactant-templated layered silicate material that lacks full three-dimensional crystallinity using such an NMR crystallography approach. Through a combination of powder X-ray diffraction and advanced 29Si solid-state NMR spectroscopy, it is revealed that the structure of the silicate layer of this layered silicate material templated with cetyltrimethylammonium surfactant cations is isostructural with the silicate layer of a previously reported material referred to as ilerite, octosilicate, or RUB-18. High-field 1H NMR spectroscopy reveals differences between the materials in terms of the ordering of silanol groups on the surfaces of the layers, as well as the contents of the inter-layer space.",

The asymmetric unit of (I) consists of two symmetry-independent molecules, while those of (II) and (III) contain one molecule each. The molecular conformations are stabilized by different intramolecular interactions, viz. C—H...O interactions in (I), N—H...Cl and C—H...O interactions in (II), and C—H...O interactions in (III). The crystals of the three compounds display different supramolecular architectures built by various weak intermolecular interactions of the types C—H...O, C—H...Cl, C—H...π(aryl), π(aryl)–π(aryl) and Cl...Cl. A detailed Hirshfeld surface analysis of these compounds has also been conducted in order to understand the relationship between the crystal structures. The d norm and shape-index surfaces of (I)–(III) support the presence of various intermolecular interactions in the three structures. Analysis of the fingerprint plots reveals that the greatest contribution to the Hirshfeld surfaces is from H...H contacts, followed by H...O/O...H contacts. In addition, comparisons are made with the structures of some related compounds. Putative N—H...O hydrogen bonds are observed in 29 of the 30 reported structures, wherein the N—H...O hydrogen bonds form either C (4) chain motifs or R 2 2 (8) rings. Further comparison reveals that the characteristics of the N—H...O hydrogen-bond motifs, the presence of other interactions and the resultant supramolecular architecture is largely decided by the position of the substituents on the benzenesulfonyl ring, with the nature and position of the substituents on the aniline ring exerting little effect. On the other hand, the crystal structures of (I)–(III) display several weak interactions other than the common N—H...O hydrogen bonds, resulting in supramolecular architectures varying from one- to three-dimensional depending on the nature and position of the substituents on the aniline ring.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of modern industry, water pollution has become an intractable environmental issue facing humans worldwide. In particular, the organic dyes discharged into natural water from dyestuffs, dyeing and the textile industry are the main sources of pollution in wastewater. To eliminate these types of pollutants, degradation of organic contaminants through a photocatalytic technique is an effective methodology.

These two title compounds have been structurally characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and powder X-ray diffraction. In (I), the Ag I ions and organic ligands form a one-dimensional coordination chain, and adjacent coordination chains are connected by Ag...O interactions to give rise to a two-dimensional supramolecular network. Each two-dimensional network is entangled with other equivalent networks to generate an infrequent interlocked 2D→3D (2D and 3D are two- and three-dimensional, respectively) supramolecular framework. In (II), the Cd II ions are bridged by the HBTC 2− and 3,4′-bpe ligands, which lie across centres of inversion, to give a two-dimensional coordination network. The thermal stabilities and photocatalytic properties of the title compounds have also been studied.",

    "abstract": "The crystallization and characterization of a new polymorph of 2-thiouracil by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Hirshfeld surface analysis and periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations are described. The previously published polymorph (A) crystallizes in the triclinic space group P\\overline{1}, while that described herein (B) crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c. Periodic DFT calculations showed that the energies of polymorphs A and B, compared to the gas-phase geometry, were -108.8 and -29.4 kJ mol-1, respectively. The two polymorphs have different intermolecular contacts that were analyzed and are discussed in detail. Significant differences in the molecular structure were found only in the bond lengths and angles involving heteroatoms that are involved in hydrogen bonds. Decomposition of the Hirshfeld fingerprint plots revealed that O...H and S...H contacts cover over 50% of the noncovalent contacts in both of the polymorphs; however, they are quite different in strength. Hydrogen bonds of the N-H...O and N-H...S types were found in polymorph A, whereas in polymorph B, only those of the N-H...O type are present, resulting in a different packing in the unit cell. QTAIM (quantum theory of atoms in molecules) computational analysis showed that the interaction energies for these weak-to-medium strength hydrogen bonds with a noncovalent or mixed interaction character were estimated to fall within the ranges 5.4-10.2 and 4.9-9.2 kJ mol-1 for polymorphs A and B, respectively. Also, the NCI (noncovalent interaction) plots revealed weak stacking interactions. The interaction energies for these interactions were in the ranges 3.5-4.1 and 3.1-5.5 kJ mol-1 for polymorphs A and B, respectively, as shown by QTAIM analysis.",

    "abstract": "Doubly and triply hydrogen-bonded supramolecular synthons are of particular interest for the rational design of crystal and cocrystal structures in crystal engineering since they show a high robustness due to their high stability and good reliability. The compound 5-methyl-2-thiouracil (2-thiothymine) contains an ADA hydrogen-bonding site ( A = acceptor and D = donor) if the S atom is considered as an acceptor. We report herein the results of cocrystallization experiments with the coformers 2,4-diaminopyrimidine, 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine, 6-amino-3 H -isocytosine and melamine, which contain complementary DAD hydrogen-bonding sites and, therefore, should be capable of forming a mixed ADA – DAD N—H...S/N—H...N/N—H...O synthon (denoted synthon 3 s N·S;N·N;N·O ), consisting of three different hydrogen bonds with 5-methyl-2-thiouracil. The experiments yielded one cocrystal and five solvated cocrystals, namely 5-methyl-2-thiouracil–2,4-diaminopyrimidine (1/2), C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·2C 4 H 6 N 4 , (I), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil–2,4-diaminopyrimidine– N , N -dimethylformamide (2/2/1), 2C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·2C 4 H 6 N 4 ·C 3 H 7 NO, (II), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil–2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine– N , N -dimethylformamide (2/2/1), 2C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·2C 9 H 9 N 5 ·C 3 H 7 NO, (III), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil–6-amino-3 H -isocytosine– N , N -dimethylformamide (2/2/1), (IV), 2C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·2C 4 H 6 N 4 O·C 3 H 7 NO, (IV), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil–6-amino-3 H -isocytosine– N , N -dimethylacetamide (2/2/1), 2C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·2C 4 H 6 N 4 O·C 4 H 9 NO, (V), and 5-methyl-2-thiouracil–melamine (3/2), 3C 5 H 6 N 2 OS·2C 3 H 6 N 6 , (VI). Synthon 3 s N·S;N·N;N·O was formed in three structures in which two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded networks are observed, while doubly hydrogen-bonded interactions were formed instead in the remaining three cocrystals whereby three-dimensional networks are preferred. As desired, the S atoms are involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions in all six structures, thus illustrating the ability of sulfur to act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor and, therefore, its value for application in crystal engineering.",

The organic molecule exists as a zwitterion; two zwitterions are aligned in an antiparallel fashion about a crystallographic centre of inversion. They interact directly via two N-H...O hydrogen bonds between the ammonium group of one zwitterion and the sulfonate group of its symmetry-related counterpart, and their aromatic rings are π-stacked, with an interplanar distance of 3.533 (3) Å. One of the cocrystallized water molecules connects the resulting pairs into layers and the second crosslinks the layers into a three-dimensional network. All H atoms connected to N or O atoms find acceptors in suitable geometries. In the resulting crystal, polar and hydrogen-bond-dominated slabs alternate with stacks of organic arene rings. Although the new dihydrate shows efficient space filling, with a packing coefficient of 75.7%, it is unstable and undergoes fast desolvation at room temperature. In this process, the orthorhombic ansolvate forms as a pure phase.",

    "abstract": "C-Alkyl (including C-arylmethyl) derivatives of Meldrum's acids are attractive building blocks in organic synthesis, mainly due to the unusually high acidity of the resulting compounds. Three examples, namely 5-[4-(diethylamino)benzyl]-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione, C17H23NO4, (I), 2,2-dimethyl-5-(2,4,6-trimethoxybenzyl)-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione, C16H20O7, (II), and 5-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione, C15H18O7, (III), have been synthesized, characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy, and studied by single-crystal X-ray structure analysis. The nature of the different substituents resulted in remarkable differences in both the molecular conformations and the crystal packing arrangements. The presence of a substituent with a basic centre in compound (I) leads to the formation of an inner salt accompanied by drastic changes in the conformation of the 1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione fragment. By virtue of strong N-H···O hydrogen bonds, the residues are assembled into infinite chains with the graph-set descriptor C(10). Compound (II) contains methoxy groups in both the ortho- and para-positions of the arylmethyl fragment. Because of the absence of classical hydrogen-bond donors in this structure, the crystal packing is controlled by van der Waals forces and weak C-H···O interactions. Compound (III) contains methoxy groups in both meta-positions and a hydroxy group in the para-position. Supramolecular tetrameric synthons which comprise hydrogen-bonded dimers associated into tetramers through π-π interactions of overlapping benzene rings were observed.",

    "abstract": "Crystals of hexa-tert-butyldisilane, C24H54Si2, undergo a reversible phase transition at 179 (2) K. The space group changes from Ibca (high temperature) to Pbca (low temperature), but the lattice constants a, b and c do not change significantly during the phase transition. The crystallographic twofold axis of the molecule in the high-temperature phase is replaced by a noncrystallographic twofold axis in the low-temperature phase. The angle between the two axes is 2.36 (4)°. The centre of the molecule undergoes a translation of 0.123 (1) Å during the phase transition, but the conformation angles of the molecule remain unchanged. Between the two tri-tert-butylsilyl subunits there are six short repulsive intramolecular C-H···H-C contacts, with H···H distances between 2.02 and 2.04 Å, resulting in a significant lengthening of the Si-Si and Si-C bonds. The Si-Si bond length is 2.6863 (5) Å and the Si-C bond lengths are between 1.9860 (14) and 1.9933 (14) Å. Torsion angles about the Si-Si and Si-C bonds deviate by approximately 15° from the values expected for staggered conformations due to intramolecular steric H···H repulsions. A new polymorph is reported for the crystal structure of 1,1,2,2-tetra-tert-butyl-1,2-diphenyldisilane, C28H46Si2. It has two independent molecules with rather similar conformations. The Si-Si bond lengths are 2.4869 (8) and 2.4944 (8) Å. The C-Si-Si-C torsion angles deviate by between -3.4 (1) and -18.5 (1)° from the values expected for a staggered conformation. These deviations result from steric interactions. Four Si-C(t-Bu) bonds are almost staggered, while the other four Si-C(t-Bu) bonds are intermediate between a staggered and an eclipsed conformation. The latter Si-C(t-Bu) bonds are about 0.019 (2) Å longer than the staggered Si-C(t-Bu) bonds.",

The ten molecules in the eight crystal structures [there are two independent molecules in the structures of (V) and (VI)] show similar conformations and hydrogen-bonding patterns. The C=N-NH-C=O group is planar, but the plane of the phenyl ring of the benzoyl group is rotated by about 30° with respect to that of the keto group [except for (IV), where the groups are coplanar]. Only in the amide group of (VIII) is the N-H group syn to the C=O bond, whereas the seven other compounds exhibit the anti conformation. Unless prevented by steric hindrance, N-H...O hydrogen bonds help to stabilize the crystal structure, which leads to infinite chains or dimers depending upon the molecular conformation. The molecular packing is supported by intermolecular C-H...O interactions. In the crystal structure of (VII), the methanol solvent molecule participates in two strong hydrogen bonds and two weak C-H...O interactions, thus acting as a link between the molecular chains.",

The channels of this network are occupied by the dichlorophenyl substituents and the ethanol and methanol solvent molecules. The structure of the S-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-2,3-dichlorophenylacetothiohydroxymate, C21H23Cl2NO10S, precursor has also been determined and the β-configuration and Z isomer of the thiohydroximate substituent is confirmed.",

    "abstract": "In the molecule of (2,7-dimethoxynaphthalen-1-yl)(3-fluorophenyl)methanone, C19H15FO3, (I), the dihedral angle between the plane of the naphthalene ring system and that of the benzene ring is 85.90 (5)°. The molecules exhibit axial chirality, with either an R- or an S-stereogenic axis. In the crystal structure, each enantiomer is stacked into a columnar structure and the columns are arranged alternately to form a stripe structure. A pair of (methoxy)C-H...F hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions between the benzene rings of the aroyl groups link an R- and an S-isomer to form a dimeric pair. These dimeric pairs are piled up in a columnar fashion through (benzene)C-H...O=C and (benzene)C-H...OCH3 hydrogen bonds. The analogous 1-benzoylated compound, namely (2,7-dimethoxynaphthalen-1-yl)(phenyl)methanone [Kato et al. (2010). Acta Cryst. E66, o2659], (II), affords three independent molecules having slightly different dihedral angles between the benzene and naphthalene rings. The three independent molecules form separate columns and the three types of column are connected to each other via two C-H...OCH3 hydrogen bonds and one C-H...O=C hydrogen bond. Two of the three columns are formed by the same enantiomeric isomer, whereas the remaining column consists of the counterpart isomer. In the case of the fluorinated 1-benzoylated naphthalene analogue, namely (2,7-dimethoxynaphthalen-1-yl)(4-fluorophenyl)methanone [Watanabe et al. (2011). Acta Cryst. E67, o1466], (III), the molecular packing is similar to that of (I), i.e. it consists of stripes of R- and S-enantiomeric columns. A pair of C-H...F hydrogen bonds between R- and S-isomers, and C-H...O=C hydrogen bonds between R(or S)-isomers, are also observed. Consequently, the stripe structure is apparently induced by the formation of R...S dimeric pairs stacked in a columnar fashion. The pair of C-H...F hydrogen bonds effectively stabilizes the dimeric pair of R- and S-enantiomers. In addition, the co-existence of C-H...F and C-H...O=C hydrogen bonds makes possible the formation of a structure with just one independent molecule.",

The cation and anion are well separated and the ligand planes in the cobaltate anion are periplanar. Each anthracene molecule is midway between and is oriented perpendicular to a pair of symmetry-related bipy ligands such that aromatic donor-acceptor interactions may play a role in the packing arrangement. The lengths of the bonds that connect the bipy rings support the assertion that the ligands are bipy radical anions in the iron structure. However, in the case of cobalt, these lengths are between the known ranges for a bipy radical anion and a bipy dianion, and therefore no conclusion can be made from the crystallography alone. One cocrystallized THF solvent molecule in the cobalt structure was modeled as disordered over three positions with appropriate geometric and thermal restraints, which resulted in a refined component mass ratio of 0.412 (4):0.387 (3):0.201 (3).",

    "abstract": "In this article, the crystal structure of solid hydrazine under pressure has been extensively investigated using ab initio evolutionary simulation methods. Calculations indicate that hydrazine remains both insulating and stable up to at least 300 GPa at low temperatures. A structure with P2₁ symmetry is found for the first time through theoretical prediction in the pressure range 0-99 GPa and it is consistent with previous experimental results. Two novel structures are also proposed, in the space groups Cc and C2/c, postulated to be stable in the range 99-235 GPa and above 235 GPa, respectively. Below 3.5 GPa, C2 symmetry is found originally, but it becomes unstable after adding the van der Waals interactions. The P2₁→Cc transition is first order, with a volume discontinuity of 2.4%, while the Cc→C2/c transition is second order with a continuous volume change. Pressure-induced hydrogen-bond symmetrization occurs at 235 GPa during the Cc→C2/c transition. The underlying mechanism of hydrogen-bond symmetrization has also been investigated by analysis of electron localization functions and vibrational Raman/IR spectra.",

Nitrogen-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) are important ligands in homogeneous catalysis and iron-NHC complexes have attracted increasing attention in recent years but still face problems in terms of stability under oxidative conditions. The structure of the iron(II) complex [1,1'-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-2,2-bi(1H-imidazole)-κN(3)][3,3'-bis(pyridin-2-yl-κN)-1,1'-methanediylbi(1H-imidazol-2-yl-κC(2))](trimethylphosphane-κP)iron(II) bis(hexafluoridophosphate), [Fe(C17H14N6)(C16H12N6)(C3H9P)](PF6)2, features coordination by an organic decomposition product of a tetradentate NHC ligand in an axial position. The decomposition product, a C-C-coupled biimidazole, is trapped by coordination to still-intact iron(II) complexes. Insights into the structural features of the organic decomposition products might help to improve the stability of oxidation catalysts under harsh conditions.",

The nature of short (< ∼ 3.2 Å) Cu...Cu contacts within these compounds has been debated, being either described as weakly attractive (bonding) `cuprophilic' interactions, or simply as short metal-metal distances constrained by ligand geometry or largely ionic in nature. The title three-dimensional Cu(+)-containing coordination polymer, [Cu3(C7H7N2O2)Cl2]n, was formed from the in situ reduction of CuCl2 in the presence of 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid and KOH under hydrothermal conditions. Its complex crystal structure contains ten distinct Cu(I) atoms, two of which lie on crystallographic inversion centres. The copper coordination geometries include near-linear CuOCl and CuN2, T-shaped CuOCl2 and distorted tetrahedral CuOCl3 groups. Each Cu(I) atom is also associated with two adjacent metal atoms, with Cu...Cu distances varying from 2.7350 (14) to 3.2142 (13) Å; if all these are regarded as `cuprophilic' interactions, then infinite [-101] zigzag chains of Cu(I) atoms occur in the crystal. The structure is consolidated by N-H...Cl hydrogen bonds.",

    "abstract": "Organoboranes carrying electron-withdrawing substituents are commonly used as Lewis acidic catalysts or cocatalysts in a variety of organic processes. These Lewis acids also became popular through their application in `frustrated Lewis pairs', i.e. combinations of Lewis acids and bases that are unable to fully neutralize each other due to steric or electronic effects. We have determined the crystal and molecular structures of four heteroleptic arylboranes carrying 2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, 2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl or mesityl substituents. [3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]bis[2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane, C22H11BF12, (I), crystallizes with two molecules in the asymmetric unit which show very similar geometric parameters. In one of the two molecules, both trifluoromethyl groups of the 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl substituent are disordered over two positions. In [3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]bis[2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane, C24H9BF18, (II), only one of the two meta-trifluoromethyl groups is disordered. In [2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]bis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane, C24H9BF18, (III), both meta-trifluoromethyl groups of only one 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl ring are disordered. [3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]dimesitylborane, C26H25BF6, (IV), carries only one meta-trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl ring, with one of the two trifluoromethyl groups disordered over two positions. In addition to compounds (I)-(IV), the structure of bis[2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]fluoroborane, C16H6BF13, (V), is presented. None of the ortho-trifluoromethyl groups is disordered in any of the five compounds. In all the structures, the boron centre is in a trigonal planar coordination. Nevertheless, the bond angles around this atom vary according to the bulkiness and mutual repulsion of the substituents of the phenyl rings. Also, the ortho-trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl rings usually show longer B-C bonds and tend to be tilted out of the BC3 plane by a higher degree than the phenyl rings carrying ortho H atoms. A comparison with related structures corroborates the conclusions regarding the geometric parameters of the boron centre drawn from the five structures in this paper. On the other hand, CF3 groups in meta positions do not seem to have a marked effect on the geometry involving the boron centre. Furthermore, it has been observed for the structures reported here and those reported previously that for CF3 groups in ortho positions of the aromatic ring, disorder of the F atoms is less probable than for CF3 groups in meta or para positions of the ring.",

The monohalogenated intermediates 1-(2-chloroethyl)pyridinium chloride, C5H5NCH2CH2Cl(+)·Cl(-), (I'), and 1-(2-bromoethyl)pyridinium bromide, C5H5NCH2CH2Br(+)·Br(-), (II'), and the ionic disubstituted products 1,1'-(ethylene-1,2-diyl)dipyridinium dichloride dihydrate, C12H14N2(2+)·2Cl(-)·2H2O, (I), and 1,1'-(ethylene-1,2-diyl)dipyridinium dibromide, C12H14N2(2+)·2Br(-), (II), have been isolated as powders from the reactions of pyridine with the appropriate 1,2-dihaloethanes. The monohalogenated intermediates (I') and (II') were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, while (I) and (II) were structurally characterized using powder X-ray diffraction. Both (I) and (II) crystallize with half the empirical formula in the asymmetric unit in the triclinic space group P-1. The organic 1,1'-(ethylene-1,2-diyl)dipyridinium dications, which display approximate C2h symmetry in both structures, are situated on inversion centres. The components in (I) are linked via intermolecular O-H...Cl, C-H...Cl and C-H...O hydrogen bonds into a three-dimensional framework, while for (II), they are connected via weak intermolecular C-H...Br hydrogen bonds into one-dimensional chains in the [110] direction. The nucleophilic substitution reactions of 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane with pyridine have been investigated by ab initio quantum chemical calculations using the 6-31G** basis. In both cases, the reactions occur in two exothermic stages involving consecutive SN2 nucleophilic substitutions. The isolation of the monosubstituted intermediate in each case is strong evidence that the second step is not fast relative to the first.",

    "abstract": "The identification of the antibacterial action of nalidixic acid (nx) was central to the development of the quinolone antibacterial compounds. The ability of the nx naphthyridyl ring to interact with and inhibit some proteins has encouraged the investigation of similar structures in the search for more active compounds with less adverse effects. The possibility of structural modification by attachment of other biologically active moieties to the naphthyridyl ring of nx allowed the development of new active antimicrobial molecules. Hydrazone derivatives of nx can be synthesized easily based on the condensation of the hydrazide derivative of nx with the desired aldehyde or ketone. Only a few complexes with nx hydrazone derivatives have been described but for none were the crystal structures elucidated.

These discrete complexes are connected by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions to form a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture. Compared with (I), the phenolic hydroxy group and hydrazide N atom of the thiosemicarbazide ligand of (II) are not involved in coordination and lead to a binuclear Cd(II) complex.

    "abstract": "Radical salts and charge-transfer complexes (CTCs) containing tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) display electrical conductivity, which has led to the development of many TCNQ derivatives with enhanced electron-accepting properties that are applicable toward organic electronics. To expand the family of TCNQ derivatives, we report the synthesis and structures of 11,11,12,12-tetracyano-2,6-diiodo-9,10-anthraquinodimethane (abbreviated as DITCAQ), C20H6I2N4, and its charge-transfer complexes with various electron donors, namely DITCAQ-anthracene (2/1), C20H6I2N4·0.5C14H10, (I), DITCAQ-pyrene (2/1), C20H6I2N4·0.5C16H10, (II), and DITCAQ-tetrathiafulvalene (2/1), C20H6I2N4·0.5C6H4S4, (III). The molecular structure of DITCAQ consists of a 2,6-diiodo-9,10-dihydroanthracene moiety with two malononitrile substituents. DITCAQ possesses a saddle shape, since the malononitrile groups bend significantly up out of the plane of the central ring and the two benzene rings bend down out of the same plane. π-π interactions between DITCAQ and the electron-donor molecules control the degree of charge transfer in cocrystals (I), (II), and (III), which is reflected in both the dihedral angles between the terminal benzene ring and the central ring on the DITCAQ motifs, and their corresponding IR spectra.",

    "abstract": "As a function of temperature, the hexamethylenetetramine-2-methylbenzoic acid (1/2) cocrystal, C6H12N4·2C8H8O2, undergoes a reversible structural phase transition. The orthorhombic high-temperature phase in the space group Pccn has been studied in the temperature range between 165 and 300 K. At 164 K, a t2 phase transition to the monoclinic subgroup P21/c space group occurs; the resulting twinned low-temperature phase was investigated in the temperature range between 164 and 100 K. The domains in the pseudomerohedral twin are related by a twofold rotation corresponding to the matrix (100/0-10/00-1. Systematic absence violations represent a sensitive criterium for the decision about the correct space-group assignment at each temperature. The fractional volume contributions of the minor twin domain in the low-temperature phase increases in the order 0.259 (2) → 0.318 (2) → 0.336 (2) → 0.341 (3) as the temperature increases in the order 150 → 160 → 163 → 164 K. The transformation occurs between the nonpolar point group mmm and the nonpolar point group 2/m, and corresponds to a ferroelastic transition or to a t2 structural phase transition. The asymmetric unit of the low-temperature phase consists of two hexamethylenetetramine molecules and four molecules of 2-methylbenzoic acid; it is smaller by a factor of 2 in the high-temperature phase and contains two half molecules of hexamethylenetetramine, which sit across twofold axes, and two molecules of the organic acid. In both phases, the hexamethylenetetramine residue and two benzoic acid molecules form a three-molecule aggregate; the low-temperature phase contains two of these aggregates in general positions, whereas they are situated on a crystallographic twofold axis in the high-temperature phase. In both phases, one of these three-molecule aggregates is disordered. For this disordered unit, the ratio between the major and minor conformer increases upon cooling from 0.567 (7):0.433 (7) at 170 K via 0.674 (6):0.326 (6) and 0.808 (5):0.192 (5) at 160 K to 0.803 (6):0.197 (6) and 0.900 (4):0.100 (4) at 150 K, indicating temperature-dependent dynamic molecular disorder. Even upon further cooling to 100 K, the disorder is retained in principle, albeit with very low site occupancies for the minor conformer.",

    "abstract": "There are challenges in using magnesium coordination complexes as reagents owing to their tendency to adopt varying aggregation states in solution and thus impacting the reactivity of the complexes. Many magnesium complexes are prone to ligand redistribution via Schlenk equilibrium due to the ionic character within the metal-ligand interactions. The role of the supporting ligand is often crucial for providing stability to the heteroleptic complex. Strategies to minimize ligand redistribution in alkaline earth metal complexes could include using a supporting ligand with tunable sterics and electronics to influence the degree of association to the metal atom. Magnesium bis(hexamethyldisilazide) was reacted with salicylaldimines [1L = N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)salicylaldimine and 2L = 3,5-di-tert-butyl-N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)salicylaldimine] in either nondonor (toluene) or donor solvents [tetrahydrofuran (THF) or pyridine]. The structures of the magnesium complexes were studied in the solid state via X-ray diffraction. In the nondonor solvent, i.e. toluene, the heteroleptic complex bis{μ-2-[(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)iminomethyl]phenolato}-κ3N,O:O;κ3O:N,O-bis[(hexamethyldisilazido-κN)magnesium(II)], [Mg2(C19H22NO)2(C6H18NSi2)2] or [1LMgN(SiMe3)2]2, (1), was favored, while in the donor solvent, i.e. pyridine (pyr), the formation of the homoleptic complex {2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-[(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)iminomethyl]phenolato-κ2N,O}bis(pyridine-κN)magnesium(II) toluene monosolvate, [Mg(C27H38NO)2(C5H5N)2]·C5H5N or [{2L2Mg2(pyr)2}·pyr], (2), predominated.

Chem. pp. 3321-3326] were crystallized from pyridine and THF, respectively. These studies support solvent-dependent ligand redistribution in solution.

    "abstract": "Polymorphism is the ability of a solid material to exist in more than one form or crystal structure and this is of interest in the fields of crystal engineering and solid-state chemistry. 2,2'-(Disulfanediyl)dibenzoic acid (also called 2,2'-dithiosalicylic acid, DTSA) is able to form different hydrogen bonds using its carboxyl groups. The central bridging S atoms allow the two terminal arene rings to rotate freely to generate various hydrogen-bonded linking modes. DTSA can act as a potential host molecule with suitable guest molecules to develop new inclusion compounds. We report here the crystal structures of three new polymorphs of the inclusion compound of DTSA and trimethylamine, namely trimethylazanium 2-[(2-carboxyphenyl)disulfanyl]benzoate 2,2'-(disulfanediyl)dibenzoic acid monosolvate, C3H10N+·C14H9O4S2-·C14H10O4S2, (1), tetrakis(trimethylazanium) bis{2-[(2-carboxyphenyl)disulfanyl]benzoate} 2,2'-(disulfanediyl)dibenzoate 2,2'-(disulfanediyl)dibenzoic acid monosolvate, 4C3H10N+·2C14H9O4S2-·C14H8O4S22-·C14H10O4S2, (2), and trimethylazanium 2-[(2-carboxyphenyl)disulfanyl]benzoate, C3H10N+·C14H9O4S2-, (3). In the three polymorphs, DTSA utilizes its carboxyl groups to form conventional O-H...O hydrogen bonds to generate different host lattices. The central N atoms of the guest amine molecules accept H atoms from DTSA molecules to give the corresponding cations, which act as counter-ions to produce the stable crystal structures via N-H...O hydrogen bonding between the host acid and the guest molecule. It is noticeable that although these three compounds are composed of the same components, the final crystal structures are totally different due to the various configurations of the host acid, the number of guest molecules and the inducer (i.e. ancillary experimental acid).",

In the polymer, each ZnII ion exhibits an irregular octahedral ZnN2O4 coordination geometry and is coordinated by two N atoms from two symmetry-related bimt ligands and four O atoms from two symmetry-related dianionic adipate ligands. ZnII ions are connected by adipate ligands into a one-dimensional chain which runs parallel to the c axis. The bimt ligands coordinate to the ZnII ions in a monodentate mode on both sides of the main chain. In the crystal, the one-dimensional chains are further connected through N-H...O hydrogen bonds, leading to a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture. In addition, the title polymer exhibits fluorescence, with emissions at 334 and 350 nm in the solid state at room temperature.",

The wide choice of amino acids and coformers makes it possible to design various crystal structures. The amino acid-maleic acid system provides a perfect example of a rich variety of crystal structures with different stoichiometries, symmetries and packing motifs built from the molecular building blocks, which are either exactly the same, or differ merely by protonation or as optical isomers. The present paper reports the crystal structures of two new salts of the DL-norvaline-maleic acid system with 1:1 and 2:1 stoichiometries, namely DL-norvalinium hydrogen maleate, C5H12NO2+·C4H3O4-, (I), and DL-norvalinium hydrogen maleate-DL-norvaline, C5H12NO2+·C4H3O4-·C5H11NO2, (II). These are the first examples of molecular salts of DL-norvaline with an organic anion. The crystal structure of (I) has the same C22(12) structure-forming motif which is common for hydrogen maleates of amino acids. The structure of (II) has dimeric cations. Of special interest is that the single crystals of (I) which are originally formed on crystallization from aqueous solution transform into single crystals of (II) if stored in the mother liquor for several hours.",

    "abstract": "Notwithstanding its simple structure, the chemistry of nitric oxide (NO) is complex. As a radical, NO is highly reactive. NO also has profound effects on the cardiovascular system. In order to regulate NO levels, direct therapeutic interventions include the development of numerous NO donors. Most of these donors release NO in a single high-concentration burst, which is deleterious. N -Nitrosated secondary amines release NO in a slow, sustained, and rate-tunable manner. Two new precursors to sustained NO-releasing materials have been characterized. N -[2-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-2,4-dinitroaniline, C 16 H 17 N 3 O 6 , (I), crystallizes with one independent molecule in the asymmetric unit. The adjacent amine and nitro groups form an intramolecular N—H...O hydrogen bond. The anti conformation about the phenylethyl-to-aniline C—N bond leads to the planes of the arene and aniline rings being approximately perpendicular. Molecules are linked into dimers by weak intermolecular N—H...O hydrogen bonds such that each amine H atom participates in a three-center interaction with two nitro O atoms. The dimers pack so that the arene rings of adjacent molecules are not parallel and π–π interactions do not appear to be favored. N -(4-Methylsulfonyl-2-nitrophenyl)-L-phenylalanine, C 16 H 16 N 2 O 6 S, (II), with an optically active center, also crystallizes with one unique molecule in the asymmetric unit. The L enantiomer was established via the configuration of the starting material and was confirmed by refinement of the Flack parameter. As in (I), there is an intramolecular N—H...O hydrogen bond between adjacent amine and nitro groups. The conformation of the molecule is such that the arene rings display a dihedral angle of ca 60°. Unlike (I), molecules are not linked via intermolecular N—H...O hydrogen bonds. Rather, the carboxylic acid H atom forms a classic, approximately linear, O—H...O hydrogen bond with a sulfone O atom. Pairs of molecules related by twofold rotation axes are linked into dimers by two such interactions. The packing pattern features a zigzag arrangement of the arene rings without apparent π–π interactions. These structures are compared with reported analogues, revealing significant differences in molecular conformation, intermolecular interactions, and packing that result from modest changes in functional groups. The structures are discussed in terms of potential NO-release capability.",

The structural change consists of the loss of the two solvent water molecules linking the original two-dimensional covalent substructures which are the `main frame' of the monoclinic P 2/ n hydrate (strictly preserved during the transformation), with further reaccommodation of the latter. The anhydrate organizes itself in the orthorhombic system (space group Pmn 2 1 ) in a disordered fashion, where the space-group-symmetry restrictions are achieved only in a statistical sense, with mirror-related two-dimensional planar substructures, mirrored in a plane perpendicular to [100]. Thus, the asymmetric unit in the refined model is composed of two superimposed mirror-related `ghosts' of half-occupancy each. Similarities and differences with the parent dihydrate and some other related structures in the literature are discussed.",

In the supramolecular structure of (I), a two-dimensional network is constructed based on molecular dimers and a combination of intermolecular O-H···O, N-H···O and C-H···O hydrogen bonds, forming R2(2)(11), R2(2)(16), R2(2)(22) and C(9) motifs. These two-dimensional networks are connected by C-H···O and C-H···Cl contacts to create a three-dimensional framework, where one dichloromethane solvent molecule acts as a bridge between two neighbouring networks. In the packing of (II), classical hydrogen bonds are absent and an infinite one-dimensional chain is generated via a combination of C-H···O hydrogen bonds and C-H···π interactions, producing a C(7) motif.

In this context, the illustrative case of the carbamoylcyanonitrosomethanide anion, [ONC(CN)–C(O)NH 2 ] − , suggests sufficient control over the crystal lattice with a set of supramolecular synthons, which are specific to all the present nitroso, carbamoyl and cyano groups. The structures of the carbamoylcyanonitrosomethanide salts of ethane-1,2-diammonium, C 2 H 10 N 2 2+ ·2C 3 H 2 N 3 O 2 − , (1), piperazine-1,4-diium, C 4 H 12 N 2 2+ ·2C 3 H 2 N 3 O 2 − , (2), butane-1,4-diammonium, C 4 H 14 N 2 2+ ·2C 3 H 2 N 3 O 2 − , (3), and hexane-1,6-diammonium, C 6 H 18 N 2 2+ ·2C 3 H 2 N 3 O 2 − , (4), reveal two- and three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded frameworks governed by a set of site-selective interactions. The strongest N—H...O hydrogen bonds [N...O = 2.6842 (17)–2.8718 (17) Å, mean 2.776 (2) Å] are associated with the polarized ammonium N—H donors and nitroso O-atom acceptors, which sustain invariant motifs in the form of nitroso/ammonium dimers. Subtle structural changes within this series of compounds concern the rupture of some weaker interactions, i.e. mutual hydrogen bonds of the carbamoyl groups in (1)–(3) [N...O = 2.910 (2)–2.9909 (18) Å; mean 2.950 (2) Å] and carbamoyl/nitrile hydrogen bonds in (1), (2) and (4) [N...N = 2.936 (2)–3.003 (3) Å, mean 2.977 (2) Å], providing a gradual evolution of the hydrogen-bonding pattern. A hierarchy of the synthons involving three different groups could be applicable to supramolecular synthesis with polyfunctional methanide species, suggesting also a degree of control over layered and interpenetrated hydrogen-bonded networks.",

In the crystal, molecules are linked by C-H...O hydrogen bonds to form inversion dimers.

The molecular structure of I was determined by DFT calculations at the M062X/6-311+g(d) level of theory and compared with the crystallographically determined structure.

The sulfate group mimics the role of the carboxylate anions. The water molecules present in compounds (I)–(IV) form water-mediated large ring motifs. The formation of water-mediated interactions in these crystal structures can be used as a model in the study of the hydration of nucleobases. Water molecules play an important role in building supramolecular structures. In addition to these strong hydrogen-bonding interactions, some of the crystal structures are further enriched by aromatic π–π stacking interactions [(I) and (II)].",

This synthetic protocol is noteworthy for its utilization of stoichiometric amounts of the reactants, an ecofriendly solvent and a cost-effective, non-toxic and biodegradable organocatalyst. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular structure was gained through spectroscopic, thermal and X-ray crystallographic analyses. The crystal structure is characterized by weak interactions, where only C-H...π connections contribute to the hydrogen-bond contacts. The supramolecular assembly is controlled by dispersion forces. However, the energy frameworks demonstrate that these forces act in three dimensions, providing enough stability, as observed in TGA-DSC (thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry) studies.",

Sr 3 W 2 O 9 has a monoclinic unit cell of C 2/ c symmetry. One characteristic of the structure is the breaking of the threefold rotation symmetry existing in the high-pressure phase of Ba 3 W 2 O 9 . The substitution of Sr at the Ba site results in a significant shortening of the interlayer distances of the [ A O 3 ] layers ( A = Ba, Sr) and causes a distortion in the crystal structure. In Sr 3 W 2 O 9 , there is an off-centre displacement of W 6+ ions in the WO 6 octahedra. Such a displacement is also observed in the high-pressure phase of Ba 3 W 2 O 9 .",

In the title coordination polymer, the new bifunctional inversion-symmetric ligand 2,5-bis(1 H -1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)terephthalic acid (abbreviated as H 2 bttpa) links Cd II cations, giving rise to the three-dimensional Cd II coordination polymer catena -poly[diaqua[μ 4 -2,5-bis(1 H -1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)terephthalato-κ 4 O 1 : O 4 : N 4 : N 4′ ]cadmium(II)], [Cd(C 12 H 6 N 6 O 4 )(H 2 O) 2 ] n or [Cd(bttpa)(H 2 O) 2 ] n . The asymmetric unit consists of half a Cd II cation, half a bttpa 2− ligand and one coordinated water molecule. The Cd II cation is located on a twofold axis and is hexacoordinated in a distorted octahedral environment of four O and two N atoms. Four different bttpa 2− ligands contribute to this coordination, with two carboxylate O atoms in trans positions and two triazole N atoms in cis positions. Two aqua ligands in cis positions complete the coordination sphere. The fully deprotonated bttpa 2− ligand sits about a crystallographic centre of inversion and links two Cd II cations to form a chain in a μ 2 -terephthalato-κ 2 O 1 : O 4 bridge. This chain extends in the other two directions via the triazole heterocycles, producing a three-dimensional framework. O—H...O hydrogen bonds and weak C—H...N interactions stabilize the three-dimensional crystal structure. The FT–IR spectrum, X-ray powder pattern, thermogravimetric behaviour and solid-state photoluminescence of the title polymer have been investigated.

MOF I contains hexacoordinated Er 3+ cations which are distributed in a zigzag inorganic chain running parallel to the [100] direction of the unit cell.

The results show that all the derivatives adopt the same structural conformation, where the central ring has a shallow boat conformation and the outer rings have a twisted boat conformation. The intermolecular interactions in the molecules are predominantly O—H...O, C—H...O and π–π interactions. The optimized structures of the derivatives from theoretical B3LYP/6-311G** calculations show a good correlation with the experimental structures.

    "abstract": "The three binary Tb/Er-rich transition metal compounds Tb 3 Pd 2 (triterbium dipalladium), Er 3 Pd 2 (trierbium dipalladium) and Er 6 Co 5– x (hexaerbium pentacobalt) crystallize in the space groups Pbam (Pearson symbol oP 20), P 4/ mbm ( tP 10) and P 6 3 / m ( hP 22), respectively. Single crystals of Tb 3 Pd 2 and Er 6 Co 5– x suitable for X-ray structure analysis were obtained using rare-earth halides as a flux. Tb 3 Pd 2 adopts its own structure type, which can be described as a superstructural derivative of the U 3 Si 2 type, which is the type adopted by Er 3 Pd 2 . Compound Er 6 Co 5– x belongs to the Ce 6 Co 2– x Si 3 family. All three compounds feature fused tricapped { TR 6 } ( R = rare-earth metal and T = transition metal) trigonal prismatic heterometallic clusters. R 3 Pd 2 is reported to crystallize in the U 3 Si 2 type; however, our more detailed structure analysis reveals that deviations occur with heavier R elements. Similarly, Er 6 Co 5– x was assumed to be stoichiometric Er 4 Co 3 = Er 6 Co 4.5 . Our studies reveal that it has a single defective transition-metal site leading to the composition Er 6 Co 4.72(2) . LMTO (linear muffin-tin orbital)-based electronic structure calculations suggest the strong domination of heteroatomic bonding in all three structures.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, coordination polymers constructed from multidentate carboxylate and pyridyl ligands have attracted much attention because these ligands can adopt a rich variety of coordination modes and thus lead to the formation of crystalline products with intriguing structures and interesting properties. A new coordination polymer, namely poly[[μ 2 -1,6-bis(pyridin-3-yl)-1,3,5-hexatriene-κ 2 N : N ′](μ 3 -naphthalene-1,4-dicarboxylato-κ 4 O 1 , O 1′ : O 4 : O 4′ )zinc(II)], [Zn(C 12 H 6 O 4 )(C 16 H 14 N 2 )] n , has been prepared by the self-assembly of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O, naphthalene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (1,4-H 2 ndc) and 1,6-bis(pyridin-3-yl)-1,3,5-hexatriene (3,3′-bphte) under hydrothermal conditions. The title compound has been structurally characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Each Zn II ion is six-coordinated by four O atoms from three 1,4-ndc 2− ligands and by two N atoms from two 3,3′-bphte ligands, forming a distorted octahedral ZnO 4 N 2 coordination geometry. Pairs of Zn II ions are linked by 1,4-ndc 2− ligands, leading to the formation of a two-dimensional square lattice ( sql ) layer extending in the ab plane. In the crystal, adjacent layers are further connected by 3,3′-bphte bridges, generating a three-dimensional architecture. From a topological viewpoint, if each dinuclear zinc unit is considered as a 6-connected node and the 1,4-ndc 2− and 3,3′-bphte ligands are regarded as linkers, the structure can be simplified as a unique three-dimensional 6-connected framework with the point symbol 4 4 6 10 8. The thermal stability and solid-state photoluminescence properties have also been investigated.",

    "abstract": "Structures are reported for eight Schiff bases derived from various salicylaldehydes: five are newly synthesized and re-investigations are reported for three previously reported structures, leading, in each case, to some revision of previous conclusions. In (E)-N-(3,4-dimethylisoxazol-5-yl)-4-[(2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino]benzenesulfonamide, C18H17N3O4S, (I), and (E)-4-[(5-bromo-2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)amino]-N-(3,4-dimethylisoxazol-5-yl)benzenesulfonamide. C19H18BrN3O5S, (II), the isoxazole rings adopt different orientations relative to the rest of the molecules, despite the additional substituents in (II) being in the aryl ring remote from the isoxazole unit. The molecules of both (E)-4-bromo-2-[(2-hydroxyphenylimino)methyl]-6-methoxyphenol, C14H12BrNO3, (III), and (E)-4-bromo-2-methoxy-6-[(2-methoxyphenylimino)methyl]phenol, C15H14BrNO3, (IV), are both effectively planar; while (III) adopts the phenol-imine constitution, (IV) adopts the keto-amine constitution. (E)-2-Methoxy-6-[(2-methoxyphenylimino)methyl]phenol, C15H15NO3, (V), which was determined previously using powder X-ray data assuming the phenol-imine constitution, has now been refined from single-crystal X-ray data, confirming the phenol-imine constitution. In (E)-3-benzoyl-2-[(5-fluoro-2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene, C22H18FNO2S, (VI), the fused carbocyclic ring exhibits conformational disorder; both disorder components, having populations of 0.705 (4) and 0.295 (4), adopt half-chair conformations. The isostructural (E)-3-benzoyl-2-[(2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino)]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene, C22H19NO2S, (VII), which was originally reported as having a fully ordered structure [Kaur et al. (2014). Acta Cryst. E70, o476-o477], has been rerefined using the original data set and found to exhibit the same type of disorder as found in (VI), with disordered populations having occupancies of 0.851 (3) and 0.149 (3). The triclinic polymorph of (E)-[(2-hydroxyphenylimino)methyl]phenol, C13H11NO2, (VIII), which crystallizes with Z' = 2 in the space group P-1, has been described variously as occurring as the keto-amine tautomer [Maciejewska et al. (1999). J. Phys. Org. Chem. 12, 875-880] and as the phenol-imine tautomer [Tunç et al. (2009). J. Chem. Crystallogr. 39, 672-676]. Rerefinement of this structure using one of the original data sets shows that both of the independent molecules exist in the keto-amine form. In the structures of compounds (I), (VI), (VII) and (VIII), hydrogen bonds generate simple chains, while a chain of rings is formed in (V). Sheets are formed by hydrogen bonds in both (II) and (III), while in (IV), the sheet structure is built from aromatic π-π stacking interactions.",

We herein report a determination of the molecular and crystal structures of the title tetrahydrated salt, 2Na+·C10H12N5O8P2-·4H2O. It was found that the structure differs markedly from that of the heptahydrate, but greatly resembles that of disodium deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate tetrahydrate. The C2'-O2'H moiety of ribose is surrounded by hydrophilic moieties and is disordered over two sites. The sugar puckering mode is O4'-endo-C1'-exo at both sites and the conformation around the C4'-C5' bond is gauche-trans. Powder X-ray diffraction and thermal analyses revealed that the temperature-controlled transition from the tetrahydrate to the anhydride proceeded through three intermediate phases between 40 and 60 °C at 0% relative humidity. Large induction periods were observed.",

It is obvious that in the formation of crystalline Cu-Mo6O20, the original Anderson-type skeleton of heteropolymolybdate CoMo6 was broken and the new isopolyhexamolybdate Mo6O20 unit was assembled. In Cu-Mo6O20, one Mo6O20 unit connects four [Cu(H2biim)(H2O)]2+ ions in a pentacoordinate mode via four terminal O atoms, resulting in a tetra-supported structure, and each CuII ion is shared by two adjacent Mo6O20 units. Infinite one-dimensional chains are established by linkage between two adjacent Mo6O20 units and two CuII ions, and these chains are further packed into a three-dimensional framework by hydrogen bonds, π-π interactions and electrostatic attractions. The catalytic performance of this crystalline material used as an efficient and reusable heterogeneous acid catalyst for carbonyl-group protection is discussed. In addition, Cu-Mo6O20 was applied as a new support for enzyme (horseradish peroxidase, HRP) immobilization, forming immobilized enzyme HRP/Cu-Mo6O20. HRP/Cu-Mo6O20 showed good catalytic activity and could be reused.",

The packing is stabilized by π–π stacking interactions involving one of the five-membered Se/C/C/C/O rings [centroid–centroid ( Cg ... Cg ) distance = 3.6472 (18) Å and slippage = 1.361 Å], as well as C—H...π interactions involving a C—H group and the phenyl ring. In addition, there are bifurcated C—H...Se,O interactions which link the molecules into ribbons in the c direction. For 15 , the C—Se bond lengths are longer than those of 14 . The two five-membered rings are coplanar. There are no π–π or C—H...π interactions; however, molecules are linked by C—H...O interactions into centrosymmetric dimers, with graph-set notation R 2 2 (16).",

Their structures were characterized by elemental analysis, quadrupole time-of-flight MS, NMR and UV–Vis spectroscopy. The single-crystal packing structure of 3-BEHMI is largely dominated by C—H...π interactions and weak van der Waals interactions. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the two title compounds have been evaluated against two tumour cell lines (A549 human lung cancer and 4T 1 mouse breast cancer) and two normal cell lines (MRC-5 normal lung cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts) by MTT assay. The results indicate that 3-BEHEI exhibits a slightly weaker antiproliferative capability (IC 50 = ∼50 µ M ) than the previously reported similar Schiff base 3-BEHI (IC 50 = ∼20 µ M ). This is in line with docking results. 3-BEHMI demonstrates a weak cytotoxic activity, with IC 50 values around 110 µ M , which disagrees with its docking results. Overall, the tested compounds manifest relevant cytotoxicities on the selected cancer cell lines and normal cell lines. The UV–Vis and fluorescence spectra were recorded and reproduced through the TD-DFT method with four types of hybrid density functionals, including B3LYP, M062X, PBE1PBE and WB97XD.",

In particular, the optical and electrical properties of organic-inorganic hybrid lead halides are typical of the OHP family. Besides, although three-dimensional hybrid perovskites, such as [CH3NH3]PbX3 (X = Cl, Br or I), have been reported, the development of new organic-inorganic hybrid semiconductors is still an area in urgent need of exploration. Here, an organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite is reported, namely poly[(2-azaniumylethyl)trimethylphosphanium [tetra-μ-bromido-plumbate(II)]], {(C5H16NP)[PbBr4]}n, in which an organic cation is embedded in inorganic two-dimensional (2D) mesh layers to produce a sandwich structure. This unique sandwich 2D hybrid perovskite material shows an indirect band gap of ∼2.700 eV. The properties of this compound as a semiconductor are demonstrated by a series of optical characterizations and indicate potential applications for optical devices.",

No phase transitions occurred in this temperature range. The anisotropy of the thermal expansion was different for the two polymorphs and differed from that reported previously for the hydrostatic compression. The changes in different intermolecular contacts responsible for the strain anisotropy were analysed. Relative shortening of the contacts was related directly to their initial length and reversely to the steric density around them. Increasing steric density is likely to be the driving force for the conformational ordering of the azepane ring under compression.",

In all cases, the structures obtained were solvates with dimethylformamide (DMF) and/or water present. The disulfonated naphthalene-based azo anions adopt hydrazone tautomeric forms. The structures of the Mg salt and of four transition-metal forms (M = Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) of PX are found to form an isostructural series. All have solvent-separated ion-pair (SSIP) type structures and the formula [M(H2O)6][PX]·DMF. The Ca salt of PX also has an SSIP structure, but has a higher hydration state, [Ca(H2O)7][PX]·2.5H2O. In contrast, the Sr salt of PX, [Sr(PX)(DMF)2(H2O)0.5]n forms a one-dimensional coordination polymer. Both the Ca and the Sr salt of CS have an SSIP structure, namely [Ca(H2O)7][CS]·H2O and [Sr(H2O)8][CS]·H2O, whilst the heavier Ba analogue, [Ba(CS)(DMF)(H2O)3]n, forms a one-dimensional coordination polymer. Unlike PX, two CS structures containing transition metals are found to be coordination complexes, [Cu(CS)(DMF)4]·H2O and {[Zn(CS)(DMF)3(H2O)]·0.5Et2O}n. This suggests that CS is a better ligand than PX for transition metals. The Cu complex forms discrete molecules with Cu in a square-pyramidal environment, whilst the Zn species is a one-dimensional coordination polymer based on octahedral Zn centres.",

The inspection of these polymorphs and a previously known polymorph with Z ′ = 2 revealed that Z ′ increases as the strength of intermolecular contacts decreases. Also, these results expand the frontier of invoking calixarenes as a host for nonsolvent small molecules, besides providing knowledge on the rare formation of high- Z ′ packing polymorphs of simple molecules, such as the target benzothiazole.",

One of them is a new polymorph, β-KYN·H2O, of the already known KYN monohydrate. All crystal species were further studied by single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, thermal and spectroscopic methods. In addition to the above methods, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), in-situ variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction and Raman microscopy were applied to characterize the phase behaviour of the new forms. All the compounds display a zwitterionic form of KYN and two different enol-keto tautomers are observed depending on the crystallization solvent used.",

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that CP 1 possesses a cationic linear chain structure consisting of alternating cyanide-bridged Fe–Mn units, with free perchlorate as the charge-balancing anion, which can be further extended into a two-dimensional supramolecular sheet structure via inter-chain π–π interactions between the 4,4′-bipyridine ligands. Within the chain, each Mn II ion is six-coordinated by an N 6 unit and is involved in a slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry. Investigation of the magnetic properties of 1 reveals an antiferromagnetic coupling between the cyanide-bridged Fe III and Mn II ions. A best fit of the magnetic susceptibility based on the one-dimensional alternating chain model leads to the magnetic coupling constants J 1 = −1.35 and J 2 = −1.05 cm −1 , and the antiferromagnetic coupling was further confirmed by spin Hamiltonian-based density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations.",

Recently, imidazole-containing multidentate ligands have received much attention. Two new Cd II coordination frameworks, namely, poly[tris{μ-1,4-bis[(1 H -imidazol-1-yl)methyl]benzene-κ 2 N 3 : N 3′ }tetrakis(nitrato-κ 2 O , O ′)dicadmium], [Cd 2 (NO 3 ) 4 (C 14 H 14 N 4 ) 3 ] n , (I), and poly[[bis{μ 3 -1,3,5-tris[(1 H -imidazol-1-yl)methyl]benzene-κ 3 N 3 : N 3′ : N 3′′ }cadmium] hexafluorosilicate], {[Cd(C 18 H 18 N 6 ) 2 ](SiF 6 )} n , (II), have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In polymer (I), the 1,4-bis[(1 H -imidazol-1-yl)methyl]benzene ligand bridges Cd 2+ ions with a distorted seven-coordinated pentagonal bipyramidal geometry, forming a one-dimensional ladder chain, and the nitrate anions coordinate to the Cd 2+ ions in a terminal bidentate fashion. In the crystal, adjacent chains are further connected by C—H...O hydrogen bonds to generate a two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular structure. Polymer (II) exhibits a 2D layered structure in which 1,3,5-tris[(1 H -imidazol-1-yl)methyl] benzene ligands join Cd 2+ centres having a six-coordinated octahedral structure. The layers are connected by hexafluorosilicate anions via C—H...F hydrogen-bond interactions, giving rise to a three-dimensional supramolecular network structure in the solid state. In addition, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) carried out and fluorescence properties investigated.",

The energy framework analysis, together with interaction energy calculations using the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method, indicates that the TNZ – VA cocrystal inherits strong interactions from the TNZ and VA crystals, which accounts for the enhanced thermal stability and reduced dissolution rate.

The complexes were characterized by single-crystal X-ray and powder diffraction, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). All the structures of this family of lanthanide CPs are isomorphous with the triclinic space group P \\overline{1} and reveal that they have the same 2D network based on binuclear Ln III units, which are further extended via interlayer C—H...π interactions into a three-dimensional supramolecular structure. The carboxylate groups of the cpboda 3− ligands link adjacent Ln III ions and form binuclear [Ln 2 ( R COO) 4 ] secondary building units (SBUs), in which each binuclear Ln III SBU contains four carboxylate groups from different cpboda 3− ligands. Moreover, with the increase of the rare-earth Ln atomic radius, the dihedral angles between the aromatic rings gradually increase. Magnetically, CP6 shows weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the Gd III ions. The solid-state luminescence properties of CP2 , CP5 and CP6 were examined at ambient temperature and CP5 exhibits characteristic red emission bands derived from the Eu 3+ ion (CIE 0.53, 0.31), with luminescence quantum yields of 22%.

The crystal structure was solved and refined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. By strict definition, the title compound crystallizes in the stannite structure type; however, this type of structure can also be described as a compressed chalcopyrite-like structure. The Li + cation lies on a crystallographic fourfold rotoinversion axis, while the Pb 2+ and Si 4+ cations reside at the intersection of the fourfold rotoinversion axis with a twofold axis and a mirror plane. The Li + and Si 4+ cations in this structure are tetrahedrally coordinated, while the larger Pb 2+ cation adopts a distorted eight-coordinate dodecahedral coordination. These units join together via corner- and edge-sharing to create a dense, three-dimensional structure. Powder X-ray diffraction indicates that the title compound is the major phase of the reaction product. Electronic structure calculations, performed using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method within density functional theory (DFT), indicate that Li 2 PbSiS 4 is a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 2.22 eV, which compares well with the measured optical bandgap of 2.51 eV. The noncentrosymmetric crystal structure and relatively wide bandgap designate this compound to be of interest for IR nonlinear optics.",

Acta Cryst. B36, 2977-2985; our structure determination of phase (I) at room temperature is included in the supporting information]. In the high-temperature phase, the Ba2+ cation is surrounded by six carboxylate groups in bidentate bridging modes. In the low-temperature phases, five carboxylate groups act in bidentate bridging modes and one acts in a monodentate bridging mode around Ba2+. The Ca2+ cations are surrounded by six carboxylate O atoms in a trigonal antiprism in all the structures. The Ba2+ and Ca2+ cations are underbonded and significantly overbonded, respectively, in all the phases. The bonding of the Ba2+ cation increases slightly at the cost of the bonding of Ca2+ cations during cooling to the low-temperature phases. The phase transitions during cooling are accompanied by ordering of the ethyl chains. In room-temperature phase (I), all six ethyl chains are positionally disordered over two positions in the crossed mode, with additional splitting of the ethyl α- and β-C atoms. In phase (II), on the other hand, there are three disordered ethyl chains, one with positionally disordered ethyl α- and β-C atoms, and the other two with positionally disordered ethyl β-C atoms only, and in the lowest-temperature phase (III) there are four ordered ethyl chains and two disordered ethyl chains with positionally disordered ethyl β-C atoms only.",

    "abstract": "The study of various forms of pharmaceutical substances with specific physicochemical properties suitable for putting them on the market is one of the elements of research in the pharmaceutical industry. A large proportion of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) occur in the salt form. The use of an acidic coformer with a given structure and a suitable p K a value towards purine alkaloids containing a basic imidazole N atom can lead to salt formation. In this work, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (26DHBA) was used for cocrystallization of theobromine (TBR) and caffeine (CAF). Two novel salts, namely, theobrominium 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate, C 7 H 9 N 4 O 2 + ·C 7 H 5 O 4 − ( I ), and caffeinium 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate, C 8 H 11 N 4 O 2 + ·C 7 H 5 O 4 − ( II ), were synthesized. Both salts were obtained independently by slow evaporation from solution, by neat grinding and also by microwave-assisted slurry cocrystallization. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements proved the formation of the new substances. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed proton transfer between the given alkaloid and 26DHBA, and the formation of N—H...O hydrogen bonds in both I and II . Unlike the caffeine cations in II , the theobromine cations in I are paired by noncovalent N—H...O=C interactions and a cyclic array is observed. As expected, the two hydroxy groups in the 26DHBA anion in both salts are involved in two intramolecular O—H...O hydrogen bonds. C—H...O and π–π interactions further stabilize the crystal structures of both compounds. Steady-state UV–Vis spectroscopy showed changes in the water solubility of xanthines after ionizable complex formation. The obtained salts I and II were also characterized by theoretical calculations, Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy (FT–IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and elemental analysis.",

Dissolution of LiCl or LiPF6 in pyridine (py) or vinylpyridine (VnPy) and slow vapor diffusion with diethyl ether gives solvates of the lithium salts coordinated by pyridine ligands.

    "abstract": "Crown ethers and their supramolecular derivatives are well-known chelators and scavengers for a variety of cations, most notably heavier alkali and alkaline-earth ions. Although they are widely used in synthetic chemistry, available crystal structures of uncoordinated and solvent-free crown ethers regularly suffer from disorder. In this study, we present the X-ray crystal structure analysis of well-ordered solvent-free crystals of dibenzo-21-crown-7 (systematic name: dibenzo[ b , k ]-1,4,7,10,13,16,19-heptaoxacycloheneicosa-2,11-diene, C 22 H 28 O 7 ). Because of the quality of the crystal and diffraction data, we have chosen invarioms, in addition to standard independent spherical atoms, for modelling and briefly discuss the different refinement results. The electrostatic potential, which is directly deducible from the invariom model, and the Hirshfeld surface are analysed and complemented with interaction-energy computations to characterize intermolecular contacts. The boat-like molecules stack along the a axis and are arranged as dimers of chains, which assemble as rows to form a three-dimensional structure. Dispersive C—H...H—C and C—H...π interactions dominate, but nonclassical hydrogen bonds are present and reflect the overall rather weak electrostatic influence. A fingerprint plot of the Hirshfeld surface summarizes and visualizes the intermolecular interactions. The insight gained into the crystal structure of dibenzo-21-crown-7 not only demonstrates the power of invariom refinement, Hirshfeld surface analysis and interaction-energy computation, but also hints at favourable conditions for crystallizing solvent-free crown ethers.",

Three molecules are present in the asymmetric unit, two of them being nearly identical (r.m.s. deviation = 0.11 Å), with the Fe atoms on the same side of the anhydride functional group. In the third molecule, the two Fe atoms are located at opposite sides of the functional group (ferrocene–ferrocene pseudo-torsion angle = 146.2°), a very unsual feature in metallocene anhydrides. A network of weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds was also disclosed.",

    "abstract": "In the development of coordination-driven crystalline materials, O- and N-atom donors from carboxylate and pyridyl-based ligands are widely used classes of multidentate bridging ligands composed of several terminal coordinating groups linked by either rigid or flexible spacers. The rigidity of the ligands can play a vital role in the determination of the structures formed. A new Cd II supramolecular compound, namely poly[μ-adipato-κ 2 O 1 : O 4 -μ-adipato-κ 4 O 1 , O 1′ : O 4 , O 4′ -diaquabis[μ-1,4-bis(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3-butadiene-κ 2 N : N ′]dicadmium(II)], [Cd 2 (C 6 H 8 O 4 ) 2 (C 14 H 12 N 2 ) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] n , (I), has been synthesized by the self-assembly of Cd(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O, adipic acid (hexane-1,6-dioic acid; H 2 adp) and the dipyridyl ligand 1,4-bis(pyridin-4-yl)buta-1,3-diene (1,4-bpbd) under hydrothermal conditions. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that each Cd II centre is located in a distorted octahedral coordination environment, coordinated by one water O atom, three carboxylate O atoms from two different adp 2− ligands and two N atoms from two different 1,4-bpbd ligands. The Cd(H 2 O) units are interconnected by the μ 2 ,κ 2 -adp 2− , μ 2 ,κ 4 -adp 2− and 1,4-bpbd ligands, which lie across centres of inversion, to give a 6 6 - dia network. Large cavities within a single diamondoid network permit the mutual threefold interpenetration of crystallographically equivalent frameworks. Hydrogen-bonding interactions between the coordinated water molecules and adp 2− carboxylate O atoms anchor the interpenetrating networks into a unique three-dimensional supramolecular structure. Topologically, taking the coordinated water molecules and Cd II centres as nodes, the whole architecture can be simplified as a binodal (3,7)-connected supramolecular framework. The identity of (I) was further characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and powder X-ray diffraction. The solid-state photoluminescence properties of (I) were also investigated.",

    "abstract": "Benzothiazole derivatives are a class of privileged molecules due to their biological activity and pharmaceutical applications. One route to these molecules is via intramolecular cyclization of thioureas to form substituted 2-aminobenzothiazoles, but this often requires harsh conditions or employs expensive metal catalysts. Herein, the copper(II)- and gold(III)-mediated cyclizations of thioureas to substituted 2-aminobenzothiazoles are reported. The single-crystal X-ray structures of the thiourea N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-N'-(pyridin-2-yl)thiourea, C13H13N3OS, and the intermediate metal complexes aquabis[5-methoxy-N-(pyridin-2-yl-κN)-1,3-benzothiazol-2-amine-κN3]copper(II) dinitrate, [Cu(C13H11N3OS)2(H2O)](NO3)2, and bis{2-[(5-methoxy-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)amino]pyridin-1-ium} dichloridogold(I) chloride monohydrate, (C13H12N3OS)2[AuCl2]Cl·H2O, are reported. The copper complex exhibits a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry, with direct metal-to-benzothiazole-ligand coordination, while the gold complex is a salt containing the protonated uncoordinated benzothiazole, and offers evidence that metal reduction (in this case, AuIII to AuI) is required for the cyclization to proceed. As such, this study provides further mechanistic insight into the role of the metal cations in these transformations.",

The sequence starts with simple commercially available indoles and proceeds via 3-(indol-3-yl)-3-oxopropanenitriles, which react with 2-bromobenzaldehyde to form the corresponding chalcones; these are readily reduced to dihydrochalcones, which are in turn acylated to form the enolate esters.

The number of molecules in the asymmetric unit of each crystal structure ( Z ′) was found to be two for I and II, and one for III, making I and II isostructural and III unique. The difference between the molecules in the asymmetric units of I and II is due to the direction of the hydrogen bond of the alcohol group to a neighboring molecule. Molecular packing shows that each structure has alternating layers of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and halogen–halogen interactions. Hirshfeld surfaces and two-dimensional fingerprint plots were analyzed to further explore the intermolecular interactions of these structures. In I and II, energy minimization is achieved by lowering of the symmetry to adopt two independent molecular conformations in the asymmetric unit.",

The slightly longer Re—P distance of 1 [2.4987 (5) versus 2.4799 (11) Å for 1 and 2 , respectively] suggests stronger back donation from the carbonyl groups in the former case, possibly due to the stronger electron-donating ability of the unsubstituted tropolonate ring system.

    "abstract": "This article describes a series of more than 20 new compounds formed by the combination of 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid (H 4 thba) with metal ions in the presence of a base, with structures that include discrete molecular units, chains, and two- and three-dimensional networks. As a result of the presence of two ortho -hydroxy groups, H 4 thba is a relatively strong acid (p K a1 = 1.68). The carboxylate group in H 3 thba − is therefore considerably less basic than most carboxylates with intramolecular hydrogen bonds, conferring a rigid planar geometry upon the anion. These characteristics of H 3 thba − significantly impact upon the way it interacts with metal ions. In s -block metal compounds, where the interaction of the metal centres with the carboxylate O atoms is essentially ionic, the anion bonds to up to three metal centres via a variety of binding modes. In cases where the metal ion is able to form directional coordinate bonds, however, the carboxylate group tends to bond in a monodentate mode, interacting with just one metal centre in the syn mode. A dominant influence on the structures of the complexes seems to be the face-to-face stacking of the aromatic rings, which creates networks containing layers of metal–oxygen polyhedra that participate in hydrogen bonding. This investigation was undertaken, in part, by a group of secondary school students as an educational exercise designed to introduce school students to the technique of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and enhance their understanding of primary and secondary bonding.",

The topological analysis of the electron-density distribution has been performed using AIMAll and TOPOND, and unequivocally establishes the bonding character associated with the different noncovalent interactions.

    "abstract": "Guanidine is the functional group on the side chain of arginine, one of the fundamental building blocks of life. In recent years, a number of compounds based on the aminoguanidine (AG) moiety have been described as presenting high anticancer activities. The product of condensation between two molecules of AG and one molecule of formaldehyde was isolated in the protonated form as the dinitrate salt (systematic name: 2,8-diamino-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaazanona-1,8-diene-1,9-diium dinitrate), C3H14N82+·2NO3-, (I). The cation lacks crystallographically imposed symmetry and comprises two terminal planar guanidinium groups, which share an N-C-N unit. Each cation in (I) builds 14 N-H...O hydrogen bonds and is separated from adjacent cations by seven nitrate anions. The AG self-condensation reaction in the presence of copper(II) chloride and chloride anions led to the formation of the organic-inorganic hybrid 1,2-bis(diaminomethylidene)hydrazine-1,2-diium tetrachloridocuprate(II), (C2H10N6)[CuCl4], (II). Its asymmetric unit is composed of half a diprotonated 1,2-bis(diaminomethylidene)hydrazine-1,2-diium dication and half a tetrachloridocuprate(II) dianion, with the CuII atom situated on a twofold rotation axis. The planar guanidinium fragments in (II) have their planes twisted by approximately 77.64 (5)° with respect to each other. The tetrahedral [CuCl4]2- anion is severely distorted and its pronounced `planarity' must originate from its involvement in multiple N-H...Cl hydrogen bonds. It was reported that [CuCl4]2- anions, with a trans-Cl-Cu-Cl angle (Θ) of ∼140°, are yellow-green at room temperature, with the colour shifting to a deeper green as Θ increases and toward orange as Θ decreases. Brown salt (II), with a Θ value of 142.059 (8)°, does not fit the trend, which emphasizes the need to take other structural factors into consideration. In the crystal of salt (II), layers of cations and anions alternate along the b axis, with the minimum Cu...Cu distance being 7.5408 (3) Å inside a layer. The structures of salts (I) and (II) were substantiated via spectroscopic data. The endothermic reaction involved in the thermal decomposition of (I) requires additional oxygen. The title salts may be useful for the screening of new substances with biological activity.",

Of the eight crystal forms of naltrexone known thus far, only one exists in the neutral form and it crystallizes as a monohydrate. We have isolated the naltrexone free base as two new solvate forms, i.e. the ethyl acetate 0.33-solvate, C 20 H 23 NO 4 ·0.33C 4 H 8 O 2 , (I), and the diethyl ether hemisolvate, C 20 H 23 NO 4 ·0.5C 4 H 10 O, (II). While just one solvent molecule is present in the asymmetric unit of each solvate, there are three drug molecules ( Z ′ = 3) in ethyl acetate solvate (I) and two ( Z ′ = 2) in diethyl ether solvate (II). In (I), one of the three crystallographically independent drug molecules is present with its cyclopropyl group disordered over two sets of positions, as is the whole diethyl ether solvent molecule in (II). In all known forms, including the title forms, the naltrexone molecule exhibits the same conformation of the fused rings. The only conformational variability of naltrexone is in the cyclopropylmethyl group. Two conformations can be found around the bond connecting this group to the N-heterocycle, which is directly related to drug protonation. We have calculated, at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory, the minimum energy conformations of protonated and neutral naltrexone molecules for a chosen torsion angle about this bond. The lowest energy conformers depend on the protonation state and are in agreement with those found in the solid state. Within the cyclopropylmethyl group, the bond joining the methylene C atom to the cyclopropyl fragment also evidences conformational variability. In the literature, there are two well defined conformations around this bond. A third cyclopropyl conformation around this second bond is observed in the title solvates. Concerning the supramolecular features of the previously reported crystal structures, only one classical hydrogen bond between naltrexone molecules and one C (8) homosynthon is known, pointing to the robustness of this synthon and the difficulty in disrupting it. New R 2 2 (7) and C 2 2 (10) homosynthons are found in both (I) and (II), suggesting that their occurrence derives from crystallization of the neutral drug from nonpolar solvents.",

    "abstract": "Due to their rich structural chemistry and wide variety of applications, borate materials have provided a rich area of research. In a continuation of this research, diethylammonium bis(2-oxidobenzoato-κ2O1,O2)borate, C4H12N+·BO4(C7H4O)2-, (1), and propylammonium bis(2-oxidobenzoato-κ2O1,O2)borate, C3H10N+·BO4(C7H4O)2-, (2), have been synthesized by the reaction of boric acid with salicylic acid under ambient conditions. In both structures, the B atom exhibits a slightly distorted tetrahedral environment formed by the bidentate coordination of two salicylate anions via the O atoms of the central carboxylate and oxide groups. In the crystals of salts (1) and (2), mixed cation-anion layers lying parallel to the (101) plane are formed through N-H...O, C-H...O and C-H...π/N-H...O hydrogen-bonding interactions, resulting, in each case, in a two-dimensional supramolecular architecture in the solid state. The photoluminescence properties of the salts were studied using the as-synthesized samples and reveal that salts (1) and (2) both display a strong blue-light emission, with maxima at 489 and 491 nm, respectively. In DFT/TD-DFT (time-dependent density functional theory) studies, the blue emission appears to be derived from an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) excited state. In addition, IR and UV-Vis spectroscopies were used to investigate the title salts.",

The UV–Vis absorption spectra, thermal stabilities and photoluminescence spectra of the title complexes have also been studied. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD–DFT) calculations reveal that the low-energy UV absorption and the corresponding light emission both result from halide-ligand charge-transfer (XLCT) excited states.",

This difference in the chirality sequence among the title structures (in spite of the fact that the three skeletons are absolutely isostructural) is due to the differences in the environment of site 8, i.e. OH in ( II ) and H in ( III ) and ( IV ). This diversity in substitution, in turn, is responsible for the differences in the hydrogen-bonding schemes, which is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The completely revised third edition of this book by Garrison Sposito reflects the latest insights in the field and is a welcome update for those who want to have a fundamental insight into the processes in soils, insight which is needed to safeguard the crucial role of soils for life on earth.The first four chapters describe the components of soil, namely soil minerals, humus, gas and the soil solution.Chapter 1, The Composition of Soils, gives an introduction to the components of soil and reader's attention is drawn to the natural capital of the soil.According to the author, 'the critical assets derive primarily from three fundamental soil properties: texture, mineralogy and humus'.Chapter 2, Soil Minerals, describes nicely how soil minerals form, the structure of the minerals and how this determines their stability against weathering.Furthermore, the retention of ions by clay and metal oxide minerals is discussed.Chapter 3, Soil Humus, has been completely rewritten from previous editions and treats soil humus according to the new view on organic matter, of which the author has been one of the pioneers.Humification of plant and animal litter is described as an analogue to the weathering of minerals, and humus is seen as complex mixtures of identifiable molecules that can be attributed to their litter sources rather than considering the operationally defined fractions, including humin, humic and fulvic acids, to be unique new macromolecular compounds according to the classical view which is totally discarded here.Chapter 4, The Soil Solution, starts with a discussion of the methods used for sampling the soil solution.This is followed by descriptions of complex formation in the soil solution and the calculation method of chemical speciation.In this chapter, I, however, missed an explicit discussion of metal complexes with organic ligands which play a very important role in metal speciation.In the following chapters, the important chemical processes in soil, viz.mineral weathering, oxidation-reduction reactions, adsorption and ion-exchange, are discussed, together with a chapter on soil-particle surface charge and a chapter on soil colloids.These subjects are discussed thoroughly from a physical chemical perspective and give clear insights into the processes.Chapter 5, Mineral Weathering, first describes the mechanism of mineral weathering followed by mineral-weathering sequences.The chapter concludes with a section on phosphate transformations in calcareous soils and its implications on phosphate availability.Chapter 6, Oxidation-Reduction Reactions, describes the principles of redox reactions on the basis of the most relevant redox processes occurring in flooded soils and their sequence from oxidized to more and more reduced systems, which is known as the redox ladder.Finally, the construction of pE-pH diagrams is explained.In Chapter 7, Soil Particle Surface Charge, the concepts of structural charge due to the structural defects in minerals, and surface charge due to the adsorption of ions at the soil particle-water interface are discussed, together with various definitions for the 'point of zero charge', which is the pH at which the surface charge due to adsorption or desorption is zero.Chapter 8, Soil Adsorption Phenomena, deals mainly with the adsorption of both cationic and anionic species to soils.Adsorption of organic molecules is also discussed.",

The colour of both crystals was orange, but the shapes, as well as the orientation of the p -cymene and methoxycarbonyl groups, were different. The crystal structures of both isomers show approximately the same bond lengths. In the asymmetric unit, there is one cation and one anion. Due to the absence of strong hydrogen bonds, only weak intermolecular interactions were observed. The Hirshfeld surface and two-dimensional fingerprint plots of both isomers satisfactorily explain the difference in the melting points.",

The mzpy and 3bpmu ligands bridge the Cd II metal centres in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) into one-dimensional chains, and the ATBIP 2− ligands show a monodentate coordination to the Cd II centres in both coordination polymers. A discrete water tetramer exists in ( 1 ). Within the chains of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ), there are halogen bonds between adjacent ATBIP 2− and mzpy or 3bpmu ligands, as well as hydrogen bonds between the ATBIP 2− ligands and the coordinated water molecules. With the aid of weak interactions, the structures of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are further extended into three-dimensional supramolecular networks. An analysis of the solid-state diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectra of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) indicates that a wide indirect band gap exists in both complexes. Complexes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) exhibit irreversible and reversible dehydration–rehydration behaviours, respectively, and the solid-state fluorescence properties of both complexes have been studied.",

Structural peculiarities of homoleptic tris(iminophenoxide)s ( 1 )–( 3 ), binuclear tris(iminophenoxide) ( 4 ) and homoleptic ate tetrakis(iminophenoxide) ( 5 ) are discussed. The nonflat Schiff base ligand displays μ 2 -κ 3 O 1 , N , O 2 :κ O 1 bridging, and κ 3 O 1 , N , O 2 and κ 2 N , O 1 terminal coordination modes, depending on steric congestion, which in turn depends on the ionic radii of the rare-earth metals and the number of coordinated ligands. It has been demonstrated that interligand dihedral angles of the phenoxide ligand are convenient for comparing steric hindrance in complexes.

    "abstract": "Organic–inorganic hybrids consisting of organic cations and polyanions are promising functional materials due to their various compositions and structures. An important aspect of these materials is the interactions between the organic and inorganic components, which not only produce the final structures, but also influence the properties. Here, we investigated the interactions between organic cations and polyanions using protonated 2-aminopyridinium (Hap) as the cation, and successfully obtained two polyoxometalate-based hybrids, namely (C 5 H 7 N 2 ) 4 [Mo 8 O 26 ], (I), and (C 5 H 7 N 2 ) 2 [NiMo 6 O 16 (OH) 2 {CH 3 C(CH 2 O) 3 } 2 ]·4H 2 O, (II). In the crystal structure of (I), every Hap cation links with two polyanions by donating one or two N—H...O hydrogen bonds, and every polyanion is surrounded by eight Hap cations via terminal or bridging O atoms. Conversely, in compound (II), every Hap cation only links with one polyanion decorated by a triol ligand; this organic–inorganic component further assembles via uncoordinated water molecules. In the extended structures, Hap plays a key role, not only providing a counter charge, but also acting as `glue' linking polyanions in the role of hydrogen-bond donors. In both compounds, as the nodes of the supramolecular network, the polyanions exhibit an ordered two-dimensional arrangement due to strong hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between the organic and inorganic parts. The electrochemistry of compound (I) shows that redox sourcing from polyanions is a surface-controlled process. Conversely, the magnetic behaviour of compound (II) indicates dominant antiferromagnetic properties.",

The polyanion [NaCH 3 COO{Y 2 (H 2 O) 3 (B-α-AsW 9 O 33 ) 2 (W 2 O 5 )(CO 3 )}] 12− ( 1 ) was isolated as a solid crystalline material by the reaction of a Y III salt with the sodium salt of trilacunary [AsW 9 O 33 ] 9− in sodium acetate solution. The sodium salt of the polyanion, i.e. Na 12 [Na(CH 3 COO){Y 2 (AsW 9 O 33 ) 2 (W 2 O 5 )(CO 3 )(H 3 O) 3 }]·22H 2 O ( 1a ), was characterized by various analytical techniques, such as FT–IR, single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC–XRD), TGA (thermogravimetric analysis), 13 C NMR and ESI–MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry). SC–XRD studies revealed that the polyanion crystallizes in the triclinic space group P \\overline{1}. The structure showed that the polyanion is a carbonate-encapsulated sandwich-type species, consisting of two trilacunary B-α-[AsW 9 O 33 ] 9− , with a lone-pair-containing As III heteroatom, together with two extra tungsten centres and two yttrium cations at the sandwich position, where CH 3 COO − and Na + ions act as linkers between the two polyanion units. In addition, we have also synthesized two carbonate-encapsulated germanotungstates(IV), without lone-pair-containing heteroatoms, with the formula [Ln 3 (A-β-GeW 9 O 34 ) 2 (CO 3 )(H 2 O) 3 ] 13− [Ln = Y III ( 2 ) and Yb III ( 3 )], i.e. Y 2 K 3 Na 4 [Y 3 (A-β-GeW 9 O 34 ) 2 (CO 3 )(H 2 O) 3 ]·19H 2 O ( 2a ) and YbK 8 Na 2 [Yb(A-β-GeW 9 O 34 ) 2 (CO 3 )(H 2 O) 3 ]·16H 2 O ( 3a ), and characterized them by FT–IR, SC–XRD, TGA and ESI–MS. Here, the lanthanide ions act as linkers, extending the structures into higher dimensions. Sodium and potassium ions also play a key role as linkers, further extending the structure.

The judicious selection and reaction of a sparingly water-soluble transition-metal-substituted polyanion (TMSP) salt with the tritopic ligand 2,4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TPT) in a mixed solvent system under moderately forcing conditions yields Ba 9 [(B III W VI 11 O 39 Co III ) 3 (C 18 H 12 N 6 )]·38H 2 O in moderate yield. Crystallographic analysis reveals significant intermolecular interactions between the organic ligand and neighbouring polyanions, predominantly C—H...O(water) in nature; meanwhile, the solvated regions of the crystal show significant disorder. To supplement the crystallographic study, combustion analysis, and IR and 1 H NMR spectroscopic analyses were conducted, revealing good bulk purity and the stability of the complex in aqueous media.",

A new coordination polymer, namely poly[[μ 2 - trans -1,2-bis(pyridin-3-yl)ethylene-κ 2 N : N ′]bis(μ 4 -4,4′-oxydibenzoato-κ 6 O : O , O ′: O ′′: O ′′, O ′′′)dicadmium(II)], [Cd 2 (C 14 H 8 O 5 ) 2 (C 12 H 10 N 2 )] n or [Cd 2 (4,4′-OBB) 2 (3,3′-BPE)] n , has been synthesized by the the self-assembly of Cd(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O, 4,4′-oxydibenzoic acid (4,4′-H 2 OBB) and trans -1,2-bis(pyridin-3-yl)ethene (3,3′-BPE) under hydrothermal conditions. The title compound was structurally characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Each Cd II centre is coordinated by six carboxylate O atoms from four different 4,4′-OBB 2− ligands and by one pyridyl N atom form a 3,3′-BPE ligand. Adjacent crystallographically equivalent Cd II ions are bridged by 4,4′-OBB 2− ligands, affording a two-dimensional [Cd(4,4′-OBB)] n net extending in the ac plane. Neighbouring [Cd(4,4′-OBB)] n nets are interlinked by 3,3′-BPE along the b axis to form a three-dimensional (3D) [Cd 2 (4,4′-OBB) 2 (3,3′-BPE)] n coordination network. In the network, each Cd II centre is linked by four different 4,4′-OBB 2− ligands and one 3,3′-BPE ligand. Meanwhile, each 4,4′-OBB 2− ligand connects four separate Cd II ions. Therefore, if the 4,4′-OBB 2− ligands and Cd II ions are considered as 4- and 5-connecting nodes, the structure of the title compound can be simplified as a 3D (4,5)-connected binodal framework with the rare (4 4 6 2 )(4 4 6 6 ) TCS topology (Pearson, 1985; Blake et al. , 2011).

All three structures reveal a similar extended conformation, despite the flexible linker between the two aromatic systems and the different types of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The molecules of 2a are practically planar due to the double bond in the linker, which enables conjugation along the whole molecule, while the molecules of 1a exhibit the possibility of parallel orientations of their aromatic systems, despite the aliphatic (ethyl) linker.",

Three of these four compounds contain substituents at the para position of the phenyl ring, which affect the charge density on the H(C Ph ) atoms and thus stabilize C Ph —H...O interactions. The fourth compound realizes the C—H...O hydrogen bonding via H atoms of the furyl ring. The applicability and shortcomings of the Full Interaction Map tool to predict the likelihood of C—H...O and C—H...Br hydrogen-bonded motifs, and the effect of substituents on the phenyl ring on the supramolecular architecture are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Naphthalenediimides, an attractive class of electron-deficient organic dyes with rich redox and photoredox properties, have been investigated extensively as building blocks for coordination networks or metal–organic frameworks in recent decades. However, most of the available work has focused on d -block metal cations rather than f -block lanthanide ions, whose complexes exhibit a large variability in coordination numbers. In this article, four coordination polymers composed of naphthalenediimides and lanthanide cations, namely catena -poly[[[tris(nitrato-κ 2 O , O ′)lanthanide]-bis{μ- N , N ′-bis[(1-oxidopyridin-1-ium-3-yl)methyl]-1,8:4,5-naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide-κ 2 O : O ′}-[tris(nitrato-κ 2 O , O ′)lanthanide]-μ- N , N ′-bis[(1-oxidopyridin-1-ium-3-yl)methyl]-1,8:4,5-naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide-κ 2 O : O ′] methanol disolvate], {[Ln(C 26 H 16 N 4 O 4 ) 1.5 (NO 3 ) 3 ]·CH 3 OH} n , with Ln = Eu, 1 , Gd, 2 , Dy, 3 , and Er, 4 , have been successfully synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the four compounds are isomorphic and that each asymmetric unit contains one nine-coordinated Ln centre, one and a half diimide ligands, three nitrate anions and one uncoordinated methanol molecule. In addition, each metal centre is surrounded by nine O atoms in a distorted tricapped trigonal–prismatic geometry. Two centres are bridged by two cis ligands to form a ring, which is further bridged by trans ligands to generate one-dimensional chains. Neighbouring chains are stacked via π–π interactions between pyridine rings to give a two-dimensional structure, which is stabilized by π–π interactions between naphthalene rings, forming the final three-dimensional supermolecular network. Solid-state optical diffuse-reflectance spectral studies indicate that compound 4 is a potential wide band gap semiconductor.",

In general, O -benzoylation exerts little effect on exo- and endocyclic C—C and endocyclic C—O bond lengths, but exocyclic C—O bonds involved in O -benzoylation are lengthened by 0.02–0.04 Å depending on the site of substitution. The conformation of the O -benzoyl side-chains is highly conserved, with the carbonyl O atom either eclipsing the H atom attached to a 2°-alcoholic C atom or bisecting the H—C—H bond angle of an 1°-alcoholic C atom. Of the three bonds that determine the side-chain geometry, the C—O bond involving the alcoholic C atom exhibits greater rotational variability than the remaining C—O and C—C bonds involving the carbonyl C atom. These findings are in good agreement with recent solution NMR studies of the O -acetyl side-chain conformation in saccharides.",

    "abstract": "Pyrazole (pz)-derived ligands can, besides exhibiting a strong coordination ability toward different metal ions, exhibit a great diversity in their coordination geometry and nuclearity, which can be achieved by varying the type and position of the pz substituents. The present study reports the synthesis and crystal structure of two binuclear complexes, namely bis(μ-4-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-ide-5-carboxylato)-κ3N1,O:N2;κ3N2:N1,O-bis[aqua(dimethylformamide-κO)copper(II)], [Cu2(C4HN3O4)2(C3H7NO)2(H2O)2], (II), and bis(μ-4-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-ide-5-carboxylato)-κ2N1,O:N2;κ2N2:N1,O-bis[triaquacobalt(II)] dihydrate, [Co2(C4HN3O4)2(H2O)6]·2H2O, (III). These compounds represent rare examples of metal complexes comprising 3,4-substituted pz derivatives as a bridging ligand and also the first crystal structures of transition-metal complexes with ligands derived from 4-nitropyrazole-3-carboxylic acid. Recently, the crystal structures of the same ligand in the neutral and mixed neutral/anionic forms have been reported. We present here the third form of this ligand, where it is present in a fully deprotonated anionic form within a salt, i.e. ammonium 4-nitropyrazole-3-carboxylate, NH4+·C4H2N3O4-, (I). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that in the present complexes, the CuII and CoII centres adopt distorted square-pyramidal and octahedral geometries, respectively. In both cases, the N,N',O-coordinated pz ligand shows simultaneously chelating and bridging coordination modes, leading to the formation of a nearly planar six-membered M2N4 metallocycle. In all three crystal structures, the supramolecular arrangement is controlled by strong hydrogen bonds which primarily engage the carboxylate O atoms as acceptors, while the nitro group adopts the role of an acceptor only in structures with an increased number of donors, as is the case with CoII complex (III). The electrostatic potential, as a descriptor of reactivity, was also calculated in order to examine the changes in ligand electrostatic preferences upon coordination to metal ions.",

The isomers of 5ClU can be microhydrated at different molecular target sites. The mono- and dihydrated forms are the most stable in both the gas and water phases, and, because of the intermolecular interactions, the hydrations lead to a degree of change in the stability trend. Two types of isomerizations were considered: the internal H-O bond rotations in which the H atom rotates 180° around the C-O bond and the intramolecular proton-transfer reactions in which an H atom is transferred between an O atom and a neighbouring N atom. The forward and backward energy barriers for isomerizations of nonhydrated 5ClU were calculated. In addition, 16 optimized transition-state structures for water-mediated catalysis on isomerizations of 5ClU were investigated. The forward and backward proton-transfer energy barriers of water-mediated catalysis on isomerizations of 5ClU were obtained. The results indicate that the catalytic effect of two H2O molecules is much greater than that of one H2O molecule in isomerizations of 5ClU.",

The other half of the bischalcone is generated by twofold rotation symmetry, giving rise to two half-occupied and overlapping molecules presenting both anti and syn conformations in their open chain. Such a disorder allows for distinct patterns of intermolecular C-H...O contacts involving the carbonyl and anti-oriented β-C-H groups, which is reflected in three 13C NMR chemical shifts for the carbonyl C atom. Here, we have also assessed the cytotoxicity of three symmetric bischalcones through their in vitro antitumour potential against three cancer cell lines.

Its X-ray structure showed a distorted square-pyramidal geometry and the compound does not undergo dissociation in solution, as shown by variable-temperature NMR and UV-Vis studies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided an insight into the bonding; the nickel dsp2-hybridized orbitals form the basal plane and the nearly pure p orbital forms the axial bond. This is consistent with the NBO (natural bond orbital) analysis of analogous nickel(II) complexes.",

The motif of isolated WO 6 prisms with W atoms on the cell edges is common to both phases. WO 6 octahedra, both isolated and joined by faces, are distributed along the c axis within the unit cells. Phase I contains extra layers of isolated WO 6 octahedra compared to phase II. Tungsten sites in joined octahedra are disordered and partially occupied. Disordering is more expressed in phase II, which in return contains rather more W and O per atom of La. The refined chemical compositions are La 18 W 10 O 57 for I and La 15 W 8.5 O 48 for II.",

SCXRD shows that 1 consists of a hexanuclear nickel(II) [Ni6] cluster, dinuclear NiII nodes and a mononuclear NaI node, resulting in the formation of a complex covalent three-dimensional network. In addition, a tightly packed NiO/C&S nanocomposite is fabricated by sintering the coordination precursor at 400 °C. The uniform nanocomposite consists of NiO nanoparticles, incompletely carbonized carbon and incompletely vulcanized sulfur. When used as a supercapacitor electrode, the synthesized composite shows an extra-long cycling stability (>5000 cycles) during the charge/discharge process.",

(1992). Acta Cryst . C 48 , 1272–1275] and that published by Serrano-González et al. , using neutron and X-ray diffraction data [Serrano-González et al. (1999). J. Phys. Chem. B , 103 , 6215–6223]. As predicted by these authors, the hydroxy groups are involved in weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the crystal, forming tetrahedral tetramers based on the two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit, one of which is placed on the threefold symmetry axis of the R \\overline{3} space group. However, the reliable determination of the hydroxy H-atom positions is difficult to achieve, for two reasons. Firstly, a positional disorder affects the full asymmetric unit, which is split over two sets of positions, with occupancy factors of ca 0.74 and 0.26. Secondly, all hydroxy H atoms are further disordered, either by symmetry, or through a positional disorder in the case of parts placed in general positions. We show that the correct description of the hydrogen-bonding scheme is possible only if diffraction data are collected at low temperature. The prochiral character of the hydrogen-bonded tetrameric supramolecular clusters leads to enantiomorphic three-dimensional graphs in each tetramer. The crystal is thus a racemic mixture of sup S and sup R motifs, consistent with the centrosymmetric nature of the R \\overline{3} space group.",

The asymmetric unit (C 62 H 94 N 10 O 10 ·1.296C 3 H 8 O·1.403H 2 O) contains three LGS molecules ( A , B and C ) forming β-turn and intramolecular β-sheet structures. With the exception of one motif in molecule C , D-Phe-Pro turn motifs (Phe is phenylalanine and Pro is proline) were classed as type II′ β-turns. The peptide backbones twist slightly to the right along the long axis of the molecule. The puckering of Pro is in a Cγ- endo or twisted Cγ- endo –Cβ- exo form. Flanking molecules are arranged such that the angles ( A...B = 104°, B...C = 139° and C...A = 117°) form helical β-sheets. Solvent molecules interact with the peptide backbones supporting the β-sheets. The forms of the replacement Leu side chains are consistent with the e-form of the Orn side chain in GS analogues. No hydrophilic region composed of solvent molecules, such as that observed in Gramicidin S hydrochloride (GS·HCl) crystals, was found. The perturbation of αH chemical shifts and coupling constants of CONH showed that the structural properties of GS·HCl and LGS are similar to each other in solution. CD spectra also supported the structural similarity. With the sequence cyclo(–Val–Leu–Leu–D-Phe–Pro–) 2 (Val is valine and Leu is leucine), LGS lacks the amphiphilicity and antimicrobial activity of parental Gramicidin S (GS). However, the structure of LGS reflects the structural characteristics of GS and no disordering inconvenient for structural analysis was found. Thus, LGS could be a novel scaffold useful for studying β-turn and sheet structures.",

Compound I crystallizes in the high-symmetry trigonal space group P 3 2 21 with an atypical formation of solvent-accessible voids, as a consequence of the 3 2 screw axis in the crystallographic c -axis direction, which are probably occupied by uncharacterized disordered solvent molecules. Additionally, the trihydrated chloride salt crystallizes in the conventional monoclinic space group P 2 1 / c without the formation of solvent-accessible voids. The acid–base equilibria of H 2 dimpy were studied by potentiometric and spectrophotometric titrations, and the results suggest the formation of H 3 dimpy + (p K a1 = 5.40) and H 4 dimpy 2+ (p K a2 = 3.98), with the electrochemical behaviour of these species showing two consecutive irreversible proton-coupled electron-transfer reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate the interpretation of the experimental results and support the assignment of the electrochemical behaviour.",

In the three isomers, the phenolic OH group is in the ortho, meta and para positions. The crystal structure analysis of the meta isomer (C10H9N5O) shows that the 2H-tautomer is present in the crystal and that the molecule adopts a substantially planar geometry. However, the conformation found in the crystal is different compared to the monoprotonated cation of the same compound previously investigated in several salts. The packing of the meta isomer is driven by the formation of strong hydrogen bonds and shows the formation of infinite planar ribbons, parallel to a, formed around 21 crystallographic axes. The three isomers were tested against some cancer cell lines and also against normal cell lines. The ortho isomer shows a weak antiproliferative activity, the meta isomer shows significant antiproliferative activity against some cancer lines and no activity against healthy cell lines, and the para isomer is active against all the tested cell lines.",

Structural and spectroscopic analysis of these phases revealed that derivatives ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are isomers of previously reported ( 3 ) [Brahmia et al. (2013). Acta Cryst. E 69 , o1296]. The crystal structures of meta derivative ( 1 ) and para derivative ( 2 ) were ab initio determined from powder X-ray diffraction data using the direct-space approach. Both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) adopt the orthorhombic space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 . These isomers show hydrogen bonds and rich π–π stacking, together with π...H interactions, which are built by conjugated systems of coumarin and phenol rings. In the crystalline lattice, the packing of ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are mainly stabilized through O—H...O hydrogen bonding between neighbouring coumarin molecules, while hydrogen bonds between coumarin and water molecules build the stable crystal structure of derivative ( 2 ). A big similarity in the skeletons of the IR spectra of these isomers was noticed. Derivative ( 2 ) exhibits two weak bands which were not present in the spectra of the other two derivatives, at 2370 and 2948 cm −1 , which can be assigned to the O—H vibrations of the solvent (H 2 O) trapped in the structure of ( 2 ). These aminocoumarin derivatives display absorption maxima in the visible region, attributed to π–π delocalization involving the whole electronic system of the compounds with a considerable charge-transfer character originating from the aminophenyl ring and pointing towards the coumarin system which is characterized by a high electron-accepting character. Additionally, the isolated molecular ground-state geometries were optimized at the PBE0/TZP level and the electronic properties, molecular electrostatic potential and Hirshfeld charges were determined.",

The compound was synthesized under microwave irradiation. The single-crystal X-ray structure analysis revealed an angle of 13.36 (8)° between the planes of the rings, as well as molecules linked by N sp 2 —H...N hydrogen bonds forming dimers along the crystal. The material was analyzed by FT–IR vibrational spectroscopy, while a computational approach was used to elucidate the vibrational frequency couplings. The existence of N sp 2 —H...N hydrogen bonds in the crystal was confirmed spectroscopically by the IR peaks from the N—H stretching vibration shifting to lower wavenumbers in the solid state relative to those in the gas phase. The supramolecular studies confirmed the formation of centrosymmetric R 2 2 (8) rings, which correspond to the formation of dimers that stack parallel to the b direction. Other weak C—H...π interactions, essential for crystal growth, were found. The UV–Vis spectroscopic analysis showed a donor–acceptor process, where the amino group acts as a donor and the pyridine and pyrimidine rings act as acceptors. The reactive sites of the molecule were identified and their quantitative values were defined using the electrostatic potential model proposed in the multifunctional wave function analyzer multiwfn . The calculated interaction energies between pairs of molecules were used to visualize the electrostatic terms as the leading factors against the dispersion factors in the crystal-growth process. The docking results showed that the amino group of the pyrimidine moiety was simultaneously anchored by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the Asp427 and His407 protein residues. This compound could be key for the realization of a series of syntheses of molecules that could be used as possible inhibitors of chronic myelogenous leukemia.",

Only one sulfonyl O atom takes part in intramolecular hydrogen bonding as a proton acceptor and this atom is different in the two enantiomorphic structures. As a result, the S atom becomes a pseudo-stereogenic centre. This fact is worth taking into account due to the different biological activities of the enantiomorphic forms.

This process often results in iron overload and can be treated by an iron-chelating agent, like deferiprone (3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4-one), C7H9NO2, in an oral formulation. The first crystal structure of deferiprone, (Ia), was reported in 1988 [Nelson et al. (1988). Can. J. Chem. 66, 123-131]. In the present study, two novel polymorphic forms, (Ib) and (Ic), of deferiprone were identified concomitantly with polymorph (Ia) during the crystallization experiments. Polymorph (Ia) was redetermined at low temperature for comparison of the structural features and lattice energy values with polymorphs (Ib) and (Ic). Polymorph (Ia) crystallized in the orthorhombic space group Pbca, whereas both polymorphs (Ib) and (Ic) crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/c. The asymmetric units of (Ia) and (Ib) contain one deferiprone molecule, while polymorph (Ic) has three crystallographically independent molecules (A, B and C). All three polymorphs have similar hydrogen-bonding features, such as an R22(10) dimer formed by O-H...O hydrogen bonds, an R43(20) tetramer formed by C-H...O hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions, but the polymorphs differ in their molecular arrangements in the solid state and are classified as packing polymorphs. O-H...O and C-H...O hydrogen bonds lead to the formation of two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded parallel sheets which are interlinked by π-π stacking interactions. In the three-dimensional crystal packing, the deferiprone molecules were aggregated as corrugated sheets in polymorphs (Ia) and (Ic), whereas in polymorph (Ib), they were aggregated as a square-grid network. The characteristic crystalline peaks of polymorphs (Ia), (Ib) and (Ic) were established through powder X-ray diffraction analysis. The Rietveld analysis was also performed to estimate the contribution of the polymorphs to the bulk material.",

In all three crystal structures, there are two symmetry-independent molecules ( A and B ), and these molecules are connected by three relatively short and directional hydrogen bonds to form chains of alternating A and B molecules. A further organization of these chains is dependent on the nature of the solvent molecule. In the unsolvated form, two orientations of the neighbouring chains are observed, and similar motifs – but only one per structure – can be observed in the solvated structures. These two different motifs can be connected by two different kinds of contacts, i.e. either π–π (hemihydrate) or staple-supported S...S (DMF). In the crystal structures, the O atoms of the solvent molecules are double acceptors of the same type of hydrogen bonds and bind the chains of DAPMT molecules into different motifs (dimeric or infinite chains).

    "abstract": "An operationally simple and time-efficient approach has been developed for the synthesis of racemic N-substituted 3-(2-aryl-2-oxoethyl)-3-hydroxyindolin-2-ones by a piperidine-catalysed aldol reaction between aryl methyl ketones and N-alkylisatins. These aldol products were used successfully as strategic intermediates for the preparation of N-substituted (E)-3-(2-hetaryl-2-oxoethylidene)indolin-2-ones by a stereoselective dehydration reaction under acidic conditions. The products have all been fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, by mass spectrometry and, for a representative selection, by crystal structure analysis. In each of (RS)-1-benzyl-3-hydroxy-3-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-oxoethyl]indolin-2-one, C24H21NO4, (Ic), and (RS)-1-benzyl-3-{2-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-2-oxoethyl}-3-hydroxyindolin-2-one, C25H24N2O3, (Id), inversion-related pairs of molecules are linked by O-H...O hydrogen bonds to form R22(10) rings, which are further linked into chains of rings by a combination of C-H...O and C-H...π(arene) hydrogen bonds in (Ic) and by C-H...π(arene) hydrogen bonds in (Id).

The structure consists of a three-dimensional (3D) anionic Cu I CN network with noncoordinated protonated N -methylethanolamine cations providing charge neutrality. Pairs of cuprophilic Cu atoms are bridged by the C atoms of μ 3 -cyanide ligands, which link these units into a 4 3 spiral along the c axis. The spirals are linked together into a 3D anionic network by the two other cyanide groups. The cationic moieties are linked into their own 4 3 spiral via N—H...O and O—H...O hydrogen bonds, and the cations interact with the 3D network via an unusual pair of N—H...N hydrogen bonds to one of the μ 2 -cyanide groups. Thermogravimetric analysis indicates an initial loss of the base cation and one cyanide as HCN at temperatures in the range 130–250 °C to form CuCN. We show how loss of a specific cyanide group from the 3D CuCN structure could form the linear CuCN structure. Further heating leaves a residue of elemental copper, isolated as the oxide.",

A correlation between electrostatic energy and contact enrichment is found only for the strongly attractive (N—H...Cl − ) and repulsive contacts. Electrostatic energies between ions reveal that the interacting biguanidium cation pairs are repulsive and that the crystal is maintained by attractive cation...Cl − dimers.

Crystals of these compounds are isomorphous, and theory predicted similar ADPs for both. In-house diffraction experiments with Mo K α radiation were in apparent contradiction to this theoretical result, with experimentally observed ADPs significantly larger for the bromo derivative. In contrast, the experimental and theoretical ADPs for the lighter congener matched reasonably well. As all usual quality indicators for both sets of experimental data were satisfactory, complementary diffraction experiments were performed at a synchrotron beamline with shorter wavelength. Refinements based on these intensity data gave very similar ADPs for both compounds and were thus in agreement with the earlier in-house results for the chloro derivative and the predictions of theory. We speculate that strong absorption by the heavy halogen may be the reason for the observed discrepancy.",

For both crystallization and an MTT assay, racemic mixtures of the corresponding [1,2,3]triazolo[5,1- b ][1,3,4]thiadiazines were used. The main manner of molecular packing in these compounds is the organization of either enantiomeric pairs or dimers. In both cases, the formation of two three-centre hydrogen bonds can be detected resulting from intramolecular N—H...O and intermolecular N—H...O or N—H...N interactions. Molecules of different enantiomeric forms can also form chains through N—H...O hydrogen bonds or form layers between which only weak hydrophobic contacts exist. Unlike other [1,2,3]triazolo[5,1- b ][1,3,4]thiadiazines, ethyl 5′-benzoyl-5′ H ,7′ H -spiro[cyclohexane-1,6′-[1,2,3]triazolo[5,1- b ][1,3,4]thiadiazine]-3′-carboxylate contains molecules of only the ( R )-enantiomer; moreover, the N—H group does not participate in any significant intermolecular interactions. Molecular mechanics methods (force field OPLS3e) and the DFT B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) method show that the compound forming enantiomeric pairs via weak N—H...N hydrogen bonds is subject to greater distortion of the geometry under the influence of the intermolecular interactions in the crystal. For intramolecular N—H...O and S...O interactions, an analysis of the noncovalent interactions (NCIs) was carried out. The cellular activities of the compounds were tested by evaluating their antiproliferative effect against two normal human cell lines and two cancer cell lines in terms of half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ). Some derivatives have been found to be very effective in inhibiting the growth of Hela cells at nanomolar and submicromolar concentrations with minimal cytotoxicity in relation to normal cells.",

    "abstract": "Hirshfeld surfaces and two-dimensional fingerprint plots are used to analyse the intermolecular interactions in two new phosphorothioic triamide structures, namely N,N',N''-tris(3,4-dimethylphenyl)phosphorothioic triamide acetonitrile hemisolvate, P(S)[NHC6H3-3,4-(CH3)2]3·0.5CH3CN or C24H30N3PS·0.5CH3CN, (I), and N,N',N''-tris(4-methylphenyl)phosphorothioic triamide-3-methylpiperidinium chloride (1/1), P(S)[NHC6H4(4-CH3)]3·[3-CH3-C5H9NH2](+)·Cl(-) or C21H24N3PS·C6H14N(+)·Cl(-), (II). The asymmetric unit of (I) consists of two independent phosphorothioic triamide molecules and one acetonitrile solvent molecule, whereas for (II), the asymmetric unit is composed of three components (molecule, cation and anion). In the structure of (I), the different components are organized into a six-molecule aggregate through N-H···S and N-H···N hydrogen bonds. The components of (II) are aggregated into a two-dimensional array through N-H···S and N-H···Cl hydrogen bonds. Moreover, interesting features of packing arise in this structure due to the presence of a double hydrogen-bond acceptor (the S atom of the phosphorothioic triamide molecule) and of a double hydrogen-bond donor (the N-H unit of the cation). For both (I) and (II), the full fingerprint plot of each component is asymmetric as a consequence of the presence of three fragments. These analyses reveal that H···H interactions [67.7 and 64.3% for the two symmetry-independent phosphorothioic triamide molecules of (I), 30.7% for the acetonitrile solvent of (I), 63.8% in the phosphorothioic triamide molecule of (II) and 62.9% in the 3-methylpiperidinium cation of (II)] outnumber the other contacts for all the components in both structures, except for the chloride anion of (II), which only receives the Cl···H contact. The phosphorothioic triamide molecules of both structures include unsaturated C atoms, thus presenting C···H/H···C interactions: 17.6 and 21% for the two symmetry-independent phosphorothioic triamide molecules in (I), and 22.7% for the phosphorothioic triamide molecule of (II). Furthermore, the N-H···S hydrogen bonds in both (I) and (II), and the N-H...Cl hydrogen bonds in (II), are the most prominent interactions, appearing as large red spots on the Hirshfeld surface maps. The N···H/H···N contacts in structure (I) are considerable, whereas for (II), they give a negligible contribution to the total interactions in the system.",

In complex (2), the cis disposition of two chloride ligands restricts the ability of the dafo molecule to bind ruthenium in a bidentate fashion.

They comprise an acrylamide group of the usual s-cis configuration appended to a 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-substituted piperidine-1-oxyl radical or a piperidinyl chair, respectively. The adjacent amide and piperidinyl H atoms are approximately trans across the C-N bond. The packing in (I) is dominated by N-H...O hydrogen bonds; these are supported by C-H...O contacts to form an R2(1)(6) ring repeat, a motif which has been observed in other acrylamide structures. In (II), hydrogen bonds are again key to the packing arrangements. In this case, the incorporated solvent water molecule acts as an acceptor through its O atom and as a donor through both H atoms, binding three adjacent piperidinylacrylamide molecules into layers. In both structures, weak C-H...O contacts involving the piperidinyl methyl H atoms and a proximal acrylamide carbonyl O atom extend the structure in the third dimension.",

The asymmetric unit of (IIIb) contains two independent cations with very similar conformations. The B atom has a distorted tetrahedral coordination in all four structures. The cyclopentadienyl rings of (Ib), (IIa) and (IIIb) are approximately eclipsed, while a bisecting conformation is found for (IVb). The N-H groups of (IIa) and (IIIb) are shielded by the ferrocenyl and tert-butyl or phenyl groups and are therefore not involved in hydrogen bonding. The B-N(amine) bond lengths are shortened by delocalization of π-electrons. In the cations with an amine substituent at boron, the B-N(bipyridyl) bonds are 0.035 (3) Å longer than in the cations with a methylene C atom bonded to boron. A similar lengthening of the B-N(bipyridyl) bonds is found in a survey of related cations with an oxy group attached to the B atom.",

Compound (1) has a one-dimensional structure, in which H 2 bipy 2+ cations and acetylenedicarboxylate (ADC 2− ) anions are linked through a typical supramolecular synthon, i.e. R 2 2 (7), and form linear `–cation–anion–' ribbons. Through an array of nonclassical C—H...O hydrogen bonds, adjacent ribbons interact to give two-dimensional sheets. These sheets stack to form a layered structure via π–π interactions between the H 2 bipy 2+ cations of neighbouring layers. The supramolecular isostructurality of compounds (1)–(4) is ascribed to the synergistic effect of multiple interactions in these structures. The balanced strong and weak intermolecular interactions stabilizing this structure type include strong charge-assisted N—H...O hydrogen bonds, C—H...O contacts and π–π interactions.",

Two Zn(II) atoms are bridged by two carboxylate groups of L(2-) ligands, generating a [Zn2(CO2)2] ring.

The two types of chains are linked through additional N-H···O and O-H···O hydrogen bonds, and the hydrogen oxalate chains are sandwiched by the 4-(3-azaniumylpropyl)morpholin-4-ium chains, forming organic layers that are separated by the chloride anions. Finally, the layered three-dimensional structure is stabilized via intermolecular N-H···Cl and C-H···Cl interactions.",

The Co(II) centre exhibits a distorted tetrahedral geometry, with two independent pyrazole-based ligands occupying two coordination sites and two chloride ligands occupying the third and fourth coordination sites. The supramolecular structure is supported by complementary hydrogen bonding between the pyrazole NH group and the chloride ligand of an adjacent molecule. This hydrogen-bonding motif yields a ten-membered hydrogen-bonded ring. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations at the PBE/6-311G level of theory were used to probe the solid-state structure. These simulations suggest that the chelate undergoes a degree of conformational distortion from the lowest-energy geometry to allow for optimal hydrogen bonding in the solid state.",

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements show that the compound undergoes a reversible phase transition at about 261.7 K, with a wide heat hysteresis of 21.9 K. The lower-temperature polymorph (denoted LT; T = 223 K) crystallizes in the space group C2/c, while the higher-temperature polymorph (denoted RT; T = 296 K) crystallizes in the space group P2/c. The relationship between these two phases can be described as: 2a(RT) = a(LT); 2b(RT) = b(LT); c(RT) = c(LT). The crystal structure contains an infinite zigzag hydrogen-bonded chain network of 2-carboxypyridinium cations. The most distinct difference between the higher (RT) and lower (LT) temperature phases is the change in dihedral angle between the planes of the carboxylic acid group and the pyridinium ring, which leads to the formation of different ten-membered hydrogen-bonded rings. In the RT phase, both the perchlorate anions and the hydrogen-bonded H atom within the carboxylic acid group are disordered. The disordered H atom is located on a twofold rotation axis. In the LT phase, the asymmetric unit is composed of two 2-carboxypyridinium cations, half an ordered perchlorate anion with ideal tetrahedral geometry and a disordered perchlorate anion. The phase transition is attributable to the order-disorder transition of half of the perchlorate anions.",

The asymmetric unit consists of one and a half Cd(II) cations, one 4-PyBIm ligand, one and a half 1,4-chdc(2-) ligands and one coordinated water molecule. The central Cd(II) cation, located on an inversion centre, is coordinated by six carboxylate O atoms from six 1,4-chdc(2-) ligands to complete an elongated octahedral coordination geometry. The two terminal rotationally symmetric Cd(II) cations each exhibits a distorted pentagonal-bipyramidal geometry, coordinated by one N atom from 4-PyBIm, five O atoms from three 1,4-chdc(2-) ligands and one O atom from an aqua ligand. The 1,4-chdc(2-) ligands possess two conformations, i.e. e,e-trans-chdc(2-) and e,a-cis-chdc(2-). The cis-1,4-chdc(2-) ligands bridge the Cd(II) cations to form a trinuclear {Cd3}-based chain along the b axis, while the trans-1,4-chdc(2-) ligands further link adjacent one-dimensional chains to construct an interesting two-dimensional network.",

The unit cells in the space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 are of similar dimensions for all the crystals. The conformation of the raffinose molecules remains almost the same across the four crystal structures. The raffinose molecules are linked into a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network involving all the –OH groups, the ring and glycosidic O atoms, and the water molecules. Six water sites were identified in the structures of (II), (III) and (IV), of which W 1, W 4 and W 6 ( W = water) are partially occupied with their populations coupled. W 1, W 4 and one of the –OH groups of the galactose ring form an infinite hydrogen-bonding chain around a 2 1 axis parallel to the a axis (denoted chain A ), and W 6 and the same –OH group form a similar chain (chain A ′) disordered with chain A . The occupancy ratio of chain A to chain A ′ for N -hydrates ( N is a hydration number between 4 and 5) is ( N − 4):(5 − N ). The transformation of chain A to chain A ′ as part of the dehydration process has little effect on the rest of the structure.

    "abstract": "The ADDSYM routine in the program PLATON [Spek (2015). Acta Cryst. C71, 9-18] has helped researchers to avoid structures of (metal-)organic compounds being reported in an unnecessarily low symmetry space group. However, determination of the correct space group may get more complicated in cases of pseudosymmetric inorganic compounds. One example is NaVO2F2, which was reported [Crosnier-Lopez et al. (1994). Eur. J. Solid State Inorg. Chem. 31, 957-965] in the acentric space group P2₁ based on properties but flagged by ADDSYM as (pseudo)centrosymmetric P2₁/m within default distance tolerances. Herein a systematic investigation reveals that NaVO2F2 exists in at least four polymorphs: P2₁, (I), P2₁/m, (II), P2₁/c, (III), and one or more low-temperature ones. The new centrosymmetric modification, (III), with the space group P2₁/c has a similar atomic packing geometry to phase (I), except for having a doubled c axis. The double-cell of phase (III) arises from atomic shifts from the glide plane c at (x, ¼, z). With increasing temperature, the number of observed reflections decreases. The odd l reflections gradually become weaker and, correspondingly, all atoms shift towards the glide plane, resulting in a gradual second-order transformation of (III) into high-temperature phase (II) (P2₁/m) at below 493 K. At least one first-order enantiotropic phase transition was observed below 139 K from both the single-crystal X-ray diffraction and the differential scanning calorimetry analyses. Periodic first-principles calculations within density functional theory show that both P2₁/c superstructure (III) and P2₁ substructure (I) are more stable than P2₁/m structure (II), and that P2₁/c superstructure (III) is more stable that P2₁ substructure (I).",

The experiments yielded five crystal structures, namely 2-aminopyridin-1-ium 2-amino-6-chloro-4-oxo-4 H -pyrimidin-3-ide–2-amino-6-chloropyrimidin-4(3 H )-one (1/3), C 5 H 7 N 2 + ·C 4 H 3 ClN 3 O − ·3C 4 H 4 ClN 3 O, (I a ), 2-aminopyridin-1-ium 2-amino-6-chloro-4-oxo-4 H -pyrimidin-3-ide–2-amino-6-chloropyrimidin-4(3 H )-one–2-aminopyridine (2/10/1), 2C 5 H 7 N 2 + ·2C 4 H 3 ClN 3 O − ·10C 4 H 4 ClN 3 O·C 5 H 6 N 2 , (I b ), the solvent-free cocrystal 2-amino-5-bromo-6-methylpyrimidin-4(3 H )-one–2-amino-5-bromo-6-methylpyrimidin-4(1 H )-one (1/1), C 5 H 6 BrN 3 O·C 5 H 6 BrN 3 O, (II), the solvate 2-amino-5-bromo-6-methylpyrimidin-4(3 H )-one–2-amino-5-bromo-6-methylpyrimidin-4(1 H )-one– N -methylpyrrolidin-2-one (1/1/1), C 5 H 6 BrN 3 O·C 5 H 6 BrN 3 O·C 5 H 9 NO, (III), and the partial cocrystal 2-amino-5-bromo-6-methylpyrimidin-4(3 H )-one–2-amino-5-bromo-6-methylpyrimidin-4(1 H )-one–2-amino-6-chloropyrimidin-4(3 H )-one (0.635/1/0.365), C 5 H 6 BrN 3 O·C 5 H 6 BrN 3 O·C 4 H 4 ClN 3 O, (IV). All five structures show R 2 2 (8) hydrogen-bond-based patterns, either by synthon 2 or by synthon 3, which are related to the Watson–Crick base pairs.",

    "abstract": "The revived interest in halogen bonding as a tool in pharmaceutical cocrystals and drug design has indicated that cyano–halogen interactions could play an important role. The crystal structures of four closely related δ-keto esters, which differ only in the substitution at a single C atom (by H, OMe, Cl and Br), are compared, namely ethyl 2-cyano-5-oxo-5-phenyl-3-(piperidin-1-yl)pent-2-enoate, C 19 H 22 N 2 O 3 , (1), ethyl 2-cyano-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-oxo-3-(piperidin-1-yl)pent-2-enoate, C 20 H 24 N 2 O 4 , (2), ethyl 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-cyano-5-oxo-3-(piperidin-1-yl)pent-2-enoate, C 19 H 21 ClN 2 O 3 , (3), and the previously published ethyl 5-(4-bromophenyl)-2-cyano-5-oxo-3-(piperidin-1-yl)pent-2-enoate, C 19 H 21 BrN 2 O 3 , (4) [Maurya, Vasudev &amp; Gupta (2013). RSC Adv. 3 , 12955–12962]. The molecular conformations are very similar, while there are differences in the molecular assemblies. Intermolecular C—H...O hydrogen bonds are found to be the primary interactions in the crystal packing and are present in all four structures. The halogenated derivatives have additional aromatic–aromatic interactions and cyano–halogen interactions, further stabilizing the molecular packing. A database analysis of cyano–halogen interactions using the Cambridge Structural Database [CSD; Groom &amp; Allen (2014). Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 53 , 662–671] revealed that about 13% of the organic molecular crystals containing both cyano and halogen groups have cyano–halogen interactions in their packing. Three geometric parameters for the C— X ...N[triple-bond]C interaction ( X = F, Cl, Br or I), viz. the N... X distance and the C— X ...N and C—N... X angles, were analysed. The results indicate that all the short cyano–halogen contacts in the CSD can be classified as halogen bonds, which are directional noncovalent interactions.",

The pharmaceutical amide dihydrocarbamazepine (DCBZ) is a less well known material and is largely of interest here as a structural congener of CBZ. Reaction of DCBZ with strong acids results in protonation of the amide functionality at the O atom and gives the salt forms dihydrocarbamazepine hydrochloride {systematic name: [(10,11-dihydro-5 H -dibenzo[ b , f ]azepin-5-yl)(hydroxy)methylidene]azanium chloride, C 15 H 15 N 2 O + ·Cl − }, dihydrocarbamazepine hydrochloride monohydrate {systematic name: [(10,11-dihydro-5 H -dibenzo[ b , f ]azepin-5-yl)(hydroxy)methylidene]azanium chloride monohydrate, C 15 H 15 N 2 O + ·Cl − ·H 2 O} and dihydrocarbamazepine hydrobromide monohydrate {systematic name: [(10,11-dihydro-5 H -dibenzo[ b , f ]azepin-5-yl)(hydroxy)methylidene]azanium bromide monohydrate, C 15 H 15 N 2 O + ·Br − ·H 2 O}. The anhydrous hydrochloride has a structure with two crystallographically independent ion pairs ( Z ′ = 2), wherein both cations adopt syn conformations, whilst the two hydrated species are mutually isostructural and have cations with anti conformations. Compared to neutral dihydrocarbamazepine structures, protonation of the amide group is shown to cause changes to both the molecular (C=O bond lengthening and C—N bond shortening) and the supramolecular structures. The amide-to-amide and dimeric hydrogen-bonding motifs seen for neutral polymorphs and cocrystalline species are replaced here by one-dimensional polymeric constructs with no direct amide-to-amide bonds. The structures are also compared with, and shown to be closely related to, those of the salt forms of the structurally similar pharmaceutical carbamazepine.",

    "abstract": "Alkanolamines have been known for their high CO 2 absorption for over 60 years and are used widely in the natural gas industry for reversible CO 2 capture. In an attempt to crystallize a salt of ( RS )-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid with 2-amino-2-methylpropan-1-ol, we obtained instead a polymorph (denoted polymorph II) of bis(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-aminium) carbonate, 2C 4 H 12 NO + ·CO 3 2− , (I), suggesting that the amine group of the former compound captured CO 2 from the atmosphere forming the aminium carbonate salt. This new polymorph was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis at low temperature (100 K). The salt crystallizes in the monoclinic system (space group C 2/ c , Z = 4), while a previously reported form of the same salt (denoted polymorph I) crystallizes in the triclinic system (space group P \\overline{1}, Z = 2) [Barzagli et al. (2012). ChemSusChem , 5 , 1724–1731]. The asymmetric unit of polymorph II contains one 1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-aminium cation and half a carbonate anion, located on a twofold axis, while the asymmetric unit of polymorph I contains two cations and one anion. These polymorphs exhibit similar structural features in their three-dimensional packing. Indeed, similar layers of an alternating cation–anion–cation neutral structure are observed in their molecular arrangements. Within each layer, carbonate anions and 1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-aminium cations form planes bound to each other through N—H...O and O—H...O hydrogen bonds. In both polymorphs, the layers are linked to each other via van der Waals interactions and C—H...O contacts. In polymorph II, a highly directional C—H...O contact (C—H...O = 156°) shows as a hydrogen-bonding interaction. Periodic theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both polymorphs present very similar stabilities.",

Continuing our extensive work describing the structural characteristics of some related compounds with interesting biological properties, the crystallographic features of three epoxy-1-benzazepines, namely (2SR,4RS)-6,8-dimethyl-2-(naphthalen-1-yl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1,4-epoxy-1-benzazepine, (1), (2SR,4RS)-6,9-dimethyl-2-(naphthalen-1-yl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1,4-epoxy-1-benzazepine, (2), and (2SR,4RS)-8,9-dimethyl-2-(naphthalen-1-yl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1,4-epoxy-1-benzazepine, (3), all C22H21NO, and two 1-benzazepin-4-ols, namely 7-fluoro-cis-2-[(E)-styryl]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1-benzazepin-4-ol, C18H18FNO, (4), and 7-fluoro-cis-2-[(E)-pent-1-enyl]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1-benzazepin-4-ol, C15H20FNO, (5), are described. Some peculiarities in the crystallization behaviour were found, involving significant variations in the crystalline structures as a result of modest changes in the peripheral substituents in (1)-(3) and the occurrence of discrete disorder due to the molecular overlay of enantiomers with more than one conformation in (5). In particular, an interesting phase change on cooling was observed for compound (5), accompanied by an approximate fourfold increase of the unit-cell volume and a change of the Z' value from 1 to 4. This transition is a consequence of the partial ordering of the pentenyl chains in half of the molecules breaking half of the -3 symmetry axes observed in the room-temperature structure of (5). The structural assembly in all the title compounds is characterized by not only (N,O)-H...(O,N) hydrogen bonds, but also by unconventional C-H...O contacts, resulting in a wide diversity of packing.",

Each Cd(II) centre is five-coordinated by four carboxylate O atoms from two L(2-) ligands and by one N atom from a bpmb ligand, forming a disordered pentagonal pyramidal coordination geometry. The Cd(II) centres are interlinked by L(2-) ligands to form a one-dimensional [Cd2L2]n chain. Adjacent chains are further connected by bpmb linkers, giving rise to a two-dimensional network, and these networks are pillared by bpmb to afford a three-dimensional framework with a 3(3).4(2).6(3).7(1).8(1) topology. Each grid in the framework has large channels which are filled mainly by the two other equivalent frameworks to form a threefold interpenetrating net.

The compound crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group I 4 1 ( Z = 4). The asymmetric unit contains one Na I and one Fe III atom lying on a fourfold symmetry axis, one μ 2 -bridging oxalate ligand and two aqua ligands. Each metal atom is surrounded by two chelating oxalate ligands and two equivalent water molecules. The structure consists of infinite one-dimensional chains of alternating FeO 4 (H 2 O W 1) 2 and NaO 4 (H 2 O W 2) 2 octahedra, bridged by oxalate ligands, parallel to the [100] and [010] directions, respectively. Because of the cis configuration and the μ 2 -coordination mode of the oxalate ligands, the chains run in a zigzag manner. This arrangement facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds between neighbouring chains involving the H 2 O and oxalate ligands, leading to a two-dimensional framework. The structure of this new one-dimensional coordination polymer is shown to be unique among the A I M III (C 2 O 4 ) 2 (H 2 O) n series. In addition, the absorption bands in the IR and UV–Visible regions and their assignments are in good agreement with the local symmetry of the oxalate ligand and the irregular environment of iron(III).

The title binuclear terpyridine Co(II) complex, bis(μ-4,4'-oxydibenzoato)-κ(3)O,O':O'';κ(3)O'':O,O'-bis[(4'-phenyl-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine-κ(3)N,N',N'')cobalt(II)], [Co2(C14H8O5)2(C21H15N3)2], (1), has been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. In the crystal structure, each Co(II) cation is surrounded by three N atoms of a PTP ligand and three O atoms, two from a bidentate and one from a symmetry-related monodentate 4,4'-oxydibenzoate (ODA(2-)) ligand, completing a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. Neighbouring [Co(PTP)](2+) units are bridged by ODA(2-) ligands to form a ring-like structure. The third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of (1) and PTP were determined in thin films using the Z-scan technique. The title compound shows a strong third-order NLO saturable absorption (SA), while PTP exhibits a third-order NLO reverse saturable absorption (RSA). The absorptive coefficient β of (1) is -37.3 × 10(-7) m W(-1), which is larger than that (8.96 × 10(-7) m W(-1)) of PTP. The third-order NLO susceptibility χ((3)) values are calculated as 6.01 × 10(-8) e.s.u. for (1) and 1.44 × 10(-8) e.s.u. for PTP.",

    "abstract": "Multicomponent crystals or cocrystals play a significant role in crystal engineering, the main objective of which is to understand the role of intermolecular interactions and to utilize such understanding in the design of novel crystal structures. Molecules possessing carboxylic acid and amide functional groups are good candidates for forming cocrystals. β-Resorcylic acid monohydrate, C7H6O4·H2O, (I), crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 with one β-resorcylic acid molecule and one water molecule in the asymmetric unit. The cocrystal thymine-β-resorcylic acid-water (1/1/1), C5H6N2O2·C7H6O4·H2O, (II), crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pca21, with one molecule each of thymine, β-resorcylic acid and water in the asymmetric unit. All available donor and acceptor atoms in (I) and (II) are utilized for hydrogen bonding. The acid and amide functional groups are well known for the formation of self-complementary acid-acid and amide-amide homosynthons. In (I), an acid-acid homosynthon is observed, while in (II), an amide-acid heterosynthon is present. In (I), the β-resorcylic acid molecule exhibits the expected intramolecular S(6) motif between the hydroxy and carbonyl O atoms, and an intermolecular R2(2)(8) dimer motif between the carboxylic acid groups; only the former motif is observed in (II). The water solvent molecule in (I) propagates the discrete dimers into two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded sheets. In (II), thymine and β-resorcylic acid molecules do not form self-complementary amide-amide and acid-acid homosynthons; instead, a thymine-β-resorcylic acid heterosynthon is observed. With the help of the water molecule, this heterosynthon is aggregated into a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network. The absence of thymine base pairing in (II) might be linked to the availability of additional functional groups and the preference of the donor and acceptor hydrogen-bond combinations.",

This also affects the oxazolidone group, which is also slightly canted out. This conformation is qualitatively similar to that of the parent meso-tetraphenylporphyrin N-oxide, but dissimilar to that of the porpholactone N-oxide isomer 8-oxo-5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-7-oxaporphyrin N(22)-oxide, (4A), carrying the N-oxide at the oxazolidone group. While the degree of canting of the N-oxidized groups in both cases is comparable (and more pronounced than in the porphyrin N-oxide case), in (4A) the pyrrolic groups adjacent to the N-oxidized group are more affected than the opposing group.

    "abstract": "Several conditions need to be fulfilled for a photochemical reaction to proceed in crystals. Some of these conditions, for example, geometrical conditions, depend on the particular type of photochemical reaction, but the rest are common for all reactions. The mutual directionality of two neighbouring molecules determines the kind of product obtained. The influence of temperature on the probability of a photochemical reaction occurring varies for different types of photochemical reaction and different compounds. High pressure imposed on crystals also has a big influence on the free space and the reaction cavity. The wavelength of the applied UV light is another factor which can initiate a reaction and sometimes determine the structure of a product. It is possible, to a certain degree, to control the packing of molecules in stacks by using fluoro substituents on benzene rings. The crystal and molecular structure of 2,6-difluorocinnamic acid [systematic name: 3-(2,6-difluorophenyl)prop-2-enoic acid], C9H6F2O2, (I), was determined and analysed in terms of a photochemical [2 + 2] dimerization. The molecules are arranged in stacks along the a axis and the values of the intermolecular geometrical parameters indicate that they may undergo this photochemical reaction. The reaction was carried out in situ and the changes of the unit-cell parameters during crystal irradiation by a UV beam were monitored. The values of the unit-cell parameters change in a different manner, viz. cell length a after an initial increase starts to decrease, b after a decrease starts to increase, c increases and the unit-cell volume V after a certain increase starts to decrease. The structure of a partially reacted crystal, i.e. containing both the reactant and the product, namely 2,6-difluorocinnamic acid-3,4-bis(2,6-difluorophenyl)cyclobutane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (0.858/0.071), 0.858C9H6F2O2·0.071C18H12F4O4, obtained in situ, is also presented.

Reactions of benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) and pyridine (py) with Zn(II) or Co(II) yielded two new coordination polymers, namely, poly[(μ4-benzene-1,4-dicarboxylato-κ(4)O:O':O'':O''')(pyridine-κN)zinc(II)], [Zn(C8H4O2)(C5H5N)]n, (I), and catena-poly[aqua(μ3-benzene-1,4-dicarboxylato-κ(3)O:O':O'')bis(pyridine-κN)cobalt(II)], [Co(C8H4O2)(C5H5N)2(H2O)]n, (II). In compound (I), the Zn(II) cation is five-coordinated by four carboxylate O atoms from four BDC(2-) ligands and one pyridine N atom in a distorted square-pyramidal coordination geometry. Four carboxylate groups bridge two Zn(II) ions to form centrosymmetric paddle-wheel-like Zn2(μ2-COO)4 units, which are linked by the benzene rings of the BDC(2-) ligands to generate a two-dimensional layered structure. The two-dimensional layer is extended into a three-dimensional supramolecular structure with the help of π-π stacking interactions between the aromatic rings. Compound (II) has a one-dimensional double-chain structure based on Co2(μ2-COO)2 units. The Co(II) cations are bridged by BDC(2-) ligands and are octahedrally coordinated by three carboxylate O atoms from three BDC(2-) ligands, one water O atom and two pyridine N atoms. Interchain O-H...O hydrogen-bonding interactions link these chains to form a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture.",

Zn II and Cd II coordination polymers are promising candidates for producing photoactive materials because these d 10 metal ions not only possess a variety of coordination numbers and geometries, but also exhibit luminescence properties when bound to functional ligands. It is difficult to predict the final structure of such polymers because the assembly process is influenced by many subtle factors.

    "abstract": "4'-Substituted derivatives of 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine with N-containing heteroaromatic substituents, such as pyridyl groups, might be able to coordinate metal centres through the extra N-donor atom, in addition to the chelating terpyridine N atoms. The incorporation of these peripheral N-donor sites would also allow for the diversification of the types of noncovalent interactions present, such as hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking. The title compound, C24H16N4, consists of a 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine nucleus (tpy), with a pendant isoquinoline group (isq) bound at the central pyridine (py) ring. The tpy nucleus deviates slightly from planarity, with interplanar angles between the lateral and central py rings in the range 2.24 (7)-7.90 (7)°, while the isq group is rotated significantly [by 46.57 (6)°] out of this planar scheme, associated with a short Htpy...Hisq contact of 2.32 Å. There are no strong noncovalent interactions in the structure, the main ones being of the π-π and C-H...π types, giving rise to columnar arrays along [001], further linked by C-H...N hydrogen bonds into a three-dimensional supramolecular structure. An Atoms In Molecules (AIM) analysis of the noncovalent interactions provided illuminating results, and while confirming the bonding character for all those interactions unquestionable from a geometrical point of view, it also provided answers for some cases where geometric parameters are not informative, in particular, the short Htpy...Hisq contact of 2.32 Å to which AIM ascribed an attractive character.",

These compounds are 1-(2-chlorobenzylidene)-2-{2-[2-(2-chlorobenzylidene)hydrazin-1-ylidene]-1,2-diphenylethylidene}hydrazine (BDHOCB), and the 3-chloro (BDHMCB) and 4-chloro (BDHPCB) analogues, all having the formula C28H20Cl2N4. Surprisingly, only di-Schiff bases were obtained; our attempts to push the reaction in favour of the mono-Schiff bases all failed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to explain the trend in the experimental results. In the case of the systems studied, the type of Schiff base produced exhibits a clear dependence on the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps (ΔE(HOMO-LUMO)), i.e. the product is mainly governed by its stability. The compounds were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffractometry, elemental analysis, melting point, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. The structural features of the three new Schiff bases are similar. For instance, they have the same chemical formula, all the molecules have a symmetrical double helix structure, with each Ph-C=N-N=C-Ph arm exhibiting an anti conformation, and their supramolecular interactions include intermolecular π-π and weak C-H...π stacking interactions. The crystal systems are different, however, viz. triclinic (space group P1¯) for BDHPCB, monoclinic (space group P2(1)/n) for BDHOCB and orthorhombic (space group Pnna) for BDHMCB.",

In the structures of all three compounds, there are intramolecular contacts between both Se and Te with the ortho substituents. In the case of 2 , this is achieved by rotation of the nitro group from the arene plane. For 3 , both amino groups exhibit pyramidal geometry and are involved in intramolecular N—H...Se interactions, with one also participating in intermolecular N—H...N hydrogen bonding. While 3 and 7 are structurally similar, there are some significant differences. In addition to both intramolecular N—H...Te interactions and intermolecular N—H...N hydrogen bonding, 7 also exhibits intramolecular N—H...N hydrogen bonding. In the packing of these molecules, for 2 , there are weak intermolecular C—H...O contacts and these, along with the O...N interactions mentioned above, link the molecules into a three-dimensional array. For 3 , in addition to the N—H...N and N—H...Se interactions, there are also weak intermolecular C—H...Se interactions, which also link the molecules into a three-dimensional array. On the other hand, 7 shows intermolecular N—H...N interactions linking the molecules into R 2 2 (16) centrosymmetric dimers. In the theoretical studies, for compound 2 , AIM (atoms in molecules) analysis revealed critical points in the Se...O interactions with values of 0.017 and 0.026 a.u. These values are suggestive of weak interactions present between Se and O atoms. For 3 and 7 , the molecular structures displayed intramolecular, as well as intermolecular, hydrogen-bond interactions of the N—H...N type. The strength of this hydrogen-bond interaction was calculated by AIM analysis. Here, the intermolecular (N—H...N) hydrogen bond is stronger than the intramolecular hydrogen bond.

Two new main-group MOFs, namely, poly[[di-μ-aqua-diaqua(dimethylformamide)[μ 7 -5,5′-methylenebis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzene-1,3-dicarboxylato)]dibarium(II)] trihydrate], {[Ba 2 (C 23 H 20 O 8 )(C 3 H 7 NO)(H 2 O) 4 ]·3H 2 O} n or {[Ba 2 (BTMIPA)(DMF)(H 2 O) 4 ]·3H 2 O} n ( 1 ), and poly[[diaqua[μ 6 -5,5′-methylenebis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzene-1,3-dicarboxylato)]dilead(II)] 2.5-hydrate], {[Pb 2 (C 23 H 20 O 8 )(H 2 O) 2 ]·2.5H 2 O} n or {[Pb 2 (BTMIPA)(H 2 O) 2 ]·2.5H 2 O} n ( 2 ), were prepared by the self-assembly of metal salts with the semi-rigid tetracarboxylic acid ligand 5,5′-methylenebis(2,4,6-trimethylisophthalic acid) (H 4 BTMIPA). Both structures were characterized by elemental analysis (EA), single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Complex 1 reveals a three-dimensional (3D) flu network formed via bridging tetranuclear secondary building units (SBUs) and complex 2 displays a 3D framework with an sqp topology based on one-dimensional metal chains. The BTMIPA 4− ligands adopt a rare coordination mode in 2 , although the ligands in both 1 and 2 are X-shaped. The luminescence properties of both complexes were investigated in the solid state.",

    "abstract": "The crystal structure of the cis isomer of cis -bis(L-DOPA-κ 2 N , O )copper(II) monohydrate (L-DOPA is 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine) ( CuLD ), [Cu(C 9 H 10 NO 4 ) 2 ]·H 2 O, is a singular example of a structurally characterized, homoleptic, crystalline metal L-DOPA complex. CuLD crystallizes in the space group P 2 1 , with Z ′ = 2. The two independent molecules are square planar, and are interconnected by a linear hydrogen-bonded chain containing 12 independent hydrogen bonds. The copper ions in both molecules have weak apical intermolecular Cu...O interactions [2.739 (2) and 2.973 (2) Å] with catechol –OH groups. A survey of the Cambridge Structural Database suggested that cis and trans isomers of Cu(NH 2 –C–CO 2 ) 2 amino acid complexes are equally likely to occur. 12 strong O—H...O and N—H...O hydrogen bonds stabilize an unusual linear arrangement of the Cu complexes. The Cu...Cu′ distances along the chain are nearly equal [5.0739 (3) and 5.1107 (3) Å] and the Cu...Cu′...Cu angles are nearly linear [176.75 (1)°]. The MATCH procedure available in the Oxford University Crystals for Windows package was used to carry out a detailed analysis of the relationship between the two independent molecules. MATCH has some particular advantages in studying the details of pseudosymmetry, which include: (i) no atomic-order requirements; (ii) the pseudosymmetry matrix is readily available, which allows quick insight into the symmetry elements involved and their location; and (iii) the differences between molecular centroids, as well as between all atomic positions and torsion angles, are listed. A tutorial presentation is designed to attract new users to the technique. In the present case, a search for a pseudosymmetric relationship between the two independent molecules showed that they are related by a pseudo-4 2 axis along the crystallographic c direction. A detailed analysis shows that the pseudo-4 2 symmetry is disrupted by torsions about the CH 2 —C( ipso ) bonds, and that there is no supergroup that can be used to describe the crystal structure.",

The structures of two CuIP 2 S-type cuprous complexes, namely, iodido(thiourea-κ S )bis(triphenylphosphane-κ P )copper(I), [CuI(CH 4 N 2 S)(C 18 H 15 P) 2 ] or [CuI(TU)(TPP) 2 ] ( I ), and (2,3-dihydrobenzimidazole-2-thione-κ S )iodidobis(triphenylphosphane-κ P )copper(I), [CuI(C 7 H 6 N 2 S)(C 18 H 15 P) 2 ] or [CuI(DHBIT)(TPP) 2 ] ( II ), are described. In these two structures, the complex molecules of both are constructed by one copper(I) centre, one iodide ion, two TPP ligands and one thione ligand (TU for I and DHBIT for II ). The copper(I) centres of I and II are both located in a distorted CuIP 2 S tetrahedron and are coordinated by two P atoms from two TPP ligands, one S atom from the thione ligand and the I atom. The UV–Vis absorption and photoluminescence properties of these CuIP 2 S-type cuprous complexes have been studied using crystalline powder samples. Detailed time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations and wavefunction analysis reveal that the pale-blue–green phosphorescence emission should originate from intra-ligand (TPP for I and DHBIT for II ) charge transfer, with a small component of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer 3 (IL+ML)CT excited state.",

When replacing iodide with an acetonitrile (in 4) or perchlorate (in 5) ligand, the reduced interaction between the CuI atom and the ancillary ligand results in stronger CuI-arene interactions. No CuI-arene interactions are observed in dimer 6, due to the tricoordinated CuI centre having sufficient electron density from the coordinated ligands.",

The ligands are orientated in two perpendicular planes, with the O and S atoms in cis and the N atoms in trans positions. This [Fe(HL)2](anion)·H2O compound contains the first known cationic FeIII entity containing two salicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives. The FeIII ion is in the high-spin state at 100 K. In addition, a comparative IR spectroscopic study of the free ligand and the ferric complex is presented, demonstrating that such an analysis provides a quick identification of the degree of deprotonation and the coordination mode of the ligand in this class of metal compounds. The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements (5-320 K) are consistent with the presence of a high-spin FeIII ion with a zero-field splitting D = 0.439 (1) cm-1.",

The degree of nonplanarity of metalloporphyrins depends directly on the number of substituents, their size and their location. The introduction of substituents in the meso positions of β-substituted porphyrins increases the steric interaction and leads to distortions of the porphyrin core. Increasing the distortion of the porphyrin core would augment the bathochromic (red) shift of the electronic absorption spectra.

A multidentate 4-aminotriazole-bridged organic ligand, namely 4-amino-3,5-bis(4,3′-bipyridyl-5′-yl)-4 H -1,2,4-triazole ( L ) has been prepared and used to synthesize two Co II coordination polymers, namely poly[[[μ 2 -4-amino-3,5-bis(4,3′-bipyridyl-5′-yl)-4 H -1,2,4-triazole-κ 2 N : N ′]bis(methanol-κ O )cobalt(II)] bis(perchlorate)], {[Co(C 22 H 16 N 8 ) 2 (CH 3 OH) 2 ](ClO 4 ) 2 } n , (I), and poly[[μ 3 -4-amino-3,5-bis(4,3′-bipyridyl-5′-yl)-4 H -1,2,4-triazole-κ 3 N : N ′: N ′′]dichloridocobalt(II)], [CoCl 2 (C 22 H 16 N 8 )] n , (II), using Co X 2 salts [ X = ClO 4 for (I) and Cl for (II)] under solvothermal conditions. Single-crystal X-ray structure analysis revealed that they both feature two-dimensional networks. Cobalt is located on an inversion centre in (I) and in a general position in (II). In (I), L functions as a bidentate cis -conformation ligand linking Co II ions, while it functions as a tridentate trans -conformation linker binding Co II ions in (II). In addition, O—H...N and N—H...O hydrogen bonds and C—H...π interactions exist in (I), while N—H...Cl and π–π interactions exist in (II), and these weak interactions play an important role in aligning the two-dimensional nets of (I) and (II) in the solid state. As the compounds were synthesized under the same conditions, the significant structural variations between (I) and (II) are believed to be determined by the different sizes and coordination abilities of the counter-anions.

In the structure of (I), the very distorted octahedral NaO6 coordination polyhedron comprises two bidentate chelating O-atom donors (carboxylate and phenoxy) of the PFPA ligand and three O-atom donors from water molecules, one monodentate and the other μ2-bridging between inversion-related Na centres in a cyclic manner. A bridging carboxylate donor generates two-dimensional polymer layers lying parallel to (001), in which intralayer water O-H...O hydrogen-bonding associations are also present. Structures (II) and (III) are isotypic, each having an irregular MO7 stereochemistry, with the primary metal-ligand bidentate chelate similar to that in (I) and extended into a two-dimensional polymeric layered structure, lying parallel to (100), through five additional bridging carboxylate O atoms. Two of these bonds are from an O,O'-bidentate chelate interaction and the other three are from μ3-O-atom bridges, generating cyclic links with short M...M separations [3.9064 (17) Å for (II) and 4.1001 (8) for (III)], the shortest being a centrosymmetric four-membered cyclic link. In the crystals of (I)-(III), intralayer C-H...F interactions are present, but no π-π ring interactions are found.",

Compound (I) crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P 2 1 / c with two water molecules.

The crystal structure reveals a three-dimensional network of molecules linked through N—H...N, N—H...O, O—H...N and O—H...O hydrogen bonds. Thermal decomposition was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The exothermic peak temperature is 509.72 K, which indicates that hydrated salt (I) exhibits good thermal stability. Non-isothermal reaction kinetic parameters were calculated via both the Kissinger and the Ozawa methods to yield activation energies of E k = 239.07 kJ mol −1 , lg A k = 22.79 s −1 and E O = 235.38 kJ mol −1 for (I). Additionally, the thermal safety was evaluated by calculating critical temperatures and thermodynamic values, viz. T SADT , T TIT , T b , Δ S ≠ , Δ H ≠ and Δ G ≠ .

Single-crystal X-ray structure diffraction analysis of ( 1 ) reveals that the bbtz ligand acts as a bridge, linking adjacent Cu II ions into a two-dimensional cationic (4,4) topological network, in which the coordinated 3-amino-4-carboxybenzenesulfonate (Hasba − ) anion uses its sulfonate group to bind with the Cu II ion in a monodentate fashion and the carboxylate group remains protonated. The lattice Hasba − anion resides in the two-dimensional layer and balances the charge. The carboxylate group of the 2-amino-4-sulfonatobenzoate (asba 2− ) ligand in ( 2 ) is involved in bidentate coordination, connecting adjacent Cu II ions into carboxylate-bridged chains which are further bridged by the auxiliary flexible bix ligand in a trans – gauche (TG) mode, resulting in the formation of a two-dimensional network architecture. The amino group of the asba 2− ligand in ( 2 ) also takes part in the coordination with the central Cu II ion. The six-coordinated Cu II centres in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) exhibit distorted octahedral coordination geometries. Extensive hydrogen bonding exists in both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). The interlayer hydrogen bonds in both compounds further extend adjacent two-dimensional layers into three-dimensional supramolecular network architectures. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the solid-state UV–Vis–NIR (NIR is near IR) diffuse reflectance data indicates that ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) may have potential as wide band gap indirect semiconductor materials. Compounds ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) show reversible and irreversible dehydration–rehydration behaviours, respectively.",

The Ca/Sr structures form a series where, with increasing Sr content, the unit cell expands in both the crystallographic a and c directions (by 1.80 and 3.18%, respectively), but contracts slightly in the b direction (−0.31%). The largest percentage structural expansion lies parallel to the direction of propagation of the one-dimensional coordination polymer that is the primary structural feature. This structural expansion is thus associated with increased M —O distances. Aqueous solubility measurements show that solubility generally increases with increasing Sr content. Thus, tuning the composition of these mixed counter-ion salt forms leads to systematic structural changes and allows solubility to be tuned to values between those for the pure Ca and Sr species.",

    "abstract": "Molecular salts, often observed as cocrystals, play an important role in the fields of pharmaceutics and materials science, where salt formation is used to tune the properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and improve the stability of solid-state materials. Salt formation via a proton-transfer reaction typically alters hydrogen-bonding motifs and influences supramolecular assembly patterns. We report here the molecular salts formed by the pyridyl bis-urea macrocycle 3,5,13,15,21,22-hexaazatricyclo[15.3.1.1 7,11 ]docosa-1(21),7(22),8,10,17,19-hexaene-4,14-dione, ( 1 ), and naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid (H 2 NDS) as two salt cocrystal solvates, namely 4,14-dioxo-3,5,13,15,21,22-hexaazatricyclo[15.3.1.1 7,11 ]docosa-1(21),7(22),8,10,17,19-hexaene-21,22-diium naphthalene-1,5-disulfonate dimethyl sulfoxide disolvate, C 16 H 20 N 6 O 2 2+ ·C 10 H 6 O 6 S 2 2− ·2C 2 H 6 OS, ( 2 ), and the corresponding monosolvate, C 16 H 20 N 6 O 2 2+ ·C 10 H 6 O 6 S 2 2− ·C 2 H 6 OS, ( 3 ). This follows the Δp K a rule such that there is a proton transfer from H 2 NDS to ( 1 ), forming the reported molecular salts through hydrogen bonding. Prior to salt formation, ( 1 ) is relatively planar and assembles into columnar structures. The salt cocrystal solvates were obtained upon slow cooling of dimethyl sulfoxide–acetonitrile solutions of the molecular components from two temperatures (363 and 393 K). The proton transfer to ( 1 ) significantly alters the conformation of the macrocycle, changing the formerly planar macrocycle into a step-shaped conformation with trans – cis urea groups in ( 2 ) or into a bowl-shape conformation with trans – trans urea groups in ( 3 ).",

In addition, the semi-rigid ancillary ligand 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid) (H 2 oba) can adopt different coordination modes, resulting in coordination polymers with high-dimensional skeletons.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction indicates that there are three crystallographically independent Cd II cations, three bpbp ligands, two deprotonated oba 2− ligands, one nitrate ligand and one coordinated water molecule in the asymmetric unit. One Cd II centre is seven-coordinated, exhibiting a distorted {CdN 2 O 5 } pentagonal bipyramidal geometry, while the other two Cd centres are both six-coordinated, showing slightly distorted {CdN 2 O 4 } octahedral geometries. The most interesting feature is the co-existence of trans and cis conformations in a single net, allowing structural interpenetration via self-threading and yet the expected self-penetrating structure was obtained. Topological analysis shows that the whole three-dimensional framework can be classified as a 3-nodal (4,6,6)-c net with Schläfli symbol {6 13 .8 2 } 2 {6 6 }, which is a new topology.

The isomeric mbix and obix ligands have a big influence on the structures of CPs (1) and (2). CP (1) is composed of chains of nanometre-sized elliptical rings, in which the Co II atom exhibits a distorted octahedral coordination geometry and ATBIP 2− acts as a monodentate ligand. Two adjacent chains are interlinked by π–π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds, resulting in a supramolecular double chain. Hydrogen-bonded R 8 6 (16) rings extend adjacent supramolecular double chains into a two-dimensional supramolecular layer. Halogen bonding and a hydrogen-bonded R 4 2 (8) ring further link the two-dimensional supramolecular layers, leading to the formation of a three-dimensional supramolecular network. The Co II ion in CP (2) is tetracoordinated, exhibiting a distorted tetrahedral configuration. The ATBIP 2− ligand exhibits a bis(monodentate) coordination bridging mode, linking adjacent Co II ions into zigzag chains, which are further bridged by the auxiliary bridging obix ligand, resulting in a two-dimensional (4,4) topological network. Interlayer hydrogen and halogen–halogen bonding further extend the two-dimensional layers into a three-dimensional supramolecular network. A detailed analysis of the solid-state UV–Vis–NIR diffuse-reflectance spectra of (1) and (2) indicates that a wide optical band gap exists in both (1) and (2). CP (1) exhibits an irreversible dehydration–rehydration behaviour.",

It is still a challenge to expand this approach to the realm of metal–organic polymers, while insufficient control over the environment of the [ M OF 5 ] 2− units results in their orientational disorder and loss of polarity. The structures of catena -poly[[tris(3,4,5-trimethyl-1 H -pyrazole-κ N 2 )copper(II)]-μ-oxido-[tetrafluoridoniobium(V)]-μ-fluorido], [CuNbF 5 O(C 6 H 10 N 2 ) 3 ] n , (I), and its isostructural pentafluoridooxidotantalate(V) analogue, catena -poly[[tris(3,4,5-trimethyl-1 H -pyrazole-κ N 2 )copper(II)]-μ-oxido-[tetrafluoridotantalum(V)]-μ-fluorido], [CuTaF 5 O(C 6 H 10 N 2 ) 3 ] n , (II), are the first examples of the strict orientational order of [ M OF 5 ] 2− ( M = Nb and Ta) in one-dimensional coordination chains. A primary factor for the exact discrimination of one orientation of the anion over the other is strong and shape-selective multiple interactions of [ M OF 5 ] 2− with the inherently acentric Cu L 3 2+ platform, with a set of two coordination and three N—H...F hydrogen bonds. In (I) and (II), the Cu 2+ ions exhibit distorted square-pyramidal fivefold coordination formed by three pyrazole N atoms and the oxide O atom, defining the equatorial plane, and the anionic bridging F atom (which is trans with respect to the M —O bond) residing in the apical position. The inorganic bridges connect Cu L 3 2+ moieties into polar zigzag chains; the bulk polarity of the structure is eliminated by an antiparallel alignment of the individual chains. These chains are further connected through C—H...F hydrogen bonding and very weak C—H...π interactions of the organic ligands.",

Even though the disorder may be partly due to the poor quality of the harvested crystal, the structure can shed light on the nature of disorder. With the help of quantum chemical calculations, it is found that the global disorder seems to be connected with the need for stabilization of the somewhat rigid but mobile and unstable molecular structure.

There are several crucial factors which should be considered for the construction of metal–organic polyhedra, such as the starting materials, reaction time and temperature, solvent and suitable organic ligands. Recently, polyoxometalates (POMs), serving as secondary building units to construct POM-based metal–organic polyhedra, have been the subject of much interest.

The title polyhedron has an rdo topology when the {V 5 O 9 Cl} building unit and the benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (BTC 3− ) ligand were simplified into 4-connected and 3-connected vertices. Interestingly, when the {V 5 O 9 Cl} building unit and the BTC 3− ligand are considered as quadrangular and triangular faces, the structure displays rhombicuboctahedral geometry with an outer diameter of 21.88 Å. The packing of the polyhedra produces a circular channel with a diameter of 8.2 Å.

These crystals contain a 50:50 mixture of the (+ ap ,− sp ,+ ac ,− ac ) and (− ap ,+ sp ,− ac ,+ ac ) conformers. The bond lengths in the central CNOS unit are 1.3444 (19), 1.3556 (18) and 1.6567 (15) Å for C—N, C—O and C—S, respectively, and the CNOS and C 3 N moieties are flat and nearly coplanar with each other, consistent with the C—N bond possessing partial double-bond character. Tolnaftate and the four most closely related N , N -disubstituted thiocarbamates in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) all exist as E -conformational isomers in the solid state. Among these five compounds, tolnaftate is the only one in which the N -tolyl moiety is positioned trans to the S atom, i.e. the N -aryl substituent in each of the other compounds is positioned cis to their respective S atom. Notably, and more importantly, our experimental X-ray structure is unlike all prior theoretical models available for tolnaftate. The implication, either directly or indirectly, is that some of those theoretical models used in earlier studies to explain the spectroscopic properties of tolnaftate and to suggest which protein–ligand interactions are responsible for the binding of tolnaftate to squalene epoxidase are either inappropriate or structurally unreasonable, i.e. the results and conclusions from those prior studies are in need of critical reassessment.",

Each Cu II atom is in a distorted square-pyramidal environment with the equatorial plane formed by two nitrile N atoms from bridging dca groups, one of the two N atoms of the chelate biq molecule and one nitrile N atom from a terminal dca ligand, whereas the second biq N atom occupies the axial position. Thermal decomposition of 1 in an air atmosphere proceeds gradually, with copper(I) cyanide being the final decomposition product.

    "abstract": "The crystal structures of 13 simple salts of cytisine, an alkaloid isolated from the seeds of Laburnum anagyroides, have been determined, namely cytisinium (6-oxo-7,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7]trideca-2,4-dien-11-ium) bromide, C11H15N2O+·Br-, cytisinium iodide, C11H15N2O+·I-, cytisinium perchlorate, C11H15N2O+·ClO4-, cytisinium iodide triiodide, C11H15N2O+·I-·I3-, cytisinium chloride monohydrate, C11H15N2O+·Cl-·H2O, cytisinium iodide monohydrate, C11H15N2O+·I-·H2O, cytisinium nitrate monohydrate, C11H15N2O+·NO3-·H2O, hydrogen dicytisinium tribromide, C22H31N4O23+·3Br-, hydrogen dicytisinium triiodide, C22H31N4O23+·3I-, hydrogen dicytisinium triiodide diiodide, C22H31N4O23+·I3-·2I-, hydrogen dicytisinium bis(triiodide) iodide, C22H31N4O23+·2I3-·I-, cytisinediium (6-oxidaniumylidene-7,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7]trideca-2,4-dien-11-ium) bis(perchlorate), C11H16N2O2+·2ClO4-, and cytisinediium dichloride trihydrate, C11H16N2O2+·2Cl-·3H2O. Cytisine has two potential protonation sites, i.e. the N atom of the piperidine ring and the carbonyl O atom of the pyridone ring. Three forms of the cytisinium cation were identified, namely the monocation, which is always protonated at the N atom, the dication, which utilizes both protonation sites, and the third form, which contains two cytisine moieties connected by very short and linear O...H...O hydrogen bonds, with an O...O distance of approximately 2.4 Å. This third form may therefore be regarded as a 3+ species, or sesqui-cation, and is observed solely in the salts with bromide, iodide or triiodide (heavier halogen) anions. The cation is quite rigid and all 19 cytisinium fragments in the studied series have very similar conformations. The crystal structures are determined mainly by Coulombic interactions and hydrogen bonds, and the latter form is determined by different networks. Additionally, some anion-π and lone-pair...π secondary interactions are identified in almost all of the crystal structures. Hirshfeld surface analysis generally confirms the role of different interactions in the determination of the crystal architecture.",

Water molecules and counter-ions (chloride or nitrate) are involved in the formation of a two-dimensional arrangement by the establishment of hydrogen bonds with the N-H groups of the cation, stabilizing the E isomers in the solid state. The neutral HBzPyS molecule crystallized as the E isomer due to the existence of weak π-π interactions between pairs of molecules. The calculated IR spectrum of the hydrated [H2BzPyS]+ cation is in good agreement with the experimental results.",

In many recent patents, it has been claimed to exist in a very large number of polymorphic, hydrated and solvated phases, although no detailed analysis of the structural features of these forms has been published to date. Here, we have successfully crystallized the tetrahydrate form of IVA-HCl (form β), C 27 H 37 N 2 O 5 + ·Cl − ·4H 2 O, and elucidated its structure for the first time. Simultaneously, a new crystal form of IVA-HCl, i.e. the hemihydrate (form II), C 27 H 37 N 2 O 5 + ·Cl − ·0.5H 2 O, was discovered. Its crystal structure was also accurately determined and compared to that of the tetrahydrate form. While the tetrahydrate form of IVA-HCl crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , the new form (hemihydrate) was solved in the monoclinic space group P 2 1 . Detailed conformational and packing comparisons between the two forms have allowed us to understand the role of water in the crystal assembly of this hydrochloride salt. The stabilities of the two forms were compared theoretically by calculating the binding energy of the water in the crystal lattice using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The stability experiments show that the tetrahydrate is stable under high-humidity conditions, while the hemihydrate is stable under high-temperature conditions.",

Both complexes crystallized in the triclinic space group P \\overline{1}, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In both structures, in one of the independent molecules the tetradentate ligand is almost planar while in the other independent molecule the ligand shows significant distortions from planarity, as illustrated by the largest distance from the plane constructed through the central metal atom and the O , N , N ′, O ′-coordinating atoms of the ligand in 1 of 1.155 (3) Å and a distance of 1.1707 (3) Å in 2 . The possible reason for this is that there are various strong π-interactions in the structures. This was confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, as were the other crystallographic data. DFT was also used to predict the outcome of cyclic voltammetry experiments. Ligand oxidation is more stabilized in the gallium complex. Solid-state photoluminescence gave an 80 nm red-shifted spectrum for the gallium complex, whereas the aluminium complex maintains the ligand curve with a smaller red shift of 40 nm.",

However, in order to facilitate the analysis of the striking pseudosymmetry relating the four independent molecules, the structure has been analysed and reported in the nonconventional centred B-1 space-group setting. Pseudosymmetry is an eminently local property, valid only in the realm of the unit-cell boundary and not propagating to the whole crystal structure. It has been analyzed using the MP procedure described in the preceding article [Baggio (2019). Acta Cryst. C75, 837-850]. The molecules consist of a rigid core made up of three rings (five-, six- and seven-membered) and an extra six-membered ring joined to the latter group by a single C-C bond, together with a clamping intramolecular C-H...O interaction preventing free rotation and providing additional rigidity. The four molecules in the asymmetric unit pair into dimers with almost exact twofold pseudosymmetry, further linked into (001) slabs as the building bricks of the structure. Interpenetration of slabs finally leads to a three-dimensional structure of unusual compactness for an organic structure, with a Kitaigorodskii packing index of ca 0.71.",

In general, O -acetylation exerts little effect on the exo- and endocyclic C—C and endocyclic C—O bond lengths, but the exocyclic C—O bonds involved in O -acetylation are lengthened by ∼0.02 Å. The conformation of the O -acetyl side-chains is highly conserved, with the carbonyl O atom either eclipsing the H atom attached to a 2°-alcoholic C atom or bisecting the H—C—H bond angle of a 1°-alcoholic C atom. Of the two C—O bonds that determine O -acetyl side-chain conformation, that involving the alcoholic C atom exhibits greater rotational variability than that involving the carbonyl C atom. These findings are in good agreement with recent solution NMR studies of O -acetyl side-chain conformations in saccharides. Experimental evidence was also obtained to confirm density functional theory (DFT) predictions of C—O and O—H bond-length behavior in a C—O—H fragment involved in hydrogen bonding.",

Complex 2 features a tetranuclear supramolecular macrocycle, in which each ligand adopts a tridentate coordination mode with the oxadiazole ring next to the p -tolyl ring coordinated and that next to the pyridyl ring free. Two L5 ligands are bound to two Ag1 centres through two oxadiazole N and two pyridyl N atoms to form a macrocycle. The other two oxadiazole N atoms coordinate to the two Ag2 centres of the Ag 2 (O 2 CCF 3 ) 4 dimer. Each CF 3 CO 2 − anion adopts a μ 3 -coordination mode, bridging the Ag1 and Ag2 centres to form a tetranuclear silver(I) complex. This study indicates that the donor ability of the bridging oxadiazole rings can be tuned by electron-withdrawing and -donating substituents. The emission properties of ligands L1 and L5 and complexes 1 and 2 were also investigated in the solid state.",

Their crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. One of them (denoted 1 ) crystallizes in the space group P 6 3 / mmc and is isostructural with disilicates K 3 LuSi 2 O 7 , K 3 ScSi 2 O 7 and K 3 YSi 2 O 7 , while the other (denoted 2 ) crystallizes in the space group P 6 3 / mcm and is isostructural with disilicates K 3 NdSi 2 O 7 , K 3 REESi 2 O 7 (REE = Gd–Yb), K 3 YSi 2 O 7 , K 3 (Y 0.9 Dy 0.1 )Si 2 O 7 and K 3 SmSi 2 O 7 . In the crystal structure of polymorph 1 , the Er cations are in an almost perfect octahedral coordination, while in the crystal structure of polymorph 2 , part of the Er cations are in a slightly distorted octahedral coordination and the other part are in an ideal trigonal prismatic coordination environment. Sharing six corners, disilicate Si 2 O 7 groups in the crystal structure of polymorph 1 link six ErO 6 octahedra, forming a three-dimensional network and nine-coordinated potassium cations are located in its holes. In the crystal structure of polymorph 2 , the disilicate Si 2 O 7 groups connect four ErO 6 octahedra, as well as one ErO 6 trigonal prism. Three differently coordinated potassium cations are situated between them. Different site symmetries of the erbium cations in the crystal structures of polymorphs 1 and 2 affect their photoluminescence properties. Only polymorph 2 exhibits luminescence. Intense narrow lines in the emission spectrum are a result of the 4 f –4 f transition. The green emission line at 560 nm is the result of the Er 3+ transition 4 S 3/2 → 4 I 15/2 , and the luminescence line at 690 nm is the result of a 4 F 9/2 → 4 I 15/2 transition. The crystal morphologies of the two polymorphs are similar. Crystals of polymorph 1 are in the form of a hexagonal prism in combination with a hexagonal base, while crystals of polymorph 2 contain a dihexagonal prism in combination with a hexagonal base, although poorly developed faces of the dihexagonal pyramid can also be noticed.",

The compounds crystallize in the monoclinic space group C 2/ m for ( I ) and in the triclinic space group P \\overline{1} for ( II ); however, they have somewhat similar features. In the asymmetric unit of ( I ), the Li and Cr atoms both have space-group-imposed 2/ m site symmetry, while only half of the oxalate ligand is present and two independent water molecules lie on the mirror plane. The water O atoms around the Li atom are disordered over two equivalent positions separated by 0.54 (4) Å. In the asymmetric unit of ( II ), the atoms of one C 2 O 4 2− ligand and two independent water molecules are in general positions, and the Na and Cr atoms lie on an inversion centre. Taking into account the symmetry sites of both metallic elements, the unit cells may be described as pseudo-face-centred monoclinic for ( I ) and as pseudo-centred triclinic for ( II ). Both crystal structures are comprised of one-dimensional chains of alternating trans -Cr(CO) 4 (H 2 O) 2 and trans - A (CO) 4 (H 2 O) 2 units μ 2 -bridged by bis-chelating oxalate ligands. The resulting linear chains are parallel to the [101] direction for ( I ) and to the [11\\overline{1}] direction for ( II ). Within the two coordination polymers, strong hydrogen bonds result in tetrameric R 4 4 (12) synthons which link the metal chains, thus leading to two-dimensaional supramolecular architectures. The two structures differ from each other with respect to the symmetry relations inside the ligand, the role of electrostatic forces in the crystal structure and the molecular interactions of the hydrogen-bonded networks. Moreover, they exhibit the same UV–Vis pattern typical of a Cr III centrosymmetric geometry, while the IR absorption shows some differences due to the oxalate-ligand conformation. Polymers ( I ) and ( II ) are also distinguished by a different behaviours during the decomposition process, the precursor ( I ) leading to the oxide LiCrO 2 , while the residues of ( II ) consist of a mixture of sodium carbonate and Cr III oxide.",

PGTFH dehydrates in one step centred at 353 K and crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C 2/ c , whereas the anhydrous compound (PGTF) crystallizes in the triclinic space group P \\overline{1}. The dehydration process in PGTFH is preceded by a weakening of both the noncovalent aromatic–aromatic interactions and the packing contacts. This process is accompanied by the breakage of medium-strength O—H...O hydrogen bonds between ions inside layers and a reorganization of the ions within the layers. This reorganization results in the formation of two different ion pairs (DL-phenylglycinium trifluoromethanesulfonate) and the formation of a new hydrogen-bond network. The dehydration process does not destroy the nature of the crystal structure. Both crystals, i.e. hydrated and anhydrous, have a layered structure, although the layers of each crystal are arranged somewhat differently.",

Probably because his students never examined their crystals under a microscope, they failed to observe the `third' species, thereby ruining Werner's argument since he relied strictly on color to identify them. That was fortunate since our purple salt would have led him to abandon, or certainly delay, his momentous discovery. Our crystals consist of a 1:1 mixture of the cis and trans cations, thereby sharing the same elemental analysis and conductivity as the single salts, but not their crystal structure, inasmuch as X-ray diffraction had not even been discovered then. Serendipitously, our discovery would have been a great boon to his theoretical acumen, while his `two-color' argument may have doomed him.",

The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that L functions as a monodentate ligand in mononuclear 1 , while it coordinates in a bidentate manner to two independent Fe(SCN) 2 units in complex 2 , with a different conformation from that in 1 and the ligands point in two almost orthogonal directions, therefore leading to a two-dimensional grid-like network. Investigation of the magnetic properties reveals the always high-spin state of the Fe II centre over the whole temperature range in 1 and a gradual thermally-induced incomplete spin crossover (SCO) behaviour below 150 K in 2 , demonstrating the influence of the different coordination fields on the spin properties of the metal ions. The current results provide useful information for the rational design of functional complexes with different structure dimensionalities by employing different conformations of the ligand and different crystallization methods.",

    "abstract": "Porphyrins are valuable constituents in optoelectronic, catalytic, and other applications, yet control of intermolecular π–π stacking is invariably essential to attain the desired properties. Superstructures built onto the porphyrin, often via meso -aryl groups, can afford facial encumbrance that suppresses π–π stacking, although some molecular designs have provided insufficient facial coverage and many have entailed cumbersome syntheses. In this study, a copper(II) porphyrin bearing four meso substituents, namely, {10,20-bis[2,6-bis(octyloxy)phenyl]-5,15-dibromoporphinato}copper(II), [Cu(C 64 H 82 Br 2 N 4 O 4 )], was prepared by metalation of the corresponding free-base porphyrin and was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structure reveals a dihedral angle of 111.1 (2)° for the plane of the meso -aryl group relative to the plane of the porphyrin, with both aryl groups tilted in the same direction. Each of the four octyloxy groups exhibits a gauche conformation for the –OCH 2 CH 2 – unit but is extended with four or five anti (–CH 2 CH 2 –/H) conformations thereafter, causing each octyl group to span the dimension of the macrocycle. In a global frame of reference where the two Br atoms define the north/south poles and the two aryl groups are at antipodes on the equator, two octyl groups of one aryl unit project over the northern hemisphere (covering pyrroles A and B ), whereas those of the other aryl unit project over the southern hemisphere (covering pyrroles C and D ). Together, the four octyl groups ensheath the two faces of the porphyrin in a self-wrapped assembly. The closest approach of the Cu atom to an octyl methylene C atom (position 6) is 3.5817 (18) Å, the mean separations of neighboring porphyrin planes are 8.059 (4) and 4.693 (8) Å along the a and c axes, respectively, and the center-to-center distances between the Cu atoms of neighboring porphyrins are 10.2725 (4), 12.2540 (6), and 12.7472 (6) Å along the a , b , and c axes, respectively. The Hirshfeld surface analysis and two-dimensional (2D) fingerprint plots provide information concerning contact interactions in the supramolecular assembly of the solid crystal.",

    "abstract": "Thermal-induced transformation of glutamic acid to pyroglutamic acid is well known. However, confusion remains over the exact temperature at which this happens. Moreover, no diffraction data are available to support the transition. In this article, we make a systematic investigation involving thermal analysis, hot-stage microscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction to study a one-pot thermal transition of glutamic acid to pyroglutamic acid and subsequent self-cocrystallization between the product (hydrated pyroglutamic acid) and the unreacted precursor (glutamic acid). The melt upon cooling gave a robust cocrystal, namely, glutamic acid-pyroglutamic acid-water (1/1/1), C5H7NO3·C5H9NO4·H2O, whose structure has been elucidated from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data collected at room temperature. A three-dimensional network of strong hydrogen bonds has been found. A Hirshfeld surface analysis was carried out to make a quantitative estimation of the intermolecular interactions. In order to gain insight into the strength and stability of the cocrystal, the transferability principle was utilized to make a topological analysis and to study the electron-density-derived properties. The transferred model has been found to be superior to the classical independent atom model (IAM). The experimental results have been compared with results from a multipolar refinement carried out using theoretical structure factors generated from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Very strong classical hydrogen bonds drive the cocrystallization and lend stability to the resulting cocrystal. Important conclusions have been drawn about this transition.",

The title compound displays a highly selective and sensitive sensing for Fe3+ ions in aqueous solution. In addition, it displays a high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) in water under UV light irradiation.",

Both Rietveld refinement (of laboratory XRD data) and real-space refinement (of PDF data) were used to analyse all samples. The results of Rietveld and real-space refinements were compared to evaluate their application to crystalline and nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite. Significant relationships were observed between real-space refinement parameters and increasing carbonate substitution.

The structure of BATZM·Cl 2 can be described as a V-shaped molecule with reasonable chemical geometry and no disorder, and its one-dimensional structure can be described as a rhombic helix. The specific molar heat capacity ( C p ,m ) of BATZM·Cl 2 was determined using the continuous C p mode of a microcalorimeter and theoretical calculations, and the C p ,m value is 276.18 J K −1 mol −1 at 298.15 K. The relative deviations between the theoretical and experimental values of C p ,m , H T – H 298.15K and S T – S 298.15K of BATZM·Cl 2 are almost equivalent at each temperature.

    "abstract": "Molecular motion in crystals has attracted much attention for the development of stimuli-responsive materials. The most studied are molecules with few atoms or highly symmetrical molecules. To develop molecules with new motion characteristics, we synthesized a charge-transfer compound, namely, tropylium hexafluoridoantimonate(V)-1,4-dimethylnaphthalene (1/1), (C7H7)[SbF6]·C12H12, and studied its structural phase transition. In this compound, the tropylium cation and the 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene molecule have planar geometry, but the latter has low symmetry. They are stacked as a one-dimensional chain structure through π-π charge-transfer interactions. Weak intermolecular interactions and planar molecular geometry result in a large degree of freedom of in-plane motion. Upon heating, due to the in-plane rotation of the molecules, the compound undergoes an order-disorder structural phase transition (phase-transition temperature = 334 K). The space group of the room-temperature phase is P21/m and the space group of the high-temperature phase is P4/mmm. This phase transition is accompanied by significant dielectric anomalies. The current investigation shows that the structural features of the title compound can be used to construct functional materials with phase transitions, such as molecular ferroelectrics.",

In salt ( I ), the creatinine cation and bromide anion are connected through a pair of N—H...Br hydrogen bonds forming R 4 2 (8) and R 4 2 (12) ring motifs. In salts ( II ) and ( III ), the creatinine cation interacts with the corresponding anion via a pair of N—H...O hydrogen bonds.

    "abstract": "Comprehensive chemical characterization for two isomers of camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), occasionally used in the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), was performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectroscopy in negative electrospray ionization mode and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in electron ionization mode. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra together with quantum chemical calculations using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) were used to assign the stereochemistry for CSA for the first time and these assignments were then confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. As crystals were grown under the same conditions of high supersaturation using a mixed solvent without water removal, the crystal structures of the two enantiomers contained one ordered molecule of water in the asymmetric unit. The crystals of the (+)-enantiomer have a 1 S ,4 R configuration and the H atom of the sulfonic acid group combines with the water molecule to form a hydronium ion, namely, hydronium (1 S ,4 R )-(7,7-dimethyl-2-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-1-yl)methanesulfonate, H 3 O + ·C 10 H 15 O 4 S − . The crystals of the (−)-enantiomer have a 1 R ,4 S configuration. The determination of the optical purity of CSA using NMR spectroscopy with a chiral solvating agent, (1 R ,2 R )-1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-diamine, and GC/MS with a chiral column has been well explored. The results showed that the examined samples of these two isomers of CSA proved to be enantiomerically pure. In particular, for (1 R )-(−)-10-camphorsulfonic acid, this is, to our knowledge, the first description on its spectral characterization in a scientific context.",

    "abstract": "The single crystal of 4-iodobenzonitrile (C 7 H 4 IN) is brittle, whereas those of 4-bromobenzonitrile (C 7 H 4 BrN) and one of the two forms of 4-chlorobenzonitrile (C 7 H 4 ClN) are compliant in nature. The chloro crystal exhibits elastic bending, but in spite of having stronger halogen bonds, the bromo crystal exhibits plastic bending. Crystal structures have been analyzed to understand the different bending properties of these three crystals. In all three cases, the molecules form C— X ...N[triple-bond]C ( X = halogen) halogen-bonded chains in their respective crystal structures. Statistical analyses and DFT calculations on the C— X ...N[triple-bond]C halogen bonds reveal that the optimum geometry of all three halogen bonds is linear and the C—I...N[triple-bond]C bond is strongest among the three. However, when the geometry deviates from linearity, the energy loss is very high in the case of the C—I...N[triple-bond]C bond compared to the other two systems. This explains why 4-iodobenzonitrile is brittle, whereas the other two are flexible. The interactions in 4-bromobenzonitrile are more isotropic than those in 4-chlorobenzonitrile. The iodo and chloro compounds crystallize in centrosymmetric space groups, whereas the crystal of the bromo compound lacks inversion symmetry. In spite of this difference in their space groups, the chloro and bromo crystals have very similar crystal packing. In the case of the bromo crystal, the halogen-bonded chains are parallel to the bending axis (long axis) of the crystal. However, these chains are significantly tilted in the case of the chloro crystal. The isotropic/anisotropic interactions, presence/absence of an inversion centre and the different alignment of the halogen-bonded chains with respect to the bending axis could explain the different bending properties of the chloro and bromo crystals.",

The zwitterionic molecules of DFX are packed in stacks and this structural motif can be defined as a basic one from a supramolecular and energetic point of view. Hirshfeld surface analysis was used for an additional interpretation of the close contacts. The nature of the intermolecular interactions was evaluated in a pairwise manner. Destabilizing interactions were also discussed. In the context of our study on danofloxacin, we addressed the question: how common is a zwitterionic form for fluoroquinolones (FQ) in the crystalline state? A survey of the Cambridge Structural Database limited to anhydrous/hydrated/solvated forms of the most typical FQs revealed that neutral molecules are preferred, while zwitterions are less common.",

Thus, the two isomorphous pseudopolymorphs of 2,4-diamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine, i.e. (I) and (II), form a three-dimensional network, while the N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one solvate of 6-aminoisocytosine, i.e. (IV), displays two-dimensional layers.

The compounds can be used as dyes and pigments due to their long-range conjugated systems. Four structures were studied using (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectroscopy, viz. with R = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl, (1a), R = cyclohexyl, (1b), R = tert-butyl, (1c), and R = isopropyl, (1d). A detailed discussion is presented regarding the characteristics of the three-dimensional structures based on NMR analysis and the X-ray crystal structure of (1a), namely tetramethyl 4,4'-(ethane-1,2-diylidene)bis[5-oxo-1-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrole-2,3-dicarboxylate], C36H36N2O10.

The asymmetric unit contains half a perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylate (ptca(4-)) anion with twofold symmetry, two 4-aminopyridinium (4-Hap(+)) cations and four water molecules. Strong N-H···O hydrogen bonds connect each ptca(4-) anion with four 4-Hap(+) cations to form a one-dimensional linear chain along the [010] direction, decorated by additional 4-Hap(+) cations attached by weak N-H···O hydrogen bonds to the ptca(4-) anions. Intermolecular O-H···O interactions of water molecules with ptca(4-) and 4-Hap(+) ions complete the three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding network. From the viewpoint of topology, each ptca(4-) anion acts as a 16-connected node by hydrogen bonding to six 4-Hap(+) cations and ten water molecules to yield a highly connected hydrogen-bonding framework. π-π interactions between 4-Hap(+) cations, and between 4-Hap(+) cations and ptca(4-) anions, further stabilize the three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding network.",

    "abstract": "The past two decades have witnessed a veritable explosion of reports detailing the solid-state structures of coordination compounds consisting of conceptually infinite one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional nets and three-dimensional frameworks.The obvious common feature shared by these different types of compounds is that they all consist of metal-containing nodes that are 'infinitely' bridged by exo-multidentate ligands.Unfortunately there has been little consistency in the literature with regard to the terminology used to describe such materials and it is therefore essential to preface any credible discussion of extended coordination entities with a comment on nomenclature.In this regard, the reader is encouraged to consult the final report of the IUPAC task group on 'Coordination Polymers and Metal Organic Frameworks: Terminology and Nomenclature Guidelines' (Batten et al., 2013).In accordance with the task group's recommendations, the author of this editorial regards all structures comprised of coordination entities extending in one, two or three dimensions to be coordination polymers.Structures that extend in two or three dimensions can further be classified as coordination networks, while those that contain potential voids can additionally be referred to as metal-organic frameworks.Taken at face value, the concepts involved are relatively simple; crystalline coordination polymers are most often formed from solutions containing metal ions and bridging ligands.Nodes derived from the metal ions may become linked in various possible ways that adhere to the symmetries and periodicities normally inherent to crystal packing.The rich diversity of architectures arising from these relatively simple preparations is due to the many factors that can influence metalligand connectivity.Since many of these factors can be controlled relatively easily, the field of coordination polymer research is still wide open for significant further exploration.Moreover, the ever-increasing popularity of the field is also strongly linked to the widespread availability of modern X-ray diffractometers and advanced crystal structure solution/refinement software packages that enable even relatively inexperienced crystallographers to carry out routine analyses.The seemingly unlimited opportunities for preparing novel coordination polymers arise not only from obvious choices that influence structural topology (i.e.bridging ligand geometry and metal ion coordination mode) but also from a range of other factors, some of which can be quite subtle.These include (but are not limited to): counter-ions, solvent systems, mixtures of ligands and/or metal ions, ligand flexibility, proclivity for metal cluster formation, interpenetration and crystallization conditions.In the overriding majority of cases it is still not possible to construct desired framework topologies at will simply by judicious choice of the various factors at play.However, it is widely acknowledged that the control of internal architecture is one of the 'holy grails' of the vast field of crystal engineering owing to the promise that rational design strategies hold for new and potentially useful materials.Indeed, metal-organic frameworks, a distinct subclass of three-dimensional coordination polymers, have been widely studied in the context of their porous features with a view to rivalling the useful properties of zeolites for gas storage and separation as well as catalysis.Other desirable properties that may ultimately result from bottom-up materials design include magnetism, luminescence, fluorescence and anomalous thermal expansion.In order to gain significant insight into the self-assembly of a judiciously selected set of components, it is important to first amass a large collection of crystal structures.It is hoped that the knowledge thus gained can then be applied",

The transformation was found to be reversible, as on raising the temperature the crystal reverted to monoclinic form (I). In the asymmetric unit of form (I), Z' = 1, while in form (II), Z' = 2, with a very small reduction (ca 1.8%) in the unit-cell volume. The two independent molecules (A and B) in form (II) are related by a pseudo-twofold screw axis along the b axis. The molecular overlay of molecule A on molecule B has an r.m.s. deviation of 0.353 Å, with the largest distance between two equivalent atoms being 1.202 Å. The reaction of calix[4]pyrrolidine, the fully reduced form of meso-octamethylporphyrinogen, with FeCl3 gave a red-brown solid that was recrystallized from ethanol in air, resulting in the formation of the title compound. In both forms, (I) and (II), the Fe(III) atoms are coordinated to the macrocyclic ligand and have distorted octahedral FeN4OCl coordination spheres. These Fe(III) atoms lie out of the mean plane of the four N atoms, displaced towards the O atom of the [OFeCl3] unit by 0.2265 (5) Å in form (I), and by 0.2210 (14) and 0.2089 (14) Å, respectively, in the two independent molecules (A and B) of form (II). The geometry of the [OFeCl3] units are similar, with each Fe(III) atom having a tetrahedral coordination sphere. The NH H atoms are directed below the planes of the macrocycles and are hydrogen bonded to the coordinated Cl(-) ions. There are also intramolecular C-H···Cl hydrogen bonds present in both (I) and (II). In form (I), there are no significant intermolecular interactions present. In form (II), the individual molecules are arranged in alternate layers parallel to the ac plane. The B molecules are linked by a C-H···Cl hydrogen bond, forming chains along [100].",

The asymmetric unit contains two metal centres, one of which (Mn1) lies on an inversion centre, while the other (Mn2) is placed close to an inversion centre on a general position. Since all the acetates behave as bridging ligands, although with different μ2- and μ3-coordination modes, a one-dimensional polymeric structure is formed, based on trinuclear repeat units (Mn1...Mn2...Mn2'), in which the Mn2 and Mn2' sites are related by an inversion centre. Within this monomeric block, the metal-metal separations are Mn1...Mn2 = 3.36180 (18) Å and Mn2...Mn2' = 4.4804 (3) Å. Cation Mn1, located on an inversion centre, displays an [MnO6] coordination sphere, while Mn2, on a general position, has a slightly stronger [MnO5N] ligand field, as the sixth coordination site is occupied by a pyridine molecule. Both centres approximate an octahedral ligand field. The chains are parallel in the crystal structure and interact via hydrogen bonds involving coordinated water molecules. However, the shortest metal-metal separation between two chains [5.3752 (3) Å] is large compared with the intrachain interactions. These structural features are compatible with a single-chain magnet behaviour, as confirmed by preliminary magnetic studies.",

Compound (I) is a mixed dimer–polymer based on magnesium ion centres and can be regarded as the first example of a magnesium–tetrazolate polymer in the crystalline form. The structure shows a complex three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network that involves magnesium–tetrazolate dimers, solvent water molecules and one-dimensional magnesium–tetrazolate polymeric chains. The intrinsic cohesion in the polymer chains is ensured by N—H...N hydrogen bonds, which form R 2 2 (7) rings, thus reinforcing the propagation of the polymer chain along the a axis. The crystal structure of magnesium tetrazole salt (II) reveals a mixed ribbon of hydrogen-bonded rings, of types R 2 2 (7), R 2 2 (9) and R 2 4 (10), running along the c axis, which are linked by R 2 4 (16) rings, generating a 4,8-c flu net.",

The -NO2 groups of methyl parathion (systematic name: dimethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate, C8H10NO5PS) and dicapthon (systematic name: 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl dimethyl phosphorothioate, C8H9ClNO5PS) make dihedral angles of 10.67 (8) and 5.8 (1)°, respectively, with the planes of their attached rings, which accompanies angular distortion at the ring C atoms to which the -NO2 groups are attached. Similar distortions are observed at the C atom to which the thiophosphate groups are attached. Significant differences in distances and angles around the phenolic O, versus the -OMe groups, explain why it is the site of hydrolysis for these compounds. A comparison of a torsion angle involving the thiophosphate group and phenolic O atom with similar pesticide structures is given and indicates steric influences on that angle.",

The results show that in (1), the dithiobiurea anion forms a dimer via N-H···N hydrogen bonds and the dimers are connected into wide hydrogen-bonded ribbons. The guest tetrapropylammonium cation changes its character to become the host molecule, generating pseudo-channels containing the aforementioned ribbons by C-H···S contacts, yielding the three-dimensional network structure. In comparison, in (2), the dithiobiurea anions are linked via N-H···S interactions, producing one-dimensional chains which pack to generate two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded layers. These layers accommodate the guest tetrabutylammonium cations, resulting in a sandwich-like layer structure with host-guest C-H···S contacts.",

Two intramolecular hydrogen bonds are observed between adjacent pairs of N atoms of the macrocycle. Two intramolecular hydrogen bonds are also observed between the protonated amine groups and the pendant carboxylate groups. A short intermolecular hydrogen bond is observed between two partially negatively charged O atoms on adjacent macrocycles.

The asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically independent Cu atoms, one of which is Cu II , while the other has been reduced to the Cu I ion. The Cu II centre is pentacoordinated by three O atoms from three bpt 3− ligands, one N atom from a 1,4-bib ligand and one O atom from a coordinated water molecule, and the coordination geometry can be described as distorted trigonal bipyramidal. The Cu I atom exhibits a T-shaped geometry (CuN 2 O) coordinated by one O atom from a bpt 3− ligand and two N atoms from two 1,4-bib ligands. The Cu II atoms are extended by bpt 3− and 1,4-bib linkers to generate a two-dimensional network, while the Cu I atoms are linked by 1,4-bib ligands, forming one-dimensional chains along the [20\\overline{1}] direction. In addition, the completely deprotonated μ 4 -η 1 :η 1 :η 1 :η 1 bpt 3− ligands bridge one Cu I and three Cu II cations along the a (or [100]) direction to form a three-dimensional framework with a (10 3 ) 2 (10) 2 (4 2 .6.10 2 .12) 2 (4 2 .6.8 2 .10) 2 (8) topology via a 2,2,3,4,4-connected net.

    "abstract": "The application of transition metal chelates as chemotherapeutic agents has the advantage that they can be used as a scaffold around which ligands with DNA recognition elements can be anchored. The facile substitution of these components allows for the DNA recognition and binding properties of the metal chelates to be tuned. Copper is a particularly interesting choice for the development of novel metallodrugs as it is an endogenous metal and is therefore less toxic than other transition metals. The title compound, [Cu(C 16 H 11 N 2 O) 2 ], was synthesized by reacting N -(quinolin-8-yl)benzamide and the metal in a 2:1 ratio. Ligand coordination required deprotonation of the amide N—H group and the isolated complex is therefore neutral. The metal ion adopts a flattened tetrahedral coordination geometry with the ligands in a pseudo- trans configuration. The free rotation afforded by the formal single bond between the amide group and phenyl ring allows the phenyl rings to rotate out-of-plane, thus alleviating nonbonded repulsion between the phenyl rings and the quinolyl groups within the complex. Weak C—H...O interactions stabilize a dimer in the solid state. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations at the PBE/6-311G(dp) level of theory show that the solid-state structure ( C 1 symmetry) is 79.33 kJ mol −1 higher in energy than the lowest energy gas-phase structure ( C 2 symmetry). Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis offers an explanation for the formation of the C—H...O interactions in electrostatic terms, but the stabilizing effect is insufficient to support the dimer in the gas phase.",

A computational study of all isomeric locations of the H atom shows the similarity of their energies, which is subject to perturbation by intermolecular hydrogen bonding found in X-ray work on the solid state. These density functional calculations reveal that the isomer with the H atom located as found in the solid state contains a neutral radical Hbtzp ligand and tetravalent d 1 V center, but that these two unpaired electrons are more stable as an open-shell singlet and hence antiferromagnetically coupled.",

Further R2(2)(8) hydrogen-bond motifs involving either two N-H...O or two N-H...S hydrogen bonds were observed in three crystal structures, namely (I), (IV) and (VIII). In all eight structures, the residue at the ring 5-position shows a coplanar arrangement with respect to the pyrimidine ring which is in agreement with a search of the Cambridge Structural Database for six-membered cyclic compounds containing a carboxy group. The search confirmed that coplanarity between the carboxy group and the cyclic residue is strongly favoured.",

    "abstract": "The reactions of two 3-(2-allylanilino)-3-phenylacrylate esters with acetic anhydride and with strong acids has revealed a richly diverse reactivity providing a number of unexpected products. Thus, acetylation of ethyl 3-(2-allylanilino)-3-phenylacrylate, (Ia), or ethyl 3-(2-allyl-4-methylanilino)-3-phenylacrylate, (Ib), with acetic anhydride yields not only the expected acetylated esters, (II), as the major products but also the unexpected polysubstituted quinolines 3-acetyl-8-allyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl acetate, (IIIa), and 3-acetyl-8-allyl-6-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl acetate, (IIIb), as minor products. Subsequent reaction of the major product ethyl 2-[(2-allyl-4-methylanilino)(phenyl)methylidene]-3-oxobutanoate, (IIb), with concentrated sulfuric acid did not provide the expected 3-acetylquinoline derivative, but instead two unexpected products, namely ethyl 4-ethyl-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate, (IV), and ethyl 3-acetyl-4-ethyl-2-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate, (V), in yields of 39 and 22%, respectively. The reaction of (Ib) with Eaton's reagent gave both the quinoline (Z)-6-methyl-2-phenyl-8-(prop-1-en-1-yl)quinolin-4(1H)-one, (VI), and the unexpected tricyclic product (2RS)-2,8-dimethyl-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-6H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-6-one, (VII), in yields of 71 and 12%, respectively. The products (II)-(VII) have all been fully characterized spectroscopically and the crystal structures of two of the unexpected products, i.e. (IIIb) (C23H21NO3) and (VII) (C19H17NO), are reported here. The formation of compounds (IV), (V) and (VII) all require an isomerization of the initial allyl substituent, with migration of the C=C double bond from the terminal site to the internal site. In (IIIb), the two acetyl substituents are oriented such that the intramolecular distance between the two carbonyl O atoms is only 3.243 (2) Å, and in (VII), the five-membered ring adopts a twisted half-chair conformation. The molecules of compound (IIIb) are linked by two independent hydrogen bonds to form sheets built from R4(3)(20) rings and the sheets are linked by a π-π stacking interaction to form a three-dimensional framework structure. The molecules of compound (VII) are linked by a single type of C-H...O hydrogen bond to form centrosymmetric R2(2)(14) dimers. The molecules of compound (V), which crystallizes with Z' = 2, are linked by two N-H...O and two C-H...O hydrogen bonds, forming a chain of rings.",

    "abstract": "Coordination polymers are a thriving class of functional solid-state materials and there have been noticeable efforts and progress toward designing periodic functional structures with desired geometrical attributes and chemical properties for targeted applications. Self-assembly of metal ions and organic ligands is one of the most efficient and widely utilized methods for the construction of CPs under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions. 2-(Pyridin-3-yl)-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate (HPIDC(2-)) has been proven to be an excellent multidentate ligand due to its multiple deprotonation and coordination modes. Crystals of poly[aquabis[μ3-5-carboxy-2-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxylato-κ(5)N(1),O(5):N(3),O(4):N(2)]copper(II)dicopper(I)], [Cu(II)Cu(I)2(C10H5N3O4)2(H2O)]n, (I), were obtained from 2-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (H3PIDC) and copper(II) chloride under hydrothermal conditions. The asymmetric unit consists of one independent Cu(II) ion, two Cu(I) ions, two HPIDC(2-) ligands and one coordinated water molecule. The Cu(II) centre displays a square-pyramidal geometry (CuN2O3), with two N,O-chelating HPIDC(2-) ligands occupying the basal plane in a trans geometry and one O atom from a coordinated water molecule in the axial position. The Cu(I) atoms adopt three-coordinated Y-shaped coordinations. In each [CuN2O] unit, deprotonated HPIDC(2-) acts as an N,O-chelating ligand, and a symmetry-equivalent HPIDC(2-) ligand acts as an N-atom donor via the pyridine group. The HPIDC(2-) ligands in the polymer serve as T-shaped 3-connectors and adopt a μ3-κ(2)N,O:κ(2)N',O':κN''-coordination mode, linking one Cu(II) and two Cu(I) cations. The Cu cations are arranged in one-dimensional -Cu1-Cu2-Cu3- chains along the [001] direction. Further crosslinking of these chains by HPIDC(2-) ligands along the b axis in a -Cu2-HPIDC(2-)-Cu3-HPIDC(2-)-Cu1- sequence results in a two-dimensional polymer in the (100) plane. The resulting (2,3)-connected net has a (12(3))2(12)3 topology. Powder X-ray diffraction confirmed the phase purity for (I), and susceptibilty measurements indicated a very weak ferromagnetic behaviour. A thermogravimetric analysis shows the loss of the apical aqua ligand before decomposition of the title compound.",

    "abstract": "The preparation of coordination polymers (CPs) based on either transition metal centres or rare-earth cations has grown considerably in recent decades. The different coordination chemistry of these metals allied to the use of a large variety of organic linkers has led to an amazing structural diversity. Most of these compounds are based on carboxylic acids or nitrogen-containing ligands. More recently, a wide range of molecules containing phosphonic acid groups have been reported. For the particular case of Ca(2+)-based CPs, some interesting functional materials have been reported. A novel one-dimensional Ca(2+)-based coordination polymer with a new organic linker, namely poly[[diaqua[μ4-(4,5-dicyano-1,2-phenylene)bis(phosphonato)][μ3-(4,5-dicyano-1,2-phenylene)bis(phosphonato)]dicalcium(II)] tetrahydrate], {[Ca2(C8H4N2O6P2)2(H2O)2]·4H2O}n, has been prepared at ambient temperature. The crystal structure features one-dimensional ladder-like ∞(1)[Ca2(H2cpp)2(H2O)2] polymers [H2cpp is (4,5-dicyano-1,2-phenylene)bis(phosphonate)], which are created by two distinct coordination modes of the anionic H2cpp(2-) cyanophosphonate organic linkers: while one molecule is only bound to Ca(2+) cations via the phosphonate groups, the other establishes an extra single connection via a cyano group. Ladders close pack with water molecules through an extensive network of strong and highly directional O-H...O and O-H...N hydrogen bonds; the observed donor-acceptor distances range from 2.499 (5) to 3.004 (6) Å and the interaction angles were found in the range 135-178°. One water molecule was found to be disordered over three distinct crystallographic positions. A detailed solution-state NMR study of the organic linker is also provided.",

The conformation of the macrocyclic compound is very important for co-receptor recognition.

Characterization by elemental, spectroscopic and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses shows that the asymmetric unit contains half of a centrosymmetric molecule. The molecular structure shows a trans conformation for the two methylene bridges owing to molecular symmetry. The crystal structure is stabilized by intramolecular C—H...N hydrogen bonds.

    "abstract": "The study of ternary systems is interesting because it introduces the concept of molecular preference/competition into the system where one molecule may be displaced because the association between the other two is significantly stronger. Current definitions of a tertiary system indicate that solvent molecules are excluded from the molecule count of the system and some of the latest definitions state that any molecule that is not a solid in the parent form at room temperature should also be excluded from the molecule count. In the structure of the quinoline adduct hydrate of tryptaminium 3,5-dinitrobenzoate, 3C10H13N2+·3C7H3N2O6-·2C9H7N·2H2O, the asymmetric unit comprises multiple cation and anion species which are conformationally similar among each type set. In the crystal, a one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded supramolecular structure is generated through extensive intra- and inter-unit aminium N-H...O and N-H...N, and water O-H...O hydrogen bonds. Within the central-core hydrogen-bonding associations, conjoined cyclic R44(10), R53(10) and R44(12) motifs are generated. The unit is expanded into a one-dimensional column-like polymer extending along [010]. Present also in the crystal packing of the structure are a total of 19 π-π interactions involving both cation, anion and quinoline species [ring-centroid separation range = 3.395 (3)-3.797 (3) Å], as well as a number of weak C-H...O hydrogen-bonding associations. The presence of the two water molecules in the crystal structure is considered to be the principal causative factor in the low symmetry of the asymmetric unit.",

    "abstract": "The first question which arises when considering such a book is: who in 2016 is still using a dictionary instead of an inter­net search engine? Beginning my review, I had no clear answer to this question, but, since it is an impressive book (more than 1500 pages), and since it was on my desk, I decided to give it a chance.\r\n\r\nI began to search systematically for the chemical words I encountered in my teaching and research work. I have been impressed by the quality of the definitions given and by the number of words present in this dictionary. I then decided to explore the content of the dictionary for compounds, i.e. their commercial names (e.g. Ludox®), trade names, acronyms (e.g. RDGE) or `official' names. Again, the number of entries of these types present in the book is very extensive and the information is very consisely presented. I have also been convinced by the definitions of fundamentals, basic concepts (solids and colloids, for instance), processes (e.g. the viscose process) and chemical reactivity rules (e.g. Saytzeff rule). The names of great chemists, as well as Nobel Prize winners, are also included.\r\n\r\nAlthough, this dictionary is not a classical handbook of chemistry and physics, nor is it a Merck® Index, it does give some properties and CAS numbers of some compounds, as well as some chemical formulae, indications of toxicity and medicinal values.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing the results obtained using the dictionary with those obtained from an inter­net search, in all cases the definitions I found in this book were, if not the only one, then by far the most pertinent. After two months of intensive use and hundreds of searches in the dictionary, very few words (only three in fact) and acronyms were found to be missing: `TEMPO' (CAS 2564-83-2), RAFT for `Reversible Addition Fragmentation chain Transfer' and, quite astonishingly, `ionic liquid'. Considering the huge amount of work the dictionary represents (it is almost unbelievable that there are only three co-authors), it is very good value for money.\r\n\r\nClearly, I consider that this dictionary is a very valuable tool for all those who work in the various fields of chemistry or in multidisciplinary research. Masters or PhD students beginning in a new field will appreciate this data bank for handling a literature survey.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, a copy should be owned by every research team and be present in the library of each institution providing Bachelor and Masters degrees in chemistry and related sciences.",

    "abstract": "Polynuclear complexes and coordination polymers of 3 d metals have attracted significant interest evoked by a number of their unique properties. One of the most common approaches to the directed synthesis of coordination polymers is the linking of pre-prepared discrete coordination units by polydentate ligands. The formation of polynuclear complexes is usually a spontaneous process and precise prediction of the products of such reactions is virtually impossible in most cases. Tris(pyrazolyl)borates (Tp) act as tripodal `capping' ligands which form stable complexes with 3 d metal ions. In such 1:1 compounds, three metal-ion coordination sites are occupied by N atoms from a Tp anion. This limits the number of remaining coordination sites, and thus the number of additional ligands which may coordinate, and opens an attractive approach for the directed design of desirable structures by exploiting ligands with appropriate composition and topology. In the present study, Tp anions with neopentyl [Tp Np , tris(3-neopentylpyrazolyl)borate] and cyclohexyl [Tp Cy , tris(3-cyclohexylpyrazolyl)borate] substituents were used as `capping' ligands and the dianion of tetraacetylethane (3,4-diacetylhexa-2,4-diene-2,5-diolate, tae 2− ) was employed as a bridge. The dinuclear complexes (μ-3,4-diacetylhexa-2,4-diene-2,5-diolato-κ 4 O 2 , O 3 : O 4 , O 5 )bis{[tris(3-cyclohexyl-1 H -pyrazol-1-yl-κ N 2 )borato]cobalt(II)} acetonitrile disolvate, [Co 2 (C 27 H 40 BN 6 ) 2 (C 10 H 12 O 4 )]·2CH 3 CN, (I)·2CH 3 CN, and (μ-3,4-diacetylhexa-2,4-diene-2,5-diolato-κ 4 O 2 , O 3 : O 4 , O 5 )bis{[tris(3-neopentyl-1 H -pyrazol-1-yl-κ N 2 )borato]nickel(II)}, [Ni 2 (C 24 H 40 BN 6 ) 2 (C 10 H 12 O 4 )], (II), were synthesized by the reaction of the mononuclear complexes Tp Cy CoCl or Tp Np NiCl with H 2 tae (3,4-diacetylhexane-2,5-dione or tetraacetylethane) in the presence of NEt 3 as base. Compounds (I) and (II) were characterized by mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallography. They possess similar molecular structures, X-ray diffraction revealing them to be dinuclear in nature and composed of discrete Tp– M units in which two metal ions are linked by a tae 2− dianion. Each metal ion possesses a five-coordinate square-pyramidal environment. The interplanar angles between the acetylacetonate fragments are significantly smaller than the near-90° values commonly observed.",

These are [ferrocenyltris(3- tert -butylpyrazol-1-yl-κ N 2 )borato]thallium(I), [FeTl(C 5 H 5 )(C 26 H 37 BN 6 )], [ferrocenyltris(3-isopropylpyrazol-1-yl-κ N 2 )borato]thallium(I), [FeTl(C 5 H 5 )(C 23 H 31 BN 6 )], chlorido[ferrocenyltris(3- tert -butylpyrazol-1-yl-κ N 2 )borato]cobalt(II), [CoFe(C 5 H 5 )(C 26 H 37 BN 6 )Cl], [ferrocenyltris(3- tert -butylpyrazol-1-yl-κ N 2 )borato]iodidocobalt(II) benzene disolvate, [CoFe(C 5 H 5 )(C 26 H 37 BN 6 )I]·2C 6 H 6 , and [ferrocenyltris(3-isopropylpyrazol-1-yl-κ N 2 )borato]iodidocobalt(II), [CoFe(C 5 H 5 )(C 23 H 31 BN 6 )I]. The structures demonstrate that the metal coordination site can easily be modified by using bulkier substituents at the pz 3-position.",

    "abstract": "Minor variations in the molecular structure of constituent molecules of reactive crystals often yield crystals with significantly different properties due to altered modes of molecular association in the solid state. Hence, these studies could provide a better understanding of the complex chemical processes occurring in the crystalline state. However, reactions that proceed efficiently in molecular crystals are only a small fraction of the reactions that are known to proceed (with comparable efficiency) in the solution state. Hence, for consistent progress in this area of research, investigation of newer reactive molecular crystals which support different kinds of reactions and their related systems is essential. The crystal structures and acyl-transfer reactivity of a myo-inositol-1,3,5-orthoformate-derived dibenzoate and its carbonate (4-O-benzoyl-2-O-phenoxycarbonyl-myo-inositol 1,3,5-orthoformate, C21H18O9) and thiocarbonate (4-O-benzoyl-2-O-phenoxythiocarbonyl-myo-inositol 1,3,5-orthoformate, C21H18O8S) analogs are compared with the aim of understanding the relationship between crystal structure and acyl-transfer reactivity. Insertion of an O atom in the acyl (or thioacyl) group of an ester gives the corresponding carbonate (or thiocarbonate). This seemingly minor change in molecular structure results in a considerable change in the packing of the molecules in the crystals of myo-inositol-1,3,5-orthoformate-derived benzoates and the corresponding carbonates. These differences result in a lack of intermolecular acyl-transfer reactivity in crystals of myo-inositol-1,3,5-orthoformate-derived carbonates. Hence, this study illustrates the sensitivity of the relative orientation of molecules, their packing and ensuing changes in the reactivity of resulting crystals to minor changes in molecular structure.",

    "abstract": "Lamotrigine is a drug used in the treatment of epilepsy and related convulsive diseases. The drug in its free form is rather inadequate for pharmacological use due to poor absorption by the patient, which limits its bioavailability. On the other hand, the lamotrigine molecule is an excellent hydrogen-bonding agent and this has been exploited intensively in the search for better formulations. The formulation presently commercialized (under the brand name Lamictal) is rather complex and includes a number of anions in addition to the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The title salts of lamotrigine, namely 3,5-diamino-6-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazin-2-ium 2-[(2-carboxyphenyl)disulfanyl]benzoate monohydrate, C9H8Cl2N5+·C14H9O4S2-·H2O, (I), and the anhydrate, C9H8Cl2N5+·C14H9O4S2-, (II), contain a lamotriginium cation (L), a hydrogen dithiodibenzoate monoanion (D) and, in the case of (I), a disordered solvent water molecule. Both L and D present their usual configurations severely twisted around their central C-C and S-S bonds, respectively. The supramolecular structure generated by the many available donor and acceptor sites is characterized by a planar antisymmetric motif of the form D-L-L-D, i.e. the structural building block. Although this characteristic motif is extremely similar in both structures, its conformation involves different donors and acceptors in its R22(8) central L-L homosynthon. The lateral R22(8) D-L heterosynthons are, on the other hand, identical. These substructures are further connected by strong hydrogen bonds into broad two-dimensional structures, in turn weakly linked to each other. Even if the homo- and heterosynthons in (I) and (II) are rather frequent in lamotrigine structural chemistry, the composite tetrameric synthon appears to be much less common. The occurrence of these motifs among lamotrigine salts and cocrystals is analyzed.",

    "abstract": "The year 2016 marks the 50th anniversary of the discovery of scorpionates (Trofimenko, 1966), a class of tris(pyrazolyl)borate (Tp) ligands with proven versatility afforded by the ease of tuning the steric bulk and electronic properties at the metal coordination site.By adding bulky alkyl or aryl substituents, such as tert-butyl or phenyl, on the 3-position of the pyrazole, the second generation of scorpionates was introduced to discourage the formation of bis-ligand metal complexes, allowing new tetrahedral complexes to be synthesized (Calabrese et al., 1986).Functionalizing the fourth, noncoordinating, back position on the B atom opened new possibilities in third-generation scorpionates, such as magnetic behavior (Reger, 2005).In 2013, the first special issue for Acta Crystallographica Section C was published, featuring scorpionates (Yap, 2013), and from the Editorial of that issue we quote 'The first book on scorpionates, 'Scorpionates: The Coordination Chemistry of Polypyrazolylborate Ligands', intended to provide a 32-year comprehensive coverage of Tp chemistry up to 1998 (including some 1999 papers), was published in 1999 (reprinted in 2005) with 1568 references cited (Trofimenko, 1999).The second book, 'Scorpionates II: Chelating Borate Ligands', was published in 2008 to cover research from 1999 to 2008, a much shorter nine-year period, with 1710 references cited (Pettinari, 2008).A study of common ligand metrics showed that Tp ligands had the largest population, at the time the study was conducted, for fac-coordinating triskelion (i.e.tripodal) ligands and were second largest only to cyclopentadienide ligands for all tridentate ligands (Aguila et al., 2009) . . .A search on scorpionate structures in the Cambridge Structural Database (Version 5.34 of May 2013; Allen, 2002) yields 3480 hits, of which 59 appear in Acta Crystallographica journals.'Roughly, this translates to about 74 structures annually averaged since inception.A search from 2013 onwards in the Cambridge Structural Database (Version 5.37, November 2015; Groom et al., 2016) yields 761 structures of which 21 appear in Acta Crystallographica journals.Guest editor Kiyoshi Fujisawa's own chemistry research involves the use of hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate to synthesize copper protein model complexes and to investigate polymerization catalysts.In copper protein model complexes, the -2 : 2 copper(II) peroxide complex [{Cu II {HB[3,5-(i-Pr) 2 pz] 3 }} 2 (-O 2 )] (Baldwin et al., 1992; Kitajima et al., 1992), the mononuclear copper(II) alkylperoxide complex [Cu II {HB[3,5-(i-Pr) 2 pz] 3 }-{OOC(CH 3 ) 2 Ph}] (Kitajima et al., 1993; Chen et al., 2000), and the mononuclear copper(II) side-on superoxide complex [Cu II {HB(3-t-Bu-5-i-Prpz) 3 }(O 2 )] (Fujisawa et al., 1994; Chen et al., 2003) were structurally characterized, and the complexes [Cu II {HB[3,5-(i-Pr) 2 pz] 3 }{O 2 C(O)C 6 H 4 -m-Cl}] (Kitajima et al., 1990) and [Cu II {HB(3-t-Bu-5-i-Prpz) 3 }-(OOH)] (Chen et al., 2000) were physicochemically characterized using many techniques.In addition to biochemical models, Fujisawa investigated scorpionates as ligands for catalyzed polymerization reactions of phenols by copper (Higashimura et al., 2000) and olefins by manganese (Fujisawa & Nabika, 2013).Second-generation scorpionates are proving to be very useful in both research directions.In his research career, he has utilized hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borates, especially the HB[3,5-(i-Pr) 2 pz] 3 À and HB(3-t-Bu-5i-Prpz) 3À ligands, and their derivatives, as the supporting ligands.He has published many articles reporting these scorpionates and therefore he attests that his research career has been significantly supported by scorpionates.In one of the papers in this special issue, he reports his research expanding second-generation scorpionates towards new ligand systems (Fujisawa et al., 2016).",

In its crystal structure, which was determined from synchrotron data, the pores of the polymer are filled with dichloromethane and ethanol molecules. Finding a suitable model for the pore content is complicated as it is too disordered to give a reasonable atomic model but too ordered to be described by an electron gas solvent mask. This article presents an in-depth description of this polymer, as well as a discussion on the use of the bypass algorithm for solvent masks.",

In the present work, we have investigated the effect when the silyl ligands are substituted by different Group 17 atoms. We present here the structure and DFT calculations of Cp 2 NbH(SiIMe 2 )(SiFMe 2 ), showing that the position of the hydride is located between the two silyl ligands.

Among the various classes of dipeptides, aromatic dipeptides and especially diphenylalanine (Phe-Phe), which forms hexagonal nanotubes, have been the most extensively studied. However, aliphatic peptides or mixed aromatic-aliphatic dipeptides seem just as promising, exhibiting various structures ranging from amyloid fibrils to microtubes. Herein we report the single-crystal structure of an aliphatic dipeptide, alanine-isoleucine (Ala-Ile), C17H24N2O5, protected with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) group at the N-terminus. The protected dipeptide crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 and forms hollow microtubes with orthorhombic symmetry upon evaporation on glass surfaces, as shown by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). These findings provide an increased understanding of the correlation between the single-crystal structure of the peptide building block and its self-assembly mechanism, and expand the library of available building blocks for microtechnological applications.",

The protonation energy of PTP is 944.64 kJ mol-1, indicating slightly greater N-basicity compared to pyridine, a well characterized and very basic chemical reference. A variety of molecular interactions can be observed in the three new crystal structures of PTP, which are all discussed in detail.

The total simulation time was 1000 ns. The results of the simulation indicate that the pre-existence of CO2 hydrate crystals as seeds leads to rapid growth of CO2 hydrate. However, analysis of the F3 and F4 order parameters reveals that the hydrate does not meet the standard values of the perfect structure I (sI) type, confirming the existence of an imperfect structure during the simulation. Additionally, the changes in the number of different phase states of water molecules during the hydrate growth process shows that there are always some liquid water molecules, which means some water molecules fail to form solid water cages. Further investigation suggests that the presence of Na+ and Cl- hampers the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, resulting in incomplete cage structures. By analyzing the density variations in the system, it is observed that CO2 hydrate, with a density of around 1.133 g cm-3, forms rapidly, surpassing the average density of seawater. This density increase facilitates the efficient and swift containment of CO2 on the seabed, thereby supporting the feasibility of the CO2 storage theory.",

With no existing methods to ensure U remains sequestered in the shale, this study sought to add organic ligands to HFF to explore potential U retention in shale plays. To test this possibility, incubations were set up in which uranyl acetate and one organic bipyridine ligand (either 2,2'-, 2,3'-, 2,4'-, or 4,4'-bipyridine) were added to pristine HFF as the crystallization medium. After several months and complete evaporation of all volatiles, bulk yellow crystalline material was obtained from the incubations, three of which yielded crystals suitable for single-crystal analysis, resulting in two novel structures and a high-quality structure of a previously described compound.

The [3+2] cycloaddition of the carbonyl ylide with arylideneoxindole via a five-membered cyclic transition state gave a novel class of dispirooxindole derivatives, namely tert-butyl 4'-(4-bromophenyl)-1''-methyl-2,2''-dioxo-5'-phenyl-4',5'-dihydrodispiro[indoline-3,2'-furan-3',3''-indoline]-1-carboxylate, C36H31BrN2O, (Ia), 5'-(4-bromophenyl)-1,1''-dimethyl-4'-phenyl-4',5'-dihydrodispiro[indoline-3,2'-furan-3',3''-indoline]-2,2''-dione, C32H25BrN2O3, (Ib), and tert-butyl 1''-methyl-2,2''-dioxo-4'-phenyl-5'-(p-tolyl)-4',5'-dihydrodispiro[indoline-3,2'-furan-3',3''-indoline]-1-carboxylate, C37H34N2O5, (Ic). Crystal structure analyses of these dispirooxindoles revealed the formation of two diastereoisomers selectively and confirmed their relative stereochemistry (SSSR and RRRS). In all three structures, intramolecular C-H···O and π-π interactions between oxindole and dihydrofuran rings are the key factors governing the regio- and stereoselectivity, and in the absence of conventional hydrogen bonds, their crystal packings are strengthened by intermolecular C-H···π interactions.",

The crystal structures of 5,6-bis(9 H -carbazol-9-yl)benzo[ c ][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DCBT), C 30 H 18 N 4 S, and its hydrate, C 30 H 18 N 4 S·0.125H 2 O, were investigated using single-crystal X-ray analysis. The hydrate contains two symmetry-independent DCBT molecules. The dihedral angles between the plane of the central benzothiadiazole fragment and that of the carbazole units vary between 50.8 and 69.9°, indicating conformational flexibility of the DCBT molecule in the crystals, which is consistent with quantum chemical calculations. The analysis of the crystal packing of DCBT revealed that the experimental triclinic structure could be described as a distortion from a hypothetical higher-symmetry monoclinic structure. The quantum chemical calculations of two possible monoclinic structures, which are related to the experimental structure by a shifting of molecular layers, showed that the proposed structures are higher in energy by 5.4 and 10.1 kcal mol −1 . This energy increase is caused by less dense crystal packings of the symmetric structures, which results in a decrease of the number of intermolecular interactions.",

    "abstract": "Naphthalene diimides, which are planar, chemically robust and redox-active, are an attractive class of electron-deficient dyes, which can undergo a single reversible one-electron reduction to form stable radical anions in the presence of electron donors upon irradiation. This makes them excellent candidates for organic linkers in the construction of photochromic coordination polymers. Such a photochromic one-dimensional linear coordination polymer has been prepared using N , N ′-bis(3-carboxyphenyl)naphthalene-1,8:4,5-tetracarboximide (H 2 BBNDI). Crystallization of H 2 BBNDI with magnesium nitrate in an N , N ′-dimethylformamide (DMF)/ethanol/H 2 O mixed-solvent system under solvothermal conditions afforded the one-dimensional coordination polymer catena -poly[[bis(dimethylformamide-κ O )magnesium(II)]-bis[μ- N -(3-carboxylatophenyl)- N ′-(3-carboxylphenyl)naphthalene-1,8:4,5-tetracarboximide-κ 2 O : O ′]], [Mg(C 28 H 13 N 2 O 8 ) 2 (C 3 H 7 NO) 2 ] n . The asymmetric unit contains half of a magnesium cation, one HBBNDI − ligand and one DMF molecule. Two partially deprotonated HBBNDI − ligands bridge two magnesium cations to form a one-dimensional chain. Strong inter-chain π–π interactions between the naphthalene rings of the HBBNDI − ligand and the imide rings of adjacent chains provide a two-dimensional structure. The supramolecular three-dimensional framework is stabilized by π–π interactions between naphthalene rings of neighbouring two-dimensional supramolecular networks. The complex exhibits a reversible photochromic behaviour, which may originate from the photoinduced electron-transfer generation of radicals in the HBBNDI − ligand.",

Oxyclozanide [systematic name: 2,3,5-trichloro-N-(3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-6-hydroxybenzamide] is a drug used for the treatment of fascioliasis in domestic animals. The molecule carries five chlorine substituents and represents an ideal candidate for the study of halogen bonds in the crystal.

Solvates (I)-(IV) exhibit similar one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded chains generated by O-H...O, O-H...Cl and Cl...Cl interactions.

The complex crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1, with one formula unit per cell (Z = 1 and Z' = 1/2). It consists of a mononuclear unit with the CoII ion on an inversion centre coordinated by two 2,6-diamino-7H-purin-1-ium cations, two 4,4'-oxydibenzoate anions (in a nonbridging κO-monodentate coordination mode, which is less common for the anion in its CoII complexes) and two water molecules, defining an octahedral environment around the metal atom. There is a rich assortment of nonbonding interactions, among which a strong N+-H...O- bridge, with a short N...O distance of 2.5272 (18) Å, stands out, with the H atom ostensibly displaced away from its expected position at the donor side, towards the acceptor. The complex molecules assemble into a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network. A variable-temperature magnetic study between 2 and 300 K reveals an orbital contribution to the magnetic moment and a weak antiferromagnetic interaction between CoII centres as the temperature decreases. The model leads to the following values: A (crystal field strength) = 1.81, λ (spin-orbit coupling) = -59.9 cm-1, g (Landé factor) = 2.58 and zJ (exchange coupling) = -0.5 cm-1.",

The complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), powder XRD and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Both complexes possess a stair-step [Cu 4 I 4 ] cluster structure with a crystallographic inversion centre located in the middle of a Cu 2 I 2 ring ( Z ′ = 1/2). The dppp ligands each adopt a bidentate coordination mode that bridges two Cu I centres on one side of the [Cu 4 I 4 ] cluster and the acepy ligands act as terminal ligands. The solid-state samples of similar complexes show highly efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) at room temperature. At ambient temperature, both Cu L 3 and Cu L 4 exhibit photoluminescence, with a maximum emission in the region 560–580 nm and with short emissive decay times, but only phosphorescence was observed at 77 K. The narrow gaps between the higher lying singlet state and the triplet state, Δ E ( S 1 − T 1 ), also confirm the presence of TADF. Structure analysis and consideration of photoluminescence indicates that the position of the acetyl group on the heterocyclic ligand has an obvious influence on the structural arrangement, on intermolecular interactions and on the observed photophysical properties.",

Schiff bases 2 and 3 were found to be isostructural and underwent a phase transition upon cooling which was attributed to the dynamic disorder in one of the tert -butyl groups resolving at low temperature. All of the structures were found to exist in the enol rather than the keto form based on the C—O(H) and imine C=N bond lengths, and contained an intramolecular O—H...N hydrogen bond alongside weaker intermolecular C—H...O contacts.",

The title compound was structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy. In the crystal structure of (I), each CaII cation binds to six carboxylate groups from four symmetry-related L2- dianions. The hexadentate L2- ligand links four symmetry-related calcium cations into a 2D layer-like structure, which can be simplified as a uninodal SP 2-periodic (3,6)III net with the point symbol (43·63). In the lattice, all layers pack in parallel arrays through weak interlayer hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions. The thermal stability and photoluminescence properties of (I) have been investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals the different thermal stabilities of the two coordinated water molecules due to their different hydrogen-bonding interactions. The title coordination polymer exhibits an excitation-wavelength-dependent fluorescence in the solid state.",

The macrocyclic compound, also known by the abbreviation DOTAM-mono-acid, crystallized at room temperature and was isolated concomitantly as two polymorphic forms. The structures of both polymorphs were determined at 90 K. The first polymorph crystallized as a zwitterionic dihydrate [systematic name: 4,7,10-tris(carbamoylmethyl)-1-(carboxylatomethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecan-1-ium dihydrate] in the space group P21/n, with Z' = 1. The second polymorph crystallized as a zwitterionic dihydrate in the space group P21 at 90 K, with Z' = 2. The two independent molecules are related by a local center. In each polymorph, the zwitterion is formed between the negatively-charged carboxylate group and the ring N atom that bears the acetate pendant arm. Extensive inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding exists in both polymorphic structures. In polymorph 1, an intermolecular hydrogen-bonding network propagating parallel to the a direction creates an infinite chain. A second hydrogen-bonding network is observed through a water molecule of hydration in the b direction. Polymorph 2 also has two intermolecular hydrogen-bonding networks. One propagates parallel to the a direction, while the other propagates in the [-110] direction. Increasing the temperature of polymorph 2 yields the same structure at T = 180 K, but the pseudocenter becomes exact at 299 K. The higher-temperature structure has Z' = 1 in the space group P21/c.",

This triflate salt precursor is required for the synthesis of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl 6-[ 18 F]-fluoronicotinate ([ 18 F]FPyTFP), a prosthetic group used to radiolabel peptides for positron emission tomography (PET), as peptides are increasingly being used as PET-imaging probes in nuclear medicine. Radiolabeling of peptides is typically done using a `prosthetic group', a small synthon to which the radioisotope is attached in the first step, followed by attachment to the peptide in the second step. During the synthesis of the PyTFP-precursor, displacement of a Cl atom with trimethylamine gas and anion replacement with a triflate counter-ion is critical, as incomplete replacement would hinder radioisotopic incorporation of nucleophilic fluorine-18 and result in diminished radiochemical yields. The structural determination of the PyTFP-precursor by X-ray crystallography helped confirm the anion exchange of chloride with triflate.",

The structure indicates that in-situ decarboxylation of H 3 cpimda occurred during the synthesis process. The asymmetric unit consists of two Cd 2+ centres, one 4-carboxy-1-(4-carboxylatobenzyl)-2-propyl-1 H -imidazole-5-carboxylate (Hcpimda 2− ) anion, one 1-(4-carboxylatobenzyl)-2-propyl-1 H -imidazole-4-carboxylate (cpima 2− ) anion, one coordinated water molecule and one lattice water molecule. One Cd 2+ centre, i.e. Cd1, is hexacoordinated and displays a slightly distorted octahedral CdN 2 O 4 geometry. The other Cd centre, i.e. Cd2, is coordinated by seven O atoms originating from one Hcpimda 2− ligand and three cpima 2− ligands. This Cd 2+ centre can be described as having a distorted capped octahedral coordination geometry. Two carboxylate groups of the benzoate moieties of two cpima 2− ligands bridge between Cd2 centres to generate [Cd 2 O 2 ] units, which are further linked by two cpima 2− ligands to produce one-dimensional (1D) infinite chains based around large 26-membered rings. Meanwhile, adjacent Cd1 centres are linked by Hcpimda 2− ligands to generate 1D zigzag chains. The two types of chains are linked through a μ 2 -η 2 bidentate bridging mode from an O atom of an imidazole carboxylate unit of cpima 2− to give a two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymer. The simplified 2D net structure can be described as a 3,6-coordinated net which has a (4 3 ) 2 (4 6 .6 6 .8 3 ) topology. Furthermore, the FT–IR spectroscopic properties, photoluminescence properties, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern and thermogravimetric behaviour of the polymer have been investigated.",

Instead, single-crystal X-ray data and Rietveld refinement of synchrotron X-ray powder data show that the M phase has a different triclinic structure in the space group P -1 with Z = 2. As prior work has suggested, the crystal structure can be described as a distorted version of the thortveitite crystal structure of β-Mn 2 V 2 O 7 . A twofold superstructure in diffraction patterns of crystals of the M phase used for single-crystal X-ray diffraction work arises from twinning by reticular pseudomerohedry. This superstructure can be described as a commensurate modulation of a pseudo-monoclinic basis structure closely related to the crystal structure of β-Mn 2 V 2 O 7 . In comparison with the distortions introduced when β-Mn 2 V 2 O 7 transforms at low temperature to α-Mn 2 V 2 O 7 , the distortions which give rise to the M phase from the β-Mn 2 V 2 O 7 prototype are noticeably less pronounced.",

This work evaluates how the catalyst activity and selectivity are affected by some of its preparative parameters, such as the method for supporting the catalytically active heteropoly acid over the zirconia matrix or the pretreatments applied to the resulting materials before being used as heterogeneous catalysts. Our results indicate that the most effective catalysts able to maintain their activity after several reaction runs are those prepared by following the sol-gel route, whereas the most selective catalysts are those obtained by impregnation methods. Moreover, the calcination temperature has also been identified as a relevant parameter influencing the performance of catalysts based on supported heteropoly acids. The increasing catalytic activity observed over several consecutive reaction runs has been attributed to the formation of peroxo derivatives of polyoxometalate clusters at the surface of the catalyst and their accumulation after each reaction cycle.",

The two representative compounds contain a well-established Cu 3 cluster supporting a given 4 4 network. The ligand length is the underlying factor that controls the degree of interpenetration. Controlled interpenetration can be facile to realise by elongating protocols. Compound I shows a non-interpenetrating 4 4 network, whereas II features a threefold interpenetrating network. Furthermore, similar hydrogen-bond interactions extend the different interpenetrating 4 4 networks into three-dimensional supramolecular topologies. Variable-temperature magnetic studies showed a ferromagnetic coupling behaviour in the two complexes.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, much initial interest and enthusiasm has focused on the self-assembly of coordination polymers due to the aesthetics of their crystalline architectures and their potential applications as new functional materials. As part of an exploration of chiral coordination polymers, a new twofold interpenetrated two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymer, namely, poly[[tetraaquabis[μ3-(2R,2'R)-2,2'-(benzene-1,4-dicarboxamido)dipropionato-κ5O,O':O'',O''':O'']dicadmium(II)] trihydrate], {[Cd2(C14H14N2O6)2(H2O)4]·3H2O}n, has been synthesized by the reaction of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O with the designed ligand (2R,2'R)-2,2'-(benzene-1,4-dicarboxamido)dipropionic acid (H2L). The compound has been structurally characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In the crystal structure, each CdII cation binds to three carboxylate groups from two crystallographically independent L2- dianions. Four carboxylate groups link two crystallographically independent cadmium cations into a 4,4-connected secondary building unit (SBU). The resulting SBUs are extended into a two-dimensional folding sheet via the terephthalamide moiety of the ligand as a spacer, which can be simplified as a (4,4)-connected 4,4L15 net with the point symbol (3.53.62)(32.52.62). In the lattice, two independent folding sheets interpenetrate each other to yield a double-sheet layer. The resulting 2D layers pack in parallel arrays through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and interlayer π-π interactions. The thermal stability and photoluminescence properties of the title compound have been investigated and it exhibits an enhanced fluorescence emission and a longer lifetime compared with free H2L.",

Two pharmacologically important functional groups, i.e. arylsulfonamide and piperidinyl–fluorobenzisoxazole, are linked by three- and four-membered aliphatic chains. These compounds crystallize as hydrochloride salts in monoclinic space groups, i.e. C 2/ c for (I), P 2 1 / c for (II) and (III), and P 2 1 / n for (IV). In the asymmetric unit, a charge-assisted hydrogen bond is observed between the cation located at the piperidine N atom and the chloride anion. The protonated piperidine N atom is critical to the pharmacological activity for the compounds, allowing for a strong interaction with monoaminergic receptors in the central nervous system. The sulfonyl group plays the role of a hydrogen-bond acceptor in the pharmacophore model and is involved in several C—H...O interactions. Two aromatic fragments of the presented structures are involved in C—H...π contacts, which were studied by Hirshfeld structure analysis. The distances between the mentioned functional groups are in agreement with pharmacophore models given in the literature. The studied interactions observed in the crystal structure indicate the main forces responsible for ligand–receptor recognition and binding.",

    "abstract": "The amide bond represents one of the most fundamental functional groups in chemistry. The properties of amides are defined by amidic resonance (n N →π* C=O conjugation), which enforces planarity of the six atoms comprising the amide bond. Despite the importance of 4-halo-substituted benzamides in organic synthesis, molecular interactions and medicinal chemistry, the effect of 4-halo-substitution on the properties of the amide bond in N , N -disubstituted benzamides has not been studied. Herein, we report the crystal structures and energetic properties of a full series of 4-halobenzamides. The structures of four 4-halobenzamides (halo = iodo, bromo, chloro and fluoro) in the N -morpholinyl series have been determined, namely 4-[(4-halophenyl)carbonyl]morpholine, C 11 H 12 X NO 2 , for halo = iodo ( X = I), bromo ( X = Br), chloro ( X = Cl) and fluoro ( X = F). Computations have been used to determine the effect of halogen substitution on the structures and resonance energies. 4-Iodo- N -morpholinylbenzamide crystallized with a significant distortion of the amide bond (τ + χ N = 33°). The present study supports the correlation between the Ar—C(O) axis twist angle and the twist angle of the amide N—C(O) bond. Comparison of resonance energies in synthetically valuable N -morpholinyl and N -piperidinyl amides demonstrates that the O atom of the morpholinyl ring has a negligible effect on amidic resonance in the series.",

In the racemate crystal, an enantiomeric pair on an inversion centre is weakly linked by alcoholic O-H and N-H groups into an R22(10) ring. The trigonal pyramidal amino group is also linked to the phenolic and alcoholic groups to form a C(6) chain.

From the results of the crystal structure analysis, thermal analyses and DFT calculations validated from FT-IR spectra, a different tautomer was found in the racemic molecule (RS-SYN) versus the enantiopure molecule (R-SYN).",

Pseudopolymorph (I) follows the symmetry of the P 2 1 / n space group and has four tyraminium cations, four barbitalate anions and four molecules of chloroform in the asymmetric unit. Pseudopolymorph (II) crystallizes in the space group R \\overline{3} c with one tyraminium cation, one barbitalate anion and a small amount of disordered solvent (ethanol and water) located in the cavities. Hirshfeld surface analysis and the Non-Covalent Interaction (NCI) index were used to examine and compare the crystal packing features and intermolecular interactions in (I) and (II). Both materials crystallize with large unit cells and contain nontypical barbitalate ions formed through deprotonation of the barbital N3 position. Pseudopolymorph (I) is an example of a crystal structure with a rarely observed value of Z ′ = 4. Analysis of the hydrogen-bond patterns in (II) showed an unusual arrangement of three barbitalate anions in R 3 3 (12) rings, which is the first example of such a hydrogen-bond motif in barbital structures. The mutual arrangement of the ions in the crystal structure of (II) leads to the formation of specific cavities along the c direction.",

    "abstract": "A Guide to the Elements is an agile book aiming at providing a reference to the reader about the history, as well as the main chemical and physical properties, of the chemical elements.The target reader is the general public with some science background, rather than the accomplished chemist, as one immediately understands from the introduction, where basic definitions well known to the chemist are briefly introduced (for example, the periodic table, isotopes, atomic shells etc.).The book has reached its fourth edition.I have not read the previous editions, but comparing the table of contents and the index available online for the third edition, it is not clear what changes have been introduced, apart from the conventional names for elements No. 113-118 which had not been assigned when that edition went to press.I therefore concentrate my review on the actual content rather than on the changes from the previous edition, which are not clear to me.Each element gets at least one page, where its history, including sometimes some anecdotes, physical and chemical properties (not available for most transactinides), and use in daily life are described.Quite obviously, the most extensively used elements receive greater space (the record holder being carbon, with 7.5 pages) than the more exotic, artificial ones, but each and every element gets its spotlight.The amount of information condensed in this book is remarkable and the style in which it is presented is attractive, so that the reader never gets bored.The epilogue insists on the search for the 'island of stability' (the hypothetical region of the periodic table where giant elements with 184 neutrons and 120-126 protons would be unusually stable); it is followed by a glossary and a chronology of the discovery of the elements, and by a list of printed and online resources.We notice, however, a few regrettable omissions which would have been important additions for the general public which is the target of this book:* the use of N 2 O anaesthetic ('laughing gas') is discussed (page 47), but nothing is said about its deleterious oxidation effects on cobalamine (vitamin B12), which has been known for a long time (Chanarin, 1980);* the three pages on oxygen say nothing at all about its toxicity, which is a serious omission in a general-public-oriented chapter devoted to the element;* the same objection can be levelled at the chapter about fluorine, as well as at that about aluminium, the latter being explicitly defined as 'nontoxic' (page 63);* when discussing gypsum (page 82), a word about it as a secondary product (e.g.phosphogysum) and the hazards related to its potential use (residual radioactivity) would have been useful;* in the chapter about iridium, no mention is made of the iridium anomaly at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary taken as evidence for an asteroid impact (Alvarez et al., 1980).A few mistakes should also to be pointed out: * magnesite is incorrectly addressed as 'also known as dolomite' (page 60), which is simply incorrect;* chromium sesquioxide (Cr 2 O 3 ) is said to be 'among the 10 most abundant compounds in the Earth's crust', which seems a gross overestimation, even ignoring silicates;* similarly, barium is stated to rank '6th in abundance among the elements that make up the Earth's crust' (page 149), whereas it is only 14th.",

Mono- O -acetylation appears to promote the crystallization of ( II ), inferred from the difficulty in crystallizing methyl α-D-mannopyranosyl-(1→3)-β-D-mannopyranoside despite repeated attempts. The conformational properties of the O -acetyl side chain in ( II ) are similar to those observed in recent studies of peracetylated mannose-containing oligosaccharides, having a preferred geometry in which the C2—H2 bond eclipses the C=O bond of the acetyl group. The C2—O2 bond in ( II ) elongates by ∼0.02 Å upon O -acetylation. The phi (φ) and psi (ψ) torsion angles that dictate the conformation of the internal O -glycosidic linkage in ( II ) are similar to those determined recently in aqueous solution by NMR spectroscopy for unacetylated ( II ) using the statistical program MA′AT , with a greater disparity found for ψ (Δ = ∼16°) than for φ (Δ = ∼6°).",

Electrical resistivities measured at 1073 K by alternating-current impedance spectroscopic and direct-current methods were 1.16 × 10 −4 and 1.14 × 10 −4 S cm −1 , respectively, which indicates that electrons and/or holes were conduction carriers at high temperature.

In the structure of H L , O—H...O hydrogen bonds between neighbouring molecules result in the formation of dimers, while the silver(I) complex shows polymerization associated with the O atoms of three distinct deprotonated ligands ( L − ). Thus, the structure of the Ag complex can be considered as a coordination polymer consisting of a one-dimensional linear chain, constructed by carboxylate bridging groups, running parallel to the b axis. Neighbouring polymeric chains are further bridged by Ag—C monohapto contacts, resulting in a 2D framework. Fingerprint analysis of the Hirshfeld surfaces show that O...H/H...O hydrogen bonds are responsible for the most significant contacts in the crystal packing of H L and Ag L , followed by the H...H and O...C/C...O interactions. The Ag...Ag, Ag...O/O...Ag and Ag...C/C...Ag interactions in the Hirshfeld surface represent 12.1% of the total interactions in the crystal packing. Studies of the interactions of the compounds with human serum albumin (HSA) indicated that both H L and Ag L interact with HSA.",

Complex II is a (4,4)-connected 3D novel network with ribbon-like chains formed by ( o , m -bpta) 4− linkers. Magnetic studies indicate an orbital contribution to the magnetic moment of I and II due to the longer Co...Co distances.

    "abstract": "The four azole rings place structural restrictions on ascidiacyclamide (ASC). As a result, the structure of ASC exists in an equilibrium between two major forms (i.e. folded and square). [D-βVal3,7]Ascidiacyclamide (βASC) was synthesized by replacing two D-Val-Thz (Val is valine and Thz is thiazole) blocks with D-β-Valine (D-βVal-Thz). This modification expands the peptide ring; the original 24-membered macrocycle of ASC becomes a 26-membered ring. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that, in solution, the structural equilibrium is maintained with βASC, but the folded form is dominant. A copper complex was prepared, namely [[D-βVal3,7]ascidiacyclamide(2-)]aqua-μ-carbonato-dicopper(II) monohydrate, [Cu2(C38H54N8O6S2)(CO3)(H2O)]·H2O, to determine the effect of the change in ring size on the coordinated structure. The obtained bis-CuII-βASC complex contains two water molecules and a carbonate anion. Two CuII ions are chelated by three N-donor atoms of two Thz-Ile-Oxz (Ile is isoleucine and Oxz is oxazoline) units. An O atom of the carbonate anion bridges two CuII ions, forming two square pyramids. These features are similar to the previously reported structure of the CuII-ASC complex, but the two pyramids are enveloped inside the peptide and share one apex. In the CuII-ASC complex, the apex of each square pyramid is an O atom of a water molecule, and the two pyramids are oriented toward the outside of the peptide. The incorporated β-amino acids of βASC make the space inside the peptide large enough to envelop the two square pyramids. The observed structural changes in the bis-CuII-βASC complex arising from ring expansion are particularly interesting in the context of the previously reported structure of the CuII-ASC complex.",

At the molecular level, the compound features an intramolecular N—H...O hydrogen bond; neighbouring molecules interact via N—H...N contacts to form chains along [100]. Due to its elemental composition, resonant scattering of the target compound is entirely insignificant for diffraction experiments with Mo K α and small even for Cu K α radiation. A preliminary study with the harder radiation type confirmed the chiral space group and the suitability of the single crystal chosen; as expected, the results concerning the absolute structure remained completely inconclusive. A second data collection with the longer wavelength gave satisfactory quality indicators for the correct handedness of the molecule, albeit with high standard uncertainties. The absolute configuration has been assessed independently: CD spectra for both enantiomers of the target molecule were calculated and the spectrum for the S -configured stereoisomer was in agreement with the experiment. The Cotton effect of ( 1 ) may be ascribed to π–π* transitions from HOMO to LUMO and from HOMO to LUMO+1. As both independent techniques agree with respect to the handedness of the target molecule, the absolute structure may be assigned with a high degree of confidence.",

Three polymorphic structures for 1 and two polymorphic structures for 2 have been studied thoroughly. The strongest intermolecular interaction is stacking of the `head-to-head' type in all the studied crystals. The polymorphic structures of 1 differ with respect to the intermolecular interactions between stacked columns. Two of the polymorphs have a columnar or double columnar type of crystal organization, while the third polymorphic structure can be classified as columnar-layered. The difference between the two structures of 2 is less pronounced. Both crystals can be considered as having very similar arrangements of neighbouring columns. The formation of polymorphic modifications is caused by a subtle balance of very weak intermolecular interactions and packing differences can be identified only using an analysis based on a study of the pairwise interaction energies.",

Each Zn II centre is four-coordinated and displays a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. The Zn II centres are connected by TATB 3− anions to form an angled ladder chain with large windows. Simultaneously, the bib ligands link Zn II centres to give a helical Zn–bib–Zn chain. Furthermore, adjacent ladders are bridged by Zn–bib–Zn chains to form a fascinating three-dimensional self-penetrated framework with the short Schläfli symbol 6 5 ·7·8 13 ·9·10. In addition, the luminescence properties of 1 in the solid state and the fluorescence sensing of metal ions in suspension were studied.

The supramolecular interactions and single-crystal structural characteristics of these molecules, together with the crystal structures of four other similar molecules, i.e. NCA-A (the 4-phenyl derivative of NCA-NA ), DNCA-AE (the 5,6-unsaturated derivative of NCA-AE ), DNCA and NCA , were analysed. Surprisingly, DNCA-A and NCA-A , as well as DNCA–NA and NCA-NA , proved to be isomorphic, while DNCA-AE and NCA-AE , as well as DNCA and NCA , have very different crystal structures. These are very rare isostructural examples between unsaturated and saturated oxanorbornene/oxanorbornane derivatives. To further explore how noncovalent interactions (NCIs) affect the degree of isomorphism in this particular series of rigid molecules where there is a fairly limited conformational degree of freedom, all four pairs of crystal structures were analyzed in parallel. The differentiation in NCIs which entails the packing mode of similar molecules is supported by energy calculations based on real or exchanged crystal structures. Our results show that minor structural differences may result in very different supramolecular interactions, and so lead to altered packing modes in the crystalline solids. Even if isostructurality sometimes occurs, the possibility of various molecular packing types cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, isomorphism may just be the result of kinetic possibilities instead of relative thermodynamic stabilities. Though crystal structure prediction is formidable, the comparison method based on existing crystal structures and quantum calculations can be used to predict the probability of isomorphism. This understanding will help us to design new norbornene derivatives with specified structures.",

The presence of both basic ligands (OH- or OEt-) and acidic [H(phosphate)2]- associates at the same metal centres in (1) and (3) is rather unusual. Complexes may serve as precatalysts for ethylene polymerization under mild conditions, providing polyethylene with a small amount of short-chain branching. The formation of a small amount of α-olefins has been detected in this reaction.",

    "abstract": "We prepared a 3 d –4 f heterobimetallic CuEu–organic framework NBU-8 with a density of 1921 kg m −3 belonging to the family of dense packing materials (dense metal–organic frameworks or MOFs). This MOF material was prepared from 4-(pyrimidin-5-yl)benzoic acid (HPBA) with a bifunctional ligand site as a tripodal ligand and Cu 2+ and Eu 3+ as the metal centres; the molecular formula is Cu 3 Eu 2 (PBA) 6 (NO 3 ) 6 ·H 2 O. This material is a very promising dimethylformamide (DMF) molecular chemical sensor. Systematic high-pressure studies of NBU-8 were carried out by powder X-ray diffraction, high-pressure X-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simulation. The high-pressure experiment shows that the (006) diffraction peak of the crystal structure moves toward a low angle with increasing pressure, accompanied by the phenomenon that the d -spacing increases, and as the pressure increases, the (10\\overline{2}) diffraction peak moves to a higher angle, the amplitude of the d -spacing is significantly reduced and finally merges with the (006) diffraction peak into one peak. The amplitude of the d -spacing is significantly reduced, indicating that NBU-8 compresses and deforms along the a -axis direction when subjected to uniform pressure. This is caused by tilting of the ligands to become more vertical along the c direction, leading to its expansion. This allows greater contraction along the a direction. We also carried out a Rietveld structure refinement and a Birch–Murnaghan solid-state equation fitting for the high-pressure experimental results. We calculated the bulk modulus of the material to be 45.68 GPa, which is consistent with the calculated results. The framework is among the most rigid MOFs reported to date, exceeding that of Cu–BTC. Molecular dynamics simulations estimated that the mechanical energy absorbed by the system when pressurized to 5.128 GPa was 249.261 kcal mol −1 . The present work will provide fresh ideas for the study of mechanical energy in other materials.",

    "abstract": "Acridines are a class of bioactive agents which exhibit high biological stability and the ability to intercalate with DNA; they have a wide range of applications. Pyridine derivatives have a wide range of biological activities. To enhance the properties of acridine and 2-amino-3-methylpyridine as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), 4-nitrobenzoic acid was chosen as a coformer. In the present study, a mixture of acridine and 4-nitrobenzoic acid forms the salt acridinium 4-nitrobenzoate, C 13 H 10 N + ·C 7 H 4 NO 4 − ( I ), whereas a mixture of 2-amino-3-methylpyridine and 4-nitrobenzoic acid forms the salt 2-amino-3-methylpyridinium 4-nitrobenzoate, C 6 H 9 N 2 + ·C 7 H 4 NO 4 − ( II ). In both salts, protonation takes place at the ring N atom. The crystal structure of both salts is predominantly governed by hydrogen-bond interactions. In salt I , C—H...O and N—H...O interactions form an infinite chain in the crystal, whereas in salt II , intermolecular N—H...O interactions form an eight-membered R 2 2 (8) ring motif. A theoretical charge–density analysis reveals the charge–density distribution of the inter- and intramolecular interactions of both salts. An in-silico ADME analysis predicts the druglikeness properties of both salts and the results confirm that both salts are potential drug candidates with good bioavailability scores and there is no violation of the Lipinski rules, which supports the druglikeness properties of both salts. However, although both salts exhibit drug-like properties, salt I has higher gastrointestinal absorption than salt II and hence it may be considered a potential drug candidate.",

The Ge1 and Ge2 atoms fully occupy the 4 a ( m \\overline{3} m symmetry) and 24 d ( m.mm ) sites, respectively. The Ni1 and Ni2 atoms both fully occupy two 32 f sites (.3 m symmetry). The Mg/Ge statistical mixture occupies the 24 e site with 4 m.m symmetry. The structure of the title compound contains a three-core-shell cluster. At (0,0,0), there is a Ge1 atom which is surrounded by eight Ni atoms at the vertices of a cube and consequently six Mg atoms at the vertices of an octahedron. These surrounded eight Ni and six Mg atoms form a [Ge1Ni 8 (Mg/Ge) 6 ] rhombic dodecahedron with a coordination number of 14. The [GeNi 8 (Mg/Ge) 6 ] rhombic dodecahedron is encapsulated within the [Ni 24 ] rhombicuboctahedron, which is again encapsulated within an [Ni 32 (Mg/Ge) 24 ] pentacontatetrahedron; thus, the three-core-shell cluster [GeNi 8 (Mg/Ge) 6 @Ni 24 @Ni 32 (Mg/Ge) 24 ] results. The pentacontatetrahedron is a new representative of Pavlyuk's polyhedra group based on pentagonal, tetragonal and trigonal faces. The dominance of the metallic type of bonding between atoms in the Mg 5.57 Ni 16 Ge 7.43 structure is confirmed by the results of the electronic structure calculations.

The crystal structures of these salts were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing protonation in I and II by the transfer of a H atom from the acid to the pyridine base. In the crystals of both I and II , N—H...O interactions form an R 2 2 (8) ring motif. Hirshfeld surface analysis distinguishes the interactions present in the crystal structures of I and II , and the two-dimensional (2D) fingerprint plot analysis shows the percentage contribution of each type of interaction in the crystal packing. The volumes of the crystal voids of I (39.65 Å 3 ) and II (118.10 Å 3 ) have been calculated and reveal that the crystal of I is more mechanically stable than II . Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis predicts that the band gap energy of II (2.6577 eV) is lower compared to I (4.0035 eV). The Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) analysis shows that the pyridinium–carboxylate N—H...O interaction present in I is stronger than the other interactions, whereas in II , the hydroxy–carboxylate O—H...O interaction is stronger than the pyridinium–carboxylate N—H...O interaction; the bond dissociation energies also confirm these results.

The thiocyanate ligand acts as a μ-1,3 bridge, joining neighbouring Co III atoms and forming a uniform zigzag one-dimensional polymeric chain.

Herein, a novel manganese-based halide, specifically diaquatetrakis(methyldiphenylphosphine oxide)manganese(II) tetrachloridomanganate(II), [Mn(C 13 H 13 OP) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ][MnCl 4 ] or [Mn(MDPPO) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ][MnCl 4 ] (MDPPO is methyldiphenylphosphine oxide), was synthesized through the solvothermal reaction of MnCl 2 with the neutral molecule MDPPO. In this compound, [Mn(MDPPO) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ] 2+ acts as the cation, while [MnCl 4 ] 2− serves as the anion, enabling the co-existence of tetrahedral and octahedral structures within the same system. Remarkably, the compound exhibits efficient red-light emission at 662 nm, distinct from the green-light emission typically observed in Mn X 4 -based halides. Theoretical calculations show that the red emission comes from the charge transfer from the MDPPO to the Mn 2+ of [MnCl 4 ] 2− . This work provides a new perspective for the design and synthesis of red-light-emitting manganese-based halides with unique structures.",

Furthermore, axial groups that contain O and/or F atoms tend to have significant hydrogen-bonding interactions, while axial groups containing arene site(s) can participate in π-π interactions with the BsubPc bowl, both of which can strongly influence the crystal packing. Bulky axial groups did tend to disrupt the π-π interactions and/or axial-group interactions, preventing some of the close packing that is seen in BsubPcs with less bulky axial groups. The atomic radius of the heteroatom bonded to boron directly influences the axial bond length, whereas the axial group has minimal impact on the BsubPc bowl depth. Finally, the crystal growth method did not generally appear to have a significant impact on the solid-state arrangement, with the exception of water occasionally being incorporated into crystal structures when hygroscopic solvents were used. These insights can help with the design and fine-tuning of the solid-state structures of BsubPcs as they continue to be developed as functional materials in organic electronics.",

Two kinds of bimetallic parallel layers (A1 and A2) are present alternately and are found to be staggered, while only the A2 layer is crossed by a twofold axis parallel to the a axis through two Na atoms. The [NH 2 (CH 3 ) 2 ] + (HDMA) cations occupy the voids between the anionic layers, while the free molecules, i.e. NH(CH 3 ) 2 (DMA) and H 2 O, are located between two different anionic layers. In addition to ionic bonds, the stability of the structure is ensured by hydrogen-bond interactions involving the oxalate ligands and the nitrogenous and water molecules. The layered structure appears to be different in the family of oxalate-bridged Na I –Fe III compounds. It is in agreement with the predicted 2D or layered structure of bimetallic complexes containing anionic tris(oxalato)metallate(III) with the [ XR 4 ] + counter-ion template ( X = N, P or S, and R = alkyl group or H). The thermal decomposition of the compound shows the final residual product to be NaFeO 2 .",

The protonated species were recrystallized from anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. In the solid state of the monoprotonated species of methyl prop-2-ynoate and the diprotonated species of dimethyl fumarate, strong intramolecular O—H...F hydrogen bonds build a three-dimensional network. The monoprotonated species of dimethyl fumarate builds chains by strong O—H...O hydrogen bonds between the cations.",

In the crystal structure of (I), the nine-coordinated Ba II ions are bridged by two μ 2 -aqua ligands and two carboxylate μ 2 -O atoms to form a 1D loop-like Ba–O chain, which, together with the other two coordinated water molecules and μ 2 -carboxylate groups, produces a rod-like secondary building unit (SBU). The resultant 1D polynuclear SBUs are further extended into a 3D MOF via the terephthalamide moiety of the ligand as a spacer. Two intramolecular dihydrogen bonds (DHBs) between the imine H atoms and the arene H atoms contribute to maintaining the 3D structure. In the crystal, two independent MOFs interpenetrate each other, thereby producing a twofold interpenetrated 3D architecture with a 4-connected PtS-X topology. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding and π–π interactions contribute to the stability of the twofold interpenetrated 3D architecture. The noncovalent interactions in the coordination polymer (CP) were further investigated by Hirshfeld surface analysis and the results show that the prominent interactions are H...O (39.6%) and H...H (34.4%), as well as Ba...O (9.8%), contacts.

The asymmetric unit of two salts of 2-picolinic acid, namely, ( R , S )- N -[2-(2,3-dimethylphenoxy)ethyl]-1-hydroxypropan-2-aminium pyridine-2-carboxylate, C 13 H 22 NO 2 + ·C 6 H 4 NO 2 − , 1p , and ( R )- N -[2-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)ethyl]-1-hydroxypropan-2-aminium pyridine-2-carboxylate, C 13 H 22 NO 2 + ·C 6 H 4 NO 2 − , 2p , consists of one cation and one 2-picolinate anion. Salt 1p crystallizes in the triclinic centrosymmetric space group P \\overline 1, while salt 2p crystallizes in the space group P 4 1 2 1 2. The conformations of the amine fragments are contrasted and that of 2p is found to have an unusual antiperiplanar arrangement about the ether group. The crystal packing of 1 and 2c is dominated by hydrogen-bonded chains, while the structures of the 2-picolinate salts have hydrogen-bonded rings as the major features. In both salts with 2-picolinic acid, the specific R 1 2 (5) hydrogen-bonding motif is observed. Structural studies have been enriched by the generation of fingerprint plots derived from Hirshfeld surfaces.",

The L molecule adopts an almost planar structure, with a small dihedral angle between the planes of the stilbene and salicylhydrazone groups. There are multiple π-π stacking interactions between adjacent L molecules. The DMSO solvent molecules act as proton donors and acceptors, forming hydrogen bonds of various strengths with the L molecules. In addition, the geometry optimization of a single molecule of L and its luminescence properties either in solution, as a solvated solid or as a desolvated solid were studied.

    "abstract": "Anion...π interactions are newly recognized weak supramolecular forces which are relevant to many types of electron-deficient aromatic substrates. Being less competitive with respect to conventional hydrogen bonding, anion...π interactions are only rarely considered as a crystal-structure-defining factor. Their significance dramatically increases for polyoxometalate (POM) species, which offer extended oxide surfaces for maintaining dense aromatic/inorganic stacks. The structures of tetrakis(caffeinium) μ 12 -silicato-tetracosa-μ 2 -oxido-dodecaoxidododecatungsten trihydrate, (C 8 H 11 N 4 O 2 ) 4 [SiW 12 O 40 ]·3H 2 O, (1), and tris(theobrominium) μ 12 -phosphato-tetracosa-μ 2 -oxido-dodecaoxidododecatungsten ethanol sesquisolvate, (C 7 H 9 N 4 O 2 ) 3 [PW 12 O 40 ]·1.5C 2 H 5 OH, (2), support the utility of anion...π interactions as a special kind of supramolecular synthon controlling the structures of ionic lattices. Both caffeinium [(HCaf) + in (1)] and theobrominium cations [(HTbr) + in (2)] reveal double stacking patterns at both axial sides of the aromatic frameworks, leading to the generation of anion...π...anion bridges. The latter provide the rare face-to-face linkage of the anions. In (1), every square face of the metal–oxide cuboctahedra accepts the interaction and the above bridges yield flat square nets, i.e. {(HCaf + ) 2 [SiW 12 O 40 ] 4− } n . Two additional cations afford single stacks only and they terminate the connectivity. Salt (2) retains a two-dimensional (2D) motif of square nets, with anion...π...anion bridges involving two of the three (HTbr) + cations. The remaining cations complete a fivefold anion...π environment of [PW 12 O 40 ] 3− , acting as terminal groups. This single anion...π interaction is influenced by the specific pairing of (HTbr) + cations by double amide-to-amide hydrogen bonding. Nevertheless, invariable 2D patterns in (1) and (2) suggest the dominant role of anion...π interactions as the structure-governing factor, which is applicable to the construction of noncovalent linkages involving Keggin-type oxometalates.",

    "abstract": "(−)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the main component of green tea extract, displays multiple biological activities. However, it cannot be used as a drug due to its low cellular absorption, instability and metabolic degradation. Therefore, there is a need to provide analogs that can overcome the limitations of EGCG. In this work, six synthetic analogs of EGCG sharing a common tetralindiol dibenzoate core were synthesized and fully characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, HRMS and IR spectroscopies, and X-ray crystallography. These are (2 R ,3 S )-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene-2,3-diyl bis[3,4,5-tris(benzyloxy)benzoate], C 66 H 56 O 10 , and the analogous esters bis(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate), C 30 H 32 O 10 , bis(3,4,5-trifluorobenzoate), C 24 H 14 F 6 O 4 , bis[4-(benzyloxy)benzoate], C 38 H 32 O 6 , bis(4-methoxybenzoate), C 26 H 24 O 6 , and bis(2,4,6-trifluorobenzoate), C 24 H 14 F 6 O 4 . Structural analysis revealed that the molecular shapes of these dibenzoate esters of tetralindiol are significantly different from that of previously reported dimandelate esters or monobenzoate esters, as the acid moieties extend far from the bicyclic system without folding back over the tetralin fragment. Compounds with small fluorine substituents take a V-shape, whereas larger methoxy and benzyloxy groups determine the formation of an L-shape or a cavity. Intermolecular interactions are dominated by π–π stacking and C—H...π interactions involving the arene rings in the benzoate fragment and the arene ring in the tetrahydronaphthalene moiety. All six crystal structures are determined in centrosymmetric space groups (either P -1, P 2 1 / n , C 2/ c or I 2/ a ).",

Two polymorphic forms differ in both their molecular and crystal structures. The monoclinic polymorphic form was crystallized from more volatile solvents and contains a conformer with a higher relative energy. The basic molecule forms an abundance of interactions with relatively close energies. The orthorhombic polymorph was crystallized very slowly from isoamyl alcohol and contains a conformer with a much lower energy. The basic molecule forms two strong interactions and a large number of weak interactions. Stacking interactions of the `head-to-head' type in the monoclinic structure and of the `head-to-tail' type in the orthorhombic structure proved to be the strongest and form stacked columns in the two polymorphs. The main structural motif of the monoclinic structure is a double column where two stacked columns interact through weak C—H...N hydrogen bonds and dispersive interactions. In the orthorhombic structure, a single stacked column is the main structural motif.

    "abstract": "Being a close analogue of amflutizole, methyl 4-amino-3-phenylisothiazole-5-carboxylate (C 11 H 10 N 2 O 2 S) was assumed to be capable of forming polymorphic structures. Noncentrosymmetric and centrosymmetric polymorphs have been obtained by crystallization from a series of more volatile solvents and from denser tetrachloromethane, respectively. Identical conformations of the molecule are found in both structures. The two polymorphs differ mainly in the intermolecular interactions formed by the amino group and in the type of stacking interactions between the π-systems. The most effective method for revealing packing motifs in structures with intermolecular interactions of different types (hydrogen bonding, stacking, dispersion, etc .) is to study the pairwise interaction energies using quantum chemical calculations. Molecules form a column as the primary basic structural motif due to stacking interactions in both polymorphic structures under study. The character of a column (straight or zigzag) is determined by the orientations of the stacked molecules (in a `head-to-head' or `head-to-tail' manner). Columns bound by intermolecular N—H...O and N—H...N hydrogen bonds form a double column as the main structural motif in the noncentrosymmetric structure. Double columns in the noncentrosymmetric structure and columns in the centrosymmetric structure interact strongly within the ab crystallographic plane, forming a layer as a secondary basic structural motif. The noncentrosymmetric structure has a lower density and a lower (by 0.59 kJ mol −1 ) lattice energy, calculated using periodic calculations, compared to the centrosymmetric structure.",

    "abstract": "Only two crystal structures of diorganotellurones have been reported to date, both of which contain cocrystallized solvents and one of which is stabilized by intramolecular Te-N secondary bonding interactions. This work describes the crystal structure of bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl) tellurone, (C12H17)2TeO2 or C24H34O2Te, the first well-defined diorganotellurone without cocrystallized solvents and without stabilizing intramolecular contacts. The molecule has crystallographic twofold symmetry, with half the molecule as the asymmetric unit. The molecular structure is compared to previously reported tellurones and those computed at the density functional theory DFT/B3PW91 level. The molecules form two-dimensional layers as a result of a weak intermolecular hydrogen-bonding network. The layers are then stacked in an antiparallel manner to form the crystal packing structure. The Hirshfeld surface analysis was employed to visualize and quantify the intermolecular contacts in the molecular crystal structure, and the contribution of O...H and H...H interactions was found to be the dominating factor.",

The geometries of the compounds in the crystal structures were compared with those found during docking studies at the active site of the receptor, and some relevant differences were identified. Intermolecular interactions were analyzed using three different methods. First, the (3,−1) critical points of the gradient field of the electron density were identified, and then the appropriate contacts were analyzed using their geometrical characteristics and interaction energy calculations. The results confirmed the importance of weak delocalized interactions in the construction of the crystal structures, and the results of different methods (PIXEL and DFT) were comparable in the absence of strong well-defined intermolecular interactions.",

A comparison of the structural parameters of (I) with the corresponding parameters in α-D-glucosamine hydrochloride, (II), and β-D-galactosamine hydrochloride, (III)/(III′), was undertaken to evaluate the effects of ionic hydrogen bonding on structural properties. Three types of ionic hydrogen bonds are present in the crystals of (I)–(III)/(III′), i.e. N + —H...O, N + —H...Cl − , and O—H...Cl − . The exocyclic structural parameters in (I), (II), and (III)/(III′) appear to be most influenced by this bonding, especially the exocyclic hydroxy groups, which adopt eclipsed conformations enabled by ionic hydrogen bonding to the chloride anion. Anomeric disorder was observed in crystals of (I), with an α:β ratio of 37:63. However, anomeric configuration appears to exert minimal structural effects; that is, bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles are essentially identical in both anomers. The observed disorder at the anomeric C atom of (I) appears to be caused by the presence of the chloride anion and atom O3 or O4 in proximal voids, which provide opportunities for hydrogen bonding to atom O1 in both axial and equatorial orientations.",

    "abstract": "Psilocybin was of great interest to some of my contemporaries during my student days, but not due to its crystal structure, at least not directly.At present, due to the study of hallucinogens as possible treatment agents for various mental illnesses, their use has become a topic of significantly renewed interest (Gill et al., 2020;Sherwood & Prisinzano, 2018).As is well known in the pharmaceutical industry, crystallographic characterization of materials is crucial in order to understand the bioavailability of a drug (Byrn et al., 1999).Structural knowledge is thus highly important for the potential use of psilocybin.In their detailed study of the structural forms of psilocybin reported recently in Acta Crystallographica Section C, Sherwood et al. (2022) solve two novel anhydrous psilocybin structures ab initio from high-resolution synchrotron and from laboratory X-ray powder data, respectively.While attempts to directly crystallize the anhydrous forms were attempted, they could only produce the phases by removing water from a hydrated form.The hydrated phase forms single crystals and has a determined structure, but dehydration destroys these crystals, producing crystalline powders.To confirm the quality of the powder structures and review the hydrogen-bonding motifs, they performed computations with plane-wave density functional theory (DFT).A second form of DFT was used in 'gas phase' computations to compare the energetics of the psilocybin conformations for isolated molecules for their two new polymorphs and the previously-known hydrated form.While the very high quality of the fits between the observed and calculated patterns would already give one confidence in their results, their verification that that calculations from theory demonstrate that the structures represent energetic minima boosts confidence in their results manyfold.However, it had been reported in the patent literature that different polymorphs exist.To address this, Sherwood et al. (2022) performed Rietveld fits on data from a total of 24 different samples, either with contemporary data collection or with digitized powder diffraction patterns taken from the literature.They show that all these patterns are consistent with their two new anhydrous structures and the known hydrous form, sometimes as mixtures and sometimes where intensities require correction for significant preferred orientation.This texture is not at all surprising considering the highly anisotropic crystal habits they see in the powders.Furthermore, they made significant efforts to coax psilocybin to crystallize in other structural forms, but to no avail.Based on all this, the previous assignment of other phases for anhydrous psilocybin seems highly unlikely and this careful work casts doubt that any other anhydrous polymorphs could exist.This tour de force study is one that deserves exposure in the classroom, so that crystallography students may see how powder diffraction crystallography can rise to the gold standard level that we expect from single-crystal analysis.In fact, it is worth noting that the agreement seen between DFT and the powder-synchrotron structure is far better than the DFT-single crystal agreement.The impact of this work on patents issued with incorrect crystallography is something to be resolved in courts, not the scientific literature, but I have no doubt that a number of scientific managers are currently considering the potential impact that less-than-careful crystallography might have on their organization's intellectual property collections.The compelling structural validation work by Sherwood et al. (2022) demonstrates the great value of DFT as a partner tool to crystallography.As I write this, on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day, thinking about DFT raises for me thoughts on another topic of contemporary worldwide interest -if not contention -which is on the value in opening borders for immigration.It is worth remembering that the life of Walter",

The complex crystallizes in the triclinic space group P \\overline{1} and the central Zn II atom is located on an inversion center. The NPA ligand is found to coordinate via the carboxylate O atoms with unique C—O bond lengths that support an unequal distribution of resonance over the carboxylate fragment. The axial H 2 O ligands form hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules that stabilize the supramolecular system in rigid straight chains, with an angle of 180° along the c axis. π stacking is the primary stabilization along the a and b axes, resulting in a highly ordered supramolecular structure.

    "abstract": "Two new crystalline solids, namely, 5-aminotetrazole-3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid-water (1/4/6), CH3N5·4C7H6O4·6H2O (I), and 5-aminotetrazolium 3,5-dinitrosalicylate, CH4N5+·C7H3N2O7- (II), have been synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Hirshfeld surface analysis. The crystal packing arrangements of I and II are governed by N-H...O and O-H...O hydrogen-bonding interactions. In cocrystal I, adjacent acid molecules are linked through O-H...O hydrogen bonds, forming a dimer with an R22(8) motif. In salt II, the tetrazolium cation and acid anion are linked through N-H...O hydrogen bonds to also form a dimer with an R22(8) motif. Further N-H...O and O-H...O hydrogen bonds help to stabilize the crystal packing, along with aromatic π-π stacking interactions in I and carbonyl...π interactions in II. The Hirshfeld surface analysis and fingerprint plots reveal that O...H/H...O interactions contribute 34.4% of the total interactions in the crystal packing of cocrystal I and 36.7% in salt II.",

The octahedral coordination geometry around the Fe II centre is completed by a bidentate 5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine ligand. Two polymorphs for this compound were obtained from the crude reaction product, the first in the space group P -1 and the other in P 2 1 / c . The molecular and crystal structures are very similar for both forms, the main difference being that the eight-membered Fe(μ-1,3-N 3 ) 2 Fe metallacycle formed with end-to-end azide ligands has a nearly flat conformation in the triclinic form and a chair conformation in the monoclinic form. In spite of this geometric difference, both forms have the same density, the same packing index and similar arrangements of the one-dimensional chains in the crystal. As a consequence, they also share very similar Hirshfeld surfaces and fingerprint plots. However, a density functional theory (DFT) computational study showed that the monoclinic form is more stable than the triclinic form by ca 30.5 kJ mol −1 .",

In vitro antitubercular and antidiabetic screening of the β-aminopropioamidoxime tosylation products was also carried out. It was revealed that this series of compounds does not have activity against drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, and exhibits high and moderate antidiabetic α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity. Using the hydrogen-bond propensity tool, we found that the inclination of counter-ions and atoms to act as acceptors of hydrogen bonds for the amino group decreases passing from tosylate O atoms to water molecules and the N atoms of five-membered rings. This fact is probably the reason for the formation in the solids of hydrogen-bonded tetramers consisting of two anions and two cations, and the rare occurrence of 2-aminospiropyrazolinium salt hydrates.",

The crystal and molecular structures of solid phase I have been determined at 173 K. The cyclohexyl rings both adopt the chair conformation and are equatorially substituted. The packing of 1 in the crystalline state is driven by the antiparallel arrangement of cyano dipoles with the formation of close contacts involving the strong cyano acceptor and weak aromatic C-H or aliphatic C-H donors. The crystal packing is discussed and compared with X-ray diffraction data in the liquid-crystalline state. The combination of thermal analysis, optical polarizing microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis suggests that the mesophase is a partially ordered smectic phase. The lamellar structure of the mesophase is retained in crystalline solid phase II obtained by cooling the liquid-crystalline phase.",

They are not found as natural building blocks of canonical DNA. Reports on their conformational properties are limited. Herein, the single-crystal X-ray structure of α-D-2′-deoxyadenosine (α-dA), C 10 H 13 N 5 O 3 , and its conformational parameters were determined. In the crystalline state, α-dA forms two conformers in the asymmetric unit which are connected by hydrogen bonds. The sugar moiety of each conformer is arranged in a `clamp'-like fashion with respect to the other conformer, forming hydrogen bonds to its nucleobase and sugar residue. For both conformers, a syn conformation of the nucleobase with respect to the sugar moiety was found. This is contrary to the anti conformation usually preferred by α-nucleosides. The sugar conformation of both conformers is C2′- endo , and the 5′-hydroxyl groups are in a + sc orientation, probably due to the hydrogen bonds formed by the conformers. The formation of the supramolecular assembly of α-dA is controlled by hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions, which was verified by a Hirshfeld and curvedness surface analysis. Chains of hydrogen-bonded nucleobases extend parallel to the b direction and are linked to equivalent chains by hydrogen bonds involving the sugar moieties to form a sheet. A comparison of the solid-state structures of the anomeric 2′-deoxyadenosines revealed significant differences of their conformational parameters.",

As observed in other X-ray structures of disaccharides containing β-(1→4) O -glycosidic linkages, inter-residue hydrogen bonding between O3H of the βGlcNAc bearing the OCH 3 aglycone and O5 of the adjacent βGlcNAc is observed based on the 2.79 Å internuclear distance between the O atoms.

The O -glycosidic linkage torsion angles, phi (ϕ) and psi (ψ), in (III) and (IV) differ by 6–8°. The N -acetyl side chain conformation in (III) and (IV) shows some context dependence, with the C1—C2—N—C car torsion angle 10–15° smaller for the βGlcNAc residue involved in the internal O -glycosidic linkage. In (IV), conformational disorder is observed in the exocyclic hydroxymethyl (–CH 2 OH) group in the βGlcNAc residue bearing the OCH 3 aglycone, and a fitting of the electron density indicates an approximate 50:50 distribution of the gauche – gauche ( gg ) and gauche – trans ( gt ) conformers in the lattice. Similar behavior is not observed in (III), presumably due to the different packing structure in the vicinity of the –CH 2 OH substituent that affects its ability to hydrogen bond to proximal donors/acceptors. Unlike (IV), a re-examination of the previously reported electron density of (III) revealed conformational disorder in the N -acetyl side chain attached to the reducing-end βGlcNAc residue caused by rotation about the C2—N bond.",

The neutral complex sports two carbonyls and an oligotetrapyrrolic biladiene ligand. Notably, the biladiene adopts a coordination geometry that is well distorted from square planar and much more closely approximates a seesaw arrangement. Accordingly, Ru(CO) 2 [DMBil1] is not only the first ruthenium cis -dicarbonyl with a tetrapyrrole ligand, but also the first metal biladiene complex in which the tetrapyrrole does not adopt a (pseudo-)square-planar coordination geometry. Ru(CO) 2 [DMBil1] is weakly luminescent, displaying λ em = 552 nm upon excitation at λ ex = 500 nm, supports two reversible 1 e − reductions at −1.45 and −1.73 V ( versus Fc + /Fc), and has significant absorption features at 481 and 531 nm, suggesting suitability for photocatalytic and photosensitization applications. While the structure of Ru(CO) 2 [DMBil1] was initially determined by X-ray diffraction, a traditionally acceptable quality structure could not be obtained (despite multiple attempts) because of consistently poor crystal quality. An independent structure obtained from electron diffraction experiments corroborates the structure of this unusual biladiene complex.",

In the solvent-free crystals of (II) and (III), the hydroxy H atoms are involved in intramolecular O-H···π hydrogen bonding, with the central arene ring of the terphenyl unit acting as an acceptor. The corresponding crystal structures are stabilized by intermolecular C-H···π contacts. Due to the distinctive acceptor character of the included DMF solvent species in the crystal structures of (IIa) and (IIIa), the guest molecule is coordinated to the host via O-H···O=C hydrogen bonding. In both crystal structures, infinite strands composed of alternating host and guest molecules represent the basic supramolecular aggregates. Within a given strand, the O atom of the solvent molecule acts as a bifurcated acceptor. Similar to the solvent-free cases, the hydroxy H atoms in inclusion structure (IIIb) are involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, and there is thus a lack of host-guest interaction. As a result, the solvent molecules are accommodated as C-H···N hydrogen-bonded inversion-symmetric dimers in the channel-like voids of the host lattice.",

These weak interactions play a prominent role in the structural stability and aid the highly regio- and diastereoselective synthesis. In each of the four structures, the molecular assembly in the crystal is also governed by weak noncovalent interactions.

The molecules are packed through N-H...O and N-H...S hydrogen bonds in the crystal and these hydrogen bonds are responsible for the high melting point. The P atoms of the anion and cation both have distorted tetrahedral environments.",

This simple change in the structure substantially alters the intermolecular interaction patterns. The substituted phenyl group adopts a synclinal geometry with respect to the plane of the pyridine ring in all three compounds. In (I), a C-H···N interaction results in a one-dimensional chain parallel to the b axis. In (II), there are two C-H···N(nitrile) interactions from different symmetry-related molecules, resulting in a two-dimensional network parallel to the bc plane. There is also a weak C-H···O interaction from the ethoxy group to an adjacent nitro O atom. The present work is an example of how the simple replacement of a substituent in the main molecular scaffold may transform the structure type, paving the way for a variety of supramolecular motifs and consequently altering the complexity of the intermolecular interaction patterns.",

The ccop(2-) anions bridge the Zn(II) cations in a head-to-tail fashion via monodentate aromatic carboxylate and phenolate O atoms to form an extended zigzag chain which runs parallel to the [011] direction. One O atom of the aliphatic carboxylate group of the ccop(2-) ligand coordinates to the Zn(II) atom of a neighbouring chain thereby producing undulating layers which lie parallel to the (01-1) plane. A similar parallel undulating planar structure can be obtained if a path involving the other O atom of the aliphatic carboxylate group is considered. Thus, the aliphatic carboxylate group acts in a bridging bidentate mode to give extended -Zn-O-C-O-Zn- sequences running parallel to [001] which link the layers into an overall three-dimensional framework. The three-dimensional framework can be simplified as a 4-connected sra topology with a Schläfli symbol of 4(2).6(3).8 if all the Zn(II) centres and ccop(2-) anions are regarded as tetrahedral 4-connected nodes.

    "abstract": "Prototropy tautomerism and E/Z-stereoisomerism of 2-iminothiazolidin-4-ones was extensively studied in the literature during the past several decades.This tautomerism was studied for both alkyl/aryl-amino/imino-substituted thiazolidinones/ thiazolinones by several authors (Comrie, 1964;A ˚kerblom, 1967;Chowdry et al., 2000;Mornon & Raveau, 1971;Ramsh et al., 1978) in the solid state, as well as in solution, and the results can be generalized as follows.Exo-N-unsubstituted and N-alkyl-substituted compounds exist in solution preferentially as 2-(alkyl)aminothiazolin-4-ones, whereas N-aryl-substituted compounds prefer the 2-(arylimino)thiazolidin-4-one arrangement, although some exceptions to this rule were also reported (Sedla ´k et al., 2002;Kammel & Hanusek, 2014).For example, in a recent article (Kammel & Hanusek, 2014) we have found that base-catalyzed cyclization of N-isopropyl-S-(2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-3-yl)isothiouronium bromide gives 5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-isopropylimino-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one, which during crystallization or simple heating undergoes the above-mentioned prototropy tautomerism to give 5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-isopropylamino-1,3-thiazolin-4-one.From this observation it is evident that the solvent, purification method, temperature and other parameters can influence the position of tautomeric equilibrium and also the crystal packing.In our article from 2009 (Va ´n ˇa et al., 2009), the single crystal of 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-[(pyridin-2-yl)imino]-1,3-thiazolidin-4one was grown from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), whereas the single crystal studied by Gzella et al. ( 2014) was grown from methanol from a sample previously prepared in refluxing ethanol.In order to support our refinement (Va ´n ˇa et al., 2009), the following arguments are given: three peaks assignable to the 'amino or imine' H atoms were located on our Fourier difference map under the given measurement conditions (150 K).Both tautomers were refined but based on the known NMR assignment, literature data and higher electron density we decided to refine the structure as the imine tautomer.To conclude, we are surprised how Gzella et al. (2014) could suggest that our structure had an incorrectly-positioned H atom based on the measurement under different conditions on crystals grown from a different solvent, and last, but not least, from a disordered structure, when tautomerism is always a chemical equilibrium.",

The cations are constructed by two N-[(diphenylphosphanyl)methyl]pyridin-4-amine (DPP) ligands linking two Ag(+) cations in a head-to-tail fashion. In (1), the unique Ag(+) cation has a near-linear coordination geometry consisting of one pyridine N atom and one P atom from two different DPP ligands. Two ClO4(-) anions doubly bridge two metallomacrocycles through Ag···O and N-H···O weak interactions to form a chain extending in the c direction. The half-occupancy acetonitrile molecule lies with its methyl C atom on a twofold axis and makes a weak N···Ag contact. In (2), there are two independent [Ag(C18H17N2P)](+) cations. The nitrate anions weakly chelate to each Ag(+) cation, leading to each Ag(+) cation having a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry consisting of one pyridine N atom and one P atom from two different DPP ligands, and two chelating nitrate O atoms. Each dinuclear [Ag2(C18H17N2P)2(NO3)2] molecule acts as a four-node to bridge four adjacent equivalent molecules through N-H···O interactions, forming a two-dimensional sheet parallel to the bc plane. Each sheet contains dinuclear molecules involving just Ag1 or Ag2 and these two types of sheet are stacked in an alternating fashion. The sheets containing Ag1 all lie near x = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 etc, while those containing Ag2 all lie near x = 0, 1, 2 etc. Thus, the two independent sheets are arranged in an alternating sequence at x = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 etc. These two different supramolecular structures result from the different geometric conformations of the templating anions which direct the self-assembly of the cations and anions.",

Compound (1) is novel, whereas the results for compounds (2) and (3) have been reported previously, but we record here our results for compound (3), which we find are more precise and accurate than those currently reported in the literature. In (1), two cyclo-P(O)OCH2CMe2CH2O groups are linked through a catechol group. The conformations about the two catechol O atoms are quite different, viz. one C-C-O-P torsion angle is -169.11 (11)° and indicates a trans arrangement, whereas the other C-C-O-P torsion angle is 92.48 (16)°, showing a gauche conformation. Both six-membered POCCCO rings have good chair-shape conformations. In both the trans and gauche conformations, the catechol O atoms are in the axial sites and the short P=O bonds are equatorially bound.",

A novel octanuclear nickel(II)-molybdenum(VI) heterometallic cluster based on the salicylhydroxamate ligand, namely di-μ3-acetato-di-μ2-acetato-di-μ3-hydroxido-di-μ3-oxido-tetraoxidooctakis(pyridine-κN)bis(μ5-salicylhydroxamato)hexanickel(II)dimolybdenum(VI) monohydrate, [Mo2Ni6(C7H4NO3)2(C2H3O2)4O5(OH)2(C5H5N)8]·H2O, (I), was synthesized by the reaction of sodium molybdate, nickel acetate and salicylhydroxamic acid in a dimethylformamide/pyridine/methanol solution at room temperature. The salicylhydroxamate(3-) (shi(3-)), acetate and oxide ligands adopt complicated coordination modes and link six Ni(II) and two Mo(VI) cations into the octanuclear heterometallic cluster. All of the metal cations exhibit octahedral coordination geometries and are connected to each other through the sharing of corners, edges or planes. The heterometallic clusters are further connected to form two-dimensional supramolecular layers through weak C-H...O hydrogen bonds.

PhD thesis, ETH Zürich. Switzerland]. At that time it was not possible to discriminate unambiguously between the positions of some of the chloride ions and water O atoms, and disorder was thus postulated. In a new determination, a conclusive scheme of hydrogen bonding proves to be a particularly appealing aspect of the structure. Single crystals of the title compound, C12H30GeN6O6(4+)·4Cl(-)·6H2O or [Ge(taci)2]2Cl8·12H2O, were grown from an aqueous solution by slow evaporation of the solvent. The two [Ge(taci)2](4+) cations exhibit a double-adamantane-type structure with exclusive O-atom coordination and approximate D3d symmetry. The taci ligands adopt a zwitterionic form with deprotonated hydroxy groups and protonated amino groups. Both cations are hydrogen bonded to six water molecules. The structure of the hydration shell of the two cations is, however, slightly different. The {[Ge(taci)2]·6H2O}(4+) aggregates are interlinked in all three dimensions by further hydrogen bonds of the types N-H...Cl...H-N, N-H...O(H)2...H-N, (Ge)O...H-O(H)...H-N, N-H...O(H)-H...Cl...H-N, (Ge)O...H-O-H...Cl...H-N, N-H...O(H)-H...Cl...H-(H)O...H-N, (Ge)O...H-O-H...Cl...H-(H)O...H-N and Ge(O)...H-O-H...Cl...H-O-H...O(Ge).",

    "abstract": "As indicated by its title, the book ‘Chemistry for Environmental Scientists’ aims at covering a very broad field of knowledge. After a short and general introduction, it is divided in four chapters, namely ‘Chemistry under environmental conditions’, ‘Fundamentals of physical chemistry’, ‘Chemistry of the elements and its [sic] compounds in the environment’ and ‘Chemical processes in the environment’. The first chapter gives mainly basic physicochemical concepts on matter and its states. Some examples relating to air, atmosphere, ‘water and waters’ (i.e. pure water and natural waters), soils and dusts are given. The second chapter concentrates on physical chemistry, thermodynamics and kinetics, though the discussed concepts of general chemistry are those usually taught at the bachelor degree level in chemistry. This second chapter is completely independent of the others. The third chapter deals with chemistry in the atmosphere and in the condensed phases of H, O, N, S, C, halogens, phosphorus, metal and metalloids. The final chapter deals with numerous subjects, such as chemical evolution, the formation of the earth, volcanism, photosynthesis, atmospheric chemistry and radioactivity. Although this book deals with a very interesting field of science, it is difficult for me to recommend it. Indeed, the way the species are written is not in the way recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and in many cases I simply could not understand the things that were written. [What are the species H and OH in solution? I would have said before (and after) reading this book that they don’t exist in the terrestrial environment. H and OH are only two examples of improbable species among numerous others in the book.] Equilibrium constants are also not calculated as recommended by IUPAC and the chemical activity concept is clearly not considered. What I would understand as radical species are not indicated in the normal way (i.e. with a superscript dot) in most cases, so it is hard to understand the species in question. Moreover, there are some typographical errors which are offputting (for instance, Mg is not the reduced species of Mg). There might be some useful information in this book but the problems described in the preceding paragraph make the reader wary of placing undue reliance on its content. ISSN 2053-2296",

    "abstract": "Proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) are prodrugs used widely to treat acid-related diseases since the late 1980s. After an extensive research effort it has become clear that the fundamental interactions between metal atoms and PPIs are of paramount importance for both drug release and long-term therapeutic safety. Unfortunately, until now, very little information has been available on this topic. In this paper, we report the crystal structure analysis of a novel calcium–PPI compound incorporating bridging and terminal deprotonated ( R )-rabeprazole tricyclic ligands ( L ), namely bis[μ-( R )-2-({[4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl]methyl}sulfinyl)-6,7-dihydro-3 H -benzofuro[5,6- d ]imidazol-1-ido]bis{dimethanol[( R )-2-({[4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl]methyl}sulfinyl)-6,7-dihydro-3 H -benzofuro[5,6- d ]imidazol-1-ido]calcium(II)} methanol hexasolvate, [Ca 2 (C 20 H 22 N 3 O 4 S) 4 (CH 3 OH) 4 ]·6CH 3 OH or [Ca 2 ( L ) 4 (CH 3 OH) 4 ]·6CH 3 OH, which crystallizes from methanol in the polar C 2 space group. Using low-temperature microcrystal synchrotron radiation, we demonstrate that this compound is in the form of a beautiful `butterfly molecule', consisting of a C 2 -symmetric dinuclear (CH 3 OH) 2 L Ca II (μ 2 - L ) 2 Ca II L (HOCH 3 ) 2 framework. A large amount of disorder is found within the bridging L ligand and the conformation of the fused tetrahydrofuran ring exhibits great variety. All the sulfinyl groups remain intact and the nonbonded Ca...Ca distance is significantly longer than in other calcium dimers, indicating steric hindrance in the bridging ligands. Considerable hydrogen bonding and aromatic C—H...π interactions co-operate to stabilize the whole complex, as well as to facilitate supramolecular assembly. Additional investigations into the bond nature were made using density functional theory (DFT) methods at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level; geometry optimization, Mulliken atomic charges, MEP (molecular electrostatic potential), HOMO–LUMO (highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), TDOS (total density of states), PDOS (partial density of states), COOP (crystal orbital overlap population) and vibrational spectra were calculated/recorded and assessed carefully.",

The host (4R,5R)-4,5-bis(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane, (I), displays expected conformational features. The crystal-disordered chiral guest 4,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(3H)-one, (II), is present in the crystal 85.1 (4)% of the time. It shares a common site with 4a-hydroperoxymethyl-4,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(3H)-one, (III), present 14.9 (4)% of the time, which is the product of autoxidation of (II). This minor peroxide impurity was isolated, and the results of nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, and X-ray fluorescence studies are consistent with the proposed structure of (III). The complete structure was therefore determined to be (4R,5R)-4,5-bis(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(3H)-one-4a-hydroperoxymethyl-4,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(3H)-one (1/0.85/0.15), C31H30O4·0.85C10H14O·0.15C10H14O3, (IV). There are host-host, host-guest, and host-impurity hydrogen-bonding interactions of types S and D in the solid state. We believe that the crystals of (IV) were originally prepared to establish the chirality of the guest (II) by means of X-ray diffraction analysis of host/guest crystals obtained in the course of chiral resolution during cocrystallization of (II) with (I). In spite of the absence of `heavy' elements, the absolute configurations of all anomeric centres in the structure are assigned as R based on resonant scattering effects.",

Neither cation exhibits any geometrical strain induced by the intrinsic repulsion between the positive charges.

In these structures, the carboxylate groups are engaged in short contacts with the cations and in hydrogen bonds with water molecules, if present. If both O atoms of the carboxylate group take part in such interactions, the negative charge is delocalized over the two atoms. In the absence of hydrogen bonds and contacts with cations, the negative charge is localized on one of the O atoms. In the crystal structures of tetramethylammonium 2-hydroxy-5-[(E)-(4-nitrophenyl)diazenyl]benzoate and tetramethylammonium 2-hydroxy-5-[(E)-(2-nitrophenyl)diazenyl]benzoate, both C4H12N(+)·C13H8N3O5(-), all the interactions between the cations and anions are weak, and their effect on the geometry of the anions is negligible. Under these conditions, the 2-nitro-substituted anion is an almost pure phenol-carboxylate tautomer, whereas in the 4-nitro-substituted anion, the phenolic H atom is shifted towards the carboxylate group, and thus the structure of this anion is intermediate between the phenol-carboxylate and phenolate-carboxylic acid tautomeric forms. The probable formation of such an intermediate form is supported by quantum chemical calculations. Being the characteristic feature of this form, a short distance between the phenolic and carboxylate O atoms is observed in the 4-nitro-substituted anion, as well as in the structures of some 3,5-dinitrosalicylates reported in the literature.",

In the design and synthesis of extended frameworks, supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking and van der Waals interactions, have been exploited for molecular recognition associated with biological activity and for the engineering of molecular solids.The title compound, [Ag(CN)(C12H12N2)]n, crystallizes with the Ag(I) cation on a twofold axis, half a cyanide ligand disordered about a centre of inversion and half a twofold-symmetric 5,5'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine (5,5'-dmbpy) ligand in the asymmetric unit. Each Ag(I) cation exhibits a distorted tetrahedral geometry; the coordination environment comprises one C(N) atom and one N(C) atom from substitutionally disordered cyanide bridging ligands, and two N atoms from a bidentate chelating 5,5'-dmbpy ligand. The cyanide ligand links adjacent Ag(I) cations to generate a one-dimensional zigzag chain. These chains are linked together via weak nonclassical intermolecular interactions, generating a two-dimensional supramolecular network.",

    "abstract": "Valinomycin is a naturally occurring cyclic dodecadepsipeptide with the formula cyclo -[D-HiVA→L-Val →L-LA→L-Val] 3 (D-HiVA is D-α-hydroxyisovaleic acid, Val is valine and LA is lactic acid), which binds a K + ion with high selectively. In the past, several cation-binding modes have been revealed by X-ray crystallography. In the K + , Rb + and Cs + complexes, the ester O atoms coordinate the cation with a trigonal antiprismatic geometry, while the six amide groups form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the network that is formed has a bracelet-like conformation (Type 1 binding). Type 2 binding is seen with the Na + cation, in which the valinomycin molecule retains the bracelet conformation but the cations are coordinated by only three ester carbonyl groups and are not centrally located. In addition, a picrate counter-ion and a water molecule is found at the center of the valinomycin bracelet. Type 3 binding is observed with divalent Ba 2+ , in which two cations are incorporated, bridged by two anions, and coordinated by amide carbonyl groups, and there are no intramolecular amide hydrogen bonds. In this paper, we present a new Type 4 cation-binding mode, observed in valinomycin hexaaquamagnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonate) trihydrate, C 54 H 90 N 6 O 18 ·[Mg(H 2 O) 6 ](CF 3 SO 3 ) 2 ·3H 2 O, in which the valinomycin molecule incorporates a whole hexaaquamagnesium ion, [Mg(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ , via hydrogen bonding between the amide carbonyl groups and the hydrate water H atoms. In this complex, valinomycin retains the threefold symmetry observed in Type 1 binding, but the amide hydrogen-bond network is lost; the hexaaquamagnesium cation is hydrogen bonded by six amide carbonyl groups. 1 H NMR titration data is consistent with the 1:1 binding stoichiometry in acetonitrile solution. This new cation-binding mode of binding a whole hexaaquamagnesium ion by a cyclic polypeptide is likely to have important implications for the study of metal binding with biological models under physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Tropolone long has served as a model system for unraveling the ubiquitous phenomena of proton transfer and hydrogen bonding. This molecule, which juxtaposes ketonic, hydroxylic, and aromatic functionalities in a framework of minimal complexity, also has provided a versatile platform for investigating the synergism among competing intermolecular forces, including those generated by hydrogen bonding and aryl coupling. Small members of the troponoid family typically produce crystals that are stabilized strongly by pervasive π–π, C—H...π, or ion–π interactions. The organic salt (TrOH·iBA) formed by a facile proton-transfer reaction between tropolone (TrOH) and isobutylamine (iBA), namely isobutylammonium 7-oxocyclohepta-1,3,5-trien-1-olate, C 4 H 12 N + ·C 7 H 5 O 2 − , has been investigated by X-ray crystallography, with complementary quantum-chemical and statistical-database analyses serving to elucidate the nature of attendant intermolecular interactions and their synergistic effects upon lattice-packing phenomena. The crystal structure deduced from low-temperature diffraction measurements displays extensive hydrogen-bonding networks, yet shows little evidence of the aryl forces ( viz. π–π, C—H...π, and ion–π interactions) that typically dominate this class of compounds. Density functional calculations performed with and without the imposition of periodic boundary conditions (the latter entailing isolated subunits) documented the specificity and directionality of noncovalent interactions occurring between the proton-donating and proton-accepting sites of TrOH and iBA, as well as the absence of aromatic coupling mediated by the seven-membered ring of TrOH. A statistical comparison of the structural parameters extracted for key hydrogen-bond linkages to those reported for 44 previously known crystals that support similar binding motifs revealed TrOH·iBA to possess the shortest donor–acceptor distances of any troponoid-based complex, combined with unambiguous signatures of enhanced proton-delocalization processes that putatively stabilize the corresponding crystalline lattice and facilitate its surprisingly rapid formation under ambient conditions.",

The crystal structure of SN-38 as the monohydrate, C22H20N2O5·H2O, reveals that it is a monoclinic crystal, with one SN-38 molecule and one water molecule in the asymmetric unit. When the crystal is heated to 473 K, approximately 30% of SN-38 is hydrolyzed at its lactone ring, resulting in the formation of the inactive carboxylate form. The molecular arrangement around the water molecule and the lactone ring of SN-38 in the crystal structure suggests that SN-38 is hydrolyzed by the water molecule at (x, y, z) nucleophilically attacking the carbonyl C atom of the lactone ring at (x - 1, y, z - 1). Hydrogen bonding around the water molecules and the lactone ring appears to promote this hydrolysis reaction: two carbonyl O atoms, which are hydrogen bonded as hydrogen-bond acceptors to the water molecule at (x, y, z), might enhance the nucleophilicity of this water molecule, while the water molecule at (-x, y + 1/2, -z), which is hydrogen bonded as a hydrogen-bond donor to the carbonyl O atom at (x - 1, y, z - 1), might enhance the electrophilicity of the carbonyl C atom.",

Moreover, meso-functionalized porphyrins with virtually fourfold symmetry can be relatively readily synthesized from pyrrole and the appropriate aldehyde. A number of metallo derivatives of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-cyanophenyl)porphyrin, where the N atom of the linear cyano group can act both as a donor for coordination bonds or as an acceptor for hydrogen bonds, have been structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis.

The crystal structure of [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3-cyanophenyl)porphyrinato]copper(II) (CuTCNPP) nitrobenzene trisolvate, [Cu(C48H24N8)]·3C6H5NO2, has been determined at 80 K by synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction. CuTCNPP exhibits a C2h-symmetric ααββ conformation, despite an unsymmetrical crystal environment, and is situated on a crystallographic centre of symmetry. The CuII ion adopts a genuine square-planar coordination by the four pyrrole N atoms. The 24-membered porphyrin ring system shows no marked deviation from planarity. In the crystal, the CuTCNPP molecules and two nitrobenzene molecules are face-to-face stacked in an alternating fashion, resulting in corrugated layers. The remaining nitrobenzene guest molecule per CuTCNPP resides in the region between four neighbouring columnar stacks of CuTCNPP and sandwiched nitrobenzene molecules, and is disordered over four positions about a centre of symmetry.",

    "abstract": "The photophysical properties of organic fluorophores are sensitive to the local sterics of the surrounding environment. Restriction of torsional motion in aggregates and crystals can give rise to enhanced emissive behavior. N-Aryl-substituted carbazoles serve an essential role as ubiquitous host matrices for organic light-emitting diodes, due to their large band gaps and high triplet energies, and so studies connecting photophysical behaviors with detailed crystallographic structural information are important. To elucidate the structural changes involved in the excited-state charge-transfer processes of N-aryl-substituted carbazoles with ester withdrawing groups, ethyl 4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl) benzoate, C21H17NO2, was synthesized. The compound crystallizes with ten independent molecules in the asymmetric unit that pack together through moderate C-H...π interactions between carbazole units (2.5-2.9 Å) and π-stacks of benzoate groups (3.8-3.9 Å) between neighboring molecules. Four of the ten independent molecules show disorder by rotation of the ethyl carboxylate groups, with major occupancy rates between 0.931 (3) and 0.840 (3). The attached benzoate groups are also disordered, with identical occupancies, to compensate for the altered steric profile of the misaligned ethyl ester groups. For two molecules, the disorder extends to the entire carbazole units as well. Torsion angles between the nonplanar carbazole and benzoate groups range from θ = 44.8 to 57.2°, while those between the benzoate planes and the carboxylate COO atoms vary from α = 6.4 to 15.7°. The crystal is twinned by pseudomerohedry. The superstructure can be reduced to a hypothetical averaged parent structure in the space group Pbcn with Z' = 1, displaying fourfold disorder. Variable-temperature data collection shows that there is no phase transition between the disordered supercell and the hypothetical parent structure; supercell reflections persist up to 350 K. We propose that the disorder and variation in torsion angles result from frustrated close-packing and necessitate a unit cell with a high Z' number.",

    "abstract": "The self-assembly of coordination polymers and the crystal engineering of metal-organic coordination frameworks have attracted great interest, but it is still a challenge to predict and control the compositions and structures of the complexes. Employing multidentate organic ligands and suitable metal ions to construct inorganic-organic hybrid materials through metal-ligand coordination and hydrogen-bonding interactions has become a major strategy. Recently, imidazole-containing multidentate ligands that contain an aromatic core have received much attention. A new three-dimensional MnII coordination polymer based on 1,3,5-tris[(1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]benzene, namely poly[(ethane-1,2-diol-κO)(μ-sulfato-κ2O:O'){μ3-1,3,5-tris[(1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]benzene-κ3N:N':N''}manganese(II)], [Mn(SO4)(C18H18N6)(C2H6O2)]n, was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystal structural analysis shows that there are two kinds of crystallographically independent MnII centres, each lying on a centrosymmetric position and having a similar six-coordinated octahedral structure. One is coordinated by four N atoms from four 1,3,5-tris[(1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]benzene (timb) ligands and two O atoms from two different bridging sulfate anions. The second is surrounded by two timb N atoms and four O atoms, two from sulfate anions and two from two ethane-1,2-diol ligands. The tripodal timb ligand bridges neighbouring MnII centres to generate a two-dimensional layered structure running parallel to the ab plane. Adjacent layers are further bridged by sulfate anions, resulting in a three-dimensional structure with 3,4,6-c topology. Thermogravimetric analysis of the title polymer shows that it is stable up to 533 K. The first weight loss between 533 and 573 K corresponds to the release of coordinated ethane-1,2-diol molecules, and further decomposition occurred at 648 K.",

The pdon ligand chelates to zinc through its two N atoms to form part of the [ZnN2O4] octahedron. The two crystallographically independent bdc(2-) ligands are fully deprotonated and adopt μ3-κO:κO':κO'' and μ4-κO:κO':κO'':κO''' coordination modes, bridging three or four Zn(II) cations, respectively, from two Zn4(OH)2 units. The Zn4(OH)2 fragment connects six neighbouring tetranuclear units through four μ3-bdc(2-) and two μ4-bdc(2-) ligands, forming a three-dimensional framework with uninodal 6-connected α-Po topology, in which the tetranuclear Zn4(OH)2 units are considered as 6-connected nodes and the bdc(2-) ligands act as linkers. The uncoordinated water molecules are located on opposite sides of the Zn4(OH)2 unit and are connected to it through hydrogen-bonding interactions involving hydroxide and carboxylate groups. The structure is further stabilized by extensive π-π interactions between the pdon and μ4-bdc(2-) ligands.",

The results indicate that the structure can indeed be described in the centrosymmetric space group Pm3m; no justification for the absence of the inversion centre could be found within the accuracy of the available data. In comparison with Ni2Sn2Zn, slight but significant differences were confirmed; consequently, the two structures are topologically related but not isotypic.",

Accordingly, the compound displays a pronounced preferred exopolyhedral ligand orientation (ELO) which is traced to both the greater trans influence of the cage B over the cage C atoms and the greater trans influence of the triphenylphosphane ligands over the nitrate ligand.

The N 3 O 2 donor set coordinates to the metal centre in a pentagonal planar arrangement; seven-coordinated Mn II complexes were obtained via coordination of two auxiliary ligands (anions or water molecules) at the axial positions. However, in some cases, the alcohol O-atom donors remain uncoordinated, resulting in five- or six-coordinated Mn II complexes.

Theoretical calculations of the relaxed potential energy surface (rPES) revealed that the energy barriers for the rotation of the nitro group for isolated H2Cl4na + and H2m6na + cations are 4.6 and 11.6 kcal mol −1 , respectively. The ammonium group and respective anions form hydrogen bonds which are the most important interactions and are arranged in zero- (in 3 ), one- (in 1 and 4 ) or two-dimensional (in 2 and 5 ) networks. Hydrogen-bonding patterns were analyzed by means of mathematical relationships between graph-set descriptors and compared with previously reported nitroaniline salts. Hirshfeld surface analysis indicates that the nitro group plays a dominant role among the weak interactions, i.e. C—H...O(NO 2 ), NO 2 ...π(Ar) and O(NO 2 )...π(NO 2 ). The frequency of the ν s NO 2 vibration is correlated with the type of interaction in which the NO 2 group is involved. Analysis of the ν s NO 2 band observed in the IR and Raman spectra allowed an assessment of its shift in the sequence (H2m6na)I 3 ( 4 ) &lt; (H2m6na)HSO 4 ( 5 ) &lt; (H2m6na)Br ( 3 ) &lt; (H2Cl4na)Br ( 1 ) &lt; (H2Cl4na)HSO 4 ( 2 ).",

The composition obtained from refinement of the XRD data is in agreement with the EDS results. In the present study, chemical disorder was only detected on the 8 h positions. The ordering is compared with other members of the X -phase family and shows that the degree of disordering depends on the chemical composition.

    "abstract": "The molecular structures of five diorganotin(IV) carboxylates, (I)–(V), can be categorized into two main well-known structural types for such Sn complexes. One is the mononuclear dialkytin(IV) carboxylates with an [R 2 Sn( L H) 2 ]-type skew-trapezoidal bipyramid, where the alkyl ligands are in pseudo-axial positions and the O atoms from two asymmetrically coordinated bidentate carboxylate ligands are in the equatorial plane. This structure type is adopted by dibutylbis{( E )-2-hydroxy-5-[(3-methylphenyl)diazenyl]benzoato}tin(IV) cyclohexane hemisolvate, [Sn(C 4 H 9 ) 2 (C 14 H 11 N 2 O 3 ) 2 ]·0.5C 6 H 12 , (I), dibenzylbis{( E )-5-[(4-bromophenyl)diazenyl]-2-hydroxybenzoato}tin(IV), [Sn(C 7 H 7 ) 2 (C 13 H 8 BrN 2 O 3 ) 2 ], (II), and aquadibenzylbis(4-{( E )-[( Z )-4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-ylidene]amino}benzoato)tin(IV) benzene disolvate, [Sn(C 7 H 7 ) 2 (C 12 H 12 NO 3 ) 2 (H 2 O)]·2C 6 H 6 , (III), although the latter has an additional water ligand to give a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry in which the carboxylate groups are more symmetrically coordinated to the Sn atom than in (I) and (II). The other structure motif is that of the tetranuclear bis(dicarboxylatotetraorganodistannoxanes), {[R 2 Sn( L H)] 2 O} 2 , which contain an Sn 4 O 2 core decorated with four bridging carboxylate ligands, plus two alkyl ligands at each Sn IV centre. The complexes octabutyltetrakis{μ-( E )-4-[(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)diazenyl]benzoato}di-μ 3 -oxido-tetratin(IV) ethanol disolvate, [Sn 4 (C 4 H 9 ) 8 (C 15 H 13 N 2 O 3 ) 4 O 2 ]·2C 2 H 6 O, (IV), and octabutyltetrakis{( E )-3-[(2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino]propanoato}di-μ 3 -oxido-tetratin(IV), [Sn 4 (C 4 H 9 ) 8 (C 10 H 10 NO 3 ) 4 O 2 ], (V), display this motif. The structures obtained correlate with the 1:1 and 1:2 stoichiometric ratios of the dialkyltin(IV) and carboxylic acid starting materials in the syntheses. The supramolecular structures arising from consideration of secondary Sn...O interactions and/or classic hydrogen bonds include discrete molecules for (V), centrosymmetric dimers for (I), extended chains for (II) and (III), and sheets for (IV).",

Eight-coordinated metal centres have been observed in both compounds, when considering the Pb...S and Pb...Br interactions. Both compounds were characterized by FT–IR and diffuse reflectance spectroscopies, as well as by powder X-ray diffraction. Compound (II a ) and its desolvated version (II b ) represent the first structurally characterized Pb II compounds containing neutral HSpym and anionic Spym − ligands. After a prolonged time in solution, (II a ) is converted to another compound due to complete deprotonation of HSpym.

The design and construction of the target molecule were carried out starting from the guanidinium nitrate salt (previously synthesized) and the corresponding enaminone. X-ray diffraction analysis and a study of the Hirshfeld surfaces revealed important interactions between the nitro-group O atoms and the H atoms of the pyridine and pyrimidine rings. A crystalline ordering in layers, by the stacking of rings through interactions of the π–π type, was observed and confirmed by a study of the shape-index surfaces and dispersion energy calculations. Quantitative electrostatic potential studies revealed the most positive value of the molecule on regions close to the N—H groups (34.8 kcal mol −1 ); nevertheless, steric impediments and the planarity of the molecule do not allow the formation of hydrogen bonds from this group. This interaction is however activated when the molecule takes on a new extended conformation in the active pocket of the enzyme kinase (PDB ID 2hyy), interacting with protein residues that are fundamental in the inhibition process of CML. The most negative values of the molecule are seen in regions close to the nitro group (−35.4 and −34.0 kcal mol −1 ). A molecular docking study revealed an energy affinity of Δ G = −10.3 kcal mol −1 for NPPA which, despite not having a more negative value than the control molecule (Imatinib; Δ G = −12.8 kcal mol −1 ), shows great potential to be used as a template for new drugs against CML.",

    "abstract": "Derivatives of 4-methyl-1,6-diphenylpyrimidine-2(1H)-selenone show very strong antimicrobial activity. In order to extend the current knowledge about the features responsible for the biological activity, crystal structure analyses are presented for 4-methyl-1-(2-methylphenyl)-6-phenylpyrimidine-2(1H)-selenone (1), 4-methyl-1-(3-methylphenyl)-6-phenylpyrimidine-2(1H)-selenone (2), 4-methyl-1-(4-methylphenyl)-6-phenylpyrimidine-2(1H)-selenone (3) (all C18H16N2Se) and 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-6-phenylpyrimidine-2(1H)-selenone (4) (C17H13ClN2Se). Furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were evaluated. All the presented derivatives crystallize in the space group P21/c with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The molecular geometries differ slightly in the mutual orientation of the rings. The packing of molecules in the crystals is dominated by C-H...N and C-H...Se intermolecular interactions. Additionally, in the crystal structure of 4, C-H...Cl intermolecular interactions are observed. The introduction of a methyl or chlorine substituent improves the biological activity, while its position significantly affects biological activity only in case of the chlorine substituent.",

    "abstract": "The design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much interest due to the aesthetics of their crystalline architectures and their potential applications as new functional materials.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the carboxylate groups from two crystallographically independent L2- dianions link the cadmium cations into a one-dimensional helical secondary building unit (SBU). The resulting SBUs are extended into a 3D metal-organic framework via the terephthalamide moiety of the ligand as a spacer. In the crystal, two independent MOFs interpenetrate each other, thus producing a twofold interpenetrated 3D architecture, which shows an unprecedented 2-nodal (7,9)-connected net with the point (Schläfli) symbol (37·46·58)(38·411·516·6). MOF (I) was further characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The photoluminescence properties and UV-Vis absorption spectrum of (I) have also been investigated. The MOF exhibits enhanced fluorescence emission with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 31.55% and a longer lifetime compared with free H2L.",

The molecular structure is approximately C-shaped and consists of an aliphatic spacer with a boat-shaped cyclohexane ring in the middle. The centroid-to-centroid distance between the quinoxaline rings is 3.950 (1) Å, with ring-offset distances of 0.354 (3) and 0.816 (2) Å. The pendant bithiophene rings are oriented parallel to one another, which results from the thiophene rings connected to the quinoxaline rings being oriented such that their S atoms are rotated inward toward one another, but are not overlapped. Intermolecular packing is largely governed by van der Waals forces and a few weak C-H...X (X = N or O) interactions.",

    "abstract": "Coordination polymers are constructed from two basic components, namely metal ions, or metal-ion clusters, and bridging organic ligands. Their structures may also contain other auxiliary components, such as blocking ligands, counter-ions and nonbonding guest or template molecules. The choice or design of a suitable linker is essential. The new title zinc(II) coordination polymer, [Zn(C 5 H 5 NO 3 P)Cl] n , has been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy (FT–IR and FT–Raman). Additionally, computational methods have been applied to derive quantitative information about interactions present in the solid state. The compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C 2/ c . The four-coordinated Zn II cation is in a distorted tetrahedral environment, formed by three phosphonate O atoms from three different (pyridin-1-ium-3-yl)phosphonate ligands and one chloride anion. The Zn II ions are extended by phosphonate ligands to generate a ladder chain along the [001] direction. Adjacent ladders are held together via N—H...O hydrogen bonds and offset face-to-face π–π stacking interactions, forming a three-dimensional supramolecular network with channels. As calculated, the interaction energy between the neighbouring ladders is −115.2 kJ mol −1 . In turn, the cohesive energy evaluated per asymmetric unit-equivalent fragment of a polymeric chain in the crystal structure is −205.4 kJ mol −1 . This latter value reflects the numerous hydrogen bonds stabilizing the three-dimensional packing of the coordination chains.",

With nitrogen-based nucleophiles, different ferrocenyl allylamine isomers have been synthesized successfully in good yield. Optimization of the basicity of the reaction medium has allowed selection of the best operating conditions to obtain the targeted isomer. In a similar way and in order to introduce phosphorus-containing functional groups, the reaction of ammonium salt (1 + )·I − with a phosphorus nucleophile, namely triphenylphosphane, was attempted.

    "abstract": "Functionalized acid amides are widely used in biology, medicine, environmental chemistry and many other areas. Among them, pyridine-substituted amides, in particular N -(pyridin-2-yl)acetamide and its derivatives, play an important role due to their excellent chelating properties. The donor properties of these ligands can be effectively modified by introducing electron-donating substituents ( e.g. alkyl groups) into the heterocycle. On the other hand, substituents in the α-position of the pyridine ring can create steric hindrance, which significantly influences the coordination number and geometry. To achieve a better understanding of these effects, copper(II) complexes with sterically demanding N -(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)acetamide ligands ( L ) and monoanions of different size, shape and coordination ability have been chosen as model compounds. The crystal structures of three new compounds, bromidobis[ N -(6-methylpyridin-2-yl-κ N )acetamide-κ O ]copper(II) bromide, [CuBr(C 8 H 10 N 2 O)]Br, (I), aquabis[ N -(6-methylpyridin-2-yl-κ N )acetamide-κ O ]copper(II) dinitrate, [Cu(C 8 H 10 N 2 O)(H 2 O)](NO 3 ) 2 , (II), and aquabis[ N -(6-methylpyridin-2-yl-κ N )acetamide-κ O ]copper(II) bis(perchlorate), [Cu(C 8 H 10 N 2 O)(H 2 O)](ClO 4 ) 2 , (III), have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. It has been shown that the presence of the 6-methyl group results in either a distorted square-pyramidal or a distorted trigonal–bipyramidal coordination geometry around the Cu II centres instead of the typical octahedral geometry observed when the methyl substituent is absent or occupies any other position on the pyridine ring. Moreover, due to the steric hindrance provided by the L ligands, only the bromide ligand, the smallest of the series, enters into the first coordination sphere of the Cu II ion in (I). In (II) and (III), the vacant coordination site of the Cu II ion is occupied by a water molecule, while the nitrate and perchlorate anions are not involved in coordination to the metal centre. The structures of (I)–(III) are characterized by the presence of one-dimensional infinite chains formed by hydrogen bonds of the types N—H...Br [in (I)], N—H...O and O—H...O [in (II) and (III)] between the amide groups of the L ligands, the coordinated water molecules and the uncoordinated anions. The hydrogen-bonded chains are further interconnected through π–π stacking interactions between the pyridine rings of the L ligands, with approximate interplanar separations of 3.5–3.6 Å.",

Compound (II) and ethanol could not be initially identified by single-crystal X-ray analysis due to complex disorder in the aliphatic chain region of (II). Mass spectrometry ensured that (II) represented only one species disordered over several positions in the solid state, rather than several species cohabitating on the same crystallographic site. The atomic identification and connectivity in (II) were established by several 2D (two-dimensional) NMR techniques, which in turn relied on a knowledge of its exact mass. The derived connectivity was then used in the single-crystal analysis to model the disorder of the aliphatic chain in (II) over three positions and allowed identification of a partially occupied ethanol solvent molecule that was disordered over an inversion center. The disordered moieties were refined with restraints and constraints.",

    "abstract": "This book is a monumental review of the area of chemistry embracing the fascinating world of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIM).This field emerged about fifty years ago and the recognition of its achievements culminated by the attribution of the Nobel prize for chemistry to Jean-Pierre Sauvage, J. Fraser Stoddart (one of the authors of this book) and Bernard L. Feringa in 2016.Starting in the mid-1980s, this field developed rapidly thanks to the efforts of numerous researchers.This book is a tribute to the work of all these chemists.The first chapter of The Nature of the Mechanical Bond: From Molecules to Machines clearly defines the concepts.It introduces the mechanical bond (interlocked molecules which cannot be separated without breaking a chemical bond) and presents the two main types of mechanically interlocked molecules, namely catenane (interlocked rings) and rotaxane (a ring around a rod with two big stoppers at its ends).The chapter presents an historical perspective of the mechanical bond and makes fascinating connections with patterns analogous to chemical bonds in nature, ancient and modern civilizations, and art.This opening chapter can be read with pleasure and interest not only by chemists but also by any curious person.Chapter 2 reviews the different synthesis strategies used to build molecular structures containing mechanical bonds under kinetic control with a specific emphasis on templatedirected synthesis (noncovalent bonding interactions serve as templates instead of covalent bonds) and active template synthesis (a species -usually a transition metal centre -acts as a template and a catalyst).These template strategies have proven to be very efficient for obtaining catenanes and rotaxanes.Chapter 3 presents the strategies used to make mechanical bonds under thermodynamical control, which rely on reversible bond breaking-bond forming steps.Techniques such as slippage, self-assembling of metallo-organic MIMs, condensation, olefin methathesis and reversible nucleophilic reactions are described and illustrated by many examples.Chapter 4 is devoted to the analysis of catenane topologies and rotaxane architectures.Topological isomerism concerns molecular ensembles containing the same atoms and chemical bonds which cannot be interconverted by any deformations that do not involve the breaking and forming of chemical bonds.In topology, rotaxanes differ from catenanes in the sense that they are topologically trivial (components can be separated without any bond breaking).This chapter describes numerous catenane and rotaxane structures with potentially interesting chemical and physicochemical properties.Chapter 5 explains and illustrates the concepts of stereochemistry in mechanomolecules.Mechanostereoisomers are isomers which have the same interlocked component parts, but their positions in space differ.The ability of mechanostereoisomers to interconvert through a dynamical process distinguishes the dynamical mechanostereoisomers from the static ones which generally cannot be interconverted without the breaking and making of bonds.The last chapter of the book describes the molecular switches (systems changing their conformation in response to a stimulus) and molecular machines (systems performing mechanical work) which can be designed from mechanostereoisomers interconverting through a dynamical process driven by a chemical reaction (acid-base, redox or covalent), light, solvation effect, molecular recognition, heat, pressure, and so on.",

This gives rise to quite different packing schemes, even if built up by similar chains having the hydroxy–ethanone O—H...O hydrogen-bond synthon in common. Both phases were found to be related by a first-order thermally driven phase transformation at 338–340 K, which is discussed in detail. The relative stabilities of both polymorphs are explained on the basis of both the noncovalent interactions operating in each structure and quantum chemical calculations. The polymorphic phase transition has also been studied experimentally by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments, conducted on individual single crystals, Raman spectroscopy and controlled heating under a microscope of individual single crystals, which were further characterized by powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",

In the solid state, these structures are different from the proposed imidine form: succinimidine crystallizes as an imino–amine, 2-imino-3,4-dihydro-2 H -pyrrol-5-amine, C 4 H 7 N 2 ( 1 ), glutarimidine as 6-imino-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-2-amine methanol monosolvate, C 5 H 9 N 3 ·CH 3 OH ( 2 ), and the corresponding hydrolyzed imino–imide compounds as amino–amides 5-amino-3,4-dihydro-2 H -pyrrol-2-one, C 4 H 6 N 2 O ( 3 ), and 6-amino-4,5-dihydropyridin-2(3 H )-one, C 5 H 8 N 2 O ( 4 ). Imidine 1 was also determined as the hydrochloride salt solvate 5-amino-3,4-dihydro-2 H -pyrrol-2-iminium chloride–2-imino-3,4-dihydro-2 H -pyrrol-5-amine–water (1/1/1), C 4 H 8 N 3 + ·Cl − ·C 4 H 7 N 3 ·H 2 O ( 1 ·HCl). As such, 1 and 2 show alternating short and long C—N bonds across the molecule, revealing distinct imino (C=NH) and amine (C—NH 2 ) groups throughout the C—N backbone. These structures provide definitive evidence for the predominant imino–amine tautomer in the solid state, which serves to enrich the previously proposed imidine-focused structures that have appeared in organic chemistry textbooks since the discovery of this class of compounds in 1883.",

The statistical mixtures Ni/Zn consisting of more Ni atoms are located in the 6 c and 9 d (symmetry .2/ m ) sites. In the following 18 f (site symmetry .2) and 18 h (site symmetry .m ) sites are located Zn/Ni statistical mixtures which consist of more Zn atoms. Zn/Ni atoms form three-dimensional networks with hexagonal channels that fill statistical mixtures of Tb/Nd and Ni/Zn. The Tb 2– x Nd x Zn 17– y Ni y compound belongs to the family of intermetallic phases capable of absorbing hydrogen. In the structure, there are three types of voids, namely, 9 e (site symmetry .2/ m ), 3 b (site symmetry \\overline{3} m ) and 36 i (site symmetry 1), in which hydrogen can be inserted, and the maximum total absorption capacity can reach 1.21 wt% H 2 .

To compute the G value of a given compound, the bond valence sums (BVSs) must first be calculated using a crystal structure. Two examples of compounds with high G values, based on data from the literature, are the wurtz–stannite-type dicopper cadmium silicon tetrasulfide (Cu 2 CdSiS 4 ) and the stannite-type dicopper mercury tin tetrasulfide (Cu 2 HgSnS 4 ), which were first reported in 1967 and 1965, respectively. In the present study, Cu 2 CdSiS 4 and Cu 2 HgSnS 4 were prepared by solid-state synthesis at 1000 and 900 °C, respectively. The phase purity was assessed by powder X-ray diffraction. Optical diffuse reflectance UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopy was used to estimate the optical bandgaps of 2.52 and 0.83 eV for Cu 2 CdSiS 4 and Cu 2 HgSnS 4 , respectively. The structures were solved and refined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. The structure type of Cu 2 CdSiS 4 was confirmed, where Cd 2+ , Si 4+ and two of the three crystallographically unique S 2− ions lie on a mirror plane. The structure type of Cu 2 HgSnS 4 was also verified, where all ions lie on special positions. The S 2− ion resides on a mirror plane, the Cu + ion is situated on a fourfold rotary inversion axis and both the Hg 2+ and the Sn 4+ ions are located on the intersection of a fourfold rotary inversion axis, a mirror plane and a twofold rotation axis. Using the crystal structures solved and refined here, the G values were reassessed and found to be in the range that indicates reasonable strain for a stable crystal structure. This work, together with some examples gathered from the literature, shows that accurate data collected on modern instrumentation should be used to reliably calculate BVSs and G values.",

Subsequent chemical considerations, coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, prompted us to revise the original structure determination. Using the original raw diffraction data, we have now performed new refinements to show that the previously proposed `bridging carbonyls' actually correspond to bridging methoxide groups, and that the crystals analyzed at the time therefore would correspond to the complex di-μ-methoxido-bis[tricarbonyl(pyridine)technetium], syn -[Tc 2 (μ-OMe) 2 (NC 5 H 5 ) 2 (CO) 6 ].

    "abstract": "Mechanochemical synthesis via grinding of trimesic acid (TA, C9H6O6) and 4-chlorophenyl diphenyl phosphate (4CDP, C18H14ClO4P) (liquid at room temperature) in a 1:1 ratio resulted in the formation of an inclusion type of cocrystal. The crystallization of this phase via slow evaporation at low temperature (276-277 K) from methanol resulted in a rare `stairstep morphology' during the process of crystal growth. This morphology was not observed after crystallization of the compound from other solvents like toluene, dichloromethane, acetone, hexane and isooctane, and hence this was characteristically observed in methanol only. The characterization from single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed the formation of a cocrystal with five molecules of TA and two molecules of 4CDP in the asymmetric unit. The trimesic acid molecules form hydrogen-bonded dimers resulting in hexagonal rings, and these rings are stacked through π-π intermolecular interactions to make a hexagonal honeycomb-like structure. The phosphate molecules, 4CDP, were found to be trapped as guests in these hexagonal channels. The similarity in the packing of trimesic acid is compared in the cocrystal and the free acid quantitatively via Xpac analysis, which establishes the relationship of a `2D supramolecular construct' between them. This signifies a unique type of arrangement in which the voids created by the trimesic acid moiety do not undergo distortion by the inclusion of the guest molecules. The quantitative analysis of the intermolecular interactions using Hirshfeld surfaces and fingerprint plots deciphers the role of both strong O-H...O hydrogen bonds and weak intermolecular interactions in the crystal packing.",

TPA-AD-DCN and CzPh-AD-DCN crystallized in the centrosymmetric space groups P -1 and P 2 1 / c , respectively. Both molecules adopt a `butterfly-like' configuration of the common part of the structure and differences occur within the substituents on the acridine N atom. A Hirshfeld surface analysis showed that the H...H and C...H/H...C contacts constitute a high percentage of the intermolecular interactions. The optical and electrochemical properties, as well as theoretical calculations, of TPA-AD-DCN and CzPh-AD-DCN support the structural characterization of these materials. As crystallization-induced emission materials, TPA-AD-DCN and CzPh-AD-DCN are anticipated to be of potential use in the construction of promising optoelectronic materials.",

Both polymorphs have an inversion centre at the centre of the hydroquinone ring (Z' = 1/2), and there are no significant differences between their bond lengths and angles. The most significant structural difference in the molecular conformations was found in the rotation of the phenyl rings of the two crystallographically independent benzyl groups. The crystal structures of the polymorphs were distinguishable with respect to the arrangement of the hydroquinone rings and the packing motif of the phenyl rings that form part of the benzyl groups. The phenyl groups of one polymorph are arranged in a face-to-edge motif between adjacent molecules, with intermolecular C-H...π interactions, whereas the phenyl rings in the other polymorph form a lamellar stacking pattern with no significant intermolecular interactions. We suggest that this partial conformational difference in the molecular structures leads to the significant structural differences observed in their molecular arrangements.",

Its structure has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, showing it to be a new polymorph, referred to as polymorph II, in the monoclinic space group P21/n. It is compared with the previously reported triclinic modification [Ehrenberg (1968). Acta Cryst. B24, 1123-1125], which is referred to as polymorph I. The asymmetric unit of polymorph II contains two half molecules located on crystallographic centres, while the asymmetric unit of polymorph I includes one half molecule, also located on a crystallographic centre. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the RB3LYP level using the 6-31G(d,p) basis set was applied. The predicted electronic absorption spectrum is in good agreement with the experimental one. The analysis of the calculated electronic absorption spectrum of polymorph II was carried out in order to assign the observed electronic transitions and to determine their character. A natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis was executed at the same level to evaluate charge-transfer, intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of the compound were appraised by the ZINDO/sum-over-states method in both static and dynamic states. The orientationally averaged (isotropic) value of γ for the compound is greater than the corresponding value of 4-nitroaniline (pNA).",

    "abstract": "The common things that pop into our minds when we hear 'Raman' are 'Raman spectroscopy', 'atomic dynamics', 'local structure', etc. Very seldom do we think about the person, the brilliant Indian scientist Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, who discovered and reported for the first time the phenomenon of inelastic light scattering by atomic vibrations, subsequently named after him.This book would be of interest for everyone who would like to learn about the discovery of the Raman effect.However, to a certain extent, this is an unusual biography.Scientists or students who know only a little about C.V. Raman might be slightly disappointed, because the book is more about C.V. Raman as a politician than as a person and scientist; it is more about the political atmosphere at the University of Calcutta at that time than about the research activities in the group of C.V. Raman that led to the observation of a new type of secondary radiation which is nowadays routinely applied in modern materials science.On the other hand, readers who are more or less familiar with the biography of C.V. Raman will appreciate this atypical approach in telling the story of this epochal breakthrough in physics, which was the missing experimental proof everyone was looking for, to boost the modern conception of the nature of light.Actually, this was the goal of the author, Dr Rajinder Singh, namely to present facts 'from the kitchen', which are not so popular among the canonical admirers of C.V. Raman.For example, it is curious to see that in a biography of Raman, it is emphasized that there were several quite incorrect statements in the original paper [C.V. Raman & K. S. Krishnan (1928)",

    "abstract": "As a class of multifunctional materials, crystalline supramolecular complexes have attracted much attention because of their unique architectures, intriguing topologies and potential applications. In this article, a new supramolecular compound, namely catena -poly[4,4′-(buta-1,3-diene-1,4-diyl)dipyridin-1-ium [(μ 4 -benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylato-κ 6 O 1 , O 1′ : O 2 : O 4 , O 4′ : O 5 )cadmium(II)]], {(C 14 H 14 N 2 )[Cd(C 10 H 2 O 8 )]} n or {(1,4-H 2 bpbd)[Cd(1,2,4,5-btc)]} n , has been prepared by the self-assembly of Cd(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O, benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid (1,2,4,5-H 4 btc) and 1,4-bis(pyridin-4-yl)buta-1,3-diene (1,4-bpbd) under hydrothermal conditions. The title compound has been structurally characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Each Cd II centre is coordinated by six O atoms from four different (1,2,4,5-btc) 4− tetraanions. Each Cd II cation, located on a site of twofold symmetry, binds to four carboxylate groups belonging to four separate (1,2,4,5-btc) 4− ligands. Each (1,2,4,5-btc) 4− anion, situated on a position of \\overline{1} symmetry, binds to four crystallographically equivalent Cd II centres. Neighbouring Cd II cations interconnect bridging (1,2,4,5-btc) 4− anions to form a three-dimensional {[Cd(1,2,4,5-btc)] 2− } n anionic coordination network with infinite tubular channels. The channels are visible in both the [1\\overline{1}0] and the [001] direction. Such a coordination network can be simplified as a (4,4)-connected framework with the point symbol (4 2 8 4 )(4 2 8 4 ). To balance the negative charge of the metal–carboxylate coordination network, the cavities of the network are occupied by protonated (1,4-H 2 bpbd) 2+ cations that are located on sites of twofold symmetry. In the crystal, there are strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between the anionic coordination network and the (1,4-H 2 bpbd) 2+ cations. Considering the hydrogen-bonding interactions, the structure can be further regarded as a three-dimensional (4,6)-connected supramolecular architecture with the point symbol (4 2 6 4 )(4 2 6 8 7·8 4 ). The thermal stability and photoluminescence properties of the title compound have been investigated.",

The main structural difference between the polymorphs concerns the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding motifs adopted, namely a one-dimensional zigzag polymer linked by N-H...N(py) (py is pyridine) interactions in polymorph I and a centrosymmetric dimeric motif formed by N-H...O=C interactions in polymorph II. The diacetylene cores of the molecules stack along the a and b axes in polymorphs I and II, respectively. It was found that only the molecular arrangement in polymorph II satisfies Baughman's criterion to afford polydiacetylenes (PDAs) by thermal annealing or irradiation with light.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis and polarizing-microscopy experiments, as well as a fourth set of single-crystal data collected at 283 K, proved that the order-disorder transformation occurs continuously. The analyses of these crystal structures and full-range relaxed potential energy surface scans showed that this kind of global disorder is not very difficult to achieve inside the crystal. Experimental and theoretical studies via UV-Vis and fluorescence spectra impart an understanding on the prediction methods of optical properties, which are essential for the rational design of biphenyl-based materials with pre-defined properties.",

    "abstract": "Computational chemistry, as well as the closely related area of molecular simulation techniques, nowadays represents a fundamental tool for the whole of chemical science.Most notably, the field has achieved the capacity to provide answers to complex chemical, or even biological, problems, to be predictive and to complement many experiments.Yet, in many instances, this important role has not fully emerged in undergraduate courses and programmes; as a consequence, textbooks for undergraduate students dealing with molecular modelling and simulations are rare.It is starting from this consideration that 'Computational Chemistry' by J. Harvey aims at providing a clear and concise, yet as complete as possible, book specifically designed for undergraduate students and covering all the aspects of computational chemistry applications.More specifically, its philosophy is clearly problem-oriented and aims at providing a guide to the practical use of computational chemistry for tackling a given problem, in particular, providing a basic knowledge of the limitations and potentiality of the different methods and the answers they can provide.More significantly, one of the strengths of the book is the constant use of 'real-life examples' in the form of real calculations performed by the author, which students are encouraged to repeat, to illustrate the different methods and the different problems.Considering its scope, the main focus of the book is obviously in the application of the different techniques, rather than in an in-depth analysis of the mathematical formalisms.However, this nontrivial task is, in most cases, performed without the loss of rigour and the interested reader will find useful guidance for further development and investigation in the 'Further reading' sections concluding each chapter.Indeed, the eight chapters of the book cover all aspects of modern molecular modelling and simulation.After a brief introduction (Chapter 1), which is also helpful in making the bridge between computational chemistry and computer science, the author deals with the basics of quantum methods in the determination of the electronic structure of molecular systems, in particular focusing on the Hartree-Fock theory (Chapter 2, Quantum Chemistry).The chapter is remarkable and even some nontrivial concepts, such as the spin contamination for unrestricted methods, are expressed in clear and accessible terms without the loss of rigour, while the crucial role of molecular orbitals in interpreting different chemical properties is underlined.The next chapter (Quantum Chemical Methods) deals with electron correlation in its various forms, from coupled clusters to multi-reference methods, also introducing density functional theory (DFT) calculation.Probably, considering the widespread use of the latter, a more dedicated chapter and a deeper analysis on the performance and limitations of the different classes of functionals would have been welcome.After having established quantum chemical methods, Chapter 4 deals with the problem of molecular mechanics and, in particular, force field definition.Once again, the chapter provides a very nice formalization of a complex, and in some cases overlooked, problem that is, however, crucial for achieving good accuracy.Chapters 5 and 6 deal with the definition and exploration of the potential energy surface, either with optimization techniques (Chapter 5) or via molecular dynamics simulation (Chapter 6).The roles of stationary points, minima and transition states are clearly evidenced, together with the proper ways to characterize them.In a remarkable effort at completeness, Chapter 7 makes the link between computational chemistry and statistical thermodynamics, in particular, providing examples on",

As a result, a nearly planar six-membered ring structure consisting of two rhodium(I) cations and two bridging phosphorous acid diester anions was formed, namely bis[μ-(4,8-di-tert-butyl-2,10-dimethoxydibenzo[d,f][1,3,2]dioxaphosphepin-6-yl)oxy]-1:2κ2P:O;1:2κ2O:P-bis{[6-([1,1'-biphenyl]-2-yloxy)-4,8-di-tert-butyl-2,10-dimethoxydibenzo[d,f][1,3,2]dioxaphosphepine-κP]carbonylrhodium(I)} toluene tetrasolvate, [Rh2(C22H28O5P)2(C34H37O5P)2(CO)2]·4C7H8.

    "abstract": "The body of the text of this book is 120 pages and covers all aspects of electrochemistry, from the most basic aspects (electrode, redox and potential) to Tafel curves, dynamic electrochemistry (voltammetry), corrosion, batteries, fuel cells, impedance spectroscopy etc.As an introduction, the author starts with the basic concept of the electric circuit, and in some examples equivalent circuits are given.At the end of each chapter there are a few exercises, easy to solve for the careful reader, encouraging others to delve back into the chapter to find the solution.To be able to address all these points in such a short book, the author has made considerable effort to summarize the text.The basic fundamental science viewpoint is the right one, especially as the book is part of the series 'Oxford Chemistry Primers' directed at undergraduate students.Only physicochemical phenomena are described and discussed.No room is left for technical aspects and analytical chemistry applications, and only a few real results are given for illustration purposes.Despite the large number of available books dealing with electrochemistry, having a short book will allow nonspecialist scientists to have a complete view of the field.Moreover, even for those already having a knowledge of electrochemistry, re-examining the order in which the aspects of the subject are usually taught may be interesting; for instance, batteries and electrical impedance are not that often in the same chapter, and starting from the electric circuit is also rather unusual.The concept is thus a good one and the book could be of great help for many students or scientists wishing to have an overview of the field, who can then go deeper into a particular subject by reading one of the more specialized books available.It is therefore all the more regrettable that many faults, errors and typographical errors spoil the impact and interest of this book, especially taking into account that it is directed at undergraduate students.A small sample of the faults that may be found is given below, but it is not an exhaustive list.Heterogeneous notation (none of them following the IUPAC recommendation) may be found:* the sign used for a reaction or a half reaction is variously a double arrow, a simple arrow or two opposite arrows;* depending on the chapter, ÁG, ÁG 0 and Á r G 0 may be found for the same concept; * the same item is called E 0 , E 1/2 and E 0 1/2 , this point is not only formal: it mixes experimental data in dynamic electrochemistry (E 1/2 ) and thermodynamic data (E 0 ); * there is some mixing between E cell and the E of the electrode in Chapter 3; this is again not only a formal problem.Many editing problems resulting from mistyping: * some errors in the mass balance in chemical equations; * non-existent species [I 4 , O À 2 (g) . . .]; * sentences strictly without meaning ['The Latimer (left) and Frost (right) diagrams for copper also show thio' on p. 26 in which there is no diagram on the right . . .];* sometimes figures are numbered, equations are never numbered and sometimes they are on several lines with paragraph numbering randomly appearing alongside the equations (p.27).",

Compound 1 displays a 2D net-like structure. The 2D layers are further linked through hydrogen bonds between methanesulfonate anions and amino groups on the framework and guest H 2 O molecules in the lattice to form a three-dimensional (3D) structure. Compound 2 and 3 exhibit 1D chain structures, in which the complicated hydrogen-bonding interactions play an important role in the formation of the 3D network. These experimental results indicate that the coordination orientation of the heteroatoms on the ligands has a great influence on the polymeric structures. Moreover, the selection of different counter-anions, together with the inclusion of different guest solvent molecules, would also have a great effect on the hydrogen-bonding systems in the crystal structures.",

The trimeric nature of supramolecular coordination complex 2 in solution was ascertained by cold spray ionization mass spectrometry (CSI–MS) and confirmed in the solid state by X-ray structure analysis. The asymmetric unit of 2 comprises the trimetallic Pd complex, six PF 6 − counter-ions and seven acetonitrile solvent molecules. Moreover, there is one cavity within the unit cell which could contain diethyl ether solvent molecules, as suggested by the crystallization process. The packing is stabilized by weak inter- and intramolecular C—H...N and C—H...F interactions. Interestingly, the crystal structure displays two distinct conformations for the L H ligand ( i.e. syn and anti ), with an all- syn -[Pd] coordination mode.

    "abstract": "A new stibium phosphate, lithium barium bis(antimony oxide) tris(phosphate), LiBa(SbO) 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , was prepared by the molten salt method with LiF as the flux. The crystal structure consists of an original three-dimensional anionic framework of [(SbO) 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ] ∞ built from PO 4 tetrahedra sharing their corners with SbO 6 octahedra. This framework delimits one-dimensional tunnels where the lithium(I) and barium(II) ions are located. The UV–Vis spectrum shows that LiBa(SbO) 2 (PO 4 ) 3 was transparent from 350 to 800 nm, and is thus suitable as a luminescent host matrix. We then used Tb 3+ and Eu 3+ activators to test its luminous performance and the purities of the prepared phosphors were studied by powder X-ray diffraction analysis with Rietveld refinements. Photoluminescence (PL) studies reveal that the emission spectra of 1 mol% RE 3+ -doped (RE = Tb and Eu) samples can be excited by 371 and 394 nm light, emitting green and orange–red light, respectively, for Tb 3+ and Eu 3+ . The CIE coordinates were measured to be (0.295, 0.571) and (0.6027, 0.3967), and the luminescent lifetimes were calculated as 0.178 and 1.159 ms, respectively.",

The compounds crystallized in similar monoclinic crystal systems, but are differentiated in their unit cells by a doubling of the number of independent molecules for R = Cy ( Z ′ = 2) and the choice of glide plane by convention. The preferred orientation for the o -tolyl substituent obtained from the X-ray structural analysis is gauche for R = Ph and anti for R = Cy (using the Se—P—C ipso —C ortho torsion angles as reference). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed both conformations to be equally probable and indicate that the preferred solid-state conformer is probably due to the minimization of repulsion energies, resulting in a packing arrangement primarily featuring weak C—H...Se interactions and additional C—H...π interactions in the R = Ph structure. A detailed electronic and steric analysis was conducted on both phosphanes using Se—P bond lengths, multinuclear NMR 1 J Se–P coupling constants, theoretical topological evaluation and crystallographic and solid-angle calculations, and compared to selected literature examples. The results indicate that the use of the o -tolyl substituent increases both the electron-donating capability and the steric size, but is also dependent on whether the o -tolyl group adopts a gauche or anti conformation. The single-crystal geometrical data are unable to detect electronic differences between these two structures due to the somewhat large displacement parameters observed for the Se atom in the R = Cy structure.",

The tetraoxazocane ring adopts a boat–chair conformation in the crystalline state, which is due to intramolecular interactions. Conformational analysis of the tetraoxazocane fragment performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,2p) level of theory showed that there are three minima on the potential energy surface, one of which corresponds to the conformation realized in the solid state, but not to a global minimum. Analysis of the geometry and the topological parameters of the electron density at the (3,−1) bond critical points (BCPs), and the charge transfer in the tetraoxazocane ring indicated that there are stereoelectronic effects in the O—C—O and N—C—O fragments. There is a two-cross hyperconjugation in the N—C—O fragment between the lone electron pair of the N atom (lpN) and the antibonding orbital of a C—O bond (σ* C—O ) and vice versa between lpO and σ* C—N . The oxazole substituent has a considerable effect on the geometry and the topological parameters of the electron density at the (3,−1) BCPs of the tetraoxazocane ring. The crystal structure is stabilized via intermolecular C—H...N and C—H...O hydrogen bonds, which is unambiguously confirmed with PIXEL calculations, a quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) topological analysis of the electron density at the (3,−1) BCPs and a Hirshfeld analysis of the electrostatic potential. The molecules form zigzag chains in the crystal due to intermolecular C—H...N interactions being electrostatic in origin. The molecules are further stacked due to C—H...O hydrogen bonds. The dispersion component in the total stabilization energy of the crystal lattice is 68.09%.",

All three compounds crystallize with two crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit ( A and B ) and are distinguished by the conformations of both the molecular Et 2 N—C 6 H 4 —C=C—C(=O)—C=C—C 6 H 4 —NEt 2 backbone (arcuate or linear) and the terminal diethylamino substituents (syn- or antiperiplanar to the plane of the molecule). The central four- and five-membered rings in I and II are almost planar, and the six-membered ring in III adopts a sofa conformation. In the crystals of I – III , the two independent molecules A and B form hydrogen-bonded [ A ... B ] dimers via intermolecular C—H...O hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the [ A ...

    "abstract": "Peter Wothers has added to his popular chemistry books with James Keeler (Keeler & Wothers, 2003, 2013) with this solo effort about the discovery of the elements.This volume appears to fill a hole between the classical account by Weeks (1968), which is now freely available, recent selective accounts, such as Browne (2013) (which looks at Fe, C, Au, Ag, U, Ti and Si) and Scerri (2013) (which looks at Pa, Hf, Re, Tc, Fr, At and Pm), and the short accounts in standard inorganic chemistry textbooks, such as Greenwood & Earnshaw (1997).It was published appropriately in 2019, since it provides a background to the 150th anniversary of the publication Mendeleev's Periodic Table and the UNESCO International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements.The book is 273 pages long and is divided into nine chapters.The 48 illustrations are mainly line drawings and half-tones and the general presentation is up to the high standard expected from Oxford University Press (OUP).The title has little to do with the contents of the book and refers to just antimony, gold and 'Jupiter's Wolf', which was a poetic term for wolfram briefly used by Henckel in 1747, and, in fact, Sb, Au and W occupy very few of the 273 pages.As can be seen in Table 1, most of the elements are discussed in Wothers's work although there are some notable absentees, like carbon and lithium.The main elements in the chapters are indicated in bold in Table 1 and minor references are given in plain text.As you can see, there is very little order in the elements discussed in the chapters and the grouping starts historically with chapters 1 and 2, and then gradually descends into chemical Groups.It appears that the major elements selected are those that Wothers felt could tell a good story.Wothers states that his purpose is to describe where the names of the elements come from and he refers specifically to how they were discovered rather than their etymology per se.In fact, the reader interested in the etymology of the names of the elements is better served by Peter van der Krogt's remarkable website Elementymology & Elements Multidict (https://elements.vanderkrogt.net/index.php),which covers far more ground internationally and linguistically than Wother's book.The first chapter examines the original seven metallic elements and discusses their astronomical relationships.Of course, there is actually little data available about the original discovery of these elements by the ancients.Wothers states (p. 1) 'We can't properly understand why some of the more recent elements were named as they were without first understanding these earlier historical connections'.So some etymology might have been useful here.For example, iron is derived from the Proto-Germanic isarnan meaning strong metal.Some reference to the effect of the introduction of iron weapons might have helped explain why iron was associated with Mars, the god of war.Some comment on the origin of the Latin root ferrum, which is far more important to chemists, might have illuminated my ignorance, and a discussion of why this caught on for chemistry would have been interesting.The etymology is addressed more directly in the following chapters.The second chapter follows the historical thread and discusses the metallic and submetallic elements, such as Sb, As, Bi, Co and Ni, which rather torpedoed the medieval European idea of their being just seven elements and these being connected to the seven bodies of the solar system known at the time.Interestingly, one planet was consistently missed out of these speculations and appears much later in the story (i.e. the Earth; tellurium was named by the German chemist Klaproth in 1801).",

A phase transition to the monoclinic space group P 2 1 ( Z = 2, γ-phase) at 285 K leads to a pseudo-merohedral twin. The high deviation from the hexagonal metric causes split reflections. However, the different orientations could not be separated, but were integrated using a large integration box. Rapid cooling to 110–170 K produces a metastable β-phase ( P 6 3 , Z = 18) in addition to the γ-phase. All crystals of the β-phase are contaminated with the γ-phase. Additionally, the crystals of the β-phase are merohedrally twinned. In contrast to the α-phase, the β- and γ-phases do not show disorder.",

Valence bond angles and torsion angles in these side chains are relatively uniform, but C—N (amide) and C—O (carbonyl) bond lengths depend on the state of hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl O atom and N—H hydrogen. Relative to N -acetyl side chains devoid of hydrogen bonding, those in which the carbonyl O atom serves as a hydrogen-bond acceptor display elongated C—O and shortened C—N bonds. This behavior is reproduced by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicating that the relative contributions of amide resonance forms to experimental C—N and C—O bond lengths depend on the solvation state, leading to expectations that activation barriers to amide cis – trans isomerization will depend on the polarity of the environment. DFT calculations also revealed useful predictive information on the dependencies of inter-residue hydrogen bonding and some bond angles in or proximal to β-(1→4) O -glycosidic linkages on linkage torsion angles ϕ and ψ. Hypersurfaces correlating ϕ and ψ with the linkage C—O—C bond angle and total energy are sufficiently similar to render the former a proxy of the latter.",

In order to assess the effect of fluorine on the conformation of 3'-deoxy-3'-fluoro-5-methyluridine (RTF), C10H13FN2O5, we studied its stereochemistry in the crystalline state using X-ray crystallography. The compound crystallizes in the chiral orthorhombic space group P212121 and contains two symmetry-independent molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit. The furanose ring in molecules A and B adopts conformations between envelope (2E, 2'-endo, P = 162°) and twisted (2T3, 2'-endo and 3'exo, P = 180°), with pseudorotation phase angles (P) of 164.3 and 170.2°, respectively. The maximum puckering amplitudes, νmax, for molecules A and B are 38.8 and 36.1°, respectively. In contrast, for 5-methyluridine (RTOH), the value of P is 21.2°, which is between the 3E (3'-endo, P = 18.0°) and 3T4 (3'-endo and 4'-exo, P = 36°) conformations.

Crystal structure determination and Hirshfeld surface analysis of the racemic product reveal that the molecules are linked by O—H...O=C hydrogen bonds between the hydroxy and carbonyl groups, accounting for 9.5% of the intermolecular contacts, while H...H contacts represent 56.9% of the total. Boltzmann population analysis of computed relative rotamer abundances in the gas phase are based on lower-level geometry optimization and thermochemical corrections coupled with higher-level electronic energy calculations using the B2PLYP double-hybrid functional. As expected, the choice of density functional has a greater effect than the basis set on accuracy for all levels of theory. For any given functional, increasing the basis set size did not always correlate with increasingly accurate structures. The hybrid functional B3LYP without dispersion correction routinely gave the closest approximations to the crystal structure where the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ combination afforded the best structure (r.m.s. deviation = 0.1314 Å). However, the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory represents the best compromise between accuracy (r.m.s. deviation = 0.1388 Å) and cost as it yielded appreciably accurate results in a fraction of the time compared to other method combinations.",

The structures of four such salts are reported, namely, the tetrapropylazanium salt, C12H28N+·C8H12BN4O8-, the tetraethylazanium salt hydrate, C8H20N+·C8H12BN4O8-·6.375H2O, the tetrabutylazanium salt as the ethanol monosolvate hemihydrate, C16H36N+·C8H12BN4O8-·C2H5OH·0.5H2O, and the sparteinium (7-aza-15-azoniatetracyclo[7.7.1.02,7.010,15]heptadecane) salt as the ethanol monosolvate, C15H27N2+·C8H12BN4O8-·C2H5OH. The 2D anion layers have preserved intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the amide groups and a typical metric repeat of around 10 × 15 Å. The constraint of matching the interfacial area organizes the cations into quite different solvated arrangements, i.e. the [NEt4] salt is highly hydrated with around 6.5H2O per cation, the [NPr4] salt apparently has a good metric match to the anion layer and is unsolvated, whilst the [NBu4] salt is intermediate and has EtOH and H2O in its cation layer, which is similar to the arrangement for the chiral [HSpa]+ cation. This family of salts shows highly organized chiral space and offers potential for the resolution of both chiral cations and neutral chiral solvent molecules.",

    "abstract": "A new polymorph of ( E )-4-bromo-2-[(phenylimino)methyl]phenol, C 13 H 10 BrNO, is reported, together with a low-temperature structure determination of the previously published polymorph. Both polymorphs were found to have an intramolecular O—H...N hydrogen bond between the phenol OH group and the imine N atom, forming an S (6) ring. The crystals were observed to have different colours at room temperature, with the previously published polymorph being more orange and the new polymorph more yellow. The planarity of the molecule in the two polymorphs was found to be significantly different, with dihedral angles (Φ) between the two aromatic rings for the previously published `orange' polymorph of Φ = 1.8 (2)° at 120 K, while the new `yellow' polymorph had Φ = 45.6 (1)° at 150 K. It was also observed that both polymorphs displayed some degree of thermochromism and upon cooling the `orange' polymorph became more yellow, while the `yellow' polymorph became paler upon cooling.",

All compounds were fully characterized by 31P, 1H, 13C NMR and IR spectroscopy. The X-ray structures of (acetylacetonato-κ2O,O')(tert-butylphosphanedicarbonitrile-κP)carbonylrhodium(I), [Rh(C5H7O2)(CO)(C8H13N2)] or [Rh(acac)(CO)(tBuP(CH2CN)2}] (2b), (acetylacetonato-κ2O,O')carbonyl[3-(diphenylphosphanyl)propanenitrile-κP]rhodium(I), [Rh(C5H7O2)(C15H14N)(CO)] or [Rh(acac)(CO){Ph2P(CH2CH2CN)}] (2h), and (acetylacetonato-κ2O,O')carbonyl[3-(di-tert-butylphosphanyl)propanenitrile-κP]rhodium(I), [Rh(C5H7O2)(C11H22N)(CO)] or [Rh(acac)(CO){tBu2P(CH2CH2CN)}] (2i), showed a square-planar geometry around the Rh atom with a significant trans influence over the acetylacetonate moiety, evidenced by long Rh-O bond lengths as expected for poor π-acceptor phosphines. The Rh-P distances displayed an inverse linear dependence with the coupling constants JP-Rh and the IR ν(C[triple-bond]O) bands, which accounts for the Rh-P electronic bonding feature (poor π-acceptors) of these complexes. A combined study from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and an evaluation of the intramolecular H...Rh contacts from X-ray diffraction data allowed a comparison of the conformational preferences of these complexes in the solid state versus the isolated compounds in the gas phase. For 2b, 2h and 2i, an energy-framework study evidenced that the crystal structures are mainly governed by dispersive energy. In fact, strong pairwise molecular dispersive interactions are responsible for the columnar arrangement observed in these complexes. A Hirshfeld surface analysis employing three-dimensional molecular surface contours and two-dimensional fingerprint plots indicated that the structures are stabilized by H...H, C...H, H...O, H...N and H...Rh intermolecular interactions.",

A number of crystallization attempts led to the orthorhombic form, with two molecules in the asymmetric part of the unit cell; obtaining a different form required the experiment to be moved to another laboratory. None of the attempts resulted in the monoclinic form described earlier. The three different forms contain molecules of significantly different geometries, which can be related to conformational freedom, postulated as the result of biological studies. In addition, the packing modes in all three forms are basically different. The structural differences at both the molecular and the supramolecular level have also been studied via calculations of energies and a topological analysis of the electron density. The results confirm the role of weak interactions in the determination of crystal architecture and additionally hint at an explanation for the results of crystallization attempts: the new monoclinic form has significantly lower energy than the form reported earlier.",

Hydrohalides 1 and 2 are isomorphous and adopt a classical dipole packing. Consistent with the observation for most β-diketones, the enol form with an intramolecular HB is observed. Additional noteworthy interactions are HBs of the protonated pyrazolium towards the X − anion at donor–acceptor distances of 2.9671 (17) Å for 1 and 3.159 (4) Å for 2 . Cocrystallization of hydrobromide 2 with the XB donor tetrafluorodiiodobenzene (TFDIB) leads to the adduct C 11 H 17 N 2 O 2 + ·Br − ·0.5C 6 F 4 I 2 ·H 2 O or (H 2 acacMePz + ·Br − ) 2 ·(H 2 O) 2 ·TFDIB ( 3 ), in which the XB donor TFDIB is situated on a crystallographic centre of inversion. Classical HBs link organic cations, water molecules and Br − anions into chains along [010]. Almost orthogonal to this interaction, XBs with Br...I = 3.2956 (4) Å connect neighbouring chains along [102] into two-dimensional sheets in the (10-2) plane. Assisted by their negative charge, halide anions represent particularly good nucleophiles towards XB donors.",

Compound I crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/c and the molecular geometry is not planar, being divided into three planar regions.

The ground-state molecular structure of I was optimized by the DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method and the theoretical structure was compared with that obtained by X-ray diffraction. Intermolecular interactions in the crystal network were studied by two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Hirshfeld analyses.

The in vitro antimicrobial activities of I against three Gram-positive bacteria, three Gram-negative bacteria and two fungi were determined. The compound was compared with several control drugs and showed better activity than the amoxicillin standard against Gram-positive bacteria B. subtilis, S. aureus and E. faecalis, and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa.

    "abstract": "An enduring paradigm in solid-state chemistry is that the structures of many ionic solids can be built up by placing cations within the interstitial sites of a stacked arrangement of close-packed anions.Filling half the tetrahedral sites results in structures containing corner-shared tetrahedra as found in diamond: a zincblende (or sphalerite) family based on cubic closest packing and a wurtzite family based on hexagonal closest packing (Parthe ´, 1965).The names, taken from the polymorphs of ZnS, draw attention to the fact that most of these compounds are sulfides or selenides.When several types of metal cations are introduced, the possibilities for how they can be distributed become immense, depending on the occurrence of order or disorder.Determining the correct site distribution is essential for understanding the relation of structure to physical properties.These compounds are typically semiconducting and have attracted enormous attention over the years as attractive candidates for materials applications.Among these 'diamondlike semiconductors,' Cu(In,Ga)S 2 is already well established in thin-film solar cell technology (Ramanujam & Singh, 2017) and Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 is a promising lead-free alternative to halide perovskite solar cells (Wallace et al., 2017).New classes of thermoelectric materials based on similar compounds are being investigated (Miller et al., 2018).In a related application that takes advantage of the ability to control band gaps, nonlinear optical (NLO) materials based on these diamond-like semiconductors can convert coherent light to other desired wavelengths, as in the operation of a laser (Liang et al., 2017).Existing NLO materials made of oxides that function in the UV-visible region are well developed, but NLO materials made of sulfides or selenides would have smaller band gaps, making them suitable for the IR region.An IR NLO laser could then be used for medical treatment or nighttime illumination.As an essential criterion for a compound to exhibit NLO behaviour, its structure should be noncentrosymmetric.As part of their longstanding investigations of diamond-like semiconductors as IR NLO materials, Craig et al. (2022) report the synthesis of the quaternary sulfide Li 4 CdGe 2 S 7 , which is remarkable in several respects.First, it demonstrates the compositional richness that has yet to be fully realized among diamond-like semiconductors.Most quaternary representatives have the composition I 2 -II-IV-VI 4 (as in the popular kesterites Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 mentioned above), whereas those with the composition I 4 -II-IV 2 -VI 7 are rare and further examples surely remain to be discovered.Second, the authors provide convincing evidence for an ordered distribution of Li, Cd and Ge atoms within tetrahedral sites, which is not necessarily an easy task.The resulting structure is a lower symmetry, noncentrosymmetric derivative of the rarer family of diamond-like semiconductors based on hexagonal stacking.Although Pauling's rules for ionic solids are recognized to have limitations (George et al., 2020), they were applied to give a satisfying rationalization of the structural features, including support for the site distribution of cations.Crystallographers sometimes engage in what may appear to be esoteric debates (to outsiders) about whether a structure is centrosymmetric or not (Marsh, 1986).In the end, does it really matter?Within other contexts, such as chiral magnetism and superconductivity, this question is essential (Cheong & Xu, 2022;Smidman et al., 2017); for optical materials, it is no exception.This leads to the third point.When microcrystalline samples of Li 4 CdGe 2 S 7 are exposed to near IR light, a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response is observed, giving a change in colour in the visible region, detectable by the naked eye.This observation clinches the assertion of a noncentrosymmetric structure.For practical use, NLO materials have to satisfy several other stringent conditions, including phase matchability, high wavelength transparency, high laser-induced damage threshold and ease of crystal growth.Li 4 CdGe 2 S 7 shows promising",

While the three-dimensional packing in all three structures is similar, the size of the halogen atom affects the nonbonded close contacts observed between molecules. Thus, the structure of 1,3-diiodo-5-nitrobenzene features a close Type 1 I...I contact, the structure of 1,3-dibromo-5-nitrobenzene features a self-complementary nitro-O...Br close contact, while the structure of 1,3-dichloro-5-nitrobenzene also has a self-complementary nitro-O...Cl interaction, as well as a bifurcated C—H...O(nitro) close contact. Notably, the major energetically attractive intermolecular interaction between adjacent molecules in each of the three structures corresponds to a π-stacked interaction. The self-complementary halogen...O(nitro) and C—H...O(nitro) interactions correspond to significant cohesive attraction between molecules in each structure, while the Type 1 halogen–halogen contact is weakly cohesive.",

In this polymer solvate, the asymmetric unit consists of three dichloromethane solvent molecules, a hexafluorophosphate anion and a polymeric heteroleptic cuprous complex cation, in which the cuprous centre is in a CuP 2 N 2 tetrahedral coordination and is coordinated by two P atoms from the Xantphos ligand and two N atoms from two 3-PyCN ligands (the pyridyl and cyano N atoms). It is through the connection of the μ 2 -bridging 3-PyCN ligand that these cuprous centres are linked into a one-dimensional helical chain structure.

The hydrogen-bonding status of raffinose pentahydrate and tetrahydrate were discussed comprehensively according to Jeffrey's hydrogen-bonding classification. It was shown that the water molecules are hydrogen bonded to the surrounding molecules by moderate O-H...O hydrogen bonds and weak C-H...O hydrogen bonds, and the number of these two types of hydrogen bonds determines the water molecules that are removed by dehydration. The lattice constant c showed a significant decrease on dehydration and further dehydration leads to loss of crystallinity of the raffinose crystals.",

Charges on the individual atoms were determined by valence shell occupancy refinements using MoPro and also by DFT calculations analyzed by several different methods.

Rubescin D, 1 , crystallizes in the space group P 2 1 and its molecular structure consists of three six-membered rings A , C and D having, respectively, envelope, twist-boat and half-chair conformations, and three five-membered rings with half-chair ( B and E ) and planar conformations ( F ). Many synthons found in the crystal packing of 1 are in agreement with expectations derived from molecules displaying the same moieties. However, the secondary alcohol–ketone O—H...O=C synthon, which has a low occurrence (2.9%), contributes much to the layered packing, while the furan–ketone C sp 2 —H...O=C and secondary alcohol–epoxide O—H...OC 2 synthons usually found in these compounds (occurrences of 20.6 and 17.6%, respectively) are missing. The packing of 1 is close to that of ceramicine B ( 3 ), but is completely different from that of TS3 ( 4 ), suggesting that the absence of the epoxide group in 3 would have favoured the furan–secondary alcohol C sp 2 —H...OH synthon and that the missing hydroxy group in 4 , a strong hydrogen-bond donor, would have favoured the involvement of water molecules in the crystal packing. The molecular structure of monadelphin A, 2 , consists of four six-membered fused rings ( A , B , C and D ) and one five-membered ring ( E ); they have twist-boat ( A and C ), chair ( B ), screw-boat ( D ) and planar ( E ) conformations.

However, the secondary alcohol–acetate O—H...OOC and secondary alcohol–ketone O—H...O=C synthons (occurrences of 16.7% each in these compounds) are missing. The furan–acetate C sp 2 —H...OOC synthon not observed in these compounds greatly contributes to the layered packing of 2 .

To better understand the reactivity differences observed for 1 when compared to 4 and 5 , modified percent buried volume (% V bur ) calculations were performed. These calculations revealed that the H atom bound to the carbene C atom is the most sterically hindered in compound 1 when compared to 4 and 5 (% V bur = 84.9, 81.3, and 79.3% for 1 , 4 , and 5 , respectively). Finally, close inspection of the quadrant-specific % V bur values indicated that the approach of a deprotonating base to the H atom bound to the carbene C atom is significantly blocked in 1 (69.9%) when compared to 4 and 5 (50.4 and 56.5%, respectively).",

    "abstract": "The 2021 article 'cis-Bis(l-DOPA-2 N,O)copper(II) monohydrate: synthesis, crystal structure, and approaches to the analysis of pseudosymmetry' by O'Brien et al. (2021) is notable for two reasons.First, it reports only the third crystal structure of a metal complex containing the medicinally important ligand l-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxy-lphenylalanine).Second, the article includes a tutorial on finding approximate symmetry relationships between molecules that are chemically equivalent but crystallographically independent.Identification of approximate symmetry in molecular crystals is not yet a solved problem; rather, it is an area of considerable recent activity.Rekis (2020) proposed a method for finding approximate inversion centers; Brock & Taylor (2020) described software for finding approximate translations; Brock (2020) identified layers that have higher approximate symmetry than does the whole crystal; Baggio (2019, 2020) outlined a general method that can be used to find approximate symmetry of all types and applied it to a large number of Z 0 = 4 structures.l-DOPA is a major drug that has been used for more than 50 years to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease; global sales of its various forms are measured in the billions of USD.It is then very surprising to find that the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD; Groom et al., 2016) contains only two structures (FETTON and FETVEF; Suzuki et al., 1998) in which l-DOPA is coordinated to a metal, and two more (XOYXUH and XOYXUH01; Shemchuk et al., 2019) in which it is part of an ionic cocrystal (with LiCl).There are numerous structures in the CSD of metal complexes containing the naturally occurring amino acids tyrosine (Tyr; 4-hydroxy-l-phenylalanine) and phenylalanine (Phe) that are the biological precursors of l-DOPA.In almost all of those structures the amino acid coordinates through both its amino and carboxylate groups.The CSD version of May 2021 includes 61 different R 0.075 structures of metal complexes of Tyr and 83 of Phe; there are, however, only two structures of any precision of l-DOPA complexes.Given its medical significance and market value it seems certain that many attempts have been made to grow diffraction-quality crystals of metal complexes of l-DOPA, but if so, then most of those attempts failed.It would seem that the addition of the second hydroxy substituent on the phenyl ring must be determining, but why? O'Brien et al. note that they had difficulty finding a crystal that diffracted well.Shemchuk et al. (2019) mention the low quality of the data for XOYXUH; their structure of the polymorph XOYXUH01 was determined from powder data.The R factors for FETTON and FETVEF (0.073 and 0.079, respectively; Suzuki et al., 1998) are surprisingly high.The small number of l-DOPA structures with metals and the problems with data quality suggest that some feature of l-DOPA interferes with crystal packing.Looking at the hydrogen-bonding tendencies of vicinal hydroxy groups located on phenyl rings might be a way to approach the problem.The reported structure is particularly unusual in having two amino acid ligands.Of the 61 Tyr complexes in the CSD, only 18 have two Tyr ligands; of the 83 Phe complexes, only 9 have two Phe ligands.In many of those structures, especially those containing Cu 2+ , the free O atom of a carboxylate group from a neighboring molecule completes the fivefold coordination sphere consistent with a d 9 ion capable of exhibiting a Jahn-Teller distortion.Sometimes, two such O atoms complete a sixfold coordination sphere.In the structure reported by O'Brien et al., it is the 3-hydroxy O atom on the phenyl ring that fills this role, although one of the independent Cu-O distances is considerably shorter than the other (2.74 versus 2.97 A ˚).In none of the 18 M n+ (Tyr) 2 L complexes is the phenyl-ring OH group coordinated in that way.",

Cremer–Pople puckering parameters indicate that the β-D-Gal p (β-D-galactopyranosyl) and β-D-Glc p (β-D-glucopyranosyl) rings in (I) adopt slightly distorted 4 C 1 chair conformations, with the former distorted towards a boat form ( B C1,C4 ) and the latter towards a twist-boat form ( O5 S C2 ). Puckering parameters for (I) and (II) indicate that the conformation of the βGal p ring is slightly more affected than the βGlc p ring by the solvomorphism. Conformations of the terminal O -glycosidic linkages in (I) and (II) are virtually identical, whereas those of the internal O -glycosidic linkage show torsion-angle changes of 6° in both C—O bonds. The exocyclic hydroxymethyl group in the βGal p residue adopts a gt conformation (C4′ anti to O6′) in both (I) and (II), whereas that in the βGlc p residue adopts a gg ( gauche – gauche ) conformation (H5 anti to O6) in (II) and a gt ( gauche – trans ) conformation (C4 anti to O6) in (I). The latter conformational change is critical to the solvomorphism in that it allows water to participate in three hydrogen bonds in (I) as opposed to only two hydrogen bonds in (II), potentially producing a more energetically stable structure for (I) than for (II). Visual inspection of the crystalline lattice of (II) reveals channels in which methanol solvent resides and through which solvent might exchange during solvomorphism. These channels are less apparent in the crystalline lattice of (I).",

At the same time, the molecule contains a sterically demanding and hydrophobic trityl group capable of participating in π-electron interactions. Due to its large volume, the trityl group may favour the formation of structural voids in the crystals, which can be filled with guest molecules. In this article, we present the crystal structures of a series of N -triphenylacetyl-L-tyrosine solvates with chloroform, namely, L- TrCOTyr ·CHCl 3 ( I ) and L- TrCOTyr ·1.5CHCl 3 ( III ), and dichloromethane, namely, L- TrCOTyr ·CH 2 Cl 2 ( II ) and L- TrCOTyr ·0.1CH 2 Cl 2 ( IV ). To complement the topic, we also decided to use the racemic amide N -triphenylacetyl-DL-tyrosine ( rac - TrCOTyr ) and recrystallized it from a mixture of chloroform and dichloromethane. As a result, rac - TrCOTyr ·1.5CHCl 3 ( V ) was obtained. In the crystal structures, the amide molecules interact with each other via O—H...O hydrogen bonds. Noticeably, the amide N—H group does not participate in the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Channels are formed between the TrCOTyr molecules and these are filled with solvent molecules. Additionally, in the crystals of III and V , there are structural voids that are occupied by chloroform molecules. Structure analysis has shown that solvates I and II are isostructural. Upon loss of solvent, the solvates transform into the solvent-free form of TrCOTyr , as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction.",

    "abstract": "The aroxyalkylaminoalcohol derivatives are a group of compounds known for their pharmacological action. The crystal structures of four new xylenoxyaminoalcohol derivatives having anticonvulsant activity are reported, namely, 2-{[2-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)ethyl]amino}-1-phenylethan-1-ol, C18H23NO2, 1, the salt N-[2-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)ethyl]-1-hydroxy-1-phenylethan-2-aminium 3-hydroxybenzoate, C18H24NO2+·C7H5O3-, 2, and two polymorphs of the salt (R)-N-[2-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)ethyl]-1-hydroxy-1-phenylethan-2-aminium chloride, C18H24NO2+·Cl-, 3 and 3p. Both polymorphs crystallize in the space group P21212 and each has two cations and two anions in the asymmetric unit (Z' = 2). The molecules in the polymorphs show differences in their molecular conformations and intermolecular interactions. The crystal packing of neutral 1 is dominated by intermolecular O-H...N hydrogen bonds, resulting in the formation of one-dimensional chains. In the crystal structures of the salt forms (2, 3 and 3p), each protonated N atom is engaged in a charge-assisted hydrogen bond with the corresponding anion. The protonation of the N atom also influences the conformation of the molecular linker between the two aromatic rings and changes the orientation of the rings. The crystal packing of the salt forms is dominated by intermolecular O-H...O hydrogen bonds, resulting in the creation of chains and rings. Structural studies have been enriched by the calculation of Hirshfeld surfaces and the corresponding fingerprint plots.",

    "abstract": "Hydrothermal reaction of Mn2+ with the ditopic ligand 2,5-bis(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (Hdtba) resulted in the complex poly[aqua[μ3-2,5-bis(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)benzoato-κ3N4:N4':O]chloridomanganese(II)] monohydrate], {[Mn(C11H7N6O2)Cl(H2O)]·H2O}n, (I). Coordination polymer I has been characterized by X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetry and susceptibility measurements. The topology of I corresponds to a three-dimensional (3,6)-conn net linked by {Mn2Cl2(COO)2} building blocks and dtba- anions. Significant antiferromagnetic exchange is observed within the dinuclear {Mn2Cl2(COO)2} subunits. A fit of the susceptibility data resulted in the magnetic parameters g = 1.93 and J = -1.52. Studies of the photoluminescence properties revealed that I represents a promising luminescence sensor for sensitively detecting dichromate ions in aqueous solution. The associated photochemical detection mechanism was studied in detail.",
