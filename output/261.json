    "abstract": "Flash sintering (FS) is an energy efficient sintering technique involving electrical Joule heating, which allows very rapid densification (<60 s) of particulate materials. Since the first publication on flash-sintered zirconia (3YSZ) in 2010, it has been intensively researched and applied to a wide range of materials. Going back more than a century ago, we have found a close similarity between FS of oxides and Nernst glowers developed in 1897. This review provides a comprehensive overview of FS and is based on a literature survey consisting of 88 papers and seven patents. It correlates processing parameters (i.e. electric field magnitude, current density, waveforms (AC, DC) and frequency, furnace temperature, electrode materials/configuration, externally applied pressure and sintering atmosphere) with microstructures and densification mechanisms. Theorised mechanisms driving the rapid densification are substantiated by modelling work, advanced in situ analysis techniques and by established theories applied to electric current assisted/activated sintering techniques. The possibility of applying FS to a wider range of materials and its implementation in industrial scale processes are discussed.",

Current UK technology uses glass wasteforms for the products of reprocessing, although many countries are temporarily storing the ceramic spent fuel for eventual disposal. Some waste streams may be incorporated into ceramics, but difficult or legacy wastes will require the development of other wasteforms comprising composite systems of crystals and glass. The importance of processing–property–structure (especially durability) relations in such systems over size scales from the atomic to the geological and on timescales to hundreds of thousands of years is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "AbstractObservation of the unconventional properties and material behaviour expected in the nanometre grain size range necessitates the fabrication of fully dense bulk nanostructured ceramics. This is achieved by the application of ceramic nanoparticles and suitable densification conditions, both for the green and sintered compacts. Various sintering and densification strategies were adopted, including pressureless sintering, hot pressing, hot isostatic pressing, microwave sintering, sinter forging, and spark plasma sintering. The theoretical aspects and characteristics of these processing techniques, in conjunction with densification mechanisms in the nanocrystalline oxides, were discussed. Spherical nanoparticles with narrow size distribution are crucial to obtain homogeneous density and low pore-to-particle-size ratio in the green compacts, and to preserve the nanograin size at full densification. High applied pressure is beneficial via the densification mechanisms of nanoparticle rearrangement and sliding, plastic deformation, and pore shrinkage. Low temperature mass transport by surface diffusion during the spark plasma sintering of nanoparticles can lead to rapid densification kinetics with negligible grain growth.Keywords: SINTERINGDENSIFICATIONNANOCRYSTALLINECERAMICSNANOPARTICLESSPARK PLASMA SINTERINGOXIDES",

    "abstract": "The need to reduce the energy consumed and the carbon footprint generated by firing ceramics has stimulated research to develop consolidation techniques operating at lower temperatures, ideally not exceeding 300 °C. This has been realised in Ultra Low Energy Sintering (ULES) using high pressure (hundreds of MPa) in the presence of a transient liquid phase, which accelerates plasticity, grain boundary/surface diffusion and mass transport. Several ULES techniques have been developed in the past 50 years, and a common feature of all of them is low temperature consolidation, through mechanisms not yet fully understood, enabling multi-material integration (e.g. organics and inorganics). This research could transform the traditional firing of functional and structural materials. Early stage work on ULES, started in the 1960s, clearly demonstrated cohesion between the compacted particles exceeding what was possible if simply produced by Van der Waals bonding, suggesting the formation of primary inter-particle bonds. Surprisingly, metals Cold Sintered (CS) in dry conditions at room temperature can be even stronger than their counterparts sintered at high temperatures (typically ≈ 2/3 Tm). Hydrothermal Hot Pressing (HHP) was originally conceived in the context of sustainability and environmental preservation, with some examples being the concept of 'synthetic rock' for immobilisation of toxic/radioactive waste and the consolidation of high surface area porous ceramics for filtration. Follow up work on HHP considered the possibility of recreating in the lab bio-mineralisation using hydroxyapatite and bioglass (including hybrids) as proof of concept. Recent work on the Cold Sintering Process has demonstrated the potential to bridge the processing gap of multi-material devices (sensors, batteries, 5G antennas, electronic components and biomaterials), enabling integration of polymers, ceramics and metals without degradation of the individual components both at the bulk and interface level. The absence of heating unlocks grain boundary design to an unprecedented level, offering further degrees of freedom in tuning functional properties.This review provides a wide perspective on room temperature consolidation, and covers the related but fragmented work published (≈ 450 papers) during the past 50 years, encompassing the relevant work developed in different disciplines including chemistry, physics, biology and geoscience. Liquid-assisted or liquid-mediated phenomena involving diffusion, plasticity, rheology, and grain growth are still largely unexplored in material science. The purpose of bringing together this literature is to build a general and multidisciplinary knowledge to guide future research directions. Both the reduction of energy consumption and carbon footprint are driving the growing interest in ULES, which could reinvent the concept of sintering, 'rendering kilns obsolete'. Also, ULES has the potential to produce new classes of materials that cannot be fabricated using conventional routes.",

SAPs are cross-linked polymers that can absorb a disproportionately large amount of liquid and swell substantially to form a soft and insoluble gel. However, their swelling capacity is highly dependent on the alkalinity and ionic content of the solution. These characteristics may be exploited for self-sealing cracks in concrete. In this preliminary study, the mechanism involved is described and tests performed to determine the swelling ratios of SAP in various solutions including synthetic pore solution, groundwater and seawater are reported. Transport testing found that the flowrate through a 340 μm wide model crack is reduced substantially by using less than 1 vol.-% SAP. The reswelling capacity of SAP in cement paste and the effect of SAP on cement paste microstructure were investigated by microscopy.",

In this review, three commonly used powder preparation approaches (i.e. mechanical mixing, solvent evaporation and dissolution-precipitation process) and two powder sintering mechanisms for the SLS are introduced. Porous ceramic parts are prepared directly through the SLS by virtue of their high porosity. And dense, high-performance Al2O3, ZrO2, kaolin and SiC ceramic parts with complex shape are prepared by introducing CIP technology into the SLS, indicating that the hybrid technology could be the promising route for preparing high-performance ceramic parts used in various fields.",

Therefore, B4C ceramics can be used in various industrial applications, such as lightweight ceramic armour, high temperature thermocouples, neutron absorber, reactor control rods in nuclear power engineering, polishing media for hard materials, abrasive media for lapping and grinding, and wear resistant components (blasting nozzles, die tips and grinding wheels). Pressureless sintering is the method with industrialised application value for B4C ceramics, however, it is impossible to sinter pure B4C ceramics to high densities without additives by pressureless sintering. So sintering additives must be used to promote the densification of B4C ceramics. The different sintering additives used to promote the densification of boron carbide will be described in this review, including carbon additives, metallic additives, oxide additives, non-oxide additives, combined additives and rare earth oxide additives. Finally, the recent research trends for sintering methods and sintering additives of B4C ceramics will also be proposed.",

The analysis considers two cold sintering approaches, characterised by the application either of isostatic or uniaxial pressure. Physical phenomena and microstructural features are discussed in view of the applied cold sintering approach. The developed pressure-assisted densification models indicate that the processes governing densification during uniaxial cold sintering are more complex than those of conventional liquid phase sintering.

Unlike traditional carbides (containing one or two metals), HECs with multiple metals could form a very large number of different compositions that could have interesting and promising properties. The high entropy effect stabilises multi-component carbide phases and forms compositions that might otherwise not be stable. After several years of investigation of HECs, several methods of synthesising HECs have been developed. The microstructures and properties of HECs have been studied and compared with traditional carbides. Many interesting discoveries in HECs have been made. This paper reviews the theories, technologies, findings and insights gained from previous studies on HECs. The basic theory of HECs, the prediction of synthesisability of HEC phases from theoretical calculations, and some rules observed from experimental results are summarised. The preparation methods of HECs (powders, coatings, films and ceramics) and their microstructures are reviewed. Their properties, including thermal and electrical, mechanical and tribological, and oxidation, irradiation, and corrosion resistance of HECs are reviewed and discussed. Compared with traditional carbides, there is a great potential to develop new HECs due to their designable and complex compositions, and this review can guide future studies.",

In tissue engineering, a highly porous artificial extracellular matrix or scaffold is required to accommodate cells and guide their growth and tissue regeneration in three dimensions. The choice of scaffolding material is crucial to the success of the technique. Bioactive glasses are an option as scaffold material for bone tissue engineering owing to their recognised osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties and controllable degradation rate. Resorbable 3D macroporous bioactive scaffolds have been produced by foaming sol–gel derived bioactive glasses with the aid of a surfactant. The foams exhibit a hierarchical structure, with interconnected macropores (10–600 μm) and mesopores (2–50 nm). The effects of processing variables on the structure and properties of the obtained bioactive glass foams are discussed in the present paper. The method is then applied to produce bioactive glass–polymer (polyvinyl alcohol) hybrid scaffolds with improved mechanical properties.Keywords: BIOACTIVE GLASS FOAMSSOL-GEL PROCESSINGTISSUE ENGINEERING",

The effect of the reactivity on fly ash geopolymerisation has been investigated with specific reference to edging of fly ash with alkali at 27°C and geopolymerisation schemes involving edging and thermal curing or direct thermal curing at 60°C. The effect of improved reactivity of fly ash on the resulting geopolymers was studied through determination of compressive strength, phase formation by X-ray diffraction and microstructural evaluation by scanning electron microscopy. The improvement in compressive strength is found to be related to the improved reactivity and resulting formation of compact microstructure. Selection of geopolymerisation scheme is found to be a key factor to realise beneficial effect of improved reactivity. Isothermal conduction calorimetry studies along with differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) were carried out to elucidate the influence of improved reactivity during geopolymerisation. Finer particle size resulted in greater dissolution of fly ash during edging. However, the overall process of geopolymerisation and strength development was found to depend not only on dissolution but also on subsequent stages of geopolymerisation. Mechanically induced reactivity is found to have far greater influence on geopolymerisation and strength development vis-à-vis reactivity induced by finer particle size and higher glass content obtained through air classification.",

Three-dimensional structures were successfully printed using a polyvinylalcohol/RHPC ratio of 3:97 w/w, with print resolutions of better than 1 mm. The test components demonstrated the manufacture of features, including off-axis holes, overhangs/undercuts, etc. that would not be manufacturable using simple mould tools. Samples hardened by 1 day post-build immersion in water at RT offered modulus of rupture (MOR) values of up to 0·8±0·1 MPa, and, after 26 days immersion in water at RT, offered MOR values of 2·2±0·2 MPa, similar to bassanite based materials more typically used in 3DP (1-3 MPa).

    "abstract": "AbstractBarium titanate is widely used in the fabrication of thermistors with a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (PTCR). The resistivity can increase by several orders of magnitude near the phase transition temperature Tc for the ferroelectric tetragonal to the paraelectric cubic phase transformation. There is general agreement that the anomaly in the change of electrical resistivity of donor doped BaTiO3 around Tc is due to the grain boundary effect. The Heywang–Jonker model and other mechanisms involving the nature of the electrical barrier formed across the grain boundaries of polycrystalline BaTiO3 are reviewed. The compositional effect on BaTiO3 based PTCR properties is listed and discussed. The influences of manufacturing methods under different stages including the initial doping methods, sample forming methods and final heat treatments on PTCR properties are compared. The complex interrelationships between compositions, microstructures, processing and PTCR characteristics are well discussed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRadioactive waste streams that include metallic uranium are incompatible with conventional ordinary Portland cement (OPC)-based encapsulation matrices. These encapsulation systems are essentially composite materials that incorporate high replacement levels of pulverised fly ash (PFA) or blast furnace slag (BFS). A potential alternative encapsulant for the treatment of problematic waste streams is magnesium phosphate cement. This paper discusses the fundamental characterisation results obtained from two magnesium phosphate cement formulations being developed in the UK for the encapsulation of metallic intermediate level waste (ILW). When compared to conventional OPC based systems, the two magnesium phosphate cement formulations investigated have lower pH, are able to chemically combine more mix water into the system and provide sufficient workability at water/solid ratios close to the theoretical confines needed for paste saturation. The results presented have confirmed compliance of this material against NDA RWMD guidelines for strength and expansion. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results obtained for both formulations up to 360 days cure time have indicated that the cement system shows evidence of chemical stability.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe most important phase in Portland cement is tricalcium silicate, which leads during its hydration to the nucleation and growth of calcium silicate hydrate [referred to as C–S–H, (CaO)x–SiO2–(H2O)y]. The development of this hydrate around the cement grains is responsible for the setting and hardening of cement pastes. The general term for designating the tricalcium silicate in cements is alite. This name relates to all polymorphs containing various foreign ions inserted in their structure. These ions may influence the intrinsic reactivity, and once released during the dissolution, they may interact also with C–S–H. One of the most likely species to be inserted in the alite structure is aluminium. In order to investigate if aluminium plays an important role in C3S reactivity, alite containing 0·1 wt-% aluminium has been synthesised. Alite hydration was followed and compared with pure tricalcium silicate one. The ion concentration evolution at a very early age shows the formation of a C–S–H containing aluminium ions, and it has been evidenced that this hydrate does not act as nuclei to C–S–H growth that induces a delay before acceleration of hydration commonly named 'dormant period'.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNatural crystal sizes of bone minerals are present in the nanoscale regime (specifically less than 100 nm in at least one direction). Therefore, research on the synthesis and characterisation of nanosize hydroxyapatite has gained significant importance in numerous biomedical applications. This is because currently used pure micrometre sized hydroxyapatite has poor mechanical properties, which limits it use in non-load bearing applications. For these reasons, various ions could be easily substituted into nanostructured hydroxyapatite to alter its biocompatibility, sinterability and mechanical properties. In this study, the synthesis methods, biocompatibility, physical, microstructural and nanostructural characteristics of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite are reviewed. Compared to pure micrometre structured hydroxyapatite, numerous properties (most notably, biocompatibility properties pertinent for orthopedic applications) are improved for nanostructured hydroxyapatite doped with various ions. Such studies demonstrated that the mechanical properties and phase stability of nanohydroxyapatite doped with various ions after sintering at high temperatures should be investigated in more detail.",

In assessing any claims regarding the environmental performance of alkali-activated concretes, analysis of appropriate formulation and processing conditions as a function of geographic and raw materials supply parameters must be undertaken. Prediction of durability is also essential, and there remains much to be done in validation of durability test methods for these materials. Another key challenge in the use of any novel binder is compliance with regulatory standards. Updated standards in some jurisdictions show increasing acceptance of alkali activation technology in principle and in practice, showing that the need for sustainable binders can drive regulatory developments in this area and thus enable the uptake and utilisation of these materials. The advancement of scientific knowledge has proven essential in this process.",

Then, the sediments were submitted to 1 and 2 h calcination treatments at 650 and 750°C. The effects of calcination were evaluated by means of 27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and FTIR. The calcined samples were mixed with 5M NaOH solution, and the obtained mixtures were studied for reactivity by means of differential scanning calorimetry. Finally, cylindrical samples were prepared with the same mixtures and cured for 3 days at 60°C plus 4 and 25 days at room temperature. The obtained samples were subjected to unconfined compressive strength determinations in order to verify the actual occurrence of geopolymerisation.

    "abstract": "Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is an extremely high-performance cutting tool material used in the machining of rock, high-strength, non-ferrous metal alloys and carbon-fibre-reinforced composites. It is favoured for its exceptional hardness and wear resistance which results in at least an order of magnitude improvement in performance over previous technologies in almost all metrics. However, PCD suffers from unpredictable brittle fracture and degradation at high temperature during service which limits its capabilities in cutting applications. The literature on the link between its microstructure and its mechanical properties, including strength, toughness and flaw size distribution as measured by pseudo-static tests, is investigated. The conclusions of the seminal paper on this topic are re-examined in the light of modern ceramics research and an alternative explanation is put forth for the strength–grain size relationship published in this paper. All known literature values for strength and toughness vs. grain size and binder content are collated showing no overall trend in strength with binder content but moderate trends in all other combinations. The common claim of weak grain boundaries is brought into question in the light of the lack of any evidence of this fracture mode being evident in pseudo-static tests. The industrial literature on wear testing and failure modes of PCD in service and service-like tests is examined to bridge the gap between pseudo-static and dynamic, application-based experiments. Six main failure modes are recorded and summarised with intergranular fracture being the most conspicuously absent from the pseudo-static tests. It is suggested that the temperature generated by friction in dynamic tests causes the weakening of grain boundaries, resulting in a transition from transgranular to intergranular fracture and a call for further research in this area is made.",

The focus is on vitrification of ashes arising from the incineration of municipal solid waste (MSW) and sewage sludge in terms of their composition, glass melting and reuse potential. The conclusion is that the high compositional variability of these and other wastes tends to preclude their use in many applications. However, the use of modern sorting and separation technology coupled with better control of waste treatment procedures may help to improve the range of potential uses for these wastes.Keywords: ASHGLASSMUNICIPAL SOLID WASTETOXICITYVITRIFICATION",

They were found to be well preserved in alumina after sintering up to 1900°C/100 MPa/3 min. In boron carbide, structural degradation of MWNTs started from ∼1600°C when sintered for 20 min. Multiwall carbon nanotubes maintained their high aspect ratio and fibrous nature even after being sintered in boron carbide at 2000°C for 20 min. However, no Raman vibrations of MWNTs were observed for nanocomposites processed at temperatures <2000°C, which indicates that they were severely degraded. Structural preservation of MWNTs in ceramic nanocomposites depends on the ceramic matrix, sintering temperature and dwell time. Multiwall carbon nanotubes were not preserved for matrices that require high sintering temperatures (>1600°C) and longer processing times (>13 min).",

Using polymer derived ceramics (PDC) the application of MEMS/NEMS in harsh environments with a high temperature under oxidising conditions becomes possible. Smallest features below one micron have already been realised. Two main approaches to the fabrication of PDC containing MEMS/NEMS are presented in this review. In so called nanoimprint lithography or soft lithography methods the microstructures are initially prepared on a duroplastic master for derivative moulding or printing processes. A direct method is the structuring and cross linking of preceramic polymers using lithographic energy sources like ultraviolet, X-ray, electron beam and laser.Keywords: POLYMER DERIVED CERAMICSPRECERAMIC POLYMERSMEMSNEMSLITHOGRAPHY",

When the Mg content is >1·5 at-%, the second phase of MgO has been found. It is found that the addition of Mg can inhibit grain growth of barium titanate ceramics. The Curie temperature and the dielectric constant peak decrease with increasing the MgO content. The addition of magnesium can lead to diffuse transition of barium titanate ceramics.

Using coffee grounds as organic residue has been proven to be effective for pore formation in clay body, increasing its insulating properties yet maintaining acceptable mechanical properties. Small amounts of waste (1–2 wt-%) were found to be effective at forming open cell porosity in clay bricks, which results in worse mechanical and thermal insulating properties. However, bricks with higher amounts of coffee grounds (3–5 wt-%) showed lower density levels and, therefore, higher porosity, which is mainly closed cell porosity, which shows higher insulating capacity and suitable mechanical resistance. Optimal results have been found in bricks with 3 wt-% coffee grounds, showing good mechanical, physical and thermal properties.",

    "abstract": "Spark plasma sintering is a hot pressing technique where rapid heating by dc electric pulses is used simultaneously with applied pressure. Thus, spark plasma sintering is highly suitable for rapid densification of ceramic nanoparticles and preservation of the final nanostructure. A considerable portion of the shrinkage during densification of the green compact of nanoparticles in the first and intermediate stages of sintering occurs during heating by particle rearrangement by sliding and rotation. Further densification to the final stage of sintering takes place by either plastic yield or diffusional processes. Full densification in the final stage of sintering is associated with diffusional processes only. Nanoparticle sliding and rotation during heating may also lead to grain coalescence, with much faster kinetics than normal grain growth at higher temperatures. Based on existing models for particle rearrangement and sliding, the contributions of these processes in conjunction with nanoparticle properties and process parameters were highlighted.",

The results of this work show that biomass ash derived from the combustion of woodchips and straw, properly treated, is characterised by pozzolanic activity and latent hydraulicity that could be exploited for the manufacture of low embodied energy concrete. The ultimate strength of mortars prepared using vitrified biomass ash becomes higher than that of the parent Portland cement after 28 days.",

The electric field and temperature dependence of the ferroelectric properties of the BCSTZS ceramics were investigated. Their energy storage density depending on electric field and temperature was determined from the polarisation–electric field (P–E ) hysteresis loops. According to the dielectric analysis, the BCSTZS ceramics experience three-phase transitions upon cooling. At room temperature, the pyroelectric coefficient p calculated from the remnant polarisation–temperature (Pr–T ) curve is 1116·7 μC K− 1 m− 2, and the figures of merit Fd is 18·1 μPa− 1/2, Fv is 0·013 m2 C− 1 and Fi is 479·3 pm V− 1 respectively. The pyroelectric figures of merit exhibit high frequency stability over a wide range from 100 to 2000 Hz, whereas these values vary gradually with the increase in temperature, which deserves further research to improve their stability. The excellent pyroelectric property of the BCSTZS ceramics is considered as correlating with a polymorphic phase transition occurring around room temperature. The present study demonstrates that the lead free BCSTZS ceramics are promising candidate for replacing the lead zirconate titanate based ceramics.",

(1990) inserted weak interfaces using very thin graphite layers between silicon carbide sheets and obtained a composite that exhibited non-catastrophic fracture characteristics. The weak interface must allow the crack to deviate either by deflection or delamination; in other words, the interface must exhibit a fracture resistance that is lower than that of the matrix layer. In parallel, ceramic laminated composites with strong interfaces were developed in which the residual tensile and compressive stresses appeared in alternate layers during cooling after sintering. These composites are prepared by stacking ceramic sheets produced by lamination or tape casting or by the sequential formation of layers by slip casting, centrifugation or electrophoretic deposition. The techniques may be combined to obtain a composite with the most adequate configuration. This work presents a review about the obtainment of multilayered ceramic composites as a toughening mechanism of ceramic plates.",

Soon after the discovery of the glass ceramic process, attempts were made to produce glass ceramics having high permittivity, low dielectric loss, high electrical resistance and dielectric breakdown strength by precipitating ferroelectric phases in the glassy matrix. In order to produce glass ceramics of high dielectric constant, barium titanate glass ceramics is the first ferroelectric perovskite.

Some wastes are similar in composition to the natural raw materials used in the fabrication of ceramics and often contain materials that are also beneficial in the fabrication process. Thus, upgrading industrial wastes to alternative raw materials is of interest both technically and economically. The present paper sets out the reasoning behind the use of phase diagrams to guide ceramic production, namely the assumptions necessary in making educated choices of compositions and processing parameters. It goes on to show how adequate dexterity with the diagrams' basic rules and dictates, coupled with sound knowledge of ceramic science and processing, can save time and resources, and eventually lead to successful upgrading of the waste material and amelioration of its negative impact on the environment.Keywords: CLAY BASED CERAMICSINDUSTRIAL WASTESPHASE DIAGRAMS",

These advanced technologies have to be adapted to consolidation of nanopowders and require nanopowders specifically designed for consolidation purposes. When adapted to nanopowders, these techniques must be accomplished in rapid rate mode to eliminate residual porosity and retain nanosize grains. Practical verification, however, has exposed problems such as large residual porosity, stable pores in triple junctions, defective grain boundaries and intensive grain growth. All these problems can be avoided when the temperature–pressure–time schedule of sintering is optimised with respect to minimal grain growth.",

This combination of techniques identifies the key components involved in the surface prehydration process. Prehydration of cement leads to dramatic retardation of hydration. in situ XRD shows the retardation of portlandite formation after prehydration, supporting the calorimetry results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ESEM investigations show surface modification after prehydration for C3S, C3A and doped C3A (4%Na2O). Prehydration of cement leads to modification of the surface area and surface charge, which can strongly influence the reactivity of bulk cements. This is relevant to the quality of cement during storage.",

In a porous burner, the solid porous body let the heat recirculate from the hot combustion products to the incoming reactants. The result is that the flame is confined within the foam, meaning high thermomechanical loadings on its constituent material. A set of commercial Si-SiC foams from the same production batch was aged with flat porous burners. Thermal cycles ramp-up, dwell and cooling, as well as burner set-up (power: 15 kW, fuel/air ratio: 1·5), were chosen based on previous experience. Before aging, each foam was first cut in bars ready for bending tests, reassembled into the burner foam configuration and operated. As produced and aged samples were physically, mechanically and chemically analysed and results compared.",

It has been suggested that alternative cementing systems, with lower internal pH than conventional Portland cement based composite cements, may reduce the corrosion of some reactive metals and may be beneficial for the long term durability of wasteforms. A potential alternative is an acid–base cementing system, based on mixing calcium aluminate cement (CAC) with acidic phosphate solutions. Although these systems have been studied previously, there has been no systematic investigation to identify phosphates for producing suitable matrixes for application in radioactive waste encapsulation. In the current study, monophosphate modified CAC formulations did not set or develop significant strength, whereas polyphosphate modified CAC formulations exhibited rapid setting and strength development. It is proposed that polyphosphate modified systems form amorphous reaction products, which act as binders between the partially and unreacted CAC particles, and were responsible for high strength development. Thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy results suggest that this binding matrix consists of amorphous calcium phosphate and alumina gel. The results presented in this investigation suggest that polyphosphate modified CAC has potential as an alternative cementing system for radioactive waste encapsulation.",

Most research to date has concentrated on using either pulverised fuel ash or high purity dehydroxylated kaolin (metakaolin) in association with ground granulated blast furnace slag as the main precursor material. However, recently, attention has turned to alternative calcined clays that are abundant throughout the globe and have lower kaolinite contents than commercially available metakaolins. Due to the lack of clear and simple screening protocols enabling assessment of such geological resources for use as precursors in geopolymer systems, the present paper presents results from experimental work that was carried out to develop a functional binder using materials containing kaolinite taken from the Interbasaltic Formation of Northern Ireland. The influence of mineralogy has been examined, and a screening process, using three Interbasaltic materials as examples, that will assist in the rapid selection of suitable geopolymeric precursors from such materials is outlined.",

    "abstract": "Phosphate cements are formed by the reaction at an environmental temperature between a phosphate solution and a solid precursor. The precursors can be divided into two categories: One contains mono- or divalent cations that are dissolved and form cation-phosphate precipitates acting as a binder. The other category is based on aluminosilicates, and in these cements, covalent Al–O–P and Si–O–P bonds are formed. There is however not yet agreement on the structure and properties of these cements in the limited literature on this last category. Compressive strengths between 40 and 146 MPa were reported, but these high values were only obtained by one group. The mentioned mechanical strengths in literature render the materials promising candidates for construction purposes. More important is that phosphate cements have a neutral pH after hardening. This allows the use of low-cost glass fibers as reinforcement. The production of Textile Reinforced Cements is thus one of the important future applications. Moreover, there is some disagreement on the molecular structure formed. Some state that Al is present in VI-fold coordination. Others state that berlinite-like structures are formed. Thus, Al is in IV-fold coordination. Crystalline berlinite is however only proven to be present after thermal treatment to at least 250°C. The formation of stable crystalline phases at high temperature makes the material also suited for use as a refractory. A drawback is the scarcity of phosphate minerals to produce phosphoric acid. For this reason, the use of phosphate cement should be limited to niche applications. As phosphates can be fast setting cements, one of these applications might be in additive manufacturing.",

In this article, the prototypes of ceramic dental prostheses and standard specimens produced by the ceramic stereolithography approach are compared with those made by the classic subtractive manufacturing method by following the critical clinical requirements. Concerns on the upcoming challenges and future improvement towards clinical applications are presented that include productivity, delivery time, dimensional tolerance, mechanical and aesthetic properties. It is concluded that it is far too early to call 'stereolithography-fabricated ceramic dental prostheses' as a success as usable and competitive products for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The value and impact that ceramic coatings have had in the development of modern mechanical systems and protection of components exposed to harsh environments are often overlooked and understated. Modern equipment must be capable of withstanding substantial attrition, impact damage, erosion and corrosion that degrades materials across a variety of applications. Ceramic coatings enable a robust protective barrier for underlying substrates that outperforms most alternative film barrier materials (i.e. polymers, metals, glasses). In this work, a comprehensive review of modern ceramic coatings for barrier protection against mechanical wear and chemical attack is discussed in detail over a large breadth of relevant topics and case studies. This review highlights many critical aspects including various coating functionalities, design architectures, processing effects, material classes and promising future directions for engineering high-performance ceramic coating.",

    "abstract": "SiC-reinforced SiC ceramic matrix composites (SiC/SiC CMCs) are considered promising candidates to replace their super alloy counterparts due to higher temperature capabilities and lower densities. However, high-temperature and high-pressure water vapour sourced from the hydrocarbons' combustion reactions inhibit the potential of SiC/SiC CMCs by leading to rapid surface recession. In order to address this challenge, environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) have been developed. The emphasis of this review is on the materials and processing techniques for the development of EBC systems. In the first part of the review, the characteristics of the SiC/SiC CMCs and the most common EBC materials are summarised. Then, the interrelationship between processing methods, microstructures and the resulting properties is reviewed. Finally, an overview of the future directions is outlined to assist developments in advanced and novel EBCs for next generation gas turbines.",

    "abstract": "The most conventional manufacturing route for ceramic foams with open cells consists of coating reticulated polyurethane foams. The resulting material has well defined cell size, but suffers from low mechanical strength owing to the presence of hollow struts. As a result, the performance and utilisation of ceramic foams manufactured by this method are limited in certain applications. One solution to overcoming this inherent disadvantage is to use a stronger ceramic coating material and to ameliorate the wetting of the polyurethane template. Such a material is reaction bonded Al2O3 (RBAO), which has high mechanical strength as a result of its fine grain structure, with less or even without glassy phases at the grain boundaries. The present work demonstrates the feasibility of producing strong ceramic foams by using a reaction bonded modified replica technique starting from polyurethane templates varying in both composition and cell size distribution.",

The study involved characterising a 20 year old neat ordinary Portland cement (OPC) paste (high Ca/Si) and a blend of the OPC with 90% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS; low Ca/Si); the results are compared with data on the same mixes at 14 months old. The morphology of the outer product (Op) C–S–H in the blend was essentially the same as at 14 months, whereas that in the neat OPC paste appeared to be finer. The mean aluminosilicate chain length of the C–S–H was considerably longer in both pastes than in similar systems at younger ages. The chemical composition of the C–S–H in both pastes was significantly different than at 14 months: in the neat OPC paste, the Ca/Si ratio of the outer product C–S–H had increased with age, whereas that of the inner product C–S–H had decreased; the Ca/Si ratio of Op C–S–H in the blended paste had decreased with age. An entirely tobermorite based nanostructural model can account for the data for the C–S–H in the blend, whereas the data for the neat paste require some jennite or calcium hydroxide based structure; the distribution of the TEM–EDX analyses favours the T/CH model.Keywords: C–S–HNANOSTRUCTURETEM–EDXPORTLAND CEMENTGGBS",

The SiCC was then replaced by equivalent amounts of SiC abrasive paper ashes of different grain sizes. The SiC containing foams led to apparent density and compressive strength values of about 0⋅18–0⋅35 g cm–3 and 0⋅9–1⋅8 MPa.

    "abstract": "Soda–lime–silica scrap or waste glasses are almost widely accepted sintering additives for the manufacturing of traditional ceramics. Although interesting, this solution does not fully exploit the potentialities of glasses compared to feldspar fluxes. In fact, glasses exhibit the softening and consequently the ability of viscous flow sintering, at much lower temperatures than those required for feldspar melting, and this could be very useful to develop 'environmentally friendly' ceramics, i.e. made with a reduced consumption of energy and natural raw materials. In the present study, a high glass recycle approach is reported, which replaces the feldspar flux, in the formulation of porcelain stoneware, with finely powdered soda–lime glass or glasses from dismantled cathode ray tubes (CRTs). This allowed the manufacturing of ceramics at 880–920 and 750–775°C, respectively. The final products were optimised by the addition of calcium hydroxide for soda–lime glass and Al2O3 platelets for CRT glasses, in order to promote the partial devitrification of the glass or control the fracture propagation. Owing to their overall mechanical properties (bending strength exceeding 70 MPa, hardness exceeding 6 GPa, fracture toughness exceeding 1⋅1 MPa m0⋅5), the new products could find applications in the construction industry.",

Starting with a mechanochemically prepared, semicrystalline phase with Ca/Si=1, the authors have prepared a series of xonotlite samples hydrothermally, at temperatures between 200 and 250°C. Analysis in each case was by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The authors' use of a much lower water/solid ratio has indirectly confirmed the 'through solution' mechanism of xonotlite formation, where silicate dissolution is a key precursor of xonotlite formation. Concerning the role of temperature, too low a temperature (<200°C) fails to yield xonotlite or leads to increased number of structural defects in the silicate chains of xonotlite and too high a temperature (≥250°C) leads to degradation of the xonotlite structure, through leaching of interchain calcium. Synthesis duration meanwhile leads to increased silicate polymerisation due to diminishing of the defects in the silicate chains and more perfect crystal morphologies.",

This work focuses on the dwell phenomenon, but also investigates the penetration response. Experiments are presented for several target configurations including targets that use a small diameter copper buffer, targets that use a large diameter copper buffer, and targets that use no buffer. The dwell-penetration transition velocity for a silicon carbide target with no buffer is 822±46 m s−1 and increases to 1538±12 m s−1 when a buffer is used. The results demonstrate the significant effect a buffer has on interface defeat and that silicon carbide can resist extremely large surface stresses (∼24 GPa) without the use of any confinement or prestress. A significant finding is the non-linear ‘erratic’ penetration velocity that occurs when dwell is not maintained. Computations are also presented that reproduce the effect of using a buffer including the effect of buffer separation. Of particular interest is the non-linear penetration velocity produced in the computed results.",

Results indicated that the addition of 2–4% nanocrystal seeding chemical (NCS) admixture by weight of PC can provide a doubling of early strength, particularly at 6 and 12 h. This strength gain could lead to the turnover of moulds in precast concrete plants being completed twice in 24 h, thus increasing production capacity. Isothermal conduction calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis techniques were used to investigate the reasons for the improvement in compressive strength development. Results indicated that the increase in early compressive strength is due to an acceleration of early hydration of PC in presence of the NCS. Indeed, after 6 h, the degree of hydration was more than 50% greater when NCS was used. This paper also highlights the possibility of the NCS chemical admixture being used in conjunction with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in PC blended concrete mixes. 2% NCS was added to a blend containing 70% PC and 30% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS). Results indicated that early strength values were greater compared to the blend without NCS and comparable to the 100% PC mix.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-light ceramic foams were successfully prepared by a green spheres technique, which used waste glass powder and fly ash as the main material. Besides, borax and SiC were introduced as fluxing agent and foaming agent, respectively.

The optimum composition is 30 wt-% fly ash, 70 wt-% waste glass, 15 wt-% borax and 0.5 wt-% SiC. Ultra-light ceramic foams sintered at 680–780°C possess bulk density of 0.14–0.41 g cm−3, porosity of 82.9–94.1%, compressive strength of 0.91–6.37 MPa and thermal conductivity of 0.070–0.121 W m−1 K−1, respectively.

In addition, the use of 3D carbon fibre preforms has begun to be explored to improve the mechanical properties and also the replacement of PyC matrix with ZrB2 to reducing the oxidation of the composites at ultra-high temperature.",

Three different ZrB2–SiC composites, i.e. ZrB2–SiCP (polycarbosilane derived SiC), ZrB2–SiCC (SiC from CUMI, India) and ZrB2–SiCH (SiC from H. C. Starck, Germany), were studied.

Stoichiometrically controlled geopolymers containing both C–(A)–S–H and N–A–S–H gels are produced here by reaction of a sodium silicate solution with calcium aluminosilicate powders, which were synthesised via a novel solution-polymerisation method utilising polyethylene glycol as a polymer carrier to sterically inhibit movement of precursor cations.

One possible solution to the problem of CRT glass waste is to convert it into foam glass, a material with very promising properties. Foam glasses can be prepared from CRT glasses containing heavy elements (lead, barium) through reaction with a reducing agent such as TiN or SiC. The present experimental study sought to determine the mechanism of foam glass formation and the structural differences between bulk and foam glasses. Additionally, the specific characteristics of bulk and foam glasses such as density, porosity, thermal and mechanical properties were determined, as well as their structural characteristics, using X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results indicate that reutilisation of CRT glass in the form of foam glass is a very promising recycling option.Keywords: CATHODE RAY TUBESDIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRYFOAM GLASSPHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPYRECYCLING",

Polyurethane (PU) sponges were impregnated by immersion in aqueous slurry of a parent glass (mean particle size around 3 μm) from the system Li2O–ZrO2–SiO2–Al2O3 and submitted to heat treatment. From TGA and IR analyses, two main paths of thermal decomposition of PU sponges were observed at 312 and 393°C, which were associated with the decomposition products CO2, CO, NH3 and isocyanide. According to linear thermal shrinkage and DTA measurements, sintering starts at around 570°C and is completed below 700°C, when crystallisation takes place. The main crystalline phases identified by XRD analysis were zirconium silicate, lithium metasilicate and β-spodumene. The morphology and properties of the glass ceramic foams obtained from PU sponges were quite similar for all samples tested. From XCT measurements, a mean cell diameter of around 260 μm and mean strut thickness of 185 μm were calculated, corresponding to a porosity of 75–78%. Compressive strength values under 500 kPa and permeability coefficient in air of about 1000 Darcy were also measured for the samples tested. LZSA glass ceramic foams can be a very interesting alternative to ceramic gas filters, owing to low temperature processing, and to superior properties such as corrosion and thermal shock resistance.Keywords: CELLULAR CERAMICSCERAMIC FOAMSFILTERSGLASS CERAMICSREPLICATION PROCESSRETICULATED POROUS CERAMICS",

    "abstract": "AbstractAbstractSpark plasma sintering (SPS) is a consolidation technique that can combine high heating and cooling rates with a uniaxial applied pressure resulting in short processing time. SPS has been successful in producing ceramics with novel microstructures, which are often reported to have been produced at temperatures lower than would be possible using conventional densification techniques. This has led many authors to infer the presence of additional densification mechanisms intrinsic to the SPS process. The present study considers the relationship between temperature measured in SPS and that experienced by the sample. A simple analytical model enables calculation of the equilibrium temperature distribution in a cylinder of known thermal conductivity and emissivity with constant heat generation per unit volume. Application of this model to the die assembly used in SPS allows estimation of the equilibrium sample temperature. Optimised processing conditions were identified for a fully dense submicrometre grain size alumina, and a SiN–40 vol.-%TiB2 composite. Both materials can only be processed to full density with optimised microstructures in a narrow temperature window. Using the analytical model, the temperature seen by the sample was calculated, and compared with the temperature required using conventional processing techniques. Observed microstructures were consistent with those obtained using conventional processing techniques when processed at the calculated temperatures, suggesting that when SPS is applied to ceramics, additional densification mechanisms intrinsic to the SPS process are not required to explain the observed microstructures. The dynamics of the temperature distribution and problems associated with producing large samples using SPS are also considered.Keywords: ANALYTICAL MODELLINGHOT PRESSINGMICROSTRUCTURESPARK PLASMA SINTERING",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis review article covers the historical development of ceramics, from the beginnings to the present. Feldspar based ceramic biomaterials for veneering metal frameworks, which are based on the jacket porcelain crown, have firmly established themselves in restorative dentistry since the 1970s. Currently, the development of restorative dental materials that can be used to replace metal represents a major challenge. As a result, this review will focus on the latest materials in this field. These materials include glass ceramics as well as high performance sintered ceramics. Glass ceramics exhibit more favourable optical properties, such as translucency and colour, compared with high performance ceramics, while the latter demonstrate high flexural strength and toughness. Both groups of materials have specialised applications in restorative dentistry and are capable of covering all the indications of dental restorations. The two types of materials, that is, glass ceramics and ceramics, have to be processed in accordance with their properties. As a result, the processing techniques, such as moulding, sintering and machining, will be discussed in detail in addition to the properties of the materials. Additional development possibilities for the materials will be presented on the basis of customer/patient needs and the successful long term use of glass ceramics and ceramics. In this context, it is clear that high performance ceramics and layered composites (consisting of high performance ceramics veneered with glass ceramics) offer the best possible solution for indications in the posterior region of the mouth. In contrast, glass ceramics are used to fabricate inlays and onlays for all parts of the jaw. In addition, glass ceramics can be used to fabricate crowns and small bridges to replace anterior dentition.Keywords: DENTAL CERAMICSREVIEWSGLASS CERAMICSBIOMATERIALSCERAMIC COMPOSITES",

Leach tests were conducted during the same period to determine the immobilisation efficiency. The results depend to a large extent on the composition of the activation solution in terms of soluble silica content and alkali used. These parameters determine both the degree of condensation and the geopolymer composition.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPorous ceramic materials have been thoroughly developed due to the wide number of applications in different areas, such as filters for environmental clean-up and reuse, bioreactors, gas or chemical sensors and support materials for catalysts or absorbents. One of the forming methods that can be selected for these applications is the freeze drying of suspensions. This method has received increased attention for manufacturing near net shaped parts with directional porosity. This work deals with the manufacture of porous alumina bodies by a freeze casting route. The different parameters of the process, such as the solids content of the suspension, the addition of cryoprotector (glycerol) and the freezing conditions (temperature and device) have been studied to determine their influence on the microstructure, density and porosity of the green and sintered pieces. Materials with different degrees of porosity and distribution of pores (aligned in the freezing direction or homogeneously distributed) have been obtained.Keywords: SHAPINGALUMINAFREEZE CASTINGPOROSITY DISTRIBUTION",

    "abstract": "AbstractThree-dimensional powder printing was used in this study to fabricate custom made magnesium phosphate based structures. In a first step, farringtonite [Mg3(PO4)2] powders were synthesised by sintering and subsequent grinding. Optimised powders suitable for printing were obtained after 60 min of grinding, which resulted in a medium particle size of 16 μm. These powders were reacted with binder liquids consisting of 2M K2HPO4, 0·5M (NH4)2HPO4 or 20%H3PO4 to form a matrix of either struvite-(K) (MgKPO4.6H2O), struvite (MgNH4PO4.6H2O) or newberyite (MgHPO4.3H2O) by a hydraulic setting reaction. While printing of struvite-(K) was not possible due to the long setting time of this cement system, both newberyite and struvite samples could be processed with good dimensional accuracy. Strength was initially low after printing, namely in the range of 1·3–2·8 MPa; however, additional post-hardening in the binders increased the compressive strength to a maximum of 10 MPa for struvite and 36 MPa for newberyite. This was accompanied by a higher degree of conversion to the setting products, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction analysis. Magnesium phosphate based structures prepared by three-dimensional printing may find an application as biodegradable bone substitutes or can be used for the rapid manufacturing of moulds for metal casting, as demonstrated in this study.",

The BNNSs were prepared using liquid exfoliation method and characterised by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The average length was ∼0.5 μm, and thickness of the nanosheets was between 4 and 30 layers. These BNNSs were used to prepare BS-BNNS composite with different loading concentrations of 1, 2.5 and 5 mass-% (i.e. 1.395, 3.705 and 7.32 vol.-%). Spark plasma sintering (SPS) was used to densify these composites to avoid structural damages to the BNNSs and/or crystallisation within the composite sample during high temperature processing. The BNNSs were found to be evenly distributed in the composites matrix and were found to be aligned in an orientation perpendicular to the direction of the applied force in SPS. The mechanical properties including fracture toughness, flexural strength and elastic modulus were measured. Both fracture toughness and flexural strength increased linearly with increasing concentration of BNNSs in BS glass. There was an enhancement of ∼45% in the fracture toughness (1.10 MPa.m1/2) as well as flexural strength (118.82 MPa) with the addition of only 5 mass-% loading of BNNSs compared to BS glass (0.76 MPa.m1/2; 82.16 MPa).

The results revealed that the fracture force of the SG restorations was higher than that of the CZ restorations in both cases, which ascribed to the fact that more voids and larger grains in the conventional versus in the SG restorations.

Conventional sintering and spark plasma sintering (SPS) were applied to compare the behaviour of CeO2 and UO2 reported in the literature. High temperature thermal conductivity measurements did not confirm the positive influence of SiC additive inside the CeO2 matrix mainly due to grain boundary disruptions.

    "abstract": "Flash sintering is a novel and emerging route for sintering ceramics within a few seconds, even under pressure-less conditions. In the current study, hydroxyapatite (HA) was fully densified by flash sintering at a furnace temperature of 1020°C. Flash sintering with constant electric fields of 750 and 1000 V cm−1 reduced the grain growth rate significantly compared to that sintered in the absence of an electric field at 1400°C. The microstructure of HA consolidated by flash sintering was compared with that of the without electric field sintered samples. The flash-sintered samples showed smaller grains (160 ∼ 320 nm) than the without electric field sintered samples (∼15 µm). The samples with a higher applied electric field showed slightly better densification than those with the lower field by flash sintering. Overall, the electric flash reduces the sintering temperature effectively and decreases the holding time to densify highly insulating ceramics, such as HA.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAbstractA closer look at some natural materials from animal and plant sources and the phenomenon driving their use in day to day applications resulted in investigation of their potential in processing of ceramic foams. Ceramic foams were made using aqueous ceramic slurries based on chicken egg white, soap nut fruit extract and sucrose. Egg white and soap nut extract were utilised for their natural foaming ability and binding of ceramic particles. Ceramic foams were produced by foaming the aqueous ceramic slurries by mechanical agitation followed by casting. The egg white based foams were set by coagulation achieved through sprinkling of acid, however use of acid was not successful with foams made from slurries with low and high ceramic loadings. Sucrose was utilised for its moisture retention ability and it not only simplified the egg white based process but also helped to achieve foams with exceptional characteristics including porosity exceeding 95%. Sucrose containing egg white based ceramic foams could be set by heating soon after casting. The soap nut based foams were processed in a similar way and were set simply by drying. Soap nut based foams exhibited a much higher number of interconnections per cell. Foams with a range of porosity and microstructural features could be produced from egg white and soap nut based slurries by using different combinations of ceramic loading and binder content in the premix or by varying the foaming time and slurry to container volume ratio.Keywords: CERAMIC FOAMEGG WHITEMICROSTRUCTURENATURAL MATERIALSRHEOLOGYSOAP NUTSUCROSE",

Open cell ceramic foams with average cell diameter of 0.5–1.5 mm, compressive strength of up to 3 MPa and porosity of up to 90% were used as supports for direct crystallisation of MFI type zeolite under partial dissolution/recrystallisation of the ceramic foam. The partial transformation of the Si–O–C based foam material by hydrothermal crystallisation at 150°C for 0–96 h resulted in a well distributed zeolite coating with excellent adhesion on the foam surface. Characterisation of the zeolite/ceramic foam composites was carried out by XRD measurements in order to determine the amount of zeolite in the composite. 29Si MAS NMR experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of Cu2O addition on the crystallisation behaviour.Keywords: CATALYSISCERAMIC FOAMSMAGIC ANGLE SPINNING NMRNITROGEN ADSORPTIONSUPPORTED CRYSTALLISATIONZEOLITE",

The different phases of TiO2 were determined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The anatase–rutile transformation temperature was found to be lowered in the presence of transition metal oxides. The transformation temperature was found to vary much in argon and hydrogen atmospheres compared to air in the presence of the metal oxides. Also the method of preparation of metal oxide doped TiO2 influences rutilation. Other methods such as chemical analysis, surface area measurements and crystallite size calculation were used for the characterisation of the samples. The surface area of heated samples was found to be decreased while crystallite size increased due to rutilation on heating. The samples were also observed under a scanning electron microscope to characterise the microstructural changes associated with each thermal treatment and atmosphere. The morphology of doped titania changes much on heating due to phase modification. The atmosphere of heating also has important effect on deciding the morphology of rutilated titania.",

Sintering behaviour of different samples was investigated by measuring shrinkage, relative density and water absorption. Results showed that addition of more than 40 wt-% slag to the base body generates closed porosities in the specimens due to the bloating phenomenon which reduces the bending strength.

In this paper, mortars and cement paste with additions of nanosilica (nS), silica fume (SF) and nS+SF were studied applying a factorial design methodology. Mortars with water/total solids ratios below 16% were characterised in the fresh state by rheological and flow table tests. Thus, all mixtures show suitable workability in both equipments. Compressive strength, setting time, air content, fresh apparent density, hydration temperature and X-ray diffraction were carried out. The optimum amount of nS and SF for each W/B ratio between 0·35 and 0·47 was determined by compressive strength at 28 days. For W/B<0·43, SF shows the best results, while for W/B>0·43, nS reaches better performance. In general, nS addition affects the properties more significantly than SF.",

The calcination of raw mussel shells to lime was studied as a function of particle size, temperature, heating rate, treatment time and atmosphere. Lime formation went through a maximum with respect to particle size for all heating conditions, as a result of competition between increased surface area and a tendency for particle to form necks resulting in caking. Optimised heat treatment conditions resulted in transformations of more than 95%. Preliminary experiments to investigate removal of phosphates from model waste water solutions showed that raw shells had limited ability due to a mechanism that relies on adsorption only. For these raw materials the finer particle sizes removed more phosphate due to increased surface area. The heat treated mussel shells on the other hand were shown to remove greater than 95% of the phosphates for both fine and coarse size ranges due to a precipitation mechanism of phosphate removal. This work demonstrates the potential for using mussels as an alternative to limestone for phosphate removal, at the same time overcoming the expensive and problematic issues of waste disposal.",

The results demonstrated that Ti powder reacted with the cellular carbon walls of the wood to form TiC coatings at 700–1000°C. Furthermore, the synthesised TiC/C ceramic retained the morphology of the carbon template, indicating that the formation of the carbon template played a dominant role in the formation of the TiC/C ceramic possessing a highly microporous structure.",

Subsequent separation tests indicated that CO2 could be separated from N2 by the mesoporous γ-Al2O3 membrane. In spite of the difficulties of the separation, the optimised microstructure achieved for the prepared membrane led to desirable and regular permeation behaviour. It was also observed that separation could be more efficient in high pressure permeation conditions. The prepared substrate fulfilled the required strength and permeability for the thin γ-Al2O3 membrane film under these conditions. Accordingly, an optimised completely ceramic membrane structure, applicable for CO2 separation applications, was achieved.",

By sintering a powder mixture of PZT and polymethylmetacrylate spherical particles (1.5 and 10 μm) at 1080°C, we prepared ceramics with ∼30% porosity with interconnected micrometer sized pores and with predominantly ∼8 μm spherical pores. The acoustic impedance was ∼15 MRa for both samples, which was lower than for the dense PZT. The attenuation coefficient α (at 2.25 MHz) was higher for ceramics with ∼8 μm pores (0.96 dB mm− 1 MHz− 1), in comparison to the ceramic with smaller pores (0.56 dB mm− 1 MHz− 1). The high α value enables the miniaturisation of the transducer, which is crucial for medical imaging probes. The dielectric and piezoelectric coefficients, polarisation, and strain response decreased with increased porosity and decreased pore/grain size. We suggest a possible role of pore/grain size on the switching behaviour.",

The coefficient of friction of the composites did not change much at low normal loads but increased with increasing amount of GNP in the alumina matrix for high normal loads. The addition of GNP contributed to improved scratch resistance of alumina nanocomposites only for low loads below ∼97 N. This correlates with the mechanical properties of the composites. As the applied load increased, the scratch resistance of the GNP composites decreased due to the presence of weakly bonded grain boundaries in the alumina matrix, which enhanced chipping of material.",

    "abstract": "The latest technological requirement demands a huge (but sometimes challenging) variety of properties which perhaps are impossible in monolithic or traditional materials. This has innovated the introduction of reinforcement in traditional materials such that the resulting composite material would be an advantage for the collaborating influence of the combined matrix and the reinforcement. Single-phase ceramics have been limited in application due to low densification and poor properties. Hence, ceramic matrix composite is the family of materials that have undertaken quick innovation in past years because of its auspicious properties for structural and functional usage. This concept has made the incorporation of sintering additives into the monolithic form of ZrO2 of high importance because of the poor densification and fracture toughness of undoped ZrO2. The addition of sintering additives provides good functionality to the improvement of ceramic materials. This paper painstakingly reviews the effects of diverse sintering additives such as carbides, borides, nitrides on the microstructure, densification, and mechanical properties of ZrO2 ceramic matrix using different sintering techniques and it lastly stated a futuristic approach to the enhancement and characterisation needed for ZrO2 ceramic matrix composites.",

The experimental material showed very high density with a value of 8.72 g/cm 3 and a small grain size of HEC and HEB grains with values of 0.95 ± 0.30 and 0.99 ± 0.27 μm, respectively. The nano-hardness of the HEC and HEB grains is very high with mean values of 37.4 ± 2.3 and 43.0 ± 2.9 GPa, respectively with the micro-hardness of the dual system HV1 29.4 ± 2.0 GPa. The friction coefficient values during the test with 5 and 10 N increased from a value of 0.4 and reached the values 0.65 and 0.77 at the sliding distances of approximately 1500 and 1000 m, respectively. The specific wear rate decreased with increasing sliding distance at 5 N load, from 4.75 × 10 −7 mm 3 /Nm to 4.2 × 10 −7 mm 3 /Nm and at 10 N from 2.1 × 10 −7 to 1.7 × 10 −7 mm 3 /Nm. The dominant wear mechanisms in both cases were an oxidation-driven tribo-chemical reaction and tribo-layer formation in boride grains and mechanical wear in carbide grains.",

The investigation focused on the factors and mechanism influencing perovskite dissolution by calculating phase compositions of different ceramic matrices and observing pigment microstructure. Pigment powders were also characterised by structural analysis and spectroscopy. Pigment dissolution was only slightly affected by the firing cycle, mostly being governed by the amount and chemical composition of the liquid phase. In particular, the larger the content of chemically aggressive components such as calcium, magnesium, zinc and lead oxides, the stronger and faster the pigment dissolution.",

This technique enables topographical information, elemental composition (from EDS) and chemical information (from Raman spectroscopy) from the same spot without sample transfer.

An increase in one order of magnitude in specific surface area (SSA) values compared to the unetched samples was observed. This SSA increase was accompanied by micro- and mesopores formation. The limited increase in the specific surface area was attributed to several factors: the smaller dimension of the etchable SiO2 nanodomains and the more amorphous nanostructure of these polymer derived ceramics compared to the sol–gel derived ones. Moreover a possible role of the carbon residue deriving from polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) microbeads used as porosity source was supposed. Higher SSA values (up to 65 m2 g−1) were reached by inducing a slight phase separation, accompanied by a growth of the nanodomains size, and by an oxidative treatment that partly removed the residual carbon. Microcellular ceramic foams with a bimodal pore size distribution were produced.",

    "abstract": "Because bone tissue engineering (TE) strategies encounter patient specificities, like site of implantation and different bone turnover rate, scaffolds with tunable characteristics are required. With this regard, custom made open porous calcium phosphate (CaP) structures with variable chemical and structural compositions were produced using an optimised gel casting technique. The phase composition was altered by changing the initial hydroxyapatite (HA) to β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) powder ratio. After sintering, an HA/β-TCP ratio between 100 : 0 and 0 : 100 was predictably attained. Average pore sizes ranged from 182 to 466 m m and corresponded to porosity values of respectively 71 and 86%. Mechanical strength and dynamic E-modulus respectively decreased with decreasing HA content from 10·1 to 0·4 MPa and 9·46 to 0·27 GPa. It was concluded that this optimised gel casting method enables the production of CaP scaffolds with a custom made HA/β-TCP ratio with variable pore size, porosity and corresponding mechanical strength.",

The average size of the silver nanoparticles incorporated in the aluminium nano‐oxide carrier ranges from 22 to 60 nm. The Al2O3–Ag nanopowders thus produced have a largely developed surface area (above 200 m2 g−1) with a great number of open pores (above 5×10−4 m3 g−1), which gives evidence that their tendency to agglomeration is only slight and that the possible agglomerates have a loose structure. Moreover, the nanopowders show good bactericidal and fungicidal properties. The results obtained in the present experiments show that the Al2O3–Ag nanopowders produced by the proposed method can be used successfully as the raw material in the production of biocidal biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Effect of WSi2 addition on densification and properties of ZrB2 has been investigated. Samples of the following composition with controlled addition of WSi2 were prepared by hot pressing (1) ZrB2, (2) ZrB2+2·5%WSi2, (3) ZrB2+5%WSi2 and (4) ZrB2+10%WSi2. Hot pressing of monolithic ZrB2 at 1750°C resulted in achieving a density of only 80·1% ρth. Addition of WSi2 enhanced the densification and resulted in near theoretical density. Microstructural investigations revealed the presence of reaction product containing Si and Zr. An increase in WSi2 content led to an increase in hardness of the product. A slight increase in fracture toughness was observed with WSi2 addition. Crack deflection was observed in the microstructure. Oxidation study of the composite samples revealed that the oxidised layer is not adherent and resulted in spallation at the end of the test.",

    "abstract": "A processing method common to composite ceramics with very different ZrB2/SiC ratios was developed in order to exploit ZrB2–SiC laminates comprising alternate layers with different compositions for thermal protection systems of re-entry vehicles. Ceramic laminates were made using SiC, ZrB2 and composites with a SiC/ZrB2 ratio ranging from 100 vol.-%SiC to 100 vol.-%ZrB2. The preparation was performed by tape casting of a slurry, layer stacking, debinding and pressureless sintering. Boron and carbon proved to be suitable sintering aids for SiC laminates as well as for composite laminates containing SiC. In the case of composites with a ZrB2 matrix, the second phase of SiC acted as a sintering aid. This process obtains very similar densification for specimens with very different compositions (ranging from 100%SiC to 80ZrB2–20SiC). The stiffness of ZrB2–SiC laminates increased with the ZrB2 content increase, while the bending strength was not affected by the ZrB2/SiC ratio.",

Results showed that sample C2 with relatively low iron oxides and mass ratio of CaO/SiO2 possessed the highest bending strength value among samples. A low content of iron oxide enhanced densification degree because pores were developed by reduction of ferric oxide into ferrous oxide. Moreover, a low CaO/SiO2 mass ratio also greatly promoted the densification process by prolonging the sintering time and delaying the crystallisation. In addition, sample C1 developed by one-stage sintering had a worse mechanical performance than that obtained by two-stage sintering although they had the same crystals. For all samples, despite of different compositions and sintering processes, the main crystal phases are augite and diopside ferrian.",

    "abstract": "The partial replacement of Portland cement (PC) by glassy aluminosilicates in cementitious binders has been common practice for decades, offering concretes with increased durability and long-term strength compared with PC concretes. However, these concretes typically display a much lower rate of strength development and this limits practical levels of cement replacement. The factors contributing to strength development in concrete are complex but among them is the reactivity of the supplementary cementitious material, which has been associated with glass content, and composition with respect to the ratio of network modifiers to network formers, etc. This paper revisits the assessment of reactivity using a fundamental dissolution approach and highlights a rapid migration of soluble constituents, specifically Ca, to the surface on contact with an activating solution. The conditions which affect the composition of Ca-bearing precipitates and their role in on-going hydration are discussed.",

Suspensions with PVA were prepared by either mixing all the components together or adding the PVA in a second step on the dispersed slurry. Although the slight increase in viscosity suggests that competitive adsorption occurs, the microstructure seems not to change depending on the order of addition of additives. Considering its lower molecular weight, glycerol provides lower viscosity, and as a consequence of its cryoprotective character, sintering leads to smaller pore size, being the porosity 35% for an added content of 10 wt-% with respect to solids. In the case of PVA, contents of 2 wt-% are enough to obtain solid firm bodies with a porosity of 48%. The porosity and the size of the pores decrease with increasing concentration of PVA.",

The micro-size cristobalite enhanced the compressive strength of the geothermal clay-based geopolymer.

The total energy consumption was divided into three parts: power lost in the electrical motor, power lost in mechanical transmission and power used for grinding materials. These three components were described separately by taking the principle of an electrical motor, mechanical transmission and grinding process into account. Measurement results of two ball mills in a real ceramic manufacturing plant showed that the proposed calculation models could achieve an accuracy of more than 96% for predicting the ball mill energy consumption during which the power fluctuates periodically to complete one rotation cycle of the ball mills.",

Properties of such concrete depend on the chemical composition of fly ash, source and method of burning of coal in power stations, etc. The present paper presents a comparative study on the properties on concrete containing fly ash obtained from two different sources, Drax Power Station, UK and Manjung Power Station, Malaysia. Fly ash obtained from Malaysia contained 11˙47%CaO and its particles were coarser than the fly ash obtained from Drax, UK, which contained less calcium oxide (2˙55%). Malaysian fly ash concrete required more water to achieve the targeted slump of 55 ± 5 mm of fresh concrete, such concrete showed 4 to 7% high porosity and 27 to 36% low compressive strength as compared with the porosity and compressive strength of the concrete made with Drax, UK fly ash.",

Accordingly, the characterisation of the plastic behaviour is essential to adjust the fluxing properties of the material. In the current work, three industrially prepared ceramic pastes (porcelain, earthenware and terracotta) were tested, using stress–deformation curves obtained by compression of cylindrical probe tests. To achieve good extrusion performance, the design and operating conditions also need to be considered in detail.The ram extrusion of adjusted pastes was followed by the Benbow–Bridgwater model. Differences in the flow behaviour were related with stress–deformation curves and with the surface quality of the extrudate (by using the static friction coefficient).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract An ideal bone graft replacement should degrade at the rate that new bone can be formed. Owing to the variability in the rate of bone turnover with age, diet, sex and health, this is almost impossible using traditional bioceramics such as hydroxyapatite and phosphate glasses. One way of achieving such a link is by coordinating implant dissolution with a specific biological stimulus associated with tissue formation. In the case of bone, one appropriate stimulus may be the enzyme alkaline phosphatase which is found in high concentrations attached to the membranes of cells responsible for bone formation (osteoblasts). It has been proposed that alkaline phosphatase functions by locally catalysing the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate ions, which are known inhibitors of hydroxyapatite formation thus enabling bone formation. It is possible, therefore, that the degradation of calcium pyrophosphate ceramics could be coordinated with bone formation. In the few studies that have been published on the use of this material as a bone replacement, the grafts were formed by pressing and sintering β-dicalcium pyrophosphate powders. This approach imposes limits on implant morphology and can be associated with significant material shrinkage. In this paper, the fabrication of calcium pyrophosphate ceramics by heating brushite based cement materials has been investigated. The results obtained in the study showed that complete conversion from brushite to γ-calcium pyrophosphate occurred at 400°C. Increasing sintering temperature from 400 to 1000°C resulted in an increase in compressive strength from 6·9 to 10·2 MPa and allowed the conversion of the γ-calcium pyrophosphate to the β form. The sintering process was associated with a considerable reduction in specific surface area which may limit the rate of resorption of the sintered material.Keywords: Calcium pyrophosphateCementBioceramicsBrushiteBone",

Disinfection of drinking water aimed at the removal and inactivation of microbiological agents typically requires the consumption of energy, which to date is mainly generated from fossil fuels. The titanium dioxide (TiO2) based photo-induced oxidising system (POS) is one of the most promising candidates for the disinfection of water using solar energy. Progress in photocatalytic water disinfection requires understanding both concepts of TiO2 semiconductors as well the biochemistry of microorganisms. The aim of the present study is to introduce workers in the solid state sciences to relevant basic concepts and terminology of microbial biochemistry. We review the structure of the bacterial cell envelope, which is the major target of the TiO2 based POS. We outline how attack by the POS leads to the production of additional reactive species commonly referred to in the biological literature as reactive oxygen species both at the surface and the inside of the cell and develop a unifying model of the molecular mechanisms underlying the biocidal activity of the TiO2 POS.",

    "abstract": "Water disinfection (removal of microbial agents) using sunlight is an emerging technology, which has the capacity to address the global shortage of drinking water. Therefore, intensive investigations in many laboratories aim to develop photocatalyst for water disinfection. The research is focused on titanium dioxide (TiO2), which is the most promising candidate for high performance photocatalyst able to address the commercial requirements. The present work (Part 1) considers the effect of defect disorder on semiconducting and photocatalytic properties of TiO2 (rutile) in water disinfection using solar energy. It is shown that photocatalytic properties of TiO2 in water are closely related to the light induced reactivity of TiO2 with water leading to the formation of active species, such as OH*, H2O2 and , which have the capacity to oxidise microorganisms. It is also shown that the ability of TiO2 to form the active radicals is closely associated with the presence of point defects in the TiO2 lattice and the related semiconducting properties. Therefore, photocatalytic properties of TiO2 may be modified in a controlled manner by changes in its defect disorder. Consequently, defect chemistry may be used as the framework in the development of TiO2 with controlled properties that are desired for solar water disinfection. The following work (Part 2) considers the structure of bacteria and their reactivity/photoreactivity with TiO2 in aqueous environments. Both Part 1 and 2 bring together the concepts of TiO2 photocatalysis and the concepts of microbiology in order to derive the theoretical models that are needed for the development of high performance photocatalysts for solar water disinfection.",

The compressive strength of the sintered porous composite increased as the porosity decreased, i.e. the low porosity gave a high compressive strength.

The hard boride based coatings on steels and alloys obtained through the thermal diffusion process have a high potential for these severe application conditions over many other types of coatings as they can be obtained on the entire working surfaces of large size and complex shape products. Intensive tribological studies of the iron boride based coatings on carbon steel obtained at Endurance Technologies Inc. have been conducted using the Cameron–Plint testing unit (reciprocating sliding of the metallic rod under the load over a flat surface of the coated samples). The friction wear loss, friction coefficient and structural changes of the coatings have been studied in dry and lubricating (water–oil) friction conditions, which simulate actual application conditions. It was demonstrated that the obtained boride coatings have the friction loss significantly smaller than untreated steel (e.g. ∼10–30 times in the dry conditions and at least 5 times in the lubricating conditions) with no peeling and flaking-off. The friction coefficients of the boride coatings are steady over the test duration. The influence of the thickness on the boride coatings performance is demonstrated. The encouraging results are explained by the specific coating structure of the hard coating obtained through the thermal diffusion process and the thin 'tribofilm' formed during a friction mode.",

Powder compacts sintered under direct heating conditions were highly porous; compacts with particle size < 38 μm reached a maximum density of 2.74 g cm− 3 at 850°C, whereas compacts with particles of size < 100 and < 250 μm reached maximum densities of 2.69 and 2.72 g cm− 3 at 875 and 900°C respectively. Further increase in sintering temperature resulted in a rapid decrease in density of the glass ceramics. Image analysis results were used to link the sudden drop in density to the increase in volume of microsized pores formed in the samples during sintering. In particular, compacts made from < 38 μm particles sintered at 950°C resulted in 65 vol.-% porosity with a pore size of ∼20 μm. Such materials can be used for sound and thermal insulation purposes.",

Before transport testing, samples were subjected to gentle stepwise drying at 21°C or severe oven drying at 105°C to induce microcracking. Microcracks were quantified using fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. Permeability decreased significantly with increasing confining pressure and this was more significant for samples with a greater degree of microcracking. Image analysis shows that microcracks undergo partial closure when confined, but the total accessible porosity was not significantly affected. Implications of these results with respect to the influence of microcracks on transport properties are discussed.",

Simulations based on the discrete element method (DEM) are used to integrate the information gained from MD simulations into the clinker particle behaviour at larger scales. Computed impact energy distributions from DEM mill simulations can serve as a link between large scale industrial and laboratory sized mills.

Calcium aluminate cement based systems have great potential for the incorporation of aluminium containing ILW owing to the near neutral internal pH of these binders. However, CAC based binders usually undergo phase conversion from the metastable hydration phases C3AH6 and/or C2AH8 to the stable C3AH6, resulting in strength regression and dimensional instability. The present study investigates the feasibility of CAC modification to prevent this detrimental process of phase conversion. Two different types of sodium phosphates are used to modify a CAC system, and the setting behaviour and the mineralogy of the binder products were studied. It is shown that it is possible to avoid the conventional phase conversion of CAC hydrates due to the formation of an amorphous aluminate phase in place of the metastable hydrates, leading to the production of a phase assemblage, which is stable for at least 180 days.",

A statistical experimental design involving mixtures of Portland cement, fly ash and nanosilica, in addition to water/binder ratio as an external factor, is proposed to study their combined effect on the compressive strength of concrete. This design allows estimating a cubic regression model that properly accounts for the effects of the mixture components within a constrained experimental region. The range of each factor was selected according to levels normally used in the industry. Finally, an optimisation strategy permits to recommend the use of nanosilica when high percentages of cement replacement by fly ash are present.",

Sintering process could be divided into three typical stages, the criterion of which is based on whether the dominant mechanism is independent particle rearrangement or independent atomic diffusion. Through the investigation of sintering mechanisms of both sintering methods in the same way, it is found that it is necessary to remove the large pores (>100 nm) before grain growth is activated for complete densification. It suggests that at the temperature when the grain growth is activated, the corresponding pore structure proves to be the crucial factor influencing the complete densification of transparent alumina ceramic.",

MgB2 is a promising parent material towards realising quasi-2D forms of boron, owing to its unique layered constitution: graphenic boron planes interleaved with hexagonal arrays of Mg atoms. Chelating agents can selectively extract the interlayer Mg from MgB2 in water, to form Mg-chelant complexes. The loss of Mg results in delamination of MgB2 into boron-based nanosheets. This approach is further improved by rational choice of chelants with greater affinity for Mg and tuning the optimal pH for metal complexation, thereby leading to a better yield of nanosheets. These boron-based nanosheets have been explored for their candidacy as a new class of inorganic fillers in a polymeric matrix – polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).

Results indicated that the minimum reflection loss value of MnCo2O4 microparticles was −26.34 dB at 11.04 GHz with the absorber thickness of 2.5 mm, which was much lower than that of NiCo2O4 microcubes with the same absorber thickness. The possible mechanism was analysed, indicating that the geometry and size of MCo2O4 (M = Mn,Ni) microparticles played a key role in microwave absorption.",

All samples were densified by spark plasma sintering at 50 MPa and at temperatures ranging from 1800°C to 2000°C. The newly synthesised boron carbide showed good sintering behaviour thanks to its small spherical grains, resulting in excellent relative densities >99%. Measurement of thermoelectric performance gave results comparable to previous reports of carbon-rich boron carbides. The High Purity boron carbide sample as well as investigated commercial reference materials showed high positive Seebeck coefficients close to 250 μVK−1 over the whole temperature range. Electrical conduction mechanisms of boron carbide is also discussed. The nearest-neighbour hopping conduction model may be a better description compared to the often-used bipolaron model.",

Starting from a standard porcelain stoneware body mix, several modified mixes were prepared by replacing different amounts of the fluxing component, a sodium feldspathic sand, with three types of scrap glass: a soda lime glass from urban wastes, a lead based glass from the neck part of cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and a barium based glass from CRT panels. The replacement of feldspar sand with a soda lime scrap glass, in the range 5–10 wt-%, allows porcelain stoneware materials to be obtained with good characteristics. A slight decrease in the water absorption of the fired material is observed after sintering at the same temperature as the reference mix. Furthermore, flexural strength remains high and the microstructural homogeneity enhances reliability. The presence of 2 and 5 wt-%, of lead and barium based scrap glass respectively, both characterised by lower liquid viscosity at higher temperature, makes possible a significant decrease in the sintering temperature of the modified porcelain stoneware products while maintaining good mechanical properties.Keywords: MECHANICAL PROPERTIESMICROSTRUCTUREPORCELAIN STONEWARE TILERECYCLINGSCRAP GLASS",

Firing was performed in a propane firing kiln at 1000°C for 1 or 4 h soaking. For oxidising atmosphere, water absorption varies between 18⋅9 and 19⋅5% and bending strength between 25⋅9 and 27⋅9 MPa. The crystalline phases identified are haematite Fe2O3, quartz SiO2, plagioclase [anorthite (Ca,Na)(Al,Si)2Si2O8], clinopyroxene [augite Ca(Mg,Fe+3,Al)(Si,Al)2O6] and corundum Al2O3. The microstructure is comprised of Si rich vitrified areas that contain quartz and have closed, round pores and an assemblage of particles creating a mass with open and interlinked pores and no signs of glassy phase. For reducing atmosphere and 1 or 4 h soaking, water absorption varies between 18⋅2 and 18⋅7% and bending strength is ∼29⋅5 MPa. The crystalline phases identified are qualitatively the same as for the oxidising atmosphere. The microstructure is comprised of two concentric zones due to the reduced gas permeability in the core of the body. The outer shell is highly vitrified with closed and rounded pores. The microstructure in the core of the body resembles that of samples fired in oxidising atmosphere; however, the average pore size is higher and the vitrified regions are more extensively formed. The build-up of compressive stresses in the outer shell may also account for the increase in the bending strength; however, cracks were developed in few occasions. In all cases, quartz participates in the development of liquid phase and dissolves in the melt. Increase in the soaking time results in a decrease in the quartz content in the body and an increase in the vitreous phase.",

The investigation was carried out by considering performance related compaction, volumetric and mechanical properties, which were assessed in the laboratory by employing a number of different characterisation techniques.It was observed that the key factor which allows a detailed interpretation of test results is the minimum absorption, which takes place in the mixtures at the vitrified ash bitumen interface. Consequently, mixtures including this type of secondary (recycled) aggregates may lead to substantial savings associated to the reduction of binder dosage and therefore, to economic and environmental advantages.Although mixtures containing vitrified MSWI ashes need to be thoroughly investigated with special attention devoted to mix design and moisture susceptibility issues, the results obtained in this study appear to be promising. The presence of vitrified ashes does not negatively affect the stiffness and fatigue failure properties of the mixtures, while benefits deriving from their high angle of internal friction may be beneficial regarding the resistance to accumulation of permanent deformation.",

Each material was completely penetrated by a tungsten carbide cored projectile of known kinetic energy and the residual penetration into a ductile aluminium alloy backing material was measured. The energy transferred to the tile by the projectile has been calculated and has been shown to vary linearly with the tile thickness. From the energy transferred to the armour tile, the mean resisting stress that was offered to the penetrator was calculated and for the materials tested, scaled with the material hardness. This work shows that for DOP testing, where the projectile remains intact, the measured DOP is merely a facet of the ceramic's hardness and not its true ballistic performance. The possibility of using this method to measure the strength of damaged ceramic is also discussed.Keywords: depth-of-penetration testingPenetration mechanismsCeramic armourModellingHardnessStrength",

The results show that, with the introducing of Y2O3, the density, glass transition temperature and thermal expansion coefficient of the glass increase but the chemical durability declines. In addition, compared with the glass without Y2O3, the bend strength of the glass including 4·76 wt-% Y2O3 increased from 54 to 110 Mpa. The possible mechanism is that yttria acts as a network former in the structure and makes the island shape network unit repolymerisation by forming Ge–O–Y bond. The absorption strength caused by hydroxyl vibration decreased up to completely disappearance as the Y2O3 content increased continuously. The introducing of yttria in the composition causes the conversion from four coordination to higher coordination germanium, which decreases non-bridge oxygen (NBO) and weakens hydroxyl characteristic absorption.",

According to the obtained results, the values of elastic modulus, compressive strength and density of the samples reduced with increasing percentage of DCPD phase. The mechanical properties of the prepared samples were near the natural compact bone. After in vitro examination and confirming the bone-like apatite ability of the prepared composites, in vivo examination was employed, and for this purpose, a rabbit model was developed. New bones formed on the outside surface and on the macropore walls of the samples, as osteoids and osteoclasts, were evident 2 months post-operatively. Considering these properties, the prepared composite scaffolds made from HAp and DCPD could be considered as highly bioactive and potential bone tissue engineering implants.",

Small organic molecules, such as 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DHP), 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid (DHC), 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid (THB), hydrocinnamic acid (HCA) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (HPA), were investigated as dispersing agents. It was shown that DHB, DHP, DHC and THB molecules, containing adjacent OH groups bonded to the aromatic rings, provide efficient stabilisation of MnO2 nanoparticles and enable EPD of MnO2 films. The results obtained for the DHB, DHP, DHC and THB molecules with different numbers of OH groups and different lengths of hydrocarbon chains were analysed and compared with corresponding experimental data for HCA and HPA without adjacent OH groups. It was demonstrated that the adsorption mechanisms of DHB, DHP, DHC and THB on MnO2 nanoparticles involved the interaction of adjacent OH groups of organic molecules with Mn ions on the particle surfaces and complexation. The deposits were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The deposition yield measurements showed that the amount of deposited material can be controlled by variation of dispersant concentration in the solutions and deposition time. The deposition mechanism and kinetics of deposition are discussed. The films prepared by EPD method are promising materials for application in electrochemical supercapacitors.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMullite is one of the most promising engineering materials for applications at elevated temperatures, but has poor mechanical properties at ambient temperature; therefore, it is usually reinforced with particles, fibres or whiskers to improve its properties. Among particles added to mullite are ZrO2 particles which improve its fracture toughness through the well known process of phase transformation from tetragonal to monoclinic in zirconia particles. The aim of the present work is to explore the utilisation of Algerian kaolin, α-Al2O3 and ZrO2 to synthesise mullite–ZrO2 composites through reaction sintering and investigate phase transformation and sintering behaviour of the composites. The raw materials were mixed through planetary ball milling followed by attrition milling. Compacted samples were sintered at temperatures between 1100 and 1600°C for 2 h. The bulk density was measured by the water immersion method. X-ray diffraction (Rietveld method) was used to characterise phases present in the sintered samples. It was found that the zirconia phase retained its tetragonal structure with the addition of up to 16% zirconia. The formation of primary mullite in all samples was complete at 1250°C. The cristobalite started to form at 1150°C, and disappeared at 1300°C in the samples of mullite, and at 1250°C when ZrO2 was added. The zircon compound ZrSiO4 started to form at 1250°C and completely disappeared at 1400°C. The increase in ZrO2 ratio promoted the formation of grains with spherical shape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Concrete is the most widely used material on earth, eclipsing the combined volumes of all other man made materials by a factor of ten. In terms of its embedded carbon, it is a benign product, being associated with relatively little CO2 per unit mass when compared with metals, glasses and polymers. Conversely, it is made in such vast quantities, that it is responsible for over five percent of anthropogenic CO2. Despite recent advances in kiln design and alternative, low energy clinkers, it seems likely that the greatest carbon savings from the industry are likely to be made by the inclusion of supplementary cementing materials. This article reviews some of the options currently under investigation, especially from the UK perspective, and highlights that some of the research needs to be satisfied before such materials are more widely adopted.",

The manipulation of the pore structures and sizes by adjusting the processing parameters was studied. Al2O3 suspensions with different viscosities were prepared by controlling the solid loadings and particle sizes. Larger lamellar pore width and thinner lamellar ceramic wall without any defect were achieved by the utilisation of microsized Al2O3 powder. Lamellar pore width, ceramic wall thickness and porosity can be tailored ranging from 12 to 49 μm, 4–26 μm and 37·4–56·2% respectively by changing the cooling rates. The incorporation of organic additives can modify not only the pore size but also the pore morphology. Double templates resulted in the coexistence of lamellar pores and large pores. The ability to produce an oriented long range ordered architecture and its manipulation flexibility indicated the potential of this method for different needs in application.",

As a result, nanosized thin films produced by direct current magnetron sputtering from the developed targets have uniform nanocrystalline or amorphous structures and superior transmittance (>90%) and low electrical resistivity. The morphology and properties of these films have been studied, depending on the film processing features.

Ordinary Portland cement and ordinary Portland cement fly ash blends were examined for comparison. The samples are exposed to solvents by immersion under static conditions. Leaching and mechanical strength tests show a wide range of geopolymer performance, depending on the initial mix design and the nature of the aggressive agent. Alkali carbonate solutions are found to be the most aggressive agent among those tested in terms of geopolymer mass and strength loss; nonetheless, the resistance to structural degradation upon carbonation of the geopolymer binder structure is mitigated to a significant extent by the low calcium content of the geopolymer binder. Less porous materials, or materials with smaller and more tortuous pores, show in many cases a markedly higher durability; porosity is shown to hold the key to durability. In traditional cement based binders, strength is lost through chemical attack upon exposure to solvents.",

The differential scanning calorimetry data show that almost no latent heat associated with phase transition can be detected in the SPS sintered ceramics. Raman spectroscopy analysis suggests that the tetragonal phase increases with increasing the grain size, and the higher content of tetragonal phase leads the superior dielectric properties in CS sintered samples. Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicates that domain structure heavily relies on the grain size of ceramics. The poor ferroelectric properties of SPS ceramics are originated from the incomplete development of the tetragonal structure.",

While different synthesis routes for processing of AlMgB14 ceramics were reported in the past, however the synthesis routes are still not optimised and present a significant challenge to the manufacturers. In this work six different synthesis routes were explored for the synthesis of AlMgB14 powder. The synthesised compositions were characterised by XRD, where weight fractions of each phase were calculated by Rietveld refinement. The bulk ceramics were sintered using powder with the highest yield (93.2%) of AlMgB14 phase by spark plasma sintering at 1315°C and 50 MPa. Both phase composition and microstructure of the sintered AlMgB14 were characterised by XRD and SEM/EDS, which revealed the existence of AlMgB14, MgAl2O4 and a small amount of unreacted Al. Hardness and indentation fracture resistance of AlMgB14 ceramics were measured to be 26.7 ± 2.2 GPa and 5.59 ± 0.42 MPa m1/2, respectively by Vickers indentation technique.",

In this study, the mechanical properties of the composite TBCs were characterised using both nanoindentation and Vicker's microhardness tests. The nanoindentation results show that both Young's modulus and nanohardness increase with increasing 8YSZ content, suggesting the mechanical properties can be tailored by changing the volume ratio of 8YSZ. The ratios of Young's modulus to nanohardness remain constant, ∼18, irrespective to the coating's composition. The microhardness results show the same dependence with 8YSZ content, which is confirmed by the analytic models based on composite theory.",

The chemical composition and mechanical properties for different types of pencils (F, 2H, 4H, 6H and 8H) were measured using X-ray diffraction, nano-indentation and a tribometer. The values for nano-indentation hardness of the pencil leads are in the range of 0.3–0.8 GPa. A higher hardness grade in the pencil lead leads to a wider error range. The clay content of the lead seems to be proportional to the hardness of the pencil lead. Different crystalline phases in clays for each grade of pencil lead result in variations in the degree and distribution of the hardness. Consequently, the content of the crystalline phases in the clay affects deviations in the hardness.",

In order to optimise the operation of cement kilns, computationally efficient thermal models are required. In this work, the development of a one-dimensional thermal model for kilns is explored. To simplify the model, the kiln is assumed to be well mixed in the transverse direction. A simultaneous mass and energy balance is solved based on a steady-state approximation. Existing semi-empirical models for heat transfer in the kiln are implemented and critically evaluated. The resulting one-dimensional model is capable of predicting axial temperature profiles in the rotary kiln which agree well with the available experimental data found in the literature. The model presented here extends from previous published models by considering a full enthalpy balance for the gas in the kiln. This allows the model to be used in a fully predictive manner, taking into account the temperature-dependent thermodynamic, transport, and radiative properties of the gas phase.",

This paper presents the in-vitro tests conducted to evaluation toxicity by cell culturing on zirconia biomaterial used in the dental implant by both direct contact and extraction method. In the present study, in-vitro assessment of tissue biocompatibility was conducted on L929 cell line (mouse fibroblast). In-vitro test, the toxicity of Zirconia specimen was done by computing percentage of viability in a cell-cultured medium. An MTT system was used to measure the active cell activities with mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which is an easy method which gives accurate and precision results. The results of biocompatibility in-vitro test by both Direct and Extraction methods confirmed that Zirconia exhibits the highest cell growth of 93.17% and resulted with zero-grade cytotoxicity.

However, typical ferroelectric behaviour, with well-saturated polarisation-electric field hysteresis loops, was observed for certain compositions at high electric field levels. It is shown using high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction that the application of the electric field induced an irreversible structural transformation from the nano-polar pseudo-cubic phase to a ferroelectric rhombohedral phase. The changes in lattice elastic strain and crystallographic texture of a poled NBT-0.02KN specimen as a function of the grain orientation, ψ, conform well to those expected for a conventional rhombohedrally distorted perovskite ferroelectric ceramic. The dielectric permittivity-temperature relationships for all compositions exhibit two transition temperatures and a frequency-dependent behaviour that is typical of a relaxor ferroelectric.

The technological properties of waste-clay bricks were analysed to evaluate the influence of the waste incorporation. The SDE (1–5 wt-%) addition in the clay matrix causes a reduction between 6 and 12% of the bulk density compared with the control samples (only clay) which implies good insulating characteristics. In addition, the waste incorporation increases the water absorption within the range 4–31% and decreases the compressive strength between 12 and 26%. However, the incorporation of the waste is beneficial as no remarkable changes in the technological properties are observed. These results indicate that the waste has a predominant pore forming effect over a pore filling effect.",

According to Young's equation, hydrophobic/oleophilic materials are theoretically simple to realise and have a wide range of applications. The hydrophobic/oleophilic membrane, however, has a poor separating effect on the mixture in which the oil has a lower density than water. Hence, to optimise the oil/water separation performance, hydrophilic modified titanium dioxide particles were introduced to a novel porous superhydrophilic/oleophobic substrate fabricated by 3D printing technology in this work. The contact angle of n-hexadecane on the membrane surface was about 130°, which was an oleophobic surface. The oil/water separation efficiency of the 0.7 mm thick oleophobic membrane was over 98% and the penetration flux was up to 11,191 L m −2 h −1 , indicating that the membranes prepared in this work might be used in high-flux oil/water separation applications.

The mechanical properties and bone-like characteristics of the prepared nanocomposites were explicated.

The SEM revealed the highly compacted and continued integrated morphological features of various shielding phases.

The phase formation and microstructure of final ceramics were observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that increasing magnesium ions content in SSBC does not change the crystal phases but increases the sintering temperature. The final phases in SSBC are pyroxenes including augite and diopside. Crystalline phases in SSBC form before densification. Substitution of Fe2+ for Mg2+ in phases would increase amount of Fe2+ in crystal, but decreases the amount in liquid, which is the main factor of the sintering temperature increase.

High purity Ti3AlC2 can be obtained from a compacted cylinder composed of TiC–Ti–1·2Al at 1350°C for 2 h, and the purity of Ti3AlC2 is nearly 96·9 wt-%. The corresponding density and compressive strength are 3·93 g·cm−3 and 377·34 MPa respectively. Ti3AlC2 grain exhibits typical plate-like structure. When aluminium melts, a mass of Al atoms diffuse to Ti grain rapidly, and Ti–Al intermetallic compounds generate. Then, Ti–Al intermetallic compounds react with TiC to form Ti3AlC2 directly. Using TiC powders as the raw materials provides Ti6C octahedra directly. At elevated temperature, a part of aluminium will evaporate and lose. This will result in that every two layers of Ti6C octahedra are linked by aluminium planes directly and Ti3AlC2 can be formed.",

The derived defect diagram, plotting the concentration of all ionic and electronic defects in TiO2 within a wide range of oxygen activity [10–15 Pa<p(O2)<105 Pa], allows to predict the effect of oxygen activity on semiconducting properties of rutile within both n- and p-type properties. This diagram may be used in the selection of processing conditions of p-type TiO2 from n-type TiO2. The present work also considers the kinetic aspects related to the imposition of defect equilibria associated with titanium vacancies.

Single-phase perovskite-type X-ray diffraction patterns were observed and samples have a phase with a tetragonal structure at room temperature for all compositions. The SEM image of the powder shows the agglomeration with increment of Mg concentrations. Small grains with average grain sizes of ∼20 ± 5 nm are uniformly distributed over the mesocrystals. TEM specimens show well-dispersed spherical barium magnesium titanate nanoparticles and diameter of these particles is around 270–300 nm. A dielectric study of Ba1-xMgxTiO3 ceramics as a function of temperature suggested that with increasing substitution concentration the dielectric constant decreased and the Curie temperature shifted towards the lower temperature side. The dielectric diffusivity (γ) was found to be maximum (1.86) for substitution of x = 0.10 in Ba1-xMgxTiO3 compounds. The activation energy (Ea) was found to increases with increasing substitution concentration in BMT compounds.",

Each sample was divided into two subgroups (n = 5). One was ground, and the other was polished by following the clinical adjustment protocol. Statistics were analysed by independent t-test to a significance level of p < .05. More material was ground off in self-glazed zirconia than in Zenostar zirconia (p < .05) during the same period, especially during the coarse grinding procedure (p < .05), whereas the grinding efficiency in fine grinding stage was not significantly different (p > .05). The polishing efficiency of the whole and of the fine polishing procedure of the two kinds of zirconia was significantly different (p < .05). It thus can be concluded that grinding and polishing efficiency of a novel self-glazed zirconia is significantly higher than that of the conventional Zenostar zirconia.",

The infiltration height of molten metals within capillary systems depends on the measured contact angles and viscosity as well as the different phases present in the preform, matrix and fibre coating. In order to successfully maintain mechanical performance, minimal reactivity between the melt and coating/fibres is desired.

The results show that waste additions below ∼10 wt-% result in no significant change in bricks properties; waste additions above ∼20 wt-% and a slightly higher firing temperature enable the manufacture of higher grade building products (tiles). The waste changes roles from inert to fluxing at 10–20 wt-% owing to the change of compatibility triangles in the phase diagram.

The phase composition examined by X-ray diffraction showed that mullite was the major phase combined with developed t-ZrO 2 and m-ZrO 2 phase as a function of zirconia content, especially at 1600°C, wherein m-ZrO 2 predominated. Density increased when the zirconia content and sintering temperature were increased ranging from 2·2 to 3·53 g cm −3 . The morphology of mullite grain showed elongated grains, whereas dispersed zirconia showed equiaxed and intergranular grains. Flexural strength was continuously improved by adding zirconia during the sintering temperature ranging from 1400 to 1500°C, whereas flexural strength was initially improved up to 5 wt-% of zirconia addition and deteriorated with more than 5 wt-% of zirconia content during sintering between 1550 and 1600°C. The maximum strength, 190 MPa, was obtained when sintering mullite with 30 wt-% of zirconia content at 1500°C. The degradation of strength at high sintering temperature may be a result from more occurrence of m-ZrO 2 phase. Thermal expansion of sintered specimens indicated linear change and hysteresis loop change. The hysteresis loop obtained with increased zirconia content resulted in the t–m phase transformation. Martensitic start temperature M s was determined to be 530°C for 15 wt-% zirconia sintered at 1500°C, implying that the t–m phase transformation occurred.",

Secondary phases, microstructures and properties of the AlN ceramics were studied. When the AlN ceramics are sintered at 1650 or 1675°C, CaO and Y2O3 from the sintering additives react with Al2O3 in the AlN powder to generate CaAl4O7 and Y3Al5O12. Part of Y3Al5O12 reacts with CaO and Al2O3 to form CaYAl3O7 at 1700°C. At 1800°C, CaYAl3O7 decomposes into CaAl4O7 and Y3Al5O12. Finally, CaAl4O7 volatilises and only Y3Al5O12 remains. As the sintering temperature increases, the AlN grains grow continuously and the bending strength and thermal conductivity of the AlN ceramics increase first and then decrease. The AlN ceramics sintered at 1700°C are fully dense and have the highest bending strength and thermal conductivity of 373·7 MPa and 136·7 W m−1 K−1 in this work.",

    "abstract": "In heat and power production, oil shale combustion forms substantial amounts of solid waste, including fly ash. The present paper is dedicated to the manufacturing of frit derived glass ceramics from melting high amounts of this waste (65–67 wt-%) combined with inexpensive minerals, such as rhyolite (33–35 wt-%). Owing to a surface mechanism of crystallisation, fine powders led to glass ceramics with high strength and reliability, even for rapid treatments (fast heating, at a rate of 40°C min−1, followed by 30 min holding stage). To minimise the presence of pressing and demoulding induced defects, the tiles were prepared by incorporating binders, i.e. polyethylene glycol or kaolin, to the frit mixtures. Finally, the stabilising effect of recycled borosilicate glass powders, mixed with waste derived glass powders, was also investigated with promising results for the production of a chemically stable material.",

    "abstract": "To understand the service behaviour of SiC fibres, the effects of ambient environment and temperature on the microstructure, mechanical property and oxidation behaviour of these fibres were investigated. The result shows that, the surface of SiC fibres becomes rough after exposure in air from 973 to 1573 K due to the formation of small SiO2 particles, and a smooth SiO2 film will be formed on the SiC fibre at 1773 K. In Ar atmosphere, SiC fibres will change into clusters of large SiC crystals after heat treatment for 2 h at 2373 K. The tensile strength of SiC fibres decreased by 66 and 95% when the fibres were exposed at 1773 K for 5 min in air and 2373 K for 2 h in Ar, respectively. This degradation is associated with the evaporation of CO and SiO from the fibres as well as with SiC grain growth in the fibres.",

Understanding the behaviour of the oxides that can result from oxidation of metal borides and carbides at very high temperatures is essential to optimise and tailor the performance of these materials; yet experimental thermodynamic and structural data for refractory oxides above 2000°C are mostly absent. The following techniques that can be applied to fill this gap are discussed: (i) commercial ultra-high-temperature differential thermal analysis for investigation of phase transformations and melting in inert environments to 2500°C, (ii) a combination of laser heating with a splittable nozzle aerodynamic levitator for splat quenching and drop calorimetry from temperatures limited only by sample evaporation, (iii) synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction on laser-heated aerodynamically levitated oxide samples for in situ observation of phase transformations in variable atmospheres, refinement of high-temperature structures and thermal expansion. Recent experimental findings include anomalous thermal expansion of the defect fluorite phase of YSZ, thermodynamics of pyrochlore–fluorite transformation from high-temperature structure refinements, and measurement of thermal expansion to the melting temperatures and fusion enthalpies of Zr, Hf, La, Yb and Lu oxides. These methods provide temperatures, enthalpies and volume change for phase transformations above 2000°C, which are required for thermodynamic assessments and calculation of phase diagrams of multicomponent systems.",

The compacted powders were sintered at three temperatures i.e. 1450°°C, 1500°C and 1550°C for an optimised duration of 5 h and they have exhibited well resolved morphotropic phase boundary with an average grain size ranging from 10 to 25 µm.

A maximum strain of around ∼0.14% was obtained which is comparable to that of lead-based piezoelectrics. Variation of relative permittivity with temperature revealed that the curves are independent of frequency, indicating the typical relaxor ferroelectric nature of the samples. A systematic study on cyclic loading was performed to evaluate piezo-electro-mechanical coefficients at different loads which showed hysteresis behaviour. High value of elastic modulus (E) and hardness (H) i.e. 262.7 ± 38.1 GPa and 13.7 ± 1.7 GPa were exhibited by samples sintered at 1450°C, which is higher than that of BCZT synthesised by wet-chemical methods.

In the present paper, material removal characteristics of reaction-bonded silicon carbide (RB-SiC) and pressureless sintered silicon carbide (S-SiC) were investigated by ultra-precision grinding experiments. #120, #600, #2000 and #12000 diamond cup wheel were employed for coarse, semi-finished, fine and finish grinding, respectively. The surface topographies, surface morphologies and grinding grooves were measured. The results indicated that there are distinguishing material removal characteristics between RB-SiC and S-SiC, and #2000 diamond wheel can be chosen as the final grinding wheel for most high-performance SiC ceramic products.

Experimental results demonstrated that materials with solid-state reaction temperature of 850°C exhibited the lowest value of activation energy, 577.6 kJ mol−1. When the solid-state reaction temperature was lower than 800°C, reaction could not be perfectly completed, which would hinder the consolidation process during heating up. In addition, increased solid-state reaction temperature could facilitate the homogeneous grain growth, reduce the final grain size and improve DC-bias superposition characteristic.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the effect of rice husk ash (RHA), as silicate impurities, on the microstructure and mechanical properties of calcium aluminate cement concrete (CACC) is explored. Various mechanical tests, including tests for obtaining the compressive, splitting tensile, flexural strengths and elastic modulus, were performed on different mixture designs containing different volume percentages of RHA (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10%) at W/Cs of 0.4 and 0.5. Furthermore, the impact of RHA on the microstructure of this concrete was examined through careful analysis of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results. The results demonstrate that, At W/C of 0.5, the microstructure and mechanical properties were improved, with the greatest improvement for the RHA substitution percentage of 5%. However, at W/C of 0.4, the addition of RHA showed no positive effect, which can be attributed to a higher specific surface area of RHA than cement.",

    "abstract": "Porous hydrophobic ceramic membranes have been increasingly applied in advanced membrane-based separation processes such as Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD) due to their higher chemical and mechanical resistances. The development of novel ceramic membranes enhanced with porosity is based on conventional techniques such as extrusion and tape casting, and unique processing such as dry–wet spinning and vacuum filtration. The relationships between shaping and surface hydrophobization related to the membrane structure, properties and performance of the ceramic membrane applied to DCMD are explained in this work. The manufacturing technique influences the membrane characteristics, and consequently the permeability in DCMD. Recent research is focused on manufacturing high porous hollow fibre ceramic membranes by dry–wet spinning. In contrast to the grafting of alkylsilanes, the chemical vapour deposition process has been applied as an effective surface modifying technique to enhance membrane hydrophobicity. Ceramic membranes are mostly applied to desalination in DCMD and have been little researched concerning the unique properties they can offer, such as superhydrophobicity and use in a harsh environment. In addition to the review of manufacturing techniques, polymer-derived ceramic (PDC) is proposed as a one-step ceramic membrane processing route for DCMD. Although only a handful of works addressed the use of PDC membranes applied to DCMD, the great potential of these materials is forecast.",

The powders were uniaxially pressed and were subjected to flash sintering at 850°C in a tube furnace under a DC bias using various current densities. It is evidenced that control of the flash electric current is a crucial factor for densification of Al-LLZO. The sample sintered in 50 V cm −1 and 200 mA mm −2 showed a cubic LLZO, 94 ± 0.4% relative density, 0.37 mS cm −1 total ionic conductivity and 0.32 eV activation energy. In addition, it was demonstrated that increasing the current density had a considerable impact on the relative density. This outstanding ionic conductivity might be due to the lower lithium loss and higher density as a result of flash sintering method applied.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAbstractA new route to interfacial bonding between ceramic and matrix in biocomposites is identified. A tailored allyl phosphonic acid is used as a coupling agent bound to the surface of a bioceramic to form a 'grafted' calcium phosphate (CAP). The allyl phosphonic acid coupling agent is synthesised by reaction of allyl halide and trialkyl phosphite. Successful synthesis was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The allyl phosphonic acid was incorporated onto calcium phosphate using a wet chemical coprecipitation synthesis route. The resulting 'grafted' CAP was characterised using FTIR coupled with photoacoustic sampling, and Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy (FTR). The spectroscopic data suggest an interaction between the allyl phosphonic acid and calcium phosphate resulting from observed reductions in intensity of the hydroxyl (3570 cm−1) and phosphate ν 3 (1030 cm−1) peaks. The continued presence of C=C functionality on the surface of the grafted CAP was indicated by FTIR and FTR spectra (peaks at 1650 and 1635 cm−1 respectively) and confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). On the basis of these results, it is concluded that grafted CAP may be used to produce a chemically bonded composite with superior mechanical properties.Keywords: CALCIUM PHOSPHATECOMPOSITECOUPLING AGENTFTIRSURFACE GRAFTINGSURFACE MODIFICATION",

MgO was added at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 wt-% to kaolin and alumina and the powders were ball milled for 5 h then uniaxially compacted at 75 MPa and finally sintered at 1500, 1550, 1600 and 1650°C for 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. It was found that addition of MgO not only affected mullite formation but also promoted grain growth. For samples containing 0, 1 and 2 wt-%MgO only mullite was formed. While, in addition to mullite, Al2O3 was present in sample containing 3 wt-%MgO. At higher MgO content (4, 5 and 6 wt-%), three phases, i.e. mullite, Al2O3 and spinel, were formed. Addition of 1 wt-%MgO increased the density of all samples for all sintering times and higher densities corresponded to higher sintering temperatures. At higher MgO content, higher temperatures led to lower densities and lower temperatures led to higher densities for almost all sintering times.",

The electrochemical activity of methanol oxidation reaction on synthesised Pt–CeO2/CB anodes was investigated. To develop this anode, the influence of surface area of CeO2 particles in Pt–CeO2/CB on anode properties was examined. The anode properties (i.e. onset potential and peak current density) were improved using fine CeO2 particles with high surface area. This indicates that higher activity on surface of CeO2 improves the anode properties. The anode properties on Pt high surface area CeO2/CB was better than that on Pt–Tin oxide(SnO2)/CB or Pt–Ru/carbon. The authors suggest that the rate determining steps of methanol oxidation reaction on Pt–CeO2/CB and other anodes such as Pt–SnO2/CB and Pt–Ru/carbon are different which accounts for the difference in performance. Therefore, it is concluded that a design of active surface of CeO2 is a key for development of Pt–CeO2/CB anode in polymer membrane fuel cells.Keywords: DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELLPT-CEO2ANODEMETHANOL OXIDATIONONSET POTENTIALCURRENT DENSITY",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed single phase polycrystalline ceramic having layered hexagonal crystal structure [lattice parameters a = 5·437(7) Å, c = 9·073(7) Å]. Fourier transform infrared results support perovskite phase. Field emission scanning electron microscopy reveals dense polycrystalline (1-9 μm) microstructure and TEM/SAED pattern exhibits excellent correlation with the hexagonal structure in good agreement with XRD results. Thermal analysis in oxygen medium indicated intrinsic oxygen non-stoichiometry in the sample with δ ∼0·12 under thermally activated condition with T1065°C. Complex impedance spectroscopy (CIS) results on electrical properties confirmed both the bulk (grain) and grain boundary contribution in different temperature ranges. An equivalent electrical circuit model using CIS response suggests cascading of parallel resistance-capacitance ('RC') combination in agreement with 'brick layer model'. Direct current conductivity obeys thermally activated Arrhenius behaviour. Substantial conductivity enhancement (about five orders) occurs at 700°C when compared with ambient conductivity ∼10−8. Activation energy (∼1·0 eV) suggests intergranular activity due to O2− ion migration via diffusion through lattice vacancy.Keywords: Oxygen deficiencyMicrostructureGrain boundaryComplex impedanceConductivity",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe pressureless sintering behaviour of gelcast zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) containing the total 5 wt-% additives of MgO and TiO2 was investigated. The effects of four combinations of MgO and TiO2 on the bulk properties, morphology and phase composition of the ZTA composites were evaluated in comparison with pure ZTA in the temperature range of 1150–1600°C. Four combinations of MgO and TiO2 initiated effective densification and enhancement at 1450°C, as indicated by the relative density and three-point bending strength measurements and fracture morphological observations by using scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed that the difference in the bending strength among four groups of ZTA composites was due to the MgO dependent formation of minor MgAl2O4 and TiO2 induced polymorphic transformation of tetragonal phase to monoclinic ZrO2. These results are useful to further develop dental ceramics, including glass infiltrated ZTA.",

Starting from the governing equations of the problem, an equivalent circuit of a ZnO NW working in quasi-static 33 mode is established. It takes into account the semiconducting properties of the NW and the effect of the Schottky contact between the tip of the NW and an electrode. Such a circuit model is expected to become a valuable tool to evaluate the performances of NWs as active elements in integrated systems. As an application, a microgenerator based on an NW array under a compressive strain has been modelled. The influence of the electrode material and the NW dimensions on the microgenerator performances is investigated. It is shown that the NW aspect ratio is of critical importance to achieve a high efficient energy conversion.",

Size of particles and dispersivity were controlled by varying the surfactant chain length and temperature conditions of the reaction mixture. Silica nanoparticles were synthesised using a series of non-ionic surfactants, namely Polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) and Polyoxyethylene (80) sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), at different reaction temperatures of 25, 50, 70 and 90°C. The particle size of silica nanoparticles gradually decreased with increasing carbon chain length of the surfactant and at higher temperature particle size became larger. Furthermore, these silica nanoparticles are incorporated into the cementitious system to improve the mechanical properties and reduce calcium leaching in the hydration process. Addition of silica nanoparticles into cement paste improves the microstructure of the paste, and calcium leaching is significantly reduced as silica nanoparticles react with calcium hydroxide, thereby forming a denser calcium–silicate–hydrate gel structure. Synthesised silica nanoparticles and microstructure of cement paste incorporated with silica nanoparticles were analysed using scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy (IR), 29Si MAS NMR and thermogravimetry analysis for morphological and mineralogical attributes.",

This study investigated the use of three-dimensional powder printing technology to form calcium phosphate brackets, previously used for forming bespoke scaffold geometries, to 95±0·1% accuracy of their original computer aided design. The surface and internal structures of the printed samples were characterised both chemically and morphologically and compared with hand moulded cements in the dry state and after 3 days of immersion in phosphate buffered saline. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and SEM all showed the presence of brushite in the hand moulded samples and brushite and monetite within the printed samples. Furthermore, the printed structures have a higher level of porosity in the dry state in comparison to the hand moulded samples (36±2·2% compared to 24±0·7%) despite exhibiting a compressive strength of almost double the hand cast material. Although the compressive strength of the printed cements decreases after the 3 day immersion, there was no significant difference between the printed and hand moulded cements under the same conditions. Three-dimensional powder printing technology has enabled the manufacture of bespoke calcium phosphate brackets with properties similar to those reported for hand moulded cements.",

Shaping from thixotropic slurries containing particles of various sizes allows processing complex large sized (up to 1 m diameter and height) components for structural applications. This versatile technology that does not require expensive and complicated equipment was successfully applied for manufacturing silicon carbide based large size ceramic components. Heterogeneous SiC based ceramics with additives, such as Al2O3, Si3N4, mullite and some others, have been developed and commercially manufactured using thixotropic casting. The developed composition and processing are based on the oxide bonding mechanism. The structure and some physical properties of SiC based ceramics, e.g. wear resistance, are described. The manufactured components are successfully used for the mentioned applications in mineral, mining, oil and gas processes, power generation, metallurgy and some other areas. This paper summarises the principles of formation of oxide bonded SiC based ceramic large size components using thixotropic casting, which is the result of the development and processing of obtained ceramics in industrial conditions conducted during a number of years and their industrial applications.",

The current carrying friction and wear characteristics of high pure bulk Ti3AlC2 dry sliding against a GCr15 bearing steel disc were experimentally investigated on a pin-on-disk type tester at several sliding speeds from 20 to 60 m s−1, different electric currents from 0 to 100 A and normal pressures from 0·1 to 0·6 MPa. It was found that the highly pure Ti3AlC2 exhibits an increasing friction coefficient (0·11–0·65) and an increasing wear rate (2·13–7·75×10−6 mm3 N−1 m−1) with the electric current increasing from 0 to 100 A; the normal pressure (0·1–0·6 MPa) and the sliding speed (20–60 m s−1) also have a complex but relatively weak influence on them. The minimum value of friction coefficient was 0·11 when the sliding electric current, speed and normal pressure were set to 0 A, 60 m s−1 and 0·6 MPa; the wear rate reached the maximum value 7·75×10−6 mm3 N−1 m −1 when the sliding electric current, speed and normal pressure respectively were set to 100 A, 60 m s−1 and 0·6 MPa. The low friction coefficient can be attributed to the presence of a continuous frictional oxide film consisting of an amorphous mixture of Al, Ti and Fe oxides on the friction surface, which have a significant antifriction effect on the friction surfaces. The percentage of oxide film cover was relatively higher when the electric current was 0 A, while the percentage of oxide film cover decreased with increasing electric current. The increase in the wear rate was ascribed to the ablation of the electric arc when the electric current was high.",

The results showed that the proppants sintered at 1260°C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5°C min–1 under air atmosphere exhibited high crush resistance and low density, with the breakage ratio of 8.5% under 52 MPa closure pressure and bulk density of 1.65 g cm–3. The proppants prepared by bauxite, waste ceramic sands and sintering aids are promising candidates as high-intensity and low-density fracturing proppants in future applications.",

    "abstract": "In order to reduce the sintering temperature and enhance the piezoelectricity, a small amount of CuO was added into BaTiO3 during sintering. The aging behaviours of these CuO modified BaTiO3 ceramics were studied systematically. For unpoled ceramic, the P–E loop changes gradually from a normal single-loop curve to a double-loop one with aging. Meanwhile, the S–E loop develops gradually from a normal strain curve to the one with almost zero strain under electric field below 10 kV mm–1. For poled ceramic, it builds a much stronger and more stable internal bias after aging. The P–E loops shift significantly along the electric field and the strain loop shows high asymmetry with one side of high linearity. A dipolar defect model was proposed to explain these aging behaviours. The defect dipoles consisting of Cu2+ occupying B site and oxygen vacancy can reorientate gradually with time to align with the spontaneous polarisation. Then the aligned defect dipoles could provide a strong restoring force on the domain wall motion and thus lead to all the observed aging behaviours.",

Boron carbide was obtained by direct synthesis from chemical elements using amorphous boron and carbon black. By mechanical dispersion, solid reagents were converted into an ultrafine state. Using a chemical method, nanoscale (70–80 nm) boron carbide was synthesised from suspension solutions of amorphous boron and liquid hydrocarbons. Boron carbide-based metal-ceramic composite powder B4C–(Co–Ni–Ti) was obtained by mechanical dispersion of the constituent components. Based on results of studying of the temperature-dependence of wetting angle of boron carbide with Co–Ni–Ti metallic alloy, the compacting modes of metal-ceramic composite powders by plasma-spark sintering and hot pressing have been developed. The influence of the component content of the binder metal (alloy) on some physico-mechanical properties (linear expansion coefficient, hardness, and bending strength) of hardmetal-ceramic materials based on boron carbide was studied. It was found that the optimum content of the metal component in the composite is ∼ 25 wt-%. In the temperature range 300–600°C, the materials obtained are characterised by stable dimensional factors, since in this temperature range the thermal conductivity coefficient does not depend much on temperature. At room temperature, their bending strength is about 1 GPa. A new method of chemical synthesis of nanocrystalline ceramic compositions of boron carbide and titanium diboride using suspension solutions for the preparation of powders and their spark plasma sintering was also developed to obtain a compacted material of composition B4C+30 wt-%TiB2, which has a high hardness of 95 HRA (with maximum microhardness 45.6 GPa) and sufficient strength (with a bending strength of 834 MPa).",

It was found that the Ti3SiC2 sample exhibits an increasing friction coefficient (0·15–0·71) and an increasing wear rate (0·91–4·69×10−6 mm3 N−1 m−1) with the electric current increasing from 0 to 60 A; the normal pressure (0·1–0·6 MPa) and the sliding speed (5–50 m s−1) also have a complex but relatively weak influence on them. The changes can be attributed to the presence of a frictional oxide film consisting of an amorphous mixture of Si, Ti and Fe oxides on the friction surface. The oxide film was formed, and the percentage of coverage was relatively higher when the electric current was 0 A. The oxide film could be formed, but the percentage of coverage was decreased with the increase in electric current. Few of the oxides were generated, and almost no oxide film was formed in the friction surface when the electric current was 60 A.

Many studies have reported the densification of SiC using oxide and nonoxide additives such as the Al2O3, B4C and Al–B–C system. However, it is difficult to densify SiC at temperatures below 2000°C without sintering additives even if spark plasma sintering (SPS) is used. The authors attempted to densify SiC using colloidal processing and SPS without sintering additives. A commercially available SiC powder with the average particle size of 0·55 μm was used as the starting material. The densities of the green body prepared by slip casting and the sintered body by SPS were 65·5 and 98·7% respectively.",

    "abstract": "Ceramics with perovskite-type structure and 0.94(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3–0.06BaTiO3 (BNBT) composition have been studied by conventional powder X-ray diffraction in Bragg–Brentano geometry. Ceramics were obtained from sol–gel autocombustion nanopowders and processed either by hot pressing and subsequent recrystallisation or pressureless sintering in two steps. These methods provided single-phase, sub-micron grain size (<700 nm), dense ceramics with good piezoelectric performance (96–94% of theoretical density and d33 = 143–124 pC N–1, respectively). For the considered ceramics, the splitting of the peaks of the cubic perovskite-type structure with 111 and 200 Miller indices has been repeatedly used as a symmetry identification criterion. In this work a simple, yet powerful, procedure to validate the consistency of the mentioned splitting interpretation is presented. Based on peaks fitting and well-known crystallographic expressions, the rhombohedral and tetragonal symmetries' coexistence is verified. The suggested procedure can be applied to the study of peak splitting in ceramics at Morphotropic Phase Boundaries in a general way. In a given series of BNBT ceramics, inconsistencies for interplanar distances, intensities' ratios and the evolution of these from not-poled to poled samples have been found. In poled ceramics, special care has been taken when carrying out this analysis, due to the anisotropic strains arising from ferroelectric (FE) domain orientation. Poling gives rise to a displacement of the peaks angular positions and modification of the intensity ratios. However, the interplanar distance changes associated with the angular deviations here observed are one order of magnitude higher than those expected from anisotropic strains. These results set up a doubt on the sufficiency of the [rhombohedral + tetragonal] model to characterise the considered ceramics. A model of a mesoscopic FE phase with rhombohedral symmetry, a mesoscopic and globally weakly polar phase, with cubic symmetry, and a nanosised phase, also cubic, is presented as a plausible alternative.",

As 'passive filler', wollastonite preceramised powders as well as commercially available wollastonite fibres were added. Their presence reduces the gas evolution occurring due to the decomposition of the calcium carbonate active filler and the polymer-to-ceramic conversion, reducing the stresses that generate in the component during heating. The resulting samples exhibited improvements in terms of the morphology and the mechanical strength, with respect to samples not containing any passive fillers, without significant modification of the final phase assemblage.",

This was achieved by using a notch (0.5 mm deep and 1.5 mm wide) located in the middle of a dog-bone specimen, allowing an uneven current distribution (ranging from 3 to 670 mA mm−2) while maintaining a fairly homogeneous temperature (1420–1500 °C). Microstructure observations nearby the notch tip confirmed localised overheating. The modelling approach decoupled thermal and electrical field effects identifying the long questioned athermal electric field effects in flash sintering. Increased current density seems to weakly restrain grain growth, to accelerate densification, to promote defects healing (i.e. notch, cracks and pores) and inter-particle bond formation. These results could rationalise the athermal effects occurring during FS and flash joining.",

Firstly, the calcined laterites were partially replaced with volcanic ash before activation in the ideal alkaline and acid solutions to obtain inorganic polymer composites. Secondly, reverse replacements and activations were achieved. The results have shown that both the reactive phase content in the aluminosilicates along with the presence of certain oxides (Fe 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 ) are the main parameters that influence the optimization of the characteristics of the obtained composites. Hence, the partial replacement of calcined laterites by volcanic ash is detrimental to the properties of the obtained products. Compressive strength reduces averagely by 57.6% and 36.7%, respectively for alkaline and acid-activated inorganic aluminosilicate polymers obtained by substituting calcined laterites with up to 50% volcanic ash. Conversely, partial replacement of volcanic ash with calcined laterites leads to 28 days compressive strength increase from 2.0 to 12.2 MPa (alkaline medium) and from 12.5 to 23.9 MPa (acidic medium). To get the best earthen building materials, activation of calcined laterite/volcanic ash mixtures is more effective in acidic medium than in alkaline one. Also, to obtain reliable products, only an aluminosilicate material with greater reactive phase content should be used as a substitute to partially replace the one with lesser reactive phase, not the reverse.",

The results show that the layer thickness achieved via the XY method surpasses that of the X-Y method, albeit not by a factor of two. The disparity in cured thickness diminished as the scanning speed increased. The dimensional deviation in the X-Y method was less than that in the XY method in both length and width, with a parallel trend observed in height measurements.

Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was employed as the silicon source, while dextrin, sucrose and glucose were tested as carbon sources. The effects of key synthesis parameters – calcination temperature, insulation time and carbon-to-silicon (C/Si) ratio – on the formation of SiC were systematically investigated. The synthesised powders were characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine phase composition, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) to analyse microstructure and morphology and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to assess elemental composition and oxygen content. Optimal synthesis conditions were achieved using dextrin as the carbon source with a C/Si ratio of 2. Under flowing argon (Ar) protection, the precursor was fully converted to SiC after calcination at 1500 °C for 180 minutes. The final product exhibited a pure SiC phase with no detectable impurities. The powder had an average crystallite size of 32 nm, a sphericity of 0.85, and an oxygen content of approximately 4%. This work demonstrates the feasibility of producing high-purity, ultra-fine SiC powder with controlled properties through a sol–gel and carbothermal reduction approach, highlighting the importance of precursor selection and process optimisation.",

Polymer infiltrated ceramic network samples were fabricated by infiltration of the methyl methacrylate monomer into the silica porous structure, followed by polymerisation at an elevated temperature. The porous structure of the sintered blocks were analysed using different models including the BET, BJH, t-plot, a s -plot, Horvath–Kawazoe and excess surface work. The results showed that the pores formed in the blocks are interconnected in a slit-like form that are necessary for the formation of the dual network structure. The results of the excess surface work model showed that due to the doping, the change of the chemical potential of the surface (Δ μ 0 ) and consequently the excess surface work ( φ ) decrease due to the increase of the polar functional groups (OH groups) attached to the surface of the nano-SiO 2 . The significant increase of the surface functional groups was also confirmed by IR spectroscopy. XRD patterns revealed that the addition of 1.0 wt% of an Al 2 O 3 dopant to the nano-SiO 2 and its sintering did not produce a crystalline phase and finally resulted in the formation of the transparent polymer infiltrated ceramic network. It was also found that the Vickers hardness of the polymer infiltrated ceramic network samples reinforced with Al 2 O 3 or ZrSiO 4 with a polymer content of 41 and 39 wt% was in the range of 2.5–3.4 and 3.9–4.1 Gpa, respectively, which were comparable to the human tooth enamel.",

There is general agreement that oxygen may be incorporated efficiently into the lattice of zirconia at the triphase boundary (TPB), which is formed by the gas phase, zirconia oxygen ion conductor and electronic conductor. Thus, a number of efforts have been made to understand the effect of the TPB structure on the oxidation mechanism. Although it is clear that the TPB is required for efficient charge transfer at high current, there is a growing number of reports to the effect that oxygen may be incorporated into zirconia in the absence of the TPB. As a result, attempts have been made to develop zirconia for use in electrodeless zirconia-based electrochemical devices.Keywords: CHARGE TRANSFERELECTRODELESS DEVICESOXIDATIONTRIPHASE BOUNDARYYTTRIA-STABILISED ZIRCONIA",

It has been found that Pb doped samples present a worse texture when compared with the undoped ones, resulting in a drastic change on the microstructure. The results showed that electrical resistivity at room temperature, critical current as well as flexural strength are decreasing for the Pb doped samples. When Ag is added to these Pb doped samples, all the properties are improved even if they do not reach the same values as the undoped ones. On the other hand, it has been found that Pb doped samples showed E–I curves with very high sharpness values on the zone of the superconducting to normal transition, reaching n values (E∼In) as high as 45 at 65 K, for samples with simultaneous Pb and Ag additions.",

The phase and composition, mechanical properties and microstructure of the composites and possible molecular interactions between both components were evaluated. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that calcium carbonate was mainly composed of aragonite and calcite. Compression tests confirmed the composites prepared by this sequential method had good mechanical properties and that the compressive strength of the composites increased with higher content of calcium carbonate. PVA formed an interconnected network and needle-like CaCO3 crystals together with some fine grains were well compatible with PVA. In situ synthesis induced a spectral shift of hydroxyl groups and C–O bonds of PVA and the suppression of the characteristic adsorption of calcite was also observed, according to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements.",

    "abstract": "Owing to their stimulating effects on bone cells, ceramics are identified as expressly promising materials for fabrication of tissue engineering (TE) scaffolds. To ensure the mechanical competence of TE scaffolds, it is of central importance to understand the impact of pore shape and volume on the mechanical behaviour of the scaffolds, also under complex loading states. Therefore, the theory of continuum micromechanics is used as basis for a material model predicting relationships between porosity and elastic/strength properties. The model, which mathematically expresses the mechanical behaviour of a ceramic matrix (based on a glass system of the type SiO2–P2O5–CaO–MgO–Na2O–K2O; called CEL2) in which interconnected pores are embedded, is carefully validated through a wealth of independent experimental data. The remarkably good agreement between porosity based model predictions for the elastic and strength properties of CEL2-based porous scaffolds and corresponding experimentally determined mechanical properties underlines the great potential of micromechanical modelling for speeding up the biomaterial and tissue engineering scaffold development process—by delivering reasonable estimates for thematerial behaviour, also beyond experimentally observed situations.",

Multiblock copolymers containing poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) (30 wt-%) as hard segment and dilinoleic acid (DLA) as soft segment were prepared in the presence of two concentrations of TiO2 particles (23 nm diameter) as nanofiller (0˙2 and 0˙4 wt-%) via in situ polycondensation process. Changes of thermal properties as well as investigations of topography of these nanocomposites suggest that addition of small amount of TiO2 nanoparticles resulted in higher crystallinity and roughness of the copolymer surface. Incubation in simulated body fluid (SBF) increased the roughness of all copolymers characterised by root mean square (rms) values; however, no hydroxyapatite layer was formed on the samples surface. The highest difference of rms values was found for the neat PET/DLA material. The addition of nanocrystalline TiO2 seems to prevent the material surface from calcification which represents a positive effect when such nanocomposite is intended for medical applications, especially for uses in contact with soft tissue.",

The formulation of mortars was based on rheology and flow table measurements, applying a design of mixture experiments. Entrained air, fresh apparent density, setting time, temperature of hydration as well as the compressive strength, water absorption and apparent porosity of samples cured for 28 days were determined. The use of mixture design restricts the number of formulations. However, all tested mixtures exhibited suitable workability. When diatomite is added, the yield stress, initial plastic viscosity and the entrained air increased, while other properties decreased. In addition, the compressive strength of mortars was above 30 MPa, and the results showed that the level of influence of diatomite will depend on the water content of the mixtures.",

Limestone samples were investigated for their bulk density, apparent porosity, crushing strength, microstructure and chemical composition by applying transmitted light microscopy, SEM and X-ray fluorescence methods respectively. The samples were calcined for 0·25–1 h at 800–950°C. The activation energy of calcination was calculated from the Arrhenius equation. Triple junction fractures detected after calcination are mainly attributed to euhedral–subhedral calcite crystals in the sparite matrices of their limestone samples. Samples with higher 'grain' content and lower bulk density show relatively lower activation energy and rate of lime crystallite growth. This is due to the original 'grain' channel pores and the formation of triple junction fractures during calcination, which facilitate transfer of hot gases and diffusivity of the evolved CO2. It is finally concluded that calcination of limestone is a temperature, chemical and microstructure dependent process.",

The authors present a simple model describing both promotion and competition of the piezoelectric and electrostriction contributions, as well as increase in the transducer constant under high voltage excitation. Enlargement of the inverse transducer constant of the polypropylene ferroelectret film by a factor of 4 was demonstrated. The non-linear properties of the polypropylene ferroelectrets result in a strong increase in their ACUS figure of merit under the high voltage excitation, which exceeds the results of their technological optimisation. Consequently, enhancement of the ACUS system transmission by 12 dB and signal to noise ratio by 32 dB was achieved.",

High viscous geopolymer paste was prepared using standard grade metakaolin dissolved in potassium hydroxide/potassium silicate solution (volume ratio, 1∶1). The alkalinity of the solution was predetermined to optimise the dissolution of amorphous aluminosilicate. Quartz sand and alumina (25, 50 and 75 wt-%) were successively introduced as filler to form refractory concretes. RGPS4, RGPS2 and RGPS34 for sand and RGPA4, RGPA2 and RGPA34 for alumina were produced. The samples obtained were cured in sealed plastic containers for 7 days at room temperature before sintering at 200, 800, 1000, 1100 and 1200°C. The heating rate was 5°C min−1, and the dwelling time at peak temperature completes the sintering time to 4 h. Unvaried mechanical strength, up to 800°C, was observed: ∼25 MPa for biaxial and ∼20 MPa for uniaxial four-point bending strengths. This behaviour was ascribed to the maintenance of the structure of the geopolymer materials within the temperature interval considered. Above this temperature, all the samples presented significant densification; the most important increase in mechanical strength was ∼65 and ∼60 MPa respectively for biaxial and uniaxial four-point bending strengths. This was accompanied by a decrease in porosity. The dense structures observed at 1000–1100°C were affected by a further increase in temperature. Microcracks, vitrification and deformation appeared at 1200°C, which can be considered as detrimental to the mechanical properties. The mechanical properties and the microstructural evolution were found to be influenced by the amount of fillers added. Si and Al rich geopolymer concretes were found promising for the development of potential thermoresistant materials through the cold process.",

The HA polymer has also a promising effect on cement injectability, which is more considerable in high molecular weight HA.

In the present work, the use of in-house glass (BN1, 30Bi2O3–30Nb2O5–30B2O3–10SiO2, mol.-%) as an aid to reduce the sintering temperature of barium neodymium titanate (BNT, Ba4Nd9·33Ti18O54) ceramics is studied. The addition of 10 wt-% BN1 glass to BNT (BNT-10BN1) resulted in a 150°C decrease in sintering temperature of BNT. However, the glass reacted with the BNT ceramic and formed an unknown pyrochlore structured phase, which resulted in a decrease in ϵr from ∼80 to ∼73, Qf0 from 8400 to 2800 GHz and τf from ∼65 to 40 MK−1. ϵr, Q and τf further decreased when 20 wt-% BN1 glass was added to BNT ceramics.

In this study, low-yttria compositions were investigated. The ceramics were prepared with two sintering methods namely spark plasma sintering (SPS) and pressureless sintering. A clear tendency was noted for the indentation toughness increase with the reduction of yttria content, and a higher toughness achieved in as-SPSed samples in comparison with the annealed samples. The origins of the increased toughness were discussed in terms of yttria content, carbon contamination and increased oxygen vacancies after sintering at reducing atmosphere in SPS.",

The corrosion behaviour of ceramic filter materials in contact with different biomass ashes under simulated gasification conditions was investigated for aluminium oxide, based SiC with mullite filter layer and mullite based filter candles. Analyses by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy show the influence of potassium on filter candle materials.",

    "abstract": "The development of novel oxides, nanocomposites and architectures is in demand for the direct conversion of solar energy into other forms of energy, such as chemical and electrical energy. Especially, those oxides and devices, which can be used for photolysis of water (hydrogen and oxygen evolution) and for water purification, are of interest. So far, semiconducting oxides such as TiO2, Fe2O3, WO3, SrTiO3, tantalates and niobates are the only class of materials which have shown high stability as photoelectrodes towards corrosion in the rate limiting step in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under illumination at the electrode/electrolyte interface during photolysis of water. Oxides have to be developed to be highly conductive and have a bandgap, which can be achieved by tailoring the defect chemistry of the oxides or by formation of a suited mixed oxide phase. Of special interest is the preparation of highly conductive p- and n-type TiO2 and WO3 as well as their alloys as corrosion stable and photoelectrocatalytically active electrodes. Bandgap reduction of pure TiO2 involved the formations of solid solutions of TiO2–FeO and TiO2–Fe2O3, which were reported to have a bandgap of ∼2·2 eV.1 Besides TiO2, WO3 also has a superior stability as a photoelectrode material in the OER. Alloying with FeO also leads to lowering of the bandgap. Alternatively, ternary oxides of the systems Ni–Co–O and Ni–Fe–O are known for their high catalytic activity in the OER. They are considered as potential cocatalysts in the process of water oxidation. The materials can also be used in hybrid photoelectrodes consisting of a photovoltaic structure to absorb the sunlight with a corrosion stable and catalytically active window layer, which is in contact with the electrolyte.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMixtures of inorganic waste materials are commonly converted into glasses, in turn to be transformed into glass ceramics. Specific composition designs may lead to glasses with a low crystallisation temperature, useful for low cost ceramisation by bulk nucleation. This feature, however, may be disadvantageous if the same glasses are subjected to sintering, since intensive crystallisation hinders the viscous flow. This paper illustrates the optimisation of simultaneous sintering and crystallisation of a waste derived glass, originally intended for bulk nucleation, when coupled with recycled glasses, at a very low temperature (800°C). The mixing with secondary glasses did not merely enhance the densification (residual porosity of ∼3%) but modified the crystallisation. Owing to the mechanical properties (e.g. Young’s modulus and bending strength exceeding 80 GPa and 90 MPa respectively), the obtained sintered glass ceramics may find profitable applications in the building industry.",

The thermal shock resistance was characterised by the residual ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS). The surface morphology and microstructure of the thermally shocked specimens were examined by a scanning electron microscope and an X-ray diffractometer. It is found that ILSS is more sensitive to the damage caused by thermal shock. The composite retains its UTS within 20 thermal shock cycles. However, the ILSS of 2D-C/SiC decreases gradually with increasing thermal shock cycles.

Crystal growth after the incorporation of Fe, however, has not been reported extensively yet. In this work, HAp particles doped with Fe ions were synthesised using hydrothermal method. The influence of Fe addition and pH values on the crystal growth of HAp was studied. It was shown that a higher pH will increase the crystal size and thereby increase the crystallinity of HAp. Fe2+/3+ has a smaller ionic radius than Ca2+ and can be incorporated directly, resulting in poor crystallinity and a concomitant reduction in crystal size. At an Fe concentration of 0·2, the rod-like Fe-HAp transformed to a spherical morphology. It suggests that Fe ions can affect the morphologies by the adsorption on specific crystal faces that inhibit growth.",

Structural and morphology studies carried out by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy indicate the change in crystal structure from rhombohedral to orthorhombic symmetry (R3C to Pnma). The morphotropic phase boundary of this system was found to lie around x = 0·08–0·14, where the orthorhombic and rhombohedral symmetries coexist. The orthorhombic phase is stabilised for x>0·14, indicating that the rhombohedral phase of Na0·5Bi0·5TiO3 is susceptible to orthorhombic distortion brought about by Ca substitution. Calcium substitution in Na0·5Bi0·5TiO3 caused an obvious decrease in peak temperature and a decrease in relative permittivity. The compositional variation of the fundamental dielectric behaviour is discussed in relation to the crystal chemistry of the system. The highest piezoelectric constant d33 of 85 pC N−1 is achieved for x = 0·1, with the coercive field of 18 kV cm−1 and the dielectric maximum temperature of 148°C.",

Both sensors were able to detect the early stage of moisture diffusion into the GRP matrix. The evanescent sensors showed a reduction in the transmitted signal intensity between 1500 and 1650 nm with an increasing exposure time due to a change in the optical properties of the polymer, whereas a peak shift was observed for the FBGs due to the swelling of the resin with the absorption of water. Additionally, the glass optical fibre sensors were embedded in a configuration that allowed the extent of diffusion through the thickness of the GRPs to be monitored, with the fibres in the closest position to the exposure face showing a greater signal change than those positioned further away.",

Refined binder chemistry was developed where the alkali and silica contents of the OBA are supplemented by calcined kaolin (CK) as alumina-rich constituents targeting balanced chemistry. The results showed that optimum formulation was achieved when 40 wt-% OBA and 60 wt-% CK were blended yielding geopolymer concrete with 28-day compressive strength of 30 MPa.

The compressive strength reached to more than 45 MPa when 5 wt-% CaO or 10 wt-% NaOH was added to the optimum blend. microstructural and mineralogical studies were performed to get insight into the microstructural changes and explain the findings.Abbreviations: ASTM: American Society for Testing and Materials; CK: Calcined Kaolin; CSH: Calcium Silicate Hydrates; DTG: Differential Thermogravimetric Analysis; EDS: Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy; LOI: Loss-On-Ignition; NASH: sodium Aluminosilicate Hydrates; OBA: Olive Biomass Ash; SEM: Scanning Electron Microscopy; TGA: Thermogravimetric Analysis; XRD: X-Ray Diffraction; XRF: X-Ray Fluorescence",

The conventional sintering produced a layer structure with the interconnected grains and the pores, which simultaneously optimised the thermal and electrical conductivity. The thermoelectric property was improved by the combination of the special morphology and ion substitution. The figure of merit ZT reached 0.205 (600°C) which was a competitive value for polycrystalline Ca3Co4O9 ceramics.

As temperature increased to 1300°C, TiSi2 layer began to scale off and presented laminated Ti3SiC2 grains beneath this layer, which indicated preferential hydrogenation occurred along the basal planes. This phenomenon was ascribed to the fact that the introduction of H interstitial atom weakened the combination between titanium and silicon interface layer, which was confirmed by first principles calculations. In addition, the formation of TiSi2 owing to the dissociation of Ti3SiC2 caused the volume expansion after hydrogenation, resulting in that majority of TiSi2 layer spelled off at 1400°C.",

Tribological properties of these coatings obtained have been studied using the pin-on-disc test configuration in simulating application conditions. The obtained iron boride coatings demonstrated significantly lower wear losses compared to bare cast iron, stable behaviour of coefficient of friction during time and no structural degradation and spalling. The superior wear resistance of boride-based coatings on cast iron is dealt with the combination of their high hardness, specific 'sawtooth' double-layer morphology obtained through the thermal diffusion process, diffusion-related bonding to the substrate, self-lubricating thin 'tribo-film' formed during friction and high thermal and chemical stability.",

On the other hand, doping still is the common way to improve the ionic conductivities of these solid electrolytes. In this study, mono and dual-doped garnet-type solid electrolytes were synthesised by substituting indium (In), gallium (Ga), indium-titanium (In-Ti) and gallium-titanium (Ga-Ti) to the Li7La3Zr2O12 structure by a solid-state reaction method. The contribution of substitutions to the formation of crystal phases was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). On the other hand, morphological analyses were done by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the ionic conductivities of the solid electrolytes were determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The study showed that while Li7-3xInxLa3Zr2O12 (for x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) and Li7-3xGaxLa3Zr2O12 (for x = 0.05) samples were formed in tetragonal phase with a space group of I41/acd:2, dual substituted Li7-3xInxLa3Zr1.8Ti0.2O12 and Li7-3xGaxLa3Zr1.8Ti0.2O12 solid electrolytes for all x values were formed in cubic phase with a space group of I-43d. The highest conductivity is reached for Li6.85Ga0.05La3Zr1.8Ti0.2O12.

Low-pressure cold spraying was used to fabricate Al–Al 2 O 3 metal matrix composite overlays, with varying concentrations of Al 2 O 3 deposited on an Al alloy. Friction stir processing (FSP) was employed to disperse and consolidate the overlay coating on the base material. The FSP was found to improve the Al 2 O 3 particle distribution in the coating and reduce the mean free path between Al 2 O 3 particles. The coating hardness increased after FSP. The post-FSPed overlays also exhibited lower wear rates compared to the as-sprayed condition. Remarkable improvement was observed in the tensile properties of the coatings, which were attributed to the improved dispersion of Al 2 O 3 particles in the matrix, while the enhanced ductility was attributed to the possible grain refinement that occurred due to the recrystallisation of Al during FSP.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the municipal sludge was used as the main raw material to prepare a kind of porous ceramsite. The porous ceramsite composition of 50 wt-% of municipal sludge, 10 wt-% of municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash, 45 wt-% of waste glass powders, sintering temperature of 900°C and holding duration of 30 min. The best of the ceramsite synthesised had 1-h water absorption capacity of 51.53%, apparent porosity of 64.14% and pore volume 0.671 mL g −1 . During the sintering process, the waste glass powders generated a large amount of liquid phase, wrapt the gas produced by organic matter, and formed a porous structure inside the ceramic particles. At the same time, the silica and aluminium were combined to form Kyanite, which constitutes the basic skeleton of the ceramic particles showing a certain strength. Besides, silicon oxide and calcium silicate generated Wollastonite improving the corrosion resistance of ceramic particles as well. The adsorption capacity of the prepared porous ceramsite modified by acid combined with sodium citrate was 3.1 mg g −1 using the prepared porous ceramsite as substrate. The adsorption kinetics of ammonia nitrogen by porous ceramics conforms to the quasi-second-order kinetic model, and the adsorption isotherm model conforms to the Langmuir model. The findings lay a theoretical foundation for the integration of resource utilisation of solid waste and later application.",

This work emphasises synthesising calcium silicate–based thermal insulating material via solid-state reaction using silica, calcium carbonate and fly ash as binding material. The calcium silicate formulations were mixed into a ratio of 1:1:1 (CaO:SiO 2 :FA) and sintered at temperatures 800–1100°C for 2 h. The developed tailored powder and the sample with calcium silicate formulations were characterised by X-ray diffraction, IR, thermagravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-EDS and thermophysical properties (thermal diffusivity, heat capacity per unit volume and thermal conductivity). The synthesised samples are composed mainly of calcium silicate phases, that is, wollastonite with minor larnite and rankinite. The microstructure was evaluated by SEM. It was found that the developed calcium silicate material reached low thermal conductivity values, that is, 0.29 and 0.42 W/mK (for 2P1000 and 2P1100, respectively). The thermal constant analysis of the material shows the stability of the material at high temperatures. Thus, the present results suggest that in-situ calcium silicate–based material prepared is a good thermal insulation ceramic material.",

Combustion synthesis has attractive advantages such as simple experimental setup, low cost, short reaction time, energy savings due to exothermic reaction, better control of stoichiometry and fine powder size. The present study involves combustion synthesis of LHA using lanthanum and aluminium nitrates as oxidising precursors, and urea as fuel. The precursor salts were dissolved in a minimum amount of deionised water and the solution was heated in a mantle heater to temperatures of around 300–350°C, at which combustion takes place with rapid evolution of gas. The LHA powder was also prepared by a precipitation route for comparative study. The as synthesised powders were calcined at up to 1450°C and subjected to X-ray diffraction for phase evolution studies. Product powders were then characterised. The influence of the lanthanum/aluminium molar ratio in the starting composition and the effect of temperature on the formation sequences of lanthanum monoaluminate (LMA) and LHA and on the conversion of LMA to LHA are discussed.Keywords: COMBUSTION SYNTHESISLANTHANUM HEXA-ALUMINATEMAGNETOPLUMBITEPRECIPITATION SYNTHESISTHERMAL BARRIER COATINGS",

Since then it has been gradually refined to become the fundamental constituent of modern concrete, familiar to all of us as the major construction material of the past century. Contemporary constructions such as skyscrapers, concert halls, suspension bridges and huge dams testify to the successful use of Portland cement concrete. For routine constructions its compressive strength development and durability are sufficiently well understood for it to be used with confidence in many diverse situations and in locations with widely different climate conditions. Even in the last 30 years, however, unexpected durability problems, such as the alkali silica reaction (ASR), delayed ettringite formation (DEF) and the thaumasite form of sulphate attack (TSA), have emerged. To ensure that the civil engineer can take the necessary steps to avoid their occurrence has required the methods of materials science to be applied to understand the mechanism of these processes. Recent ideas pertaining to the reaction mechanisms underlying DEF and TSA are critically reviewed.Keywords: JOSEPH MELLORCEMENT CHEMISTRYCONCRETEDELAYED ETTRINGITE FORMATIONTHAUMASITE SULPHATE ATTACK",

The phase morphology and surface property were studied by scanning electron microscopy.

The dc conductivity σdc shows typical Arrhenius behaviour when observed as a function of temperature. The activation energy value was estimated to be 0·24 eV. The value of σdc, evaluated from complex impedance spectrum, shows a jump of nearly two orders of magnitude at higher temperature (∼1·24 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 350°C) when compared with that of σdc (1·14 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 50°C).

The results suggest that a molecular interaction is operative between the side groups of the polymer and the growing HAp crystallites in the in situ process. The enhanced interfacial interaction between the polymer and the reinforcement material led to improved mechanical properties (i.e. higher tensile strength and strain at failure values) for the composite samples prepared by the in situ procedure. An increase in the young's modulus values with increasing filler content was observed for the composite samples prepared by both processes.

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon nanotubes are very attractive for a wide range of potential applications. However, many applications require the growth of aligned/micropatterned carbon nanotubes with or without a modified nanotube surface. Simple pyrolytic methods for large scale production of aligned/micropatterned carbon nanotube arrays perpendicular to the substrate surface have been developed. These aligned carbon nanotube arrays can be transferred onto various substrates of particular interest in either a patterned or non-patterned fashion. The perpendicularly-aligned structure provides advantages for not only an efficient device construction but also surface functionalisation (both the inner and outer wall) while their alignment structure can be largely retained. These aligned carbon nanotubes with tunable surface characteristics are of great significance to various practical applications, ranging from plastic optoelectronics to bioceramics. Examples include biomolecule immobilised carbon nanotube biosensors, synthetic polymer supported aligned carbon nanotube chemical vapour sensors, metal nanoparticle decorated carbon nanotubes, and aligned coaxial nanowires of carbon nanotubes sheathed with titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles or thin films. These newly synthesised carbon nanotubes decorated with polymers, metal nanoparticles, and/or TiO2 coatings were demonstrated to show novel optoelectronic properties and should possess good bioactive behaviours with enhanced tissue attachment attractive for functional optoelectronic and bioceramic applications. This article reviews recent work carried out in the authors group on the preparation of nanocomposites based on aligned carbon nanotubes functionalised with polymers or metal (oxide) nanoparticles. Their potential applications as plastic optoelectronics and bioceramics will also be discussed.Keywords: CARBON NANOTUBESTITANIUM DIOXIDEBIOCERAMICSBIOSENSORSNANOCOMPOSITES",

In the present work several kind of industrial and urban wastes, such as mining residues, lime, glass from dismantled cathode ray tubes and soda lime glass were used, after their vitrification. These newly formed glasses were used as partial substitution for natural feldspar sands (the glass content being from 5 to 7 wt-% of the total mix). Owing to the specific ('tailored') chemical formulation of the newly formed glasses, the modified products exhibited higher crystallisation, with a more homogeneous microstructure, leading to significant improvements in reliability and indentation fracture toughness.Keywords: MICROSTRUCTURE FINALMECHANICAL PROPERTIESTRADITIONAL CERAMICSTAILORED SECONDARY RAW MATERIALS",

Sintering of CNT–SiO2 composites was performed for 3 h at 1300°C in argon atmosphere. Pressureless sintering yielded composites with a density >95% of the theoretical.

The usage of fine glass powders (<37 μm) allowed very short sintering treatments, due to the enhanced nucleating activity of glass surfaces. In particular, dense glass ceramics could be produced by direct insertion of pressed glass powders in the furnace at the sintering temperature, followed by rapid cooling at room temperature after a 30 min holding time. The proposed approach evidences the feasibility of sintered glass ceramics by the fast and economic processes employed for traditional ceramics, with the advantage of superior mechanical properties (bending strength exceeding 100 MPa, Vickers' microhardness exceeding 6 GPa). Like in traditional ceramics, clay and water could be used for the shaping of pressed tiles, thus posing the conditions for massive industrial production.",

On the other hand, low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) has been utilised as a base material for hybrid circuit boards, packages as well as some microfluidic devices; however, new means to introduce integrated functionalities for it are needed. In this paper, a 10×5 mm rectangle and 10 mm in diameter round PZT samples fully embedded and cofired with Heraeus HeraLock LTCC were manufactured and their hysteresis, dielectric, displacement and microstructure properties and coupling factors were characterised. Relative permittivity of the LTCC embedded varied from 1300 for the rectangle sample to 1500 for the round sample at 1 kHz, while r of 2209-2406 was obtained for corresponding bare bulk samples respectively. Measured piezoelectric d 33 coefficient was in the range of 324-441 pm V−1 for embedded structures, while 553-567 pm V−1 was obtained for free bulk samples at 100 Hz. Results show that LTCC has significant impact for electromechanical performance mainly due to constraining of the LTCC layers. In spite of this, feasible figures of merits were obtained for LTCC embedded PZT materials, while further improvements can be obtained by optimising the process and structures for LTCC based microsystems, sensors and actuators.",

The maximum value of the total conductivity is 1·29×10–2 S cm–1 at 1173 K for the GdSm0·85Mg0·15Zr2O6·925 ceramic.",

The strict requirements for the production of transparent polycrystalline alumina demand a fundamental understanding of powder handling and processing steps. The use of dopants (Mg, Y, La) has proven useful, but produces noticeable effects on suspension rheology and influences the choice of the processing route. With the prospect of spray granulation of such slurries, the rheological behaviour of doped alumina suspensions was investigated from a fundamental approach taking into account slurry and particle characteristics, and computing the interparticle potentials. This information was then used in a yield stress model which successfully predicted the rheological behaviour of the doped alumina slurries. A strategy for improved slurry formulation is presented.",

The chlorination was implemented through a gas–solid reaction between Cl2 and PCS fibre. Based on the results of energy-dispersive spectrometer and attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the diffusion-controlled chlorination reaction was confirmed. During hydrolysis, the catalysis of ammonia gas was necessary. According to the results of dissolution and degradation experiments, cross-linked PCS outer layer formed after chlorination, hydrolysis and condensation, and the outer layer had higher ceramic yield than the core part.

With the graphite fluoride content increasing from 0 to 7 wt-%, the bending strength of SiC ceramic decreased from 507 to 357 MPa, while the dry friction coefficient dropped from 0·4 to 0·2. The graphite fluoride particles with lamellar structure did not vary the main crystalline phase compositions and distributed in the boundary of SiC grains. When the self-mated friction happened, graphite fluoride would fall off and stick to the friction surface, which improved the friction performance of SiC ceramic seals.",

The presence of coexisting rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is thought to play a key role in their functional properties, but a thorough understanding is currently lacking. In this experiment, (1−x)KNNS–(x)BNKZ ceramics with x = 0–0.05 were prepared by the mixed-oxide method. High-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXPD) measurements reveal that the addition of BNKZ into KNNS ceramics leads to an increase in the rhombohedral–orthorhombic phase transition temperature (TR−O) and a decrease in the orthorhombic–tetragonal phase transition temperature (TO−T) leading to orthorhombic–tetragonal and rhombohedral–tetragonal phase coexistence at room temperature for compositions with x = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively. By combining the SXPD results with microstructure, evidence is also found for the occurrence of chemical heterogeneity, which could provide an additional means to control the functional properties. The structural observations are correlated with changes in the dielectric and ferroelectric properties.",

Shear strength of SiC joints increase with the joining temperature from 1000 to 1200°C, and then decrease when the joining temperature reaches to 1350°C.

However, such a specific bone-structure pattern is making those materials susceptible to colonisation by pathogenic bacteria. This work presents results of the study on physical characterisation and microbiological assessment of biocide properties of modified man-made fluor- and hydroxyapatites. The structures and physical properties were characterised by a diffuse reflectance spectra, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, TEM and Zeta-potential analyses. The bactericidal properties were assessed with Staphylococcus aureus, the main pathogenic species responsible for implant-associated infections. It was found that manufactured materials had structures typical for the biological (bone) apatites. Doping with silver has not changed their morphology. Results from the assays have confirmed that built-in silver substantially increased their biocidal properties, thus Ag-doped fluorapatite is a promising new resistant biomaterial with great bactericidal effect that potentially could be applied in tissue engineering, or dentistry.",

Work function measurements were used to examine the effect of the applied surface processing procedures on the reactivity of zirconia with oxygen and related charge transfer. This examination involved monitoring changes in work function during oxidation at 1073 and 1173 K. It is shown that surface processing has an effect on the oxidation kinetics and mechanism at both temperatures.

The phenomenon of segregation and its impact on surface composition is outlined for yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ), where it impacts upon the performance of zirconia at elevated temperatures. The difference between equilibrium segregation and non-equilibrium segregation is discussed. In the former case, the segregation induced data represent specific materials properties. In the latter case, non-equilibrium segregation leads to a complex distribution of concentration gradients and structures, which are a reflection of the applied experimental procedures rather than of material properties.",

The composite samples with various amounts of nanoscaled HA particles were produced by mixing the ceramic and high density polyethylene particles using a single screw extrusion system. The results of the mechanical testing on the composite samples showed an increase in the fracture strength and the young's modulus values with increasing volume fraction of HA content in the composite samples. At the same time, there were decreases in both the fracture strain and toughness values with increasing volume fraction of the ceramic filler particles.

The phenomena of edge cracking and crack bifurcation are considered with reference to elastic moduli, Poisson's ratio, mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients, temperature gradient and laminate architecture. The use of compressive layers to produce a material that exhibits a threshold strength and criteria for increasing the critical applied stress below which failure will not occur are reported. A single edge V-notched beam (SEVNB) test geometry was used to measure crack growth resistance (R curve) behaviour of multilayer Si3N4/Si3N4–TiN composites. Fracture mechanics weight function analysis was applied to predict the R curve behaviour of multilayer composites having a stepwise change in composition. A conservative, non-optimised laminate design exhibiting apparent fracture toughness in excess of 17 MPa m1/2 is reported, in excellent agreement with the weight function analysis.",

Quantitative investigation of phases was carried out using an external standard method. The weight fraction of unreacted zirconia at 1000°C was found to be 0·056. SEM observation of powders exposed at various calcination temperatures indicated the presence of tetrahedral crystals, and this was enhanced by the addition of the NaF mineraliser.

Porosity, density and thermal expansion coefficient of the materials were determined. The quantitative XRD method specially developed for the materials studied is described in detail.

The parameters used to describe the structures were the size of the cell and the window, the window shape factor, the strut thickness and the volume fraction of the material. The experimental evidence gathered opened the way to understand the physical/chemical transformations involved in the polymer burnout and the ceramic sintering processes, as well as their influence on the ceramic final structure.

To verify the bioactivity of the graded coatings, as sprayed and after thermal treatment, in vitro tests were performed in simulated body fluid. Furthermore, since the mechanical properties of the coatings may be altered by the immersion in simulated body fluid, the local elastic properties were measured on the cross-section by means of a depth sensing Vickers microindentation technique before immersion (reference materials) and after soaking for 1 week (short term response) and 4 weeks (long term response), separately investigating the titania and the hydroxyapatite rich zones to account for the compositional gradient. The results proved that the presence of titania in the coating did not suppress the bioactivity, which, on the contrary, was inhibited by the heat treatment. However, the heat treated samples showed higher mechanical properties and reduced dissolution rates.Keywords: FUNCTIONALLY GRADED MATERIALSTITANIAHYDROXYAPATITEPLASMA SPRAYINGIN VITRO TESTELASTIC PROPERTIES",

In this study, we assess the long-term safety and toxicity of intracerebrally infused Gd-DTPA along with an experimental targeted agent PRX321.Fifty-four immunocompetent rats were implanted with intracerebral cannulas linked to subcutaneously placed osmotic pumps. After pump implantation, the rats were randomized into six groups of nine rats each in order to assess the toxicities of six different concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA) with and without Gd-DTPA and PRX321. The rats were monitored clinically for 6 weeks before they were autopsied and assessed for histological toxicity to their central nervous system (CNS).There was one unexplained death in a group infusing low concentration HSA, Gd-DTPA and PRX321. Upon microscopic examination of the CNS in that animal, no unexpected histological toxicity was found. Additionally, there were no signs of clinical or histological toxicity in any of the remaining rats, which all survived until the end of the 6 week observation period.Free Gd-DTPA can be safely infused via CED in a pre-clinical animal model. Future studies should include its use in predicting and actively monitoring CED drug infusions in early phase human clinical trials.",

The two nuclear techniques employed were X-ray microtomography and gamma ray transmission. For the microtomography technique, the spatial resolution of the images was 32 μm.

The gamma transmission technique was precise for porosity determination in relationship to the nominal values supplied for the sample manufacturer. The 30 and 45 ppi samples analysed by the microtomography technique present average porosities equivalent to the nominal porosity, and the other samples present an average of 4·6% smaller values.

This paper deals with a micropower source, designed to harvest energy from walking, built in a form of a shoe insole containing a piezoelectric material (43 μm thick polyethylene foil). Laboratory investigation of the piezoelectric properties is presented first, followed by a measurement result of an actual generator with 0·6 μW output power. Finally, a modification of the generator, by adding springy elements, is presented, resulting in ninefold increase in power output (to 5·6 μW).Keywords: PiezofoilsPiezogeneratorsMicropower source",

Sintering was applied to fine powders (<37 μm) at temperatures of 700–1070°C for 0·5–2 h, after very rapid heating (40°C min−1). Mixtures with small additions of CaO and CaF2 led to fluorapatite–wollastonite glass ceramics, which retained a significant porosity even at 1070°C, due to the delay in viscous flow caused by rapid crystallisation. This feature was exploited for strong open celled macrocellular glass ceramics, obtained by sintering glass powders mixed with polyethylene sacrificial templates. Mixtures with small additions of CaO and Na2O led to dense and strong combeite glass ceramics (bending strength, >100 MPa), sinterable at particularly low temperatures (800°C). Both porous and dense glass ceramics could be exploited as low cost and high strength materials, or even as biomaterials, due to the biocompatibility of the crystal phases.",

Results show that thermal treatment brought the phase transformation and the morphology change of HAP nanoparticles. In the low temperature stage (∼650°C), the samples were mainly composed of HAP as main crystalline phase and β-NaCaPO4 as minor crystalline phase. This phase transformation was mainly attributed to the residues containing sodium derived from combustion of GAGs. The particles were near spherical, and the nanocrystalline nature was retained. In the high temperature stage (650–1200°C), the samples were glass ceramic powders composed of HAP, β-tricalcium phosphate, Na3Ca6(PO4)5, β-NaCaPO4 and Na–Ca–P–O glass phase.

The analysis of the design of experiments (DOE) is performed with the signal to noise (S/N) ratio and the analysis of variance. The results clearly reveal that the time of deposition is the most influential parameter on crystallite size, whereas the asymmetric factor has the highest effect on the preferential deposition of Cu or C and thus on the chemical composition. It is therefore concluded that by changing some of the parameters, EPD can be implemented to develop nanostructured composite coating having a desired crystallite size and morphology.",

The production of cement clinker minerals by precipitation from a molten salt solvent offers a potential route to energy reduction in cement manufacture. Molten salt synthesis of the major cement compounds β-dicalcium silicate (β-Ca2SiO4, β-C2S) and tricalcium silicate (Ca3SiO5, C3S) has been attempted in fused sodium chloride (NaCl). The synthesis of β-Ca2SiO4 was carried out by the reaction of CaCO3 with SiO2 in molten NaCl (CaCO3-SiO2-NaCl mole ratios 2∶1∶19·2 at 908°C, and 2∶1∶20·4, 2∶1∶13·5, 2∶1∶10·3 and 2∶1∶8 at 1140°C). The product was characterised by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering and scanning electron microscopy. For the synthesis of Ca3SiO5, reactants with a molar ratio of 3∶1 were used (CaCO3–SiO2–NaCl 3∶1∶19·8 at 908 and 1000°C, and 3∶1∶20, 3∶1∶14, 3∶1∶9·9 and 3∶1∶8·1 at 1140°C). In all cases β-Ca2SiO4 was the principal product, with the CaO phase still present and (if any) only small quantities of Ca3SiO5. These observations, coupled with previous studies on the solid state synthesis of Ca3SiO5, indicate that β-Ca2SiO4 is an intermediate compound, requiring in excess of 1140°C to react with CaO in order to form tricalcium silicate.",

Most samples were dense with a low porosity, which can be attributed to accelerated separation and removal of gas bubbles from ceramic melts in a high gravity field. The hardness of the as prepared glass ceramics varied in the range of 8·2–12·8 GPa and could be improved by a fine eutectic structure. Compared with conventional techniques, high gravity combustion synthesis can offer a fast and efficient way to prepare glass ceramic materials.",

Composite samples were prepared by incorporating the silane treated glass–ceramic particles into the Bis-GMA/TEGDMA (60∶40 mass ratio) epoxy matrix. Structural and microstructural characterisations were conducted using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical properties of the light cured samples were examined by measuring flexural and diametral tensile strength, as well as conducting Vickers microhardness test. Results obtained in this study showed strong dependence of the flexural strength on the composition of the filler particles. Diametral tensile strength and microhardness values demonstrated lesser sensitivity to the filler composition. Microstructural examination of the samples by SEM revealed particle pull-out, debonding and crack deflection as the major energy consuming mechanisms in the fracture process.",

Mixtures of tetragonal and cubic phases have been observed in all the processed Y2O3–MUZ composites. This observation infers that though the available temperature in plasma sintered and conventionally sintered MUZ specimens is not sufficient for the transformation of monoclinic to cubic zirconia, the addition of Y2O3 favours this transformation and also stabilises the cubic zirconia phase at room temperature. The optical absorption studies completely reflect the improvement in optical band gap of Y2O3–MUZ composites to prove it as a suitable candidate for refractory applications. The bulk density, hardness and higher crystalline nature of plasma sintered composites indicate that better quality of products can be synthesised by direct current extended arc thermal plasma heating technique within a short duration of time.",

The model is constructed by bridging the characteristics of microscopic domain distribution into the macroscopic behaviour. Choosing the remanent strain and remanent polarisation as internal variables, a domain orientation distribution is used to describe the evolution of these variables and to develop a phenomenological model of ferroelasticity for electromechanical loading histories. This model is able to reproduce the (longitudinal and transversal) strain and electric displacement in function of uniaxial electrical and mechanical loading. This formulation is validated through a comparison with experimental data of the literature. The evolution of the elastic and piezoelectric constants under mechanical stress is successfully compared as well.",

For the in vivo evaluation, the ‘calvaria critical-size defect’ model was used: following 1 and 3 months of the artificial surgical bone defects filled with β-TCP-AE, histopathological analyses were performed. Gene expression studies demonstrated a mild osteoblastic differentiation of the SAOS-2 cells triggered after seven days of β-TCP-AE treatment. Digital histology of rat’s calvarial bone defects reconstructed with β-TCP-AE showed that after 1 month, calcifications and early ossifications developed with the presence of capillary-rich fibrous inflammation and remnants of exogenous compounds which nearly disappeared by the third month, and replaced with multiple newly formed bone islets mediated by osteoblasts.

Spark plasma sintering (SPS) has widened the envelope of processing conditions available to produce bioceramics with new microstructural architectures.

Recently, low-dimensional carbon nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene/graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) have gained increasing attention as reinforcements due to their providing superior mechanical properties, favourable biocompatibility, and large specific surface area. Processing of these nanocomposites is done using SPS in order to consolidate the ceramics to full density in short time periods, while retaining the structure and properties of the nanomaterial reinforcements. This review focuses on recent progress on GNP/CNT reinforced HA and alumina nanocomposites, including mechanical properties, tribological behaviour, processing conditions, and mechanisms.

Compared to the overgrowth of irregular calcite products synthesised in the presence of gelatin at RT, predominant cocoon-like and minor rosette-like microparticles with the typical size of 2–4 μm were obtained at low temperature (4°C). The samples showed that the cocoon-like microparticles were orderly stacked by small well faceted rhombohedra. The formation of hollow microspheres was confirmed by observing the consumption of the internal precursors, further indicative of the unique low temperature modulating effects of gelatin. The present biomimetic approach is simple and biosafe, and the obtained cocoon-like hollow microparticles could be potentially used for biomedical purposes.",

    "abstract": "A simplified two-dimensional finite elements model was created for a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) coated Bioglass® strut undergoing tensile stresses (loading mode I). The strengthening contributions due to the infiltration of coating into surface cracks and coating's stiffness were evaluated in terms of stress intensity factor KI and tensile stresses σyy in the proximity of the crack tip. The infiltration of the coating until the crack tip resulted as the most effective criterion for the struts strengthening. Bioglass® based scaffolds were dip coated into PVA and PVA/microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) aqueous solutions and tested in tensile load. Coated samples exhibited remarkably higher tensile strength than non-coated ones, which further raised with the increased amount of MFC. Contact angle θ and linear viscosity η measurements of PVA/MFC solutions showed that MFC caused a reduction in θ and a drastic increase in η, indicating that a balance between these two effects must be achieved.",

The present work was aimed to synthesise leucite using its stoichiometric batch compositions and subsequent high energy ball milling. CaF2 was also added in another mix to study its role on leucite formation. Further prepared, leucite phase was added in separately prepared low temperature glass frit powders to control amount of glass and leucite content. X-ray diffraction results displayed that high energy ball milling and additive promoted the formation of leucite as a major crystalline phase. Furthermore, CaF2 also suppressed the subsidiary crystallisation of kalsilite phase. Evaluated average coefficient of thermal expansion in the temperature range of 20–500°C was very close to the theoretical value of pure leucite.",

With the aim of preventing the formation of W2C, in this study, Al2O3 was added to lower the reaction temperature. Thermodynamic calculations showed that Al2O3 presence in WO3/2Al/C/xAl2O3 mixtures would lower the adiabatic temperature. Experimental findings revealed that with no Al2O3 addition, released heat in the mixture activates carbothermic reduction of WO3 and causes carbon deficiency, which results in W2C formation. When x = 0·6, although product consists of W2C phase, the coolant effect of alumina diminishes carbon deficiency phenomenon with a consequence of more WC formation. For the WO3/2Al/C/1·2Al2O3 mixture, carbothermic reduction reaction was prevented, which brings about complete conversion of W to WC after milling. The TEM observations showed that the produced WC–Al2O3 powder contains nanosize particles.",

Therefore, our objective is to test CDC's tribocorrosion performance under various electrochemical conditions and to identify the synergism between wear and corrosion. Based on the findings, the variations in OCP for CDC (0.626 mV) is smaller than Ti6Al4V (1.91 mV), and CDC showed lower induced current than T6Al4V for all potentials, suggesting CDC is more stable than Ti6Al4V under tribocorrosive conditions. Eventually, the weight loss of Ti6Al4V (50.662±5.19 μg) was found to be significantly higher than that of CDC (4.965±5.19 μg), which agrees with the electrochemical results. In summary, CDC showed better tribocorrosion performance than Ti6Al4V and was determined as an Antagonism regime.",

Local limestone and clays were used as raw materials in the batch composition. Various thermal, microscopic and diffractometric techniques were used to investigate the amorphous and crystalline phases present. Heat treatment led to the formation of β-eucryptite, wollastonite, anorthite and fayalite. Both parent and Cr2O3 containing glasses showed enhanced crystallisation of β-eucryptite and wollastonite, whereas anorthite formation was catalysed in TiO2 containing glasses, in addition to the latter phases mentioned. Crystallisation of all glasses at 1100°C reduced wollastonite formation to trace levels; however, fayalite appeared in Cr2O3 containing samples. Glass–ceramics with a homogeneous bulk microstructure were developed, mainly characterised by accumulated fine rounded to subrounded crystals of 2·5–10 μm diameter of β-eucryptite phase. Intergranular rhombic-like and fibrous crystals were also developedand may be wollastonite and anorthite respectively, in TiO2 containing samples. Depending on the content of β-eucryptite and other phases in the glass–ceramic samples, the coefficient of thermal expansion ranged from −8·75 × 10−7°C−1 (25–300°C) to 54·16 × 10−7°C−1 (25–680°C).

    "abstract": "AbstractAbstractCSIRO has demonstrated a concept for utilising two of Australia's largest energy resources, solar energy and natural gas. Solar energy is used to reform natural gas to produce solar syngas (H2/CO), then shifted to hydrogen. The resulting hydrogen contains 20% embodied solar energy. The concept allows the choice to use either the syngas directly, or hydrogen. Much of Australia's gas reserves exist in the high solar regions, and gas pipeline infrastructure is in place to transport the solar gas to the cities. Alternatively the solar gas can be used on site in large gas turbines, for distributed generation in gas engines in remote regions, or as a chemical feedstock. The most significant market penetration at present would be for syngas, however the project has demonstrated it is possible to produce hydrogen of a quality sufficient for a hydrogen fuel cell. An improved version is now under construction at Australia's National Solar Energy Centre.",

Thermal and mechanical properties were measured at room temperature by means of standard techniques and then the thermal shock resistance parameter R was calculated. The fracture toughness of selected samples was measured before and after thermal shock by the chevron notched specimen technique. The reliability of this technique for evaluation of small differences in fracture toughness after a given number of thermal shock cycles was investigated. The suitability of K Ic measurements by the chevron notched specimen technique to characterise the development of thermal shock damage in refractory materials was proved in this investigation.",

Sintering and softening points, vitrification and fusion of finely ground powders of volcanic ash were obtained by hot stage microscope observation.

The low quartz content of the final product, the relative high density together with the particular structural complexity of the matrix consequence of the interlocking of various crystalline phases conferred to fired volcanic ash relevant ceramic characteristics. Nucleation and microcrystallisation of pyroxene together with oxidation and cation enrichment are indicated as the main sintering mechanism of fired volcanic ash. Differently from conventional vitrified ceramics, i.e. quartz and mullite in vitreous matrix, the microstructure of the fired products presents spinel, anorthite, diopside, enstatite, pyroferrite, fayalite and hedenbergite crystals embedded in the high viscous liquid phase resulting in dense and resistant materials.Keywords: SINTERINGMECHANICAL STRENGTHVOLCANIC ASHCERAMIC MATERIALS",

Colour and reflectance measurements were carried out using a spectrophotometer in order to optimise the pigment powders in terms of composition and calcination temperature. Structural characterisations on the optimised powder sample were carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

The energy dispersive spectroscopy results showed that the silver ions diffused into the dielectric layer significantly when ZMT MLCC was sintered directly up to 900°C with a fixed heating rate (conventional sintering). However, ZMT MLCC was presintered (first step sintering) at 600–800°C then sintered at 900°C (second step sintering); it was found to effectively suppress silver ion diffusion into the dielectric layer. For example, the concentration of silver ions was identified by energy dispersive spectrometer, and both the Ag ion concentrations for conventional and two‐step sintering are 2 and 0·1 at‐% respectively. In addition, SEM observations showed that the silver electrode of ZMT MLCCs was greatly discontinuous by conventional sintering. Unlike the two‐step sintering, this result shows that the silver electrode of ZMT MLCCs was completely discontinuous. To prove the effect of silver ion diffusion on the insulation resistance of ZMT MLCCs, the insulation resistance under different sintering conditions was measured at 85°C and 95% relative humidity atmosphere. The insulation resistance of ZMT MLCCs with conventional sintering was degraded obviously, which was compared with that with the two‐step sintering.",

The poled PZT 95/5 ceramics demonstrate higher fracture toughness than the unpoled ceramics, and their fracture toughness significantly increases after the pressure depoling. As the porosity of ceramics increases with addition of poreformer during preparation, their fracture toughnesses all decrease accordingly either in poled state or unpoled state. The effect of pore size on the fracture toughness is subtle for the poled ceramics, but for the hydrostatic pressure depoled porous PZT 95/5 ceramics, their fracture toughness increases with the increase in pore size.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of samples show the existence of dihydrate and hemihydrates microcrystals along with traces of CaSO4.xH2O (x = 0·02–0·48) in as prepared samples, but do reveal that hemihydrate phase is removed after spraying disinfectants. Fractography of the dental stones clearly indicates that the separation between the microcrystals is widened by the disinfection process as a consequence of the possible dissolution of last precipitated gypsum phases. The mechanical properties of the dental stones are effectively decreased after disinfection to different levels.",

    "abstract": "Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the fabrication of manganese dioxide (MD) films for application in electrochemical supercapacitors (ES). Anionic dyes were used as dispersing agents for MD synthesis and EPD. The adsorption of pyrogallol red (PGR) and aurintricarboxylic acid (ACA) dyes on MD was attributed to catecholate and salicylate type of bonding respectively involving chelation of Mn atoms on the MD particle surface. The adsorption of the dyes on MD allowed efficient dispersion, charging and deposition. The higher charge/mass ratio of ACA, compared to that of PGR, allowed deposition at lower dye concentration and lower voltages. The kinetics and mechanism of deposition were discussed. Electrochemical testing results showed that the MD films prepared by the EPD method are promising for application in ES. The highest specific capacitance of 409 F g−1 was obtained at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1.",

With Si3N4 as Si source, the major product was TiCxN1−x and no Ti3SiC2 was synthesised. When SiC and Si were used, Ti3SiC2 was synthesised. Such effect of Si source is thought to be connected with the formation mechanism of Ti3SiC2, where the presence of a Ti–Si melt is required. The combustion synthesis was also performed under high gravity condition instead of common gravity. The apparent density of the product prepared under high gravity was ∼60% higher than that obtained under normal gravity. It is proposed that, the high gravity can facilitate the permeation of Ti–Si melt and enlarge the interface between the melt and carbide phases, which is helpful for the formation of Ti3SiC2.",

In this paper, we pay particular attention to computational aspects, but when appropriate, relationships with experimental results on titania nanostructures will be mentioned. First, the structural properties of titania nanotubes are reviewed, focusing from experimental growth mechanism to possible theoretical stable structure and orientation. Second, the electronic structure of nanotubes is discussed in terms of band gap modifications of titania and photocatalytic efficiencies in photoelectrochemical devices. Finally, current computational limitations and future directions are described with respect to the performances of nanotube titania based photosensitive devices.",

Hydrogen atoms in metal hydride can efficiently moderate fast neutrons. Based on this fact, some metal hydrides have been investigated for their potential environmentally friendly application as nuclear materials to be used in FR cores. Two types of utilisation of metal hydrides in FR cores are discussed in this paper. One is the application of hafnium hydride as neutron absorber in FR cores. The core design has been carried out to examine its characteristics as well as to evaluate the cost reduction effect. Demonstration of the fabrication of hydride pins has been performed using hydride pellets and stainless steel claddings. The coating technique of the inner cladding surface has also been developed to reduce the permeation of hydrogen through the stainless steel cladding. The physical and chemical properties of the pellet have been measured for the purpose of designing a hafnium hydride pin. Irradiation test of the hydride pins has been performed in the experimental FR, JOYO, Japan Atomic Energy Agency. The other application is the utilisation as a transmutation target of long lived nuclear wastes. Hydride fuel containing 237Np, 241Am and 243Am has been studied for a candidate transmutation target to be used to reduce the radioactivity of long lived nuclides contained in the nuclear wastes, which are obtained after reprocessing spent fuels.",

In recent years, it has also been reported that 2SrO.3Al2O3/Eu2+ and 4SrO.7Al2O3/Eu2+ phosphors as green and blue emitters have even higher quantum efficiencies. To determine the initial particle size effect on the phosphorescence behaviour, Eu2+/Dy3+ doped Sr4Al14O25 phosphors were synthesised by mixing 4SrO and 7Al2O3 with a flux (H3BO3) through high temperature solid state reaction method under weak reducing atmosphere. Such an influence on the crystalline structure and emission colour of phosphorescent pigments was studied by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope (SEM), particle size analysis, excitation and emission spectroscopy. The results showed that the emission wavelength of the phosphorescence pigments shifted from green to blue region due to the decrease in average particle sizes of the phosphor batches, forming different types of strontium aluminate crystals.",

Incorporation of either TiO2 or Ta2O5 gives clear crystals of low pores than in the base sample. Addition of Ta2O5 or TiO2 improves densification properties and reduces sintering temperature. Electrical measurements were done in audio frequency range and lower (90 Hz–100 kHz). Composition changes on electrical properties were examined. Experimental electrical data show that the response of specimens was not simple (not a linear relation). The increase of TiO2 and Ta2O5 generally decreases the electrical properties of the ceramic specimens used in this case.

In contrast, multiphase hafnium nitrides can form both thin-lath-based microstructure as well as large, single zeta-phase grains.

Ag3Sb obviously increases carrier concentration and leads to low electrical resistivity and high power factor. The maximum power factor is about 2000 μWm−1 K−2, which is double larger than that of MgAgSb sample prepared by the melting process. During the microwave-assisted process, many stacking faults and edge dislocations are introduced into the matrix which leads to the appearance of flake sub-grains with a thickness of 0.5–1 μm.

The major oxidation products consisted of SiO2 (α-cristobalite), La2Si2O7, HfO2 and HfSiO4 regardless of oxidation temperature. However, the morphology of the microstructure of the oxidised surfaces was shown to be dependent on oxidation temperature. In addition, it was found that the room temperature flexural strength of the composite degraded after oxidation and the degradation of strength depended on oxidation time at temperature and oxidation temperature. The strength retention displayed by composite after 100 h of oxidation at 1400°C and 1500°C was ∼83% and ∼74%, respectively.",

The addition of EMS had no serious effect on the cross-linking reaction mechanism and rate of LHBPCS, and the cross-linking of LHBPCS did not significantly confine the foaming of EMS. After 1000°C pyrolysis, EMS decomposed, but its spherical shape with sizes of 20–30 μm homogeneously embedded in the pyrolysed LHBPCS. As a result, a highly porous SiC foam with density of 0.211 g cm–3 and porosity of 91.2% was obtained and its thermal conductivity at room temperature was as low as 0.05 W (m K)–1.

From the X-ray diffractometer patterns, it is evident that the zirconia exists only in the monoclinic phase. However, Rietveld refinement of calcium-doped zirconia revealed the stabilisation in the monoclinic and cubic phases. With increasing calcium doping, the development of the cubic phase in zirconia is seen and at 16 mol-% doping of calcium, almost fully stabilised cubic phase of zirconia (∼97%) is achieved. The microstructure and elemental analyses of the sintered pellets are done using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy, respectively. Raman spectroscopic studies validate the findings of XRD. It is expected that the present study on calcium-doped zirconia opened a new channel for its potential applications in new technology such as oxygen sensors and solid electrolyte.",

The aggressive process environment in fuel production systems poses a major challenge, potentially causing corrosion within currently used metallic heat exchangers. To improve the reliability and stability of silicon carbide heat pipes, which belong to an innovative heat exchanger design, the corrosion of involved materials due to contact with steam, ash and alkaline (earth) metals needs to be investigated. Exposures of laser joined SSiC connections with wood ash caused the formation of gas inclusions and an infiltration of the joint with alkaline (earth) metals that lead to crack formations, as revealed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis. It was shown that the use of silicon carbide heat pipes joined with solder materials of both the Mg–Al–Si and the Y–Al–Si systems is possible. A further result was that the gasification temperature has to be limited to < 850°C.",

The microstructure was analysed using a scanning electron microscope. The apparent viscosity of the glass composites increased on increasing concentration and density of the filler. The variation in the viscosity is due to the diffusion of the glass matrix through channels in the cordierite filler of the composite. Based on the calculated migration distance of the filler in the glass matrix, the present work suggests that the interfacial behaviour and the density of the filler play a significant role in determining the viscous flow of the glass composites.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAbstractThe effects of different solvent mixtures and dispersants on non-aqueous suspensions of silicon carbide SiC were investigated by measuring settling rate, sediment height and viscosity. Based on these results, solvents, dispersants and dispersant concentrations were optimised to give the slurry with the lowest settling rate, maximum packing density and minimum viscosity. Tape casting slurry of SiC with shear thinning behaviour was prepared after the addition of other constituents such as plasticisers, binder and homogeniser. Rheological measurements confirmed the shear thinning nature of the tape casting slurry. Green tapes free from visible defects were obtained with 62% solids loading.Keywords: DISPERSABILITYRHEOLOGYSEDIMENTATIONSHEAR THINNINGSILICON CARBIDETAPE CASTING",

    "abstract": "The present study was carried out to produce an artificial hydraulic lime for repair and conservation of historic masonry. Lime mortar is preferred to cement based mortar for conservation work because it is more compatible with stone and ancient brickwork, as well as being a more sustainable material. The study focused on the effect of burning conditions on the properties of an artificial hydraulic lime mortar obtained by burning limestone and siliceous waste materials. The raw meals were prepared from five types of siliceous materials obtained as byproducts from industrial processes (pulverised fuel ash, glass cullet, silica sand, crushed rock and spent oil shale) with the amount of silica between 3 and 16%. The raw meal was burned in an electric furnace at 975°C for 3 h. The mortar was prepared by mixing hot slaked lime putty (water/lime ratio ∼1.6) and 'Gowrie' sand at a lime/sand ratio of 1 : 3 by weight. The limes and lime mortar were prepared and tested according to BS EN 459-2:2001. The investigations carried out on the products included free lime analysis, strength test and microstructural examination. The results show that the glass cullet lime is the most hydraulic product and can be classified as feebly hydraulic. It suggests that this hydraulic lime could be produced using a traditional kiln at a low cost.",

To overcome some drawbacks such as spontaneous crystallisation upon cooling of FA based glass and to improve its working properties, production of pyroxene based glasses from FA was undertaken. The parent glass approached the composition of CaMg0⋅75Al0⋅4Fe0⋅1Si1⋅75O6, derived from CaMg0⋅75Al0⋅5Si1⋅75O6, which belongs to diopside–Ca-Tschermak solid solutions. Cr2O3 nucleated fine grained mono mineral glass ceramics of augite were produced from the glasses comprising FA and additives of SiO2, Al2O3 and MgCO3.

The fugitive phase was burnt out during the sintering, and the shrinkage of the samples was proportional to the added volume. The lower the particle size of the fugitive phase was, the higher the shrinkage became. The properties of stoneware tiles as apparent density, linear shrinkage, modulus of rupture, porosity, roughness and water absorption were studied as function of the added fugitive phase. A reduction of the porosity was obtained when the added fugitive phase was <5 vol.-%. The modulus of rupture improvement was found in samples with higher density. The surface roughness increased by both the volume and the particle size of fugitive phase. Large added porosity volume was effectively eliminated, and the porosity was equilibrated to a fixed value related to the initial particle size of the fugitive phase. The main mechanism that contributed to the elimination of porosity during liquid assisted sintering was the gas diffusion. Large pores were hindered by the crystalline phases, and thus pore, coalescence was avoided in the porcelain stoneware.",

The authors have used two different commercial resins: one functionalised with methyl groups and the other with phenyl and methyl groups. The present paper shows that the two different resins exhibit different thermal gravimetric losses as well as a different structural evolution upon pyrolysis. After pyrolysis above 700°C, the resins are transformed into an inorganic Si–O–C material, with a higher carbon content when phenyl functionalised resin is used. The friction material components used in this study have good wettability with the resin, showing that the resin acts as an efficient binder. Pads were fabricated using the polysiloxane resin, and they were tested on carboceramic brake discs. Polysiloxane based pads show superior friction behaviour as compared to a conventional organic pad, especially at high temperature and at high energy. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature decreases the friction coefficient and increases the wear rate, but in general, the friction curves decrease their dispersion. The best overall behaviour of the material is found at a pyrolysis temperature of 700°C.",

Our set-up consists of a layer of piezoelectric sandwiched between two magnetostrictive layers. When magnetic field is applied the magnetostrictive strains and this is passed onto the piezoelectric producing a detectable voltage. We model the device using our own finite element code and calculate open circuit voltage and input impedance. Good agreement is shown with analytical formulas. We then optimise the coupling by altering the ratio of piezoelectric to magnetostrictive volume and the shape of the inner piezoelectric layer: the former effect is more important. We show that nearly equal amounts of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive give best coupling but the exact optimal ratio depends on the relative stiffnesses of the two materials. Most calculations carried out in previous literature have assumed that the magnetic field found in the device is simply the applied field. Here we show to what extent such an applied field can enter the device by simulating also the air region around the detector. The field in the device is calculated to be ∼17% less than the applied field.",

    "abstract": "This paper is a critical discussing key on previous results of the authors in the field of glass–ceramic scaffolds for tissue engineering. With the aim of developing biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve tissue functionality, glass–ceramic scaffolds were produced starting from a glass system composition enriched with traces of specific elements. The presence of one or more specific ions can modulate the better environmental conditions to favour the growth of specific specialised cells, a necessary prerequisite to originate different kinds of tissues. The main predictable use is for bone reconstruction, but other possible uses are expectable for some specific tissues (cartilage, nerve, tendons, etc.). In order to obtain the best initial tissue integration, a decisive role is played by porosity of the glass scaffold. The glass structure can generally be resorbed, leaving its volume available for tissue nodules which grow and assemble together, producing an equal volume of tissue. In bone, the action is synergically increased thanks to the phenomena of bone conduction and bone induction of the proposed porous bioactive ceramics. On the other hand, glass–ceramic scaffolds have already been appreciated as a superior material for bone healing. Compared to similar hydroxyapatite structures, the glass–ceramic ones exhibit a greater starting mechanical resistance (useful for surgical manipulations) and differently from the hydroxyapatite ones, they are resorbed more easily in time. This is a good requisite for a material to be used in bone tissue engineering. The ceramic bioactive systems can be used both in bulk and as coatings.",

A minor change of <1 mol.-% in the resulting powder composition was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry measurements. The nanosized glass powders began to shrink at 340°C, which is 50°C lower than the temperature at which micrometre sized glass powders begin shrinking. Fundamental information for the size reduction of the multicomponent glass system using dc thermal plasma technique as well as thermal behaviour was provided.",

Ammonia is adsorbed on the silica gel surface and forms a ≡Si–NH2 bond which acts as a source of in situ generation of nitrogen and decomposition of dextrose provides ultrafine carbon respectively at the reaction temperature. During a high temperature heat treatment ultrafine carbon reduces the partial pressure of oxygen required for the generation and stabilisation of silicon nitride nanowires.

The insulator-metal transition temperature T im shifted to higher temperatures when Sr content was increased. Generally, the average grain size decreased with increase in Sr content. The resistivity versus temperature curves in the metallic (ferromagnetic) and insulating (paramagnetic) region were fitted with several models. The activation energy of electrons hopping and the density of states at the Fermi level were estimated from the curve fitting. The ρ-T2 curve was found to be nearly linear in the metallic region, but the ρ-T2·5 curve deviated from linearity for x = 0·2 and 0·33. The variable range hopping model and small polaron hopping models fit well in the high temperature region. Sr substitution led to the decrease in the activation energy and the T o values.Keywords: Activation energyElectrical resistanceManganites",

Slight change of a particular sintering parameter can considerably change the microstructure as well as the electrical parameters. Structural complex grain–contact–grain is observed on Ho doped BaTiO3 ceramics, sintered from 1320 to 1380°C. The new configuration model of ceramic grain contact surfaces is presented in this paper. This model is based on Coble’s two-sphere approximation and its generalisation to ellipsoidal geometry. The integral contact surface directly influences the value of the total ceramic capacity. Fractal method is applied for intergrain contact analysis. Ceramic grains are considered to have fractal surface (as it is elsewhere in nature) and, therefore, fractal structure influences on the dielectric properties of BaTiO3 ceramics. The obtained results give better understanding of ceramic microstructure with the final aim to establish significant interrelation among processing, structural and electrical parameters.",

The TE properties are in agreement with the microstructural features, leading to lower resistivity in all the samples, compared with the solid state ones, while Seebeck coefficient is practically unchanged in all cases. As a consequence, maximum power factor values of around four times higher than those obtained in the classical solid state method have been determined.

Cation flexibility (also known as antisite defects or (dis)order structural transitions) is a unique feature of many oxide AB2O4 spinel systems in which the cations exchange their sites under external influence. This feature generates functionality in many different ways. In some cases, such as ferrites, the flexibility of zinc to occupy tetrahedral sites enhances the magnetic properties, whereas the flexibility of lithium in lithium titanate brings exotic electrochemical feature with zero strain. Similarly, cation flexibility of magnesium and aluminium makes the structure tolerant towards nuclear irradiation. Some such salient features of spinel systems are described highlighting the underlying crystal structures.Enriched with enormous chemical versatility, order–disorder structure, vacancy, interstitials and mixed-cation occupancy, 'Spinel is a world in itself'.

In this paper, we proposed a two-step doping process. Al2O3 powder was first mixed only with a part of the ZnO powder and pre-sintered. The pre-sintered powder was mixed with other additives such as Bi2O3 and the rest ZnO. Then ZnO varistor ceramics were prepared via solid state sintering processes.

Measurements were carried out at the Faculty of Atomic Physics of the Technical University of Budapest with the state-of-the-art PerkinElmer® Lambda 1050 spectrophotometer. Results: The colouring of zirconia has a major effect on dE values resulting in different colour perceptibility and acceptability. Try-in pastes, however, have no significant effects overall.

Mechanical retention is the predominant bonding mechanism between the bonding surface and the luting resin cement.",

However, the full-contour zirconia monolithic prostheses have the potentials for solving the problems. It appears that the full-contour zirconia monolithic prostheses produced through the fully digital workflow can ensure that the restorations can be closely aligned with the abutment and be easy to adjust and to wear, thus to assure the stability and accuracy of occlusal, which are crucial to the ultimate integration of the full-contour zirconia monolithic prostheses by avoiding unfavourable grinding. The newly developed full digital approach can greatly simplify the previous workflow that involved many manual operations. It improves not only the treatment efficiency but also the reliability of the prostheses by avoiding manual operational mistakes.",

Flat enamel surfaces, were prepared from human permanent incisors and were bonded to the zirconia discs. All specimens were subjected to shear bond strength test by a universal testing machine. All data were statistically analysed using one-way analysis of variance and multiple comparison least significant difference tests (α = 0.05). Hot-etching for 60 min treatment produced higher bond strengths than the other treatment. Surface treatment of zirconia with a hot-etching solution might enhance surface roughness and bond strength between zirconia and resin cement.",

    "abstract": "Zirconium carbide and oxycarbide bulks were produced via Reactive Spark Plasma Sintering (RSPS) using zirconia and carbon powders. The effects of dwell temperature, uniaxial pressure and heating rate on final chemical composition/stoichiometry were investigated. Heating rates (20–200°C min–1) had no significant effect on RSPS. The carbothermal reduction was hindered by increasing the sintering pressure. This was because of gases entrapped within the closed porosity. Under pressure-less conditions, the reaction onset started at ∼1300°C and the reduction was completed within 10 min resulting in an oxygen content as low as 1.47 at.-%. Under 16 MPa applied pressure, the reaction onset was shifted to 1830°C. Sub-micrometric zirconia powder (<0.1 µm) impacted negatively on the carbothermal reaction because of enhanced ZrO2 sintering preceding the carbothermic reaction. The RSPS reaction mechanism began with zirconia particle densifications between 900 and 1400°C followed by nucleation and growth of an intermediate O-rich ZrOC phase, between 1800 and 2100°C almost all zirconia was consumed. The ZrOC phase then reacted out its oxygen while simultaneously sintering. The results suggest that an optimised RSPS involve a two-step process employing a pressure-less SPS synthesis followed by a pressure-assisted sintering.",

In this study, Ti3AlC2 matrix composites were fabricated by SLM and pressureless sintering of an Al–TiO2–TiC–CNT system. The results show that the formation process of the sample during SLM involved the in-situ reaction of Al with TiO2 to form TiAl3 and Al2O3. TiAl3 subsequently reacted with TiC to synthesise Ti3AlC2 during the pressureless sintering process. Results also show that variations of the laser power had a correlated effect on the element, and by increasing or decreasing the laser power three distinctive areas could be seen on the sample: the TiAl3/TiC composite area, the unreacted area and alumina area according to the phase composition. As the laser power increased, the TiAl3/TiC composite area increased, the unreacted area decreased and the chemical reaction between the material components became more sufficient. The laser power also had a significant influence on the surface topography of the SLM sample. When the laser power increased from 40 to 60 W, the surface morphology of the sample evolved from the initial disordered network to the mutually stacked structure perpendicular to the scanning direction and eventually became uniformly distributed.",

SEM revealed many regular microgrooves structured on the surface by laser irradiation. Some nano-columns and nano-holes were found on the side walls of the groove. SBS test results showed that pretreatment of the femtosecond laser and the conjunctive use of a femtosecond laser and silica coating significantly improved SBS (13.769 ± 1.570 MPa and 13.516 ± 1.759 MPa) between zirconia and resin.

Furthermore, micro-EPD experiments in external alternating current (AC) fields (micro-AC-EPD) using video microscopy come to the conclusion that the observed formations of microvortices are in accordance to the numerically modelled streamline patterns. Finally, the formation of AC-EPD microdeposits exhibiting a torus-like microstructure is substantially explained based on microfluidic streamline pattern analysis.",

The effects of the carbon and silicon contents of the starting materials as well as the sintering temperature and time on the thermal conductivities and microstructures of the ceramic materials were studied. The thermal conductivities and microstructures of the samples were characterised using thermal conductivity measurements, X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and mercury injection porosimetry. The results showed that sintering temperature and time as well as the carbon and silicon contents of the green specimens are the main factors affecting the microstructure and porosity of reaction bonded SiC ceramics. Increasing the reaction temperature and time decreased the porosity of the ceramics. This was due to the infiltration of the silicon melt into the ceramic specimens. The thermal conductivity and porosity of the sample sintered at 1550°C for 3 h in an argon atmosphere were 102·5 W m K −1 and 0·3% respectively.",

Refractory degradation is of such high significance that improved refractory durability was ranked first by industry experts in a list of 20 research and development areas related to the economic viability of gasification. Therefore, for improvement of the reliability and durability of refractory linings, this work is dealing with the corrosion resistance of nine commercial refractories to a variety of emissions from potential fuels. The refractories were exposed to a gasifier-like, water vapour and alkali rich atmosphere. Exposures with a duration of 250 h produced corrosion effects that were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations were included to further explain the equilibrium chemistry. The results show that extremely low silica refractories are promising candidates for gasifier utilisation.",

To detect such an event on the structure, a piezoelectric wireless sensor network has to be developed. Therefore the feasibility of an innovative technique based on a piezoelectric harvesting device is presented. The system carries out structural health monitoring tasks using piezoelectric transducers bonded onto the structure and is also fully autonomous since the same transducers are used to convert the mechanical vibrations of the structure into electrical power. As vibrations are not available during the production process, the autonomy of the system is provided thanks to a Lamb wave emitter located in the sensor array. After measurements, the system is able to harvest 7·36 milli-watts for a 100 milli-watts mechanical power applied to the structure. This electrical power can be used both by the electronic detector and the WIFI transmitter for the detection of impacts of less than 1 Joule.",

The recent development on transformation toughening by addition of CeO2, Y2O3, MgO or CaO to zirconia in alumina matrixes offers a new generation ceramics with improved mechanical properties. The stabilisation of tetragonal or metastable tetragonal phases much depends on the type of additives, mole concentration and the processing route adopted. The present paper describes the synthesis of ultra fine powders of CeO2 based tetragonal or metastable tetragonal zirconia polycrystals for developing suitable toughening characteristics of advanced ceramic composites of α-Al2O3 matrixes with particular concentration of Ce TZP by wet chemical simultaneous precipitation process. The degree of stabilisation of different percentages by mole varying from 6 to 12 mol.-%CeO2 based zirconia polycrystal ceramics and advanced composites of α-Al2O3 matrixes with 10 wt-% Ce stabilised tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (Ce TZP) was studied through thermal and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.

Bioactivity of all samples has been proved in vitro by the presence of new layer of apatite-like phases formed after soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF). The development and the apatitic character of created layers have been demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared analysis. Scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis have demonstrated that the density and the thickness of new layer depend on P2O5 content, crystallisation temperature and immersion time. The bioactivity has been enhanced by P2O5 addition as well in the case of the base glasses as in the case of glass ceramics. The additional heat treatment appeared to inhibit the bioactive behaviour, though the longer SBF acting leads to the additional formation of apatite-like layer. The mechanical properties, expressed as Vicker hardness, have been found higher and increasing with P2O5 in glass ceramics treated at 750°C comparatively with base glass samples and the highest value of 7˙37 GPa has been achieved by 14 wt-%P2O5 addition. The same content of P2O5 in glass ceramics heat treated at 550°C resulted in a decrease in hardness to a minimum value from all samples. The increase and decrease in hardness responded to development and suppression of crystallisation respectively. The inhibition of crystallisation has been affected by the presence of 'amorphous' FA according to X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis results.Keywords: GLASSESGLASS CERAMICSVICKER HARDNESSBIOACTIVITY",

Bubbling microstructure of enamels was studied using optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) along with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. Also, enamel adherence strength, chemical durability and corrosion mechanisms were explained by the remains of the enamel on the destroyed surface and by Fourier transform infrared reflectance (FTIR) respectively. The results showed that the CCE composition had a coarser bubble structure than the CFE one and exhibited better adherence properties.

A positive voltage was obtained when the sample was cooled from 20°C to −190°C, while a negative voltage was obtained when the sample was heated from −190°C to 180°C. The difference between the positive and negative values depended on the thermal stress. Compressive stress generated a more positive voltage in the cooling process, while tensile stress led to a more negative voltage in the heating process. The voltage values also depended on the cooling (or heating) rate of the sample, e.g. the greater the cooling (or heating) rate, the greater the voltage. When cyclic loading was conducted mechanically at −190°C, the voltage reduced, but it was recovered after heating to 20°C. Damage of the PZT ceramic (90° domain switching) was detected when the sample was cooled to −190°C due to the high thermal stress.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports the 3D printing of fibre-reinforced ceramic composite with hierarchical structures. Through printing precursor formulation, short SiC fibres have been successfully incorporated into silicate materials and gradient porous hierarchical structure has been achieved for the printed parts. The mechanical testing shows a 27% improvement in impact strength, 22% improvement in flexural modulus, and 7.5% in flexural strength compared with parts without fibre reinforcement. High-resolution tomography analysis using x-ray microscopy shows that the inner structure has a porosity of 27%, while the outer layer shows a dense structure with little pores formation. This 3D printed ceramic composite with fibre-reinforcement shows high similarity to the gradient porous structures of human bone and tooth. The results indicate that 3D printing of nano/microfibre reinforced ceramic composite with hierarchical structure is a promising method to enhance the fracture toughness of ceramics and allow accurate patient-specific customisation for their implants.",

The viscosity and yield stress values of Al2O3 Al doped Y-PSZ suspensions were higher than those of Al2O3 Y-PSZ ones for all the compositions and solid loading studied. This behaviour could be explained by a larger effective size of the Al doped Y-PSZ particles, which resulted in a higher effective solid volume fraction and a lower amount of free liquid available for flow.

With the increase in Ti3SiC2 volume contents, Vickers hardness of the composites decreases because of the low hardness of monolithic Ti3SiC2. The fracture toughness rises remarkably when the contents of Ti3SiC2 increase, which is attributed to the pullout and microplastic deformation of Ti3SiC2 grains. At the same time, the flexural strength of the composites shows a considerable improvement as well. The electrical conductivity rises significantly as the Ti3SiC2 contents increase because of the formation of Ti3SiC2 network and the increase in conductive phase contents.",

Brushite cements are more soluble than hydroxyapatite (HA) in physiological conditions and as such can be more rapidly resorbed. The metastable nature of brushite means that it converts to HA following immersion in physiological conditions. This phase change reduces the resorption rate, resulting in long term stability. In this study, macropores were incorporated into brushite cement to accelerate degradation, preventing hydrolysis and long term stability. The incorporation of beads into the cement had no effect on the composition of the cement. By varying the proportion of beads in the cement, it was possible to control degradation and prevent the formation of HA within the cement. Interestingly, in the macroporous cement, after 14 days of aging, the only crystalline component was β-tricalcium phosphate, suggesting that an amorphous binding phase was formed following brushite dissolution; this phase may maintain the integrity of the cement.",

The well synthesised whiskers were of several hundreds of nanometres in diameter and a few hundreds of micrometres in length. Although the morphology and its size distribution are mainly determined by the reaction temperature and holding time, they can also be tailored by controlling the reaction atmosphere. The ratio of staring materials has no significant influence on the morphology of β-SiAlON whiskers. The growth of β-SiAlON whiskers follows a vapour–solid mechanism, and the formation of the belt-like whiskers is attributed to an anisotropic growth at the early nucleation/growth stage.",

    "abstract": "Porous Si3N4-based ceramics with different TiO2 contents were prepared by gas pressure sintering method. The effects of TiO2 addition ranging from 0 to 25 wt-% on the phase compositions, microstructures, mechanical performance and dielectric properties were investigated. The addition of TiO2 significantly promoted the density which increased from 1.64 to about 2.3 g cm−3. The mechanical properties of porous Si3N4-based ceramics with TiO2 addition decreased first and then increased with the increase of TiO2 content, and the flexural strength and elastic modulus are more than 167.4 MPa and 72.8 GPa, respectively, which were higher than that of the Si3N4 ceramic without TiO2 addition. With the increase of TiO2 content, both the dielectric constant and dielectric loss increased, and the dielectric constant enhanced obviously. These results suggested that the TiO2 was beneficial for the improvement of mechanical properties and dielectric constant of porous Si3N4-based ceramics.",

The maximum power can be predicted and the number of piezoelectric elements can be calculated to achieve a given power value. The VI system controls the test bench (patent protected), which simulates the effect of the road traffic, and obtains the Fourier model of the PDUT. The VI controls the switched circuit's matrix of the harvesting electronic hardware (HEH) to select the PDUTs and the rectifier topology. The VI also connects capacitors and load resistors of the HEH and computes the key parameters of the piezoelectric harvester model.",

While dense and highly crystallised monoliths may be achieved by sintering pressed glass powders just at the glass crystallisation temperature (TC), applying fast heating and short holding times, dense glass-ceramic beads could be obtained only by firing well above Tc (Tc + 100°C). An increased sintering temperature was applied in order to enhance the viscous flow and promote the spheroidisation of powder clusters, previously formed by casting fine powders on a rotating drum. The high degree of crystallinity and the uniform microstructure were found to contribute positively to the mechanical properties (compressive strength exceeding 120 MPa, for beads with a diameter of 1 mm, approximately).",

Aluminium nitride powders could be densified without any sintering additives by electric current assisted sintering. Sintering additives, Y2O3 or CaF2, and others are effective for densification, increase in thermal conductivity and transparency. As a result of the reaction with the sintering additives and oxide on the surface of the AlN powder, a secondary phase forms between AlN grains, oxygen impurity between aluminium nitride grains decreases and thermal conductivity increases. These mechanisms are effective in the sintering of aluminium nitride ceramics densified by electric current assisted sintering, though sintering time is short, within 5 min. The secondary phase formation does not always give good effect for transparency.",

Mechanical properties, such as indentation hardness and elastic modulus of the interface layer, parent alumina and spinel parts, were measured and compared by nanoindentation method. According to the results, several microstructural factors including initial alumina raw powders, the intrinsic microstructural inhomogeneity of the interlayers, such as presence of porosities, unresolved hard alumina phase in the microstructures, size of columnar grains and position of grain boundaries were proposed to affect the mechanical properties. Different micromechanical results between the regions of the samples were also attributed to generation of residual compressive stress during grinding and polishing of the surfaces.",

MnZn ferrite powders with a composition of Zn0·8Mn0·2Fe2O4 (wt-%) were sintered under coupled multiphysical fields applied by Gleeble-1500D thermal simulation instrument. Cylindrical bulk ferrites with a diameter of 2·5 mm and a height of 2·5 mm were prepared, and the effect of heating rate on densification and magnetic properties of MnZn ferrites was studied. The results show that the densification and magnetic properties of MnZn ferrite were directly affected by the heating rates.

Such magnetic properties as maximum energy product and remanence of MnZn ferrite sintered under coupled multiphysical fields are improved when compared to samples produced by conventional sintering. In particular, a 204·39% increase in maximum energy product is obtained. Finally, the densification mechanisms of multiphysical fields sintering method are discussed.",

However, porous ceramic membranes with permeability usually suffer from low mechanical strength.

In this paper, to avoid a trade-off between mechanical strength and permeability, we attempt to enhance these parameters by incorporating diatomite as both a pore former and a bonding phase. Because the flexural strength and air permeability of alumina support layers cannot be enhanced simultaneously by just changing the sintering temperature, we investigate whether they can be controlled by changing the amount of added diatomite. We study the effectiveness of diatomite as both a pore former and a bonding phase through a comparison of alumina–diatomite and the alumina–pyrophyllite composite support layers.",

However, Mg2SiO4 and Mg-rich phases were detected in the microstructure of CSZ doped with 5 and 10 mol-% MgO, respectively. Ionic conductivity increased with an increase in MgO content, and CSZ doped with 5 mol-% MgO exhibited a maximum value of 0.819 S cm−1 measured at 1500°C due to the scavenging of Si impurities. The thermal diffusivity increased from 0.517 (CSZ) to 0.649 mm2 s−1 (5 mol-% doped CSZ), and the thermal expansion coefficient of 0.5 mol-% doped CSZ was maximal at 9.855 μm/m°C. The value of mol-% doped CSZ decreased to 8.937 μm/m°C as it was affected by the Mg–Si phase formation.",

All of the LSMO:Agx samples showed rhombohedral perovskite structure with a space group of . The diffraction peaks of metallic Ag did not appear in the XRD graph, due to the Ag substitution at A sites (La3+ or Sr2+ ions) and the evaporation loss of the element Ag in the process of high-temperature sintering, or the residual amount of Ag beyond the sensitivity of the XRD. With the increase of Ag addition, unit cell volume (V), metal−insulator transition temperature (Tp) and conductivity at Tp (ρTp) of the LSMO:Agx samples increased significantly. At the same time, the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR%), temperature peak of the TCR% (Tk) and the figure of merit (Z) reached the optimal values of 3.3% K−1, 367 K and 0.049 at x = 0.3. Ag substitution at A sites (La3+ or Sr2+ ions) and gathering at grain boundaries (GBs) were proposed to explain the existence of Ag addition. All results suggested that the enhancement of electrical properties was due to silver-doping and it increased the bond angles of Mn−O−Mn (θMn−O−Mn ) and the bond distance of Mn−O (dMn−O), improving Mn4+ concentration, grain sizes and GBs connectivity in LSMO:Agx ceramics.",

    "abstract": "The volume erosion rate of the slip cast monolithic and composite ceramics was studied using SiO 2 and SiC particles as erodents, under different impact angles (30°, 60°, 90°), at room temperature. Therefore, three groups of samples were prepared: (i) monolithic alumina (Al 2 O 3 ); (ii) composite alumina–zirconia (Al 2 O 3 –ZrO 2 ) containing 99 wt-% Al 2 O 3 and 1 wt-% ZrO 2 and (iii) composite alumina–zirconia (Al 2 O 3 –ZrO 2 ) containing 90 wt-% Al 2 O 3 and 10 wt-% ZrO 2 . Erosion mechanisms of all prepared ceramic samples were evaluated by the volume erosion rate ([Formula: see text], mm 3 ·g –1 ). Obtained results were compared with the analytical Wiederhorn and Evans equations. The mechanical properties (hardness and fracture toughness) of prepared ceramic samples were compared with their [Formula: see text] under the above-mentioned conditions. It was found that the erosion of monolithic and composite ceramics increased with the increase of the impact angle. Volume erosion rate was highest at an impact angle of 90° and amounts to 115 mm 3 ·g –1 with SiC, and 12 mm 3 ·g –1 with SiO 2 erodent particles for monolithic alumina ceramics, 77 mm 3 ·g –1 with SiC, and 8 mm 3 ·g –1 with SiO 2 erodent particles for ceramics with the addition of 1 wt-% of ZrO 2 , and 61 mm 3 ·g –1 with SiC, and 7 mm 3 ·g –1 with SiO 2 erodent particles for ceramics with the addition of 10 wt-% of ZrO 2 . Therefore, it can be concluded that the erosion resistance of monolithic Al 2 O 3 increases with the increasing amount of ZrO 2 in the composite Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 ceramics, thus erosion resistance can be improved with the addition of ZrO 2 .",

A specially designed injection mould was used for shaping feedstocks containing a paraffin wax–oleic acid binder system with a mixture of ceramic powders. Many thousands of thin walled tubes were injection moulded to optimise the process parameters. Using a two stage wicking–thermal debinding process, the post-moulding processing time was decreased to approximately a seventh of the total required when binder removal was accomplished using only a thermal treatment. Characterisation of starting materials and zirconia tubes was conducted using thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, dilatometry and density and size measurements. Performance of the injection moulded tubes was tested using oxygen activity measurements in molten steel under industrial steelmaking conditions. Excellent results were obtained in terms of oxygen concentration, electromotive force and soluble aluminium content, with good reproducibility and high accuracy. The proposed injection moulding process is very promising and provides an important alternative for mass production of oxygen sensor tubes.",

The experimental studies, performed with polycrystalline yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ), include in situ monitoring of charge transfer at the oxygen/zirconia interface using work function measurements and determination of mass transport at the oxygen/zirconia interface using the incorporation of oxygen isotope 18O and its analysis using secondary ion mass spectrometry. Oxidation of YSZ at room temperature is found to result in oxygen chemisorption, leading to the formation of singly ionised molecular oxygen species, and subsequent oxygen incorporation into the lattice. Oxygen incorporation takes place by lattice diffusion from the entire surface exposed to the gas phase, resulting in oxygen penetration of depths of the order of 2 nm over 60 days, and diffusion of oxygen species along the surface from the adsorption sites towards grain boundaries with subsequent rapid diffusion of oxygen into the bulk along grain boundaries. These processes take place in the absence of an electronic conductor. The present findings contradict the widely held perceptions that YSZ at room temperature is quenched and not reactive, and that oxygen incorporation into YSZ requires the presence of a triphase boundary (TPB) formed by the gas phase (oxygen), electronic conductor and oxygen ionic conductor (zirconia).",

Highly dense and crystalline ceramics, predominantly composed of protoenstatite and clioenstatite together with small amounts of residual glassy phase, were obtained after sintering at a low temperature such as 1200°C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that large pores were seen in B2O3 free samples, while pore elimination and enhancement of densification for B2O3 added compacts were promoted by the viscous flow of B2O3. Bending strength of the steatite ceramics increased with B2O3 content.

Optimum flow characteristics were achieved using water addition of 4·6 wt-%. This batch was sintered at different firing temperatures up to 1500°C. To understand the effect of both firing temperatures and corresponding phases, the present castable was characterised in terms of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, bulk density (BD), apparent porosity (AP), water absorption (WA), cold crushing strength (CCS) and self-leveling flowability. The results revealed that gradual increase in firing temperature from 1100 through 1500°C caused low AP and WA, and high CCS properties due to the densification of the castable.Keywords: Refractory materialAlumina castableFiring temperatureMicrosilicaCharacterisationSelf-flowing",

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate defect sites, such as nitrogen (VN) and boron (VB) vacancies, bind favourably to olefins, hydrogen, and oxygen. In particular, the visible fluorescence intensity of processed h-BN increased with the length of exposure to air. The fluorescence behaviour of dh-BN powders when exposed to air after exposure to species such as argon, propene, and carbon dioxide is presented. Density of state calculations for molecular and atomic oxygen bound to VN and VB show that this increase in fluorescence may be due to atomic oxygen binding to VN. The fluorescence emission behaviour observed in dh-BN powders and its relationship to DOS of oxygen species bound to catalytically active defect sites provides a better understanding of potential deactivation modes for catalysts based on dh-BN.",

    "abstract": "Since invented in 1980s, cold spraying (CS) has received numerous attentions recently because of its low heat input and high efficiency. Severe plastic deformation induced by high-velocity impaction makes the particles with temperature below the melting point deposited on the substrate. Theoretically, the coating obtained by CS is dense and free of oxidation, so excellent thermal and electrical conductivity can be obtained, which is ideal for ceramic metallisation (CM). Many studies have been done on the CS CM to study the coating structures, bonding mechanism and performances. Mechanical occlusion is considered to be the main bonding type at the interface, local melting plays a small role in the bonding, but local melting improves the bonding strength significantly. However, the specific bonding mechanism of CS CM is still unclear, especially in some metal/ceramic systems with bonding strength greater than 10 MPa, the bonding mechanisms need to be further studied. CS is also difficult to metallise some ceramics, which requires complicated design. Thus, aiming to improve the reliability and the extent of the application of CS CM, a thorough review should be made. In the present paper, the bonding mechanisms of CS metal coating on ceramic proposed by previous researches were summarised to help the researchers a better and quicker understanding for the CS CM. The factors influencing the properties were introduced. The author also made an outlook for the future development of CS in CM.",

Here, a ZnO surface treatment for lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic particles is presented that enhances the interfacial bonding between PZT and polymer to allow mechanically robust composite films to be created that exhibit d33 piezoelectric coefficient of 15 pC/N after corona poling at 100°C.

Results indicate that when the indentation depth is <0·5 mm, the C/SiCs reveal the linear elastic behaviour with invisible damage for three NDT methods. Once the indentation depth is >0·75 mm, thermal images and ultrasonic C scan are able to detect the obvious damage, while X-ray radiography did not detect any damage up to the indentation depth of 1·5 mm.

It is found that the fibre volume fraction, the fibre/matrix interfacial properties and the microstructures of the composites are all important in determining the strength of the material and their fracture mechanism. This investigation revealed the existence of microcracks and interfacial debonding caused by stress concentration and differential contraction between fibre and matrix during the moulding process, which in turn affected the mechanical properties. This evaluation used chopped fibres (alkali resistant glass fibre) as the reinforcement with fibre volume fraction varied under optimised moulding conditions (temperature and pressure). In addition, a selected matrix formulation was used for the analysis of the microstructural behaviour of the moulded composite while its fracture surface was analysed. The results showed that the composite stress–strain behaviour and the residual stresses associated with moulding could be controlled by the moulding process and volume fractions. This is supported by the results of residual stress simulation and analysis between the fibre/matrix interfaces.",

Particularly, FeTiO3 can be transformed into TiN–Fe composite completely at 900°C for 60 min by microwave heating. The increase in both the reaction temperature and dwelling time is in favour of the transformation of FeTiO3. The product morphologies are spherical about 2–5 μm in size. Then TiN is obtained with the removal of Fe and their oxides from TiN–Fe composite by acid leaching treatment. This method not only reduces the reaction temperature significantly through microwave heating but also can simplify the operation process effectively.",

Optical and scanning electron microscopes were used to characterise specimen damage. The test results were compared to its counterparts in 1200°C (isothermal) laboratory air environment. At a given creep life, the applied creep stress for both the notch types was generally lower in the combustion environment than the laboratory air environment. Finite element simulations attributed lower applied creep stress in the combustion environment to the presence of thermal gradient stresses, which were not present in the isothermal laboratory air environment.",

Cold crushing strength of the green samples was measured and hydration behaviour was studied using differential thermal analysis (DTA). After firing at 1550°C for 3 h, the compositions of the fired samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction. Sintering parameters (bulk density and apparent porosity) and mechanical (cold crushing strength) as well as refractory (thermal shock resistance, permanent linear change, load bearing capacity) properties were tested according to standard specifications. It was concluded that increasing content of added SiC results in an improvement in sintering, mechanical and refractory properties but adversely affects green strength. However, castables containing 6 wt.-% SiC show a reasonable compromise between acceptable green strength and improved sintering, mechanical and refractory properties. The improved properties of the fired samples are related to the formation of SiC-mullite system in the matrix.Keywords: HIGH ALUMINA CASTABLESMULLITEREFRACTORY PROPERTIESSILLICON CARBIDESINTERING",

Well developed fluorophlogopite with randomly oriented crystals within the glassy phase acts as a reinforcing aid. Hexacelsian crystallises at or below 900°C and then transforms into monoclinic celsian by epitaxial growth. Formation of fluorophlogopite enhances the transformation of hexacelsian to monocelsian. The best conditions for simultaneous crystallisation of a fluorophlogopite and celsian phase mixture are a heating rate of 5 K min−1 and cooling rate of 10 K min−1 between 700 and 930°C. A marked shift in the positions of XRD peaks for celsian occurs as a result of the substitutional solid solution between Ba2+ and K+. Crystallisation of forsterite disappears in the mix with highest silica content. Microhardness decreases at temperatures above 950°C because of transformation of hexacelsian into celsian and the decrease in fluorophlogopite content.",

    "abstract": "We report on a new approach to increase the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth. We propose a preparation of horizontal internal plateau (IP) in dentine and the use of retentive zirconia posts to achieve a more favourable load transmission. The aim of our work was to investigate the effect of the IP depth and the post diameter on the fracture resistance and the failure mode of maxillary central incisors. Seventy-two teeth were, divided into six groups of 12. IP 4 mm in diameter and 0, 1 or 2 mm in depth was prepared and zirconia posts of two diameters luted. Specimens were loaded until failure and fractures were classified as reparable or not. Two-way ANOVA, Tukey's HSD test and Poisson regression were used for statistical analysis (α = 0.05). Significantly improved fracture resistance and predominantly favourable failure modes were found when 2-mm deep IP is prepared.",

Definite self-glazed zirconia crowns were delivered by superimposing the abutment teeth and modified temporary crowns in situ. Such novel zirconia crowns were formed by net-shape manufacturing process following biogeneric copying of the provisional crowns. The restorations represented functionally tailored hierarchical structures exhibiting superior smoothness on the surface without conventional manual work of grinding, polishing and veneering.

This work shows that it is necessary to use Al particle sizes below 10 µm for them to function as an active filler below 900°C.

The hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate ratio of the porous scaffolds was varied using different ratios of starting materials while keeping the Ca/P ratio fixed (1.5). A water glass coating on the porous Ca–P scaffolds increased the compressive strength by 45% without significantly decreasing the porosity of the H100D50 scaffold. The maximum compressive strength, ∼15 MPa, was achieved on the H100D50 scaffold. The ability for apatite formation in simulated body fluid was amplified by the water glass coating on the sintered Ca–P scaffolds.

The effects of the deviation of overall electric resistance on total power consumption were analysed. The temperature at which a falling inflection point of the power supply was observed can be used as an indicator of the minimum temperature required for densification.

In TiC/Ni composites, hollow spheres of 50–200 μm were produced, and their walls were composed of large TiC grains and small Ni particles. A larger average size of the spheres was observed in the samples prepared under high gravity compared with those obtained under normal gravity. Phase segregation was observed under high gravity, and Ni was enriched in the lower part of the samples. It is proposed that the mobility and collision frequency of liquid droplets will increase, and thus, the agglomeration of primary droplets can be enhanced under high gravity.",

    "abstract": "Indium tin oxide (ITO) ceramics with high densities are difficult to achieve using conventional heating because of the volatilisation of both indium oxide and tin oxide at high temperatures. In our present study, we proposed to use a Sb2O3 doped and microwave hybrid sintering approach to prepare for ITO ceramics. The effects of the Sb2O3 content on the microstructure, densification and electrical properties of ITO ceramics were investigated. The results show that the relative density has reached 98·3% by using the hybrid sintering approach. The resistivity of the obtained ceramics showed a decrease tendency with increasing Sb2O3 content in the range of 0–1·5 wt-%. We speculate that the formation of electrons and vacancies caused by the doping of Sb2O3 and the ‘microwave effect’ might be the main reason responsible for the increase in the densification. As a result, these, in turn, further enhanced the electronic conductivity of the obtained ITO ceramics.",

The WC-Al 2 O 3 -GPLs composites were fabricated to design advanced tool materials to acquire an optimum set of mechanical, thermal and anti-wear properties for high-temperature cutting tool applications. This study has the novelty that such composites have not been developed using SPS. The addition of GPLs to composites enhanced the microstructure, however the optimum mechanical and thermal properties were exhibited with the composite having lesser addition of GPLs. At higher levels of GPLs addition, the microstructures and properties of composites were degraded on account of stacking/agglomeration of GPLs. It was observed that SPS delivered better densification and microstructures as compared to other conventional sintering. The mechanical properties were best revealed by the sample with 0.6 wt. % of GPLs with hardness of 20.71 GPa and fracture toughness of 11.84 MPa.m 1/2 . The improved toughening and strengthening results of WC-Al 2 O 3 -GPLs composites were essentially acquired by inhibiting grain growth during sintering, bridging of GPLs between matrix components, and improved dispersion of composite constituents (EPMA/WDS), particle hardening and phase toughening (Al 2 O 3 , GPLs). A thermal study was conducted to investigate the thermal stability of sintered composites at higher temperatures while providing the maximum thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of 166 Wm −1 K −1 and 0.276 × 10 −4 m 2 s −1 at room temperatures. The tribological testing revealed that the composites with lesser GPLs reinforcement attributed lower coefficients of friction, better surface finish and least wear of the materials.",

The pyrolysed mango, jackfruit and teak were characterised in terms of pyrolysis weight loss, shrinkages, bulk density and microstructures. The end ceramics were light weight and found to have porosities in the range of 35·5–54·5 vol.-% depending on the preform carbon density and infiltration temperatures. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging confirmed the preservation of cellular tissue anatomy of the precursor wood structure in the morphologies of final ceramics. The cellular porous SiC ceramics from mango, jackfruit and teak exhibited excellent oxidation resistance during heating to 1350°C in flowing air. Porous SiC mango gives the highest porosity with more than 80% pores being in the range of 0·5–11·58 μm and an average pore diameter of 7·82 μm, while the lowest porosity is obtained in the case of porous SiC jackfruit which has a mean pore diameter of 7 μm with ∼89% of pores in the range of 0·51–11·56 μm, indicating that the cellular porous SiC ceramic possesses application potential in the hot gas filtration area.Keywords: DICOTYLEDONOUS WOODPOROUS SIC CERAMICSCELLULAR MORPHOLOGYPORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION",

The effects of cement and magnesia on spinel and hibonite formation in the castable, alumina content of spinel, and associated physical changes after exposure to high temperature were studied. The presence of a larger quantity of fines in added magnesia was found to help increase spinel formation, with greater permanent linear change (PLC), provided cement content was not too high. Considering spinel formation and PLC, it appears that optimum levels are 3% cement for 50% of fines in magnesia or 4% cement for 34% of fines in magnesia, for a total addition of 6% magnesia. No clear combined effect of cement content and fines content in added magnesia on alumina content of spinel could be found. It is observed in general only that alumina content of spinel increases with increasing firing temperature. From these findings it is evident that increase in liquid phase to a certain level helps in increasing spinel formation and expansion characteristics. However for increasing alumina content of the spinel formed, it is found that temperature is more effective than increase in the liquid phase content.",

In this paper, the dependence of deposition parameters on phase evolution in Sr deficient SBT thin films is studied. Only when bismuth is over stoichiometric (Sr0.74Bi2.2Ta2O9+x) can one obtain pure SBT structure. Decreasing the Bi content encourages formation of the Bi deficient pyrochlore phase. At 1.04 of Bi, only the pyrochlore phase forms. The pyrochlore phase is very stable even at 900°C.",

    "abstract": "A well known route to making tough silicon nitride compositions is to control the grain size and aspect ratio distributions. This is usually done by choosing the appropriate powder characteristics, sintering conditions, as well as sintering additives. The effect of hot pressing a blend of nano and micrometre scale silicon nitride powder is explored here. Microstructures and mechanical properties are determined for these hot pressed ceramics and are compared with a reference silicon nitride. Hardness and fracture toughness are determined at room temperature using hardness indents produced by a macro Vickers hardness indenter. Grain size and aspect ratio distributions and their impact on mechanical properties are presented. Blending of nano and micrometre scale powder is shown to result in a refined microstructure with an increase in the area/volume fraction of finer grains. Rising R curves are established for these ceramics demonstrating toughening behaviour. Crack bridging and crack path deviation are identified as possible toughening mechanisms.",

The characteristics of the membrane were analysed in terms of the effect of particle size and sintering temperature on porosity, pore size and microstructure. The porosity and pore size decreased as the sintering temperature increased. With increasing particle diameter, pore size and porosity increased. Broad non-Gaussian pore distribution in the ceramic matrix was turned into a narrow Gaussian distribution when the particle size was reduced. It showed that finer particles result in a very smooth outer surface of the support system. The porous support was further characterised in terms of permeability of water at specified condition where an experimental set-up was developed to perform the permeability studies.",

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation shows that the partially sintered samples have the same density under different heating procedures, which demonstrates that the assumptions of the model are reliable. The concept of the MSC could be used to predict the sintering shrinkage and final density and calculate the activation energy. A value of 105 kJ mol-1 for TiO2 was obtained. The MSC could be applied to predict the sintering profile to prepare ceramics with required density and a minimum of grain growth.",

The reactivity is considered in terms of surface properties studied using surface sensitive tools and their effect on adsorption of oxygen and water, and the related charge transfer. There is a general agreement that defected surfaces exhibit substantially enhanced reactivity over perfect surfaces. In other words, surface defects, such as oxygen vacancies and Ti interstitials are the local surface sites, which are responsible for reactivity with water and oxygen. However, the reported reactivity mechanisms on specific surface sites and the related charge transfer are conflicting. The proposed reactivity models are also not consistent with the present state of understanding of TiO2 reactivity with water and the related charge transfer. The apparent discrepancy is due to the difference between the specific environment applied in surface studies, which often requires the imposition of high vacuum, and that related to their performance in electrochemical cells.",

The crystallisation and microstructure of Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2 (LAS) glass–ceramic with nucleating agents (B2O3 and/or P2O5) are investigated by differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy and the effects of B2O3 and P2O5 on the crystallisation of LAS glass are also analysed. The introduction of both B2O3 and P2O5 promotes the crystallisation of LAS glass by decreasing the crystallisation temperature and adjusting the crystallisation kinetic parameters, allows a direct formation of β spodumene phase and as a result, increases the crystallinity of the LAS glass ceramic. Microstructural observations show that the randomly oriented, nanometre sized crystalline is found with residual glass concentrated at crystallite boundaries. Furthermore, it is interesting that codoping of B2O3 and P2O5 creates not much effect on the crystallisation temperature. The dielectric properties of the glass–ceramics formed through controlled crystallisation have a strong dependence on the phases that are developed during heat treatment. The dielectric constant is continuously increased and the dielectric loss is decreased with addition of additives where mobile alkali metal ions (e.g. Li+) are incorporated in a crystal phase and minimise the residual glass phase.",

Thermal strain with maximum value of ∼0·117% and mechanical strain with maximum value of ∼0·029% were directly measured on a progressively increasing baseline strain from 0·354 to 0·670%. The thermal strain and mechanical strain were found to have an approximately linear relationship with the temperature and stress respectively; and to be in quantitative agreement with the calculated results using the proposed semiempirical formulas. The baseline strain was considered to be damage dependent and could increase with accumulated damage. It is observed that the thermal and mechanical load cycling in an O2–Ar mixture could cause the coating/matrix cracks, the degradation of the interfaces, fibre oxidation, and an increase in the baseline strain of the composites by widening crack opening displacement due to larger interfacial debonding and fibre sliding, and reducing effective load bearing area of the fibres.Keywords: CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITESFATIGUETHERMAL CYCLINGMICROSTRUCTURE",

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in one-dimensional strain that the material can be loaded and recovered for post-mortem examination. Failure is by microfracture, which is a function of the defects and then cracking activated by plasticity mechanisms within the grains and failure at grain boundaries in the amorphous intergranular phase.

The in situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to assess the chemical composition and chemical state of the SiOxNy films. N 1s XPS spectra reveals that at least three characteristic N bonding states such as N≡Si3, N–(SiOx)3 and N = Si2–O bonds are formed in the SiOxNy films. As growth time increases, the N–(SiOx)3 bond is dominant in SiOxNy films, although N≡Si3 bonds are mainly formed in the initial growth stage at the temperature of 600°C. As considering the absence of direct bonding between N and O atoms, the nitridation and oxidation processes are believed to proceed independently. The increase in the growth temperature leads to the breakdown of both N–(SiOx)3 and N≡ = Si3 bonds and transformation into N = Si2–O bonding structure.",

The starting materials used in this investigation are local raw clay and chemical aluminium oxide (Al2O3). Based on a previous geological survey carried out by the industrial research centre (Tripoli), four different clay samples were selected from different locations of the south of Libya. Representative samples of the four selected clays were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis. The four clay samples were used separately together with aluminium oxide to prepare six different batches containing different proportions of alumina from 0 up to 60% with an increament of 10%. The mullite containing bodies were investigated through their mineralogical compositions using XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) attached with energy dispersive X-ray unit (EDX). The sintering, mechanical and refractory properties of the prepared mullite containing bodies were tested according to the international standard specifications. It is concluded that the densification, mechanical and refractory properties are improved as the alumina content increases on the expense of clay. Mixes containing 60% clay : 40% alumina and 50% clay : 50% alumina respectively, especially those prepared from Agar clay are characterised with good sintering, high mechanical and high refractory properties.",

Hollow spheres were formed due to self-assembled aggregation of zinc ion complexes and formation of internal voids with Ostwald ripening mechanism. These internal spaces can be filled and the spheres may enlarge, due to diffusion of the ionic complexes of the solution toward the surface of the initial particles and Kirkendall effect. This phenomenon was supposed to cause the mentioned size distribution in the outer diameters of the hollow spheres and their internal voids. The fabricated nanostructured spheres showed an ultraviolet A (UVA) luminescence and an intense yellow emission in the visible band which can be attributed to the low density of oxygen defects on the surface of the synthesised particles.",

The present study targets the full characterisation of both soft-doped and hard-doped lead zirconate titanate (PZT) up to 200°C. A simple set of tests and test results are presented, focusing particularly on dielectric losses and creep effect. Dielectric losses were found to decrease with the increasing field for soft-doped PZT, while they tend to increase for hard-doped PZT. The interpretation is that soft-doped PZT has less hysteresis at high field. The creep behaviour is also significantly different. While soft-doped PZT follows a logarithmic model with low and stable creep rates, hard-doped PZT exhibits non-logarithmic creep with increasing or decreasing rates depending on the temperature. This behaviour is attributed to the generation of additional poling in the material.",

The surface porosity of a glass-ceramic body from the direct sintering of an engineered mixture of fly ash from thermal power plants, recycled soda-lime glass and boron waste (residues of the mining and purification of valuable boron containing minerals) was sealed by a glaze, deriving from the sinter-crystallisation of glass powders produced from the same mixture. The use of boron waste, providing B2O3, allowed a substantial viscous flow, for the substrate, even at the relatively low temperature (850–950°C) adopted for a single firing treatment (simultaneous sintering of substrate and sinter-crystallisation of glaze). The dense sinter-crystallised layer, besides imparting improvements in the mechanical properties, was found to feature an enhanced chemical stability.",

The CDMS acquires multiple mass/charge ratios in real time while simultaneously recording dilatometry data. To identify the chemical composition of the numerous recorded mass/charge ratios, cracking patterns, isotopic abundances and decomposition reactions from model compounds (BaCO3, BaSO4) were used. Three primary regions of gas evolution were identified. During the heating ramp and into the hold period at 1350°C, CO2 appears, and below approximately 500°C, this may arise from adsorbed or surface CO2. Sulphur dioxide was also observed, and its evolution occurred directly after the majority of the CO2 appeared and immediately preceded the onset of sintering. Above 1200°C, CO2 is the primary species observed in the gas phase. The implications of the high temperature chemistry on sintering and on microstructural development are discussed.",

The oxidation resistance of refractories, especially that of low-carbon MgO-C refractories, improved with the increase of the content of metallic additives. The oxidation resistance improved with the increase of graphite purity, especially in the low-temperature region. It is expected that this study can contribute to the optimal selection of magnesia carbon bricks in the trunnion area of furnace lining and provide a reference for the design of refractories with long overall service life.",

The scale of the operations and the abrasive nature of the ore results in very aggressive wear conditions. The high levels of abrasive and impact wear can lead to equipment reliability issues, with associated costs and lost production. As such, it is common to augment the durability of mining components by the application of wear-resistant materials. For critical equipment tungsten carbide-based composite overlays are commonly selected to improve reliability and extend service life. The performance of the overlay is very much dependent on the service conditions. This paper will describe how the selection of tungsten carbide-type can determine the performance of a composite overlay in a range of abrasive and impact wear conditions. The paper will demonstrate how the effective selection of the composite to match the expected service conditions can improve the durability of mining equipment.",

The entry of Er improves the dielectric properties of NdFeO 3 , there are a large number of oxygen vacancies and interface polarisation, which improves its absorption performance.

Both the ferroelastic and non-ferroelastic creep strain components showed a strong dependence on bending stress. The ferroelastic creep depends on the coercive stress in LaCoO 3 based perovskites, which in turn is a function of temperature. In addition, the ferroelastic creep strain has the same sign as the total strain of cobaltites upon loading, however, it has the opposite sign relative to the total strain upon unloading. Non-ferroelastic creep was negligibly small in both perovskites at low temperatures, however, its contribution toward the total creep increased significantly at elevated temperature. Non-ferroelastic creep strain has the same sign as the total strain both upon loading and upon unloading.",

Three composite systems with layered microstructure were prepared using borosilicate glass matrix and vanadium particles as the inclusion phase. The sintering shrinkage of cylindrical compacts was recorded in axial and radial directions. As expected, sintering was impaired with increasing concentration of vanadium particles. A shrinkage anisotropy factor was determined based on experimental measurements and its evolution during sintering for each sample was discussed. In samples containing three layers with different volume fractions of vanadium inclusions, similar densification was observed in the bottom layer with maximum concentration of inclusions (30 vol.-%) and in the top layer with minimum concentration (2 vol.-%). This indicates that sintering anisotropy of the samples is dependent not only on the composition, but also on the position arrangement of the layers in the sintering part. The results show that heating microscopy is a simple technique which can be used to support the design and fabrication of layered (and by extension functionally graded) materials. Smart choice of composition, dimension and position of the sample in the furnace during sintering should lead to adequate control or prediction of the final sintered shape.",

It has been found that the addition of B2O3 and P2O5 has a remarkable effect on the amount of β spodumene (β-S), relative to high quartz solid solution (h-QSS). The glass ceramics that contain appropriate amounts of B2O3 and P2O5 promise good sinterability at temperature as low as 850°C. There were two major types of phase transformation in the present investigation: crystallisation of the present glass to a metastable h-QSS and subsequent transformation from h-QSS to a stable β-S. In vitro test revealed that the spodumene glass ceramic is much more durable in human body fluid.

With increasing particle size of nano SiO2, the temperature stability of μ i became higher. Meanwhile, the power loss decreased. Microstructure analysis showed that Zn0.4Mn0.6Fe2O4 spinel structure was completely formed in the sintering samples, and SiO2 reacted with CaO to form CaSiO3 at the grain boundary. The effect of different particle sizes of SiO2 on magnetic properties mainly depended on their influence on the grain size and the volume fraction of grain boundary phase. In detail, smaller particle size had higher surface activity under the same sintering condition, which led to excessive grain growth that influenced the grain size and its uniform, and also the volume fraction of grain boundary phase.",

Ni doping increases the lattice parameter of BSCF. The grain size of the undoped BSCF increases from 1.52 to 64.8 μm with increasing sintering temperature from 900 at 1150 °C, while the grain size of the Ni-doped counterpart increases from 3.06 to 34.1 μm as the sintering temperature increases from 1000 to 1200 °C. The grain growth kinetics is analysed using the expression Dn = tK 0exp(-Q/RT). The grain growth exponent n is found to be 3 for the undoped BSCF and 4.7 for the Ni-doped BSCF. The grain growth activation energy (Q) is 650.7±30 kJ/mol for the undoped BSCF and 803.4±37 kJ/mol for the Ni-doped BSCF.

All samples were sintered to a density higher than 99.2% of theoretical density of alumina. In order to examine samples SEM, EDX and XRD (X-ray diffraction from 18 to 70 °2Theta) analysis were performed together with B3B flexural strength measurement. Results revealed that by sintering of alumina samples in a spinel powder bed pore-free surfaces were prepared, which had a favourable effect on B3B flexural strength. This was ascribed to the high solubility of Al3+ in spinel at sintering temperatures, which increases the sintering driving force. A further positive effect on B3B flexural strength was observed when samples were sintered in nitrogen instead of air.",

MW mode of synthesis was relatively an efficient method as it prepared monolithic HAP NP in just one minute of heating. With the increase in duration of heating in both modes of heating; lattice parameters, crystal size, lattice strain, Ca/P ratio, and degree of crystallinity of HAP phase increased. The morphology of particles was rod-shaped having aspect ratio between 2 and 3. EDX confirmed the presence of Ag and corroborated the formation of apatite. The hydrodynamic diameter of Ag-HAP NPs was significantly bigger than the particle sizes calculated using XRD, FESEM, and TEM. Thus, an overall examination concluded MW as an efficient mode of synthesis, able to produce Ag-HAP NPs in a possible minimum time.",

The substrate colour and the thickness of zirconia affects the optical results, with special regard to colour perceptibility and acceptability. Monochromatic and multilayer zirconia show both similarities and discrepancies in behaviour, i.e. spectral reflectance and ΔE.

To obtain various domain wall characteristics, the poling process was carried out with different patterns with respect to the PZT ceramic. The domain walls were aligned in the PZT ceramic in the direction perpendicular to the poling direction. Such domain wall characteristic produced different crack growth behaviours. The crack growth occurred mainly along the domain walls of {110} for a31 (crack growth direction perpendicular to the poling direction) because of the high stress concentration between the domain walls. In contrast, the crack propagated along both domain walls and grain boundaries for a33 (crack growth direction parallel to the poling direction), leading to high crack growth resistance and good mechanical properties. The fracture toughness KIC values for the PZT ceramics in the a31 and a33 directions were about 0·5 and 2·6 MPa m1/2 respectively. It also appeared that the domain walls collapsed when a number of poling processes are conducted along different directions. These PZT ceramics had high mechanical properties due to the low stress concentrations.",

The composite sintered at 1050°C exhibited superior flexural strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue resistance owing to the remained Ti phase and dense microstructure as well as good interfacial bonding.",

Two regions of evolved gas are identified. In the temperature range from 400 to 900°C, carbon dioxide and fragments related to its cracking are observed; these species are assigned to the decomposition of organic species and trace strontium carbonate. In the temperature range of 800–1400°C, species are identified that can be assigned to the evolution of SO2, possibly arising from celestite used in the synthesis scheme. Species identification was achieved by using tabulated cracking patterns and natural isotopic abundancesby, by obtaining cracking patterns from a known gas (CO2) and by using model compounds (KHCO3, SrCO3 and SrSO4), which evolve the suspected species at elevated temperature.",

Dielectric constant values from 25 to 500°C at frequencies from 42 Hz to 1 MHz revealed the presence of all types of polarisation. At the plots of LiCuVO4 tan δ (dielectric loss) versus frequency, tan δ displays a peak at a frequency that shifts to higher values with temperature. At 400°C, the maximum losses appear at 1 kHz and at 500°C at 10 kHz.

A new approach to shape porous structures based on the assembly of hybrid micelles under the influence of a directional driving force, such as the electric field, is proposed in this work. The growth of silica porous coatings induced by electrophoresis has been explored. The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of different cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solutions, a silica sol (SiO2) and a hybrid sol (CTAB+SiO2) has been studied in terms of the solution/sol conductivity, the electrophoretic mobility of the suspended species and the applied electric field and time. After the optimisation of the sol composition for EPD, the growth behaviour of the deposit has been determined by atomic force microscopy. Results evidence the assembly of hybrid micelles as a consequence of the synergism of two phenomena: the increase in the concentration of the micelles at the substrate surroundings and the silica sol gelling. Crack free silica porous films (0·4 mg cm−2) with a deposited mass per unit area one order of magnitude higher than those prepared by dip coating can be produced by EPD.",

Binder and additives were further added to plastify the feedstock and facilitate the shaping process. Small and complex near net shape components can be efficiently mass produced by ceramic injection moulding reaching high surface quality and high dimensional tolerances. The influence of sintering in air and hydrogen atmosphere on the mechanical properties and density was investigated. It was shown that sintering in hydrogen atmosphere enhances densification, accelerates grain growth and develops elongated crack-like pores along the grain boundaries.

Though quality is very important for graphite, little published data is available on the effect of varying ash content on oxidation. Since MgO–C bricks manufactured from graphite with different ash contents are regularly used for lining converters and steel ladles at SAIL plants, a study has been conducted to select an optimum graphite with low cost. Graphites with 2·8, 4·4, 12 and 20% ash content were used to make MgO–C samples in the laboratory, and oxidation properties were evaluated using an electrically heated tube furnace. Kinetic analysis shows that a chemical reaction mechanism operates in the earlier part of oxidation, followed by a diffusion mechanism in the latter part. MgO–C manufactured from graphite with 4·4% ash content was observed to have the best oxidation resistance, with an activation energy of 43·4 kJ mol−1 during the earlier stage followed by 34·2 kJ mol−1 in the latter.",

    "abstract": "Owing to their lower costs and functional properties, the construction industry has been increasingly adopting synthetic organic polymer (SOP) materials into linings, interiors and non-load bearing structural components. While SOPs have favourable properties and characteristics at ambient conditions, the same materials often perform poorly under moderate-to-elevated temperatures such as that arising from a building fire. In fact, most SOPs tend to combust and decompose at elevated temperatures which, unlike traditional building materials such as concrete and ceramic tiles, is proven to not only contribute to the fire but also to adversely affect evacuation and firefighting operations. From a fire engineering perspective, this paper tests a hypothesis in which ceramic tiles (CTs) are expected to outperform SOPs and commonly used insulations as finishing and lining materials under fire conditions. As such, this study showcases a thorough comparison between the behaviour of commonly available CTs, SOPs and insulations in temperatures ranging between 25 and 1000°C. Then, this paper analyses published CT models to derive temperature-dependent material models with the aid of machine learning (ML). Findings of this work advocate the use of CTs as favourable finishing and interior lining materials to enable realising improved structural fire performance and fire response managements, as opposed to SOPs, composites or insulations. The outcome of this work is expected to be of interest to architects, first responders, building officials, fire and structural engineers.",

All mixtures were heated at 1500°C for duration of 30, 45 and 60 min. The results showed that Al2O3–SiC powders with an average diameter of ∼220 nm and almost equiaxial geometry with aspect ratio of 1–1·2 could only be synthesised from the mixture containing carbon black (30 wt-%) at low heating time (30 min). It was found that the intensity of SiC peaks was the highest in samples containing graphite which was attributed to the higher initial density of this sample.",

This paper investigates the fire reactions of these materials under severe thermal and heat conditions. This research is targeted to potential applications in the replacement of glass fibre reinforced polymeric insulation materials such as phenolic composites as engine heat shields which experience high temperature and heat transmission. The materials developed can provide good properties, including heat insulation with high thermal stability for engine drafts, where traditional glass/phenolic composites were used and gave a very short life cycle. This work compares the thermal properties of the glass fibre reinforced phenolic composites and metal silicate composites produced under the same processing conditions. The results show that CDMC possesses significantly better thermal stability and heat resistance in comparison with phenolic moulding composite (phenolic dough moulding composites). The indication was that under the testing condition of heat flux of 75 kW m−2 intended for materials used for applications in marine, transport and possibly nuclear waste immobilisation, the integration of the CDMC was kept intact and survived as a high temperature insulation material.Keywords: Metal silicatesGlass fibreCeramic compositesHeat reactionHeat resistanceThermal insulation",

PSC is currently practiced in table-ware industries however, application to the technical ceramics is limited owing to the collapse of cast part while de-moulding during pressure cast cycle under pneumatic pressure. Current study focuses on this key issue and demonstrated pressure casting process successfully for the fabrication of alumina parts. Slips of a mixture of alumina with different particle sizes in the various proportions and solid loadings were prepared. Slip under PSC resulted in effective interlocking of the particles retaining the shape while de-moulding and achieved a sintered density of 98.6% of theoretical density (TD). Slurry on CSC exhibited a lower sintered density of 97% of TD. Selection of particles with sizes in optimised proportion for PSC results in effective interlocking of particles in green parts as well as grains on sintering as revealed by the microstructure. This leads to higher density and mechanical properties. Slip thus optimised were shaped into solid spheres of ϕ 60 mm by PSC targeting grinding applications.",

The system considered was a soda borosilicate glass powder requiring a relatively low sintering temperature, mixed with 2 or 10 vol.-% Hastelloy X fibres. Single mode microwave heating was performed using radiation of 2·45 GHz in an applicator operating in the TE103 mode. Samples could be sintered in less than 5 min. Samples heated in the maximum of the electric field showed increased pore shrinkage in comparison with samples sintered in the maximum of the magnetic field. The present work demonstrates that metallic additions may be used to eliminate the requirement of a susceptor material (usually SiC) to heat powder glass samples in a short time to a temperature at which it would be able to couple with the microwaves in order for sintering to occur.Keywords: GLASS MATRIXMETALLIC INCLUSIONSMICROWAVE HEATINGSINTERING",

Considerable improvement (8.0 to 18.6%) in mechanical strength was observed on replacement of quartz by fly ash up to the complete replacement in the biscuit firing temperature range of 1050 and 1150°C. The increase in strength may be attributed to the gradual decrease in stresses in the fired bodies due to the decrease in the content of sand stone. There is a significant reduction in percentage thermal expansion of body mixes at 600°C in the samples fired at 1100°C due to gradual replacement of sand stone by fly ash in the compositions. This would make the body mixes more thermal shock resistant in comparison to the reference body. Moreover, this investigation showed promising result and encouraged the utilisation of waste material like fly ash in the production of value added traditional ceramic products like earthenware glazed wall tile with improved thermomechanical properties.",

Zeta potential and viscosity studies revealed that the phenolic resin coated SiC powder requires an electrostatic stabilisation, whereas, the pure SiC powder requires an electrosteric stabilisation in order to produce aqueous SiC slurries with high solids content. The decomposition behaviour of phenolic resin was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry techniques. The influence of aqueous processing on the surface characteristics of pure and the phenolic resin coated powders was assessed by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and by estimating the bulk density of their gelcast samples sintered at 2150°C for 1 h. Various characterisation results revealed that the phenolic resin coating slightly effects the dispersion behaviour of SiC powder in the aqueous medium but it protects powder from surface oxidation during aqueous processing. Sintered properties suggest that in order to obtain a dense SiC body with a bulk density of >3˙13 g cm–3 (∼97˙5% of the theoretical density) following an aqueous gelcasting technique, the phenolic resin (∼5%) coated SiC powder should possess an average particle/agglomerate size of <11˙0 μm, compact (green) density of >1˙67 g cm–3 and B content of >0˙5%.",

The electrical conductivity data, involving both n and p type regimes, are considered in terms of defect disorder assuming that the predominant mobile defects are oxygen vacancies, which are compensated by immobile titanium vacancies. Application of this model led to the determination of the electrical conductivity components related to electrons, electron holes and ions. The determined empirical relationships between electrical conductivity and oxygen activity may be used for predicting the effect of experimental conditions on semiconducting properties of TiO2.

A non-isothermal kinetic empirical model was used to evaluate the activation energy. The activation energy evaluated for PLZT formation was found to be 320 kJ mol−1. The rhombohedral unit cell parameter 'a' was found to increase with heating temperature, however the crystallite size and approximate grain size were found to decrease with increasing heating temperature. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis suggests that faster heating rate and high temperature inhibits PLZT formation due to the slow diffusion of La3+ ion in the lattice. Also the slow heating rate leads to excess evaporation of lead oxide. Best dielectric behaviour and ferroelectric polarisation (P r) were found for sample heated at 1100°C. High dielectric loss and low grain boundary resistance were observed for the samples treated with fast heating rate and high temperature.",

A foamy mass obtained by drying a resin prepared by heating yttrium nitrate, aluminium nitrate and sucrose undergoes self-sustained combustion when initiated with a burning splinter and produces YAG precursors containing amorphous oxides of yttrium and aluminium. The YAG phase has been obtained from the precursors during calcination at a relatively low temperature of 900°C without the formation of any intermediate compounds. The YAG powder prepared by planetary ball milling of the combustion product calcined at 900°C contained particles in the size range of 0·06 to 5 μm with a D 50 value of 1·04 μm and had a surface area of 21·5 m2 g−1.

    "abstract": "Lots of through SiC coating micro-cracks appeared due to the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficient between fibres and matrix, and this could be the diffusion path for oxidising gases to reduce oxidation resistance of as-cracked C/SiCs. In this paper, a simple recoating repair methodology was achieved by grinding off original coating and depositing coating again. The experimental results pointed out that as-repaired specimens had excellent oxidation resistance with the whole temperature range of 500–1500°C, and at sensitive point of 800°C, the weight loss rate of the as-repaired specimens was decreased by 22.1% compared to the as-cracked specimens. From 700 to 1100°C, the flexural strength of the as-repaired specimens has obviously improved compared to the as-cracked specimens. Microstructural analysis showed that the recoating repair methodology can seal and narrow through-coating micro-cracks, leading to oxidation resistance and mechanical properties improvement for the as-repaired specimens.",

Shear strength of SiC joints reaches the maximum at 1200°C. A relatively good interface between the SiC substrate and pyrolysis product of the polymer is formed, but there exist loose cracks or voids in the joint layer which affect the shear strength of the joint. The shear strength of the SiC joint reaches 69.2 MPa through seven times of vacuum impregnation/pyrolysis enhancement.

The model is based on the spatial–temporal reaction–permeability equation in conjunction with differential equations describing the decomposition rate and temperature–time cycle, plus an algebraic constraint which limits the buildup of pressure to avoid component failure. An approach using finite elements with a process controller was compared to an approximate approach using the pseudo-steady-state modelling assumption in conjunction with the calculus of variations. The two approaches exhibit excellent agreement, which supports the accuracy of the pseudo-steady-state assumption and the usefulness of the process control strategy, both of which can save time and energy in debinding ceramic components. The process control methodology was also applied to the complex geometry of a ceramic engine valve.",

For the in vivo evaluation, the ‘calvaria critical-size defect’ model was used: following one and three months of the artificial surgical bone defects filled with β-TCP-AE, histopathological analyses were performed. Gene expression studies demonstrated a mild osteoblastic differentiation of the SAOS-2 cells triggered after seven days of β-TCP-AE-treatment. Digital histology of rat’s calvarial bone defects reconstructed with β-TCP-AE showed that after one month, calcifications and early ossifications developed with the presence of capillary-rich fibrose inflammation and remnants of exogenous compounds which nearly dissappeared by the third month, and replaced with multiple newly formed bone islets mediated by osteoblasts. Based on our results this bioceramic compound appears to have favourable properties for the use as a scaffold in the reconstructive medical practice.",

In this paper, chemical vapour deposited SiC, polysilazane (PSN) pyrolysed ceramic and slurry transformed glass coatings were introduced to investigate the oxidation resistance of repaired C/SiCs. The repair effects of various coatings were compared by weight loss and residual mechanical properties. Results showed that both SiC coated and glass coated C/SiCs exhibited preferable oxidation resistance compared with the PSN coated and uncoated specimens. Correspondingly, the former exhibited less weight loss and higher residual flexural strengths than the latter. A scanning electron microscope was employed to observe the microstructures of fracture sections, which gave an intuitive explanation for the repair effect of various coatings.",

Results show that the highest electromechanical performance is obtained for the PZT thick films sintered at 900 or 950°C, with a thickness coupling factor kt of 50%. The addition of EC influenced the thickness of the PZT thick films but had only minor effect on the porosity content for sintering temperatures over 900°C. Moreover, elastic constants of the thick films based on the suspension with EC were lower, which leads to lower acoustic impedance (15 MRa) while maintaining high (kt) value. In this last case, a better acoustic matching can be expected with propagation media such as water or biological tissues for ultrasound medical imaging applications.",

In the present study, we used an indicalamus leaf as a template to fabricate a superhydrophobic biomorphic ZnO on a carbon substrate (ZnO/C). First, a carbon substrate with a leaf microstructure was obtained by sintering an indicalamus leaf in argon. The biomorphic ZnO/C was then obtained by immersing this carbon substrate into a Zn(NO3)2 solution and again sintering it. This ZnO/C exhibited superhydrophobicity after it was modified with fluorine silane. The water contact angle of the resulting product was 163°, which is similar to that of the indicalamus leaf (159°) and is much higher than that of smooth carbon covered with the same fluorine silane (114°).",

On the basis of transmission electron microscope images and particle diameters that were calculated from specific surface area data and X-ray diffraction patterns, it is believed that the addition of silica might interrupt the growth of smaller particles to larger ones in the flame, but could enhance the thermal stability of the formed nanoparticles. Meanwhile, based on the decomposition of methylene blue, the anatase fractions and the calculated particle diameters, the TiO2 nanoparticles that were synthesised with the addition of silica corresponding to 0·03 L min−1 of the silica precursor carrier gas were the most thermally stable among those tested with heat treatment at 1000°C.",

    "abstract": "CaCu3–xZnxTi4O12 (x is from 0 to 1·0) polycrystalline samples were fabricated via a two-step solid state reaction process. The lattice parameter of the monophasic CaCu3Ti4O12 phase increased as Zn content increased. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the CCTO ceramic show bimodal grain size distribution and the grain size decrease largely with the appearance of Zn2TiO4 second phase. The dielectric permittivity of pure CCTO ceramic is ∼1·5×104 at f = 100 Hz. The dielectric constant of the sample largely increased with Zn substitution in the frequency range f<104 Hz. The highest dielectric constant was 6·2×104 at f = 100 Hz with Zn substitution of x = 0·8. The improved dielectric properties are believed to be related to the presence of a thin grain boundary barrier layer. The resistivity of the grain boundary decreased largely with Zn substitution as evidenced from the impedance plots.",

The effect of immersion time on the morphology of the precipitate was monitored with a scanning electron microscope. X dot maps revealed that there is a relationship between distribution of Ca–P and ZTA surface. X-ray diffractometry patterns, calcium/phosphor molar ratio and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that β-tricalcium phosphate and calcium deficient hydroxyapatite precipitated onto substrates via biomimetic. The thin film X-ray diffraction pattern showed that the calcium deficient hydroxyapatite decomposed into β-tricalcium phosphate and CaO after 0·5 h of heat treatment at 700°C.",

For ZrO2(3Y)/Fe3Al composite, the interface reactions to form Al2O3 and ZrAl2 would take place when Al content was >40 at-% in Fe–Al intermetallic, while no interface reaction occurred when using Fe3Al as toughening phase.

Quantitative analysis of toughening behaviour indicated that the enhanced toughness was attributed to the synergistic effect between crack bridging toughening and phase transformation toughening. Thermal shock resistance of as prepared composite was evaluated by indentation–quench method. Compared with monoclinic ZrO2 (3Y), ZrO2 (3Y)/Fe28at-%Al composites had higher critical thermal shock temperature difference ΔTU at which cracks grow unstably. The thermal shock resistance parameters R, R′ and R′′′′ were also calculated to evaluate the thermal shock resistance.

However, this leads to more complex material systems, whose synthesis is very time consuming to assess by conventional processing techniques. On the other hand, known high throughput routes impose a serious interference with conventional processing, resulting in significant differences of the findings, or inaccessibility of certain parameters. In this paper, an accelerated processing route is introduced and compared with conventional mixed oxide processing regarding the density, large signal piezoelectric charge constant, permittivity, loss tangent planar coupling factor, specific resistivity and microstructure. By means of three differently doped KNN based compositions, it is shown that the accelerated processing route yields reproducible results, which are equal or even superior to conventional techniques, while the processing time and the batch costs are significantly reduced.",

The dc electrical resistivity was measured and found to decrease with an increase in x to follow the Verwey mechanism because of the increase in electron hopping between the Fe2+ tetrahedral site (A site) and the Fe3+ octahedral site (B site). In addition, the resistivity of ferrites was observed to decrease with an increase in temperature, confirming their semiconductor characteristics. The dielectric constant and the dielectric loss factor were found to decrease as the frequency increased, following the Maxwell–Wagner interfacial type of polarisation. The study of the electrical properties of the prepared ferrites suggests their usefulness in important applications in electronic devices in reducing power losses due to an increase in conductivity caused by the increment in Ni concentrations in various electronic circuitries, such as those in computers and transformer coils.",

In real applications of ceramic coil springs, knowing the effect of sintering temperature on their microstructure and strength distribution plays a crucial role. In this paper, the microstructure and strength distribution of alumina coil springs sintered at 1550, 1600 and 1650°C are investigated. Strength data of alumina coil springs are fitted by a Weibull distribution and according to the coefficient of determination, the deviation from the Weibull distribution can be determined. It is shown that the Weibull distribution best fits the strength data of alumina coil springs sintered at 1600°C. The probable reasons for deviation from the Weibull distribution are discussed in terms of grain size, porosity, and R curve behaviour.",

The effects of Pb(Ti,Sn)O3 additives and sintered temperature were discussed. Pb(Ti,Sn)O3 can not only enhance the dielectric constant , but also improve the temperature stability of the BaTiO3 ceramics effectively. The enhancement of Ti4+’s polarisation and the smaller thickness of average grain shell resulted in increase in the dielectric constant. Sintered at a higher temperature, the temperature-capacitance curve was flattened. The decrease in the volume ratio of grain core to grain shell was helpful to improve the temperature stability.Keywords: Electronic materialsDielectricsX8RSintered temperature",

Recently, to prevent the environmental pollution caused by greenhouse gases, especially CO2, studies for production of synthetic meixnerite have been carried out. Meixnerite releases water vapour to the environment and reduces the CO2 emission by replacing airborne CO2 with OH groups present in its double layered structure through the adhesion of CO2 on itself. The present study covers the synthesis and characterisation of meixnerite by sol-gel method. Aluminium-isopropoxide and magnesium-chloride-hexahydrate were used as initial materials. First, boehmitic sol was prepared using sol-gel method. The mixture was stirred vigorously after adding magnesium-chloride-hexahydrate into the boehmitic sol. The mixture obtained after the gelation process was heat-treated at 550, 1300, 1400 and 1500°C. The material which has [Mg5Al3(OH)16][(OH)3.4(H2O)] chemical structure was determined as meixnerite which is a member of LDH group and used as CO2 reducer.",

    "abstract": "To describe important thermal properties of high temperature insulating wool (HTIW) materials, firing experiments have been performed at temperatures above their classification temperature and following shrinkage and resilience measurements for three HTIW material groups: AES (alkaline earth silicate wool), aluminium silicate wool (RCF) and polycrystalline wool. A temperature range of 1000–1600°C has been chosen. At industrial application temperatures the HTIW products should not reveal significant shrinkage behaviour, and their mechanical properties should be maintained after exposure to elevated temperatures. This is an important and critical aspect for these high temperature insulation materials. Microstructural examination after firing at different temperatures shows increasing crystallisation as a result of phase formation, leading to increased density and shrinkage. At classification temperature these processes enhance bending of fibres and fibre thickness in the length direction which also leads to higher shrinkage. These effects are supported by sintering processes of single fibres and diffusion at junction points. At high temperatures strong crystal growth takes place. The resulting crystals on the surface achieve dimensions larger than the fibre diameter.",

Also, the addition of 0.5 wt-%Cr2O3, whilst marginally reducing grain boundary conductivity, can promote the densification process regardless of sintering technique adopted, be it conventional electrical resistance heating or SPS. The effects of SPS sintering conditions, such as sintering temperature, isothermal dwell time, applied uniaxial pressure and number of repeated SPS cycles on the relative density and ionic conductivity of the contaminated YSZ electrolytes were investigated in detail. The results showed that SPS sintering could alleviate the harmful effect of contaminants on grain boundary conductivity, with minimal effect on the grain interior conductivity.

The oxidation ratio of graphite coexisting with coated Al powder was similar to that of graphite coexisting with uncoated Al powder, indicating that both powders showed similar antioxidising behaviour.

    "abstract": "Homogeneous and ultrafine eutectic like microstructures without coarse primary crystals were formed by a crystallisation of amorphous phases for several rare earth (RE) oxide–Al2O3 eutectic systems with the off eutectic compositions. Mixtures of RE oxide and Al2O3 powders with the off eutectic compositions were melted and quenched rapidly to form the amorphous phases. A heat treatment of the amorphous phases at 1000 and 1300°C for 30 min formed RE3Al5O12/Al2O3 (or REAlO3/Al2O3) phases. This method utilises a low migration rate in the amorphous phases. SEM observation of these materials heat treated at 1300°C showed homogeneous eutectic like microstructures. Formation of primary crystals, which are always formed in the ordinal off eutectic microstructure, was absolutely suppressed. Furthermore, the microstructures were much finer than those of materials ordinarily prepared from eutectic melts.",

The authors present thiospinel compounds with A = Mn, since they may be viewed as a link to REMnO3 CMR perovskites. Ferrimagnetic MnCr2S4 is known to present a T c of 65 K and a magnetic transition towards a non-collinear Yafet-Kittel state. The (Mn1−xA'x)Cr2S4 series (A = Cd, Zn) was synthesised at 850°C. This series crystallises in the space group Fd3m with a close to 10 Å. When A' = Cd (T c ranging from 68 K, x = 0·2, to 79 K, x = 0·6), the ferromagnetic features are enhanced, indicating that antiferromagnetism between Mn spins is progressively lost. For A' = Zn, two magnetic transitions take place, one at 15 K, which is reminiscent of the antiferromagnetic state of ZnCr2S4 and another one at T c = 115 K. Impurities which could be responsible of these two magnetic states are excluded.",

The ceramic dough moulding compounds demonstrated a good handle ability and can be adjusted by the viscosity of the matrix through the use of various amount of fillers and additives.

The immediate solution was to make a concrete recipe consisting of CEM I, anhydrite and limestone that would convert the cementitious binder to non-hydraulic thaumasite when wet. It is demonstrated how sufficient compressive strength was obtained for such mixes for the first few months, after which they disintegrated completely within 6 months in sea water.",

With the MCP content increase, the pH of the cements decreased from 11.5 to 8 and the compressive strength decreased from 25.81 to 3.45 MPa. The extracts of cements promoted cell proliferation, migration, osteoblastic differentiation and mineralisation when MCP was 10–20 wt-%. These suggested that MCP powder can regulate the properties of CS cement. Composite cement containing 10–20 wt-% MCP showed improved biocompatibility and mineralisation and promising for bone defect restoration.",

The hydroxyapatite discs, which had small (specimen S) and large grain size (specimen L), were prepared through microwave sintering at 1100°C for 6 and 720 min, respectively. The average grain size of specimen S was about 15 times smaller than that of specimen L. The surface energy of specimen S was about 1.6 times higher than that of specimen L under the same surface roughness. For the osteoconductivity test, porous hydroxyapatite granules were prepared using PEG porogen. The osteoconductivity of specimen S was superior to that of specimen L four weeks after implantation in calvarial defects of New Zealand white rabbits. Taken together, it can be concluded that the hydroxyapatite with small grain size had a higher osteoconductivity compared with the hydroxyapatite with large grain size due to its high surface energy.",

The tribological parameters as friction coefficient and wear rate were measured using a ball-on-plate configuration with different contact loads. The microstructures and worn surfaces of composites were studied. The WC-Co-GPLs composite exhibits significantly better tribological properties in comparison to the WC-Co which is most evident at contact load of 80 N, where the friction coefficient and wear rate of the WC-Co-GPLs composite are 0.339 and 9.27 × 10−6 mm3·(m·N)−1, respectively. The improvement in wear behaviour of WC-Co-GPLs composite is attributed to the formation of the tribofilm during the wear test and enhancement of mechanical properties of the WC-Co-GPLs composite. The pulled-out GPLs attaches on the worn surface contribute to the formation of tribofilms during tribology test, especially at higher loads. The tribofilms protect the WC-Co-GPLs from wear and guarantee the integrity of the worn surface.",

Here we report the hydrothermal synthesis of biphasic BiFeO3 ceramics using low NaOH concentration and temperature. The ability of BiFeO3 ceramics to morph into tetragonal and rhombohedral allotropic phases was demonstrated, confirming the theoretical prediction that the polymorphism can be stabilised even in powder form. Based on our experimental study NaOH(aq) is proposed as responsible for the strain on the structure of the rhombohedral phase. In addition, the in-depth characterisation of this biphasic ceramic opens up new opportunities for the technological applications of BiFeO3 material.",

The addition of PEO decreases the sintering and mechanical properties of LPS–SiC ceramic seals obviously, while significantly reduces the dry friction coefficient of LPS–SiC ceramic seals.

In this present work, an inverse problem solving is proposed to retrieve electromechanical parameters of piezoceramic materials (relative permittivity and piezoelectric coefficient) and microscopic parameters (spontaneous polarisation and spontaneous strain). Optimisation is performed on dielectric and butterfly curves using a genetic algorithm procedure in order to ensure robust convergence even if several local solutions exist. Method is validated on comparing results obtained for PLZT8/65/35 and P188, whose parameters are well known in literature. Good agreements observed between retrieved parameters and values reported in literature show that domain wall modelling is a promising way to characterise piezoceramic materials.",

The ability to obtain concentrated solutions of high molecular mass polymer is a crucial factor for the development of a dip coating method. Potentiodynamic and impedance spectroscopy studies indicate that PEMA films provide corrosion protection of stainless steel in 3% NaCl solutions. The use of GRA facilitates the fabrication of films with improved protective properties. PEMA films are obtained as monolayers or multilayers of controlled film mass. Another important finding is a good dispersion of chemically inert microdiamond and nanodiamond particles using GRA and RLP. For the first time composite PEMA-diamond films are obtained using GRA and RLP as solubilising agents for PEMA and dispersing agents for diamonds in isopropanol solvent. The detailed analysis of film microstructures provides an insight into the influence of chemical structure of GRA and RLP on their interactions with PEMA and diamonds. Moreover, microstructure analysis indicates that such interactions are important for preventing defects in the composite films. The benefits of steroid-like dispersants are discussed. Composite films are obtained as monolayers with different diamond content or PEMA-diamond multilayers of different composition and film mass. The method represents a versatile strategy for the fabrication of alternating PEMA/PEMA-diamond multilayers. The benefits of the obtained microstructures for biomedical applications are discussed. The approach developed in this investigation opens an avenue for the fabrication of other polymer coatings containing various functional materials.",

Beyond mechanical properties, chemical inertness and high-temperature stability, abrasion/erosion resistance are one of the key properties, for which, there is no easy-applicable and rapid test method exist enabling controlled lab-scale parametric studies. A novel particle impact test was established using a resonance acoustic mixer, in which ceramic particles are strongly accelerated and collide with the ceramic surface within a closed vessel. After determination of the most representative parameters such as ceramic ball size, vessel diameter, and retainment/removal of debris, selected experiments were conducted on three candidate materials aimed to be used as high-temperature transport/port systems; dense C 799 Al 2 O 3 , porous water-plasma sprayed Plascera-type Al 2 O 3 and WHIPOX-type Al 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 ceramic matrix composites with porous matrix; with and without porous protective Al 2 O 3 coating. The distinct mass loss behaviour of candidate materials highlighted the viability of the test method and the relevance of microstructures of porous Al 2 O 3 materials on abrasion resistance.",

    "abstract": "The most widely used ceramic material is aluminium oxide, known as alumina. Due to its superior properties such as chemical stability, high wear resistance, refractoriness and so on, it is ideal for applications in aggressive environment. This type of environment often includes exposure to corrosive solids, liquids and gases. When ceramics come in contact with corrosive medium, several corrosion mechanisms can occur, depending on a number of parameters. Therefore, the corrosion behaviour of cold isostatically pressed (CIP) high purity alumina ceramics was observed under different conditions: 0.5, 1.25 and 2 mol dm −3 of nitric acid at 25°C, 40°C and 55°C through 10 days. Purity of used alumina ceramics was 99.8345 wt. % with 0.1655 wt. % of both sintering aid (MgO) and impurities (SiO 2 , CaO, Na 2 O and Fe 2 O 3 ). The results show that Al 2 O 3 ceramics exhibit good corrosion resistance in nitric acid. Al 2 O 3 corrosion behaviour varies depending on the temperature, time and HNO 3 concentration. In view of the reaction kinetics, it proceeds in the near-parabolic law in HNO 3 aqueous solution and decreases with an increase of the HNO 3 concentration.",

Two different types of microstructure were designed, one consisting of separated alumina inclusions in a zirconia matrix and another one which was a combination of two continuous phases, penetrating the whole volume of the composite. It was detected that at elevated temperatures both materials showed a distinct decrease in the wear rate. Composite with a low alumina content showed minimal wear rate at 300°C and composite with higher amount of alumina showed it at 400°C. There are some observations that this minimal wear rate result is connected with a pseudoplastic behaviour of a layer formed between co-operating elements of tribological pair.

The present paper details an experimental programme undertaken on mortars made with representative materials to determine their tensile performance. It appears that in lean mortars a synthesised sand, containing 20 wt-% kaolin clay (representative of local sands, often used in construction in Africa) gives higher strengths than clay free (standard) sand, while the same level of montmorillonite lowers the strength for rich or lean mortars. Economic modelling indicates that, for bending loading (maximum stress inversely proportional to thickness squared), using kaolin contaminated sand is preferable to using standard sand. However, the montmorillonite contaminated sand must cost around 2/3 less than the imported sand to become competitive. For membrane loading (maximum stress inversely proportional to thickness), kaolin contaminated sand is preferable only when it is considerably cheaper than standard sand, and montmorillonite contaminated sand is never preferable in practical situations.",

With thermal cycling, the bulk of the coatings experienced preferential oxidation along the splat boundaries, contributing to an increase in porosity and cracking. Despite the development of porosity and cracks, no spallation of coatings was observed even after nearly 600 thermal cycles. The microhardness of coatings did not undergo significant change, owing to oxide formation and retention of the total carbide content of Cr3C2, Cr7C3 and Cr23C6.

The material damage was evaluated with the change in sonar intensity from the ceramics, where a sensing control was operated using a condenser microphone system. This testing system produces cyclic loading with a wide range of fatigue frequencies: 1 Hz–72 kHz. The influence of fatigue frequency on the fatigue properties of a PZT ceramic has been investigated, and it appeared that the fatigue strength is not linearly correlated with the fatigue frequency. The reason for this is due to the resonance caused by the oscillation. Thus, the fatigue frequency can change the severity of sample vibration. The extent of sample vibration is associated with the sonar intensity from the ceramic, which is linearly related to the crack growth rate. Details of the resonance fatigue properties have been systematically examined.",

The highest hydrogen production rate was obtained when 0·003 mol Pt was deposited on the surface of 1 mol MCNT. Since this optimal Pt concentration is the same as that for P-25, it was concluded that the mesopore surface was not directly deposited with Pt.

First, a Portland-like cement is made at reduced temperature and cooled so that it self-pulverises to a powder of cement fineness without the need for grinding. Second, CO2 enriched gas is extracted from the cement kiln flue, and this may be used without further refinement in a third part of the process to activate this cement (which is only poorly hydraulic) in the production of precast concrete products. Considerable energy savings are anticipated, and additional sustainability gains arise from the closed loop manufacturing process. Proof of principle has been demonstrated and a preliminary estimate made of CO2 emission reduction: scale-up challenges are still to be addressed. The initial focus is on the production of precast concrete, where there is strong customer demand and regulatory pressure for low embodied carbon cements, together with a need for greater process efficiency. Other potential applications are foreseen in areas such as environmental engineering and non-structural concrete.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe dental material, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a modified Portland cement (PC) with added bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) radiopacifying powder. The reported biocompatibility of MTA has led to its widespread use as a root filling material. However, MTA has a long initial setting time of 2 h 45 min (M. Torabinejad, C. U. Hong and F. McDonald: J. Endod., 1995, 21, 349–352), which is undesirable for its application, for both patient and dentist. This study showed that the initial setting time can be decreased to several minutes by adding 30 wt-% plaster of Paris (PoP) and also investigated the long term effects of PoP additions on the compressive strength (CS), porosity and the solubility (in terms of calcium ion release) of an MTA-like PC system. Additions of 30 wt-% to MTA-like cements led to an almost complete loss of CS after 12 months of storage in an aqueous environment. This could be explained first by PoP interfering with the PC setting reaction and second by the appearance of a gypsum structure within the cement. As excess PoP was no longer consumed in the setting reaction, it is likely to have formed a more soluble gypsum structure, which was then dissolved, causing the porosity to more than double from 25 wt-% at 10 days to 56 wt-% after 12 months. PoP addition should therefore be restricted to ∼10 wt-%, which caused no changes in strength or porosity, the latter used as an indicator of cement sealing ability.",

Thermochemical nanofabrication of the honeycomb-like nanoarchitecture resulted in intergrain superconductivity of the fully dense sintered YBCO macroceramics, which is close to the inner grain superconductivity of the initial YBCO particles. The developed multifilament HTS-YBCO wire is cost effective, reliable, flexible and as workable as copper wire, but conducts ∼100 times more electricity with insignificant heat losses.",

This material is prepared by in situ polymerisation of aniline in the presence of Li0·33La0·56TiO3 nanoparticles. The nanocomposite and its precursors are characterised by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, Fourier transform infrared, TEM, SEM, electrical conductivities and electrochemical measurements. The structural and electrochemistry study reveals the existence of relatively strong interactions between the conducting polymer and the oxide particles to assure good synergy in the transport process. The dc and ac electrical conductivities and diffusion coefficient measurements at room temperature indicate that the conductivity values are several orders of magnitude higher in the composite than in the oxide alone. This behaviour determines better reversibility for Li insertion in charge–discharge cycles compared to the pristine oxide and polymer when it is used as electrode of lithium batteries.",

The study is based on in situ monitoring of work function changes during oxidation and reduction of yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ). The reactivity of YSZ with oxygen was determined in terms of both oxygen chemisorption and oxygen incorporation and related charge transfer. The obtained work function data have been used to determine the oxygen chemisorption isobar for YSZ. The effect of surface properties on the reactivity of YSZ with oxygen has been assessed and the application of surface processing for the modification of reactivity examined. It has been found that work function measurements may be used for in situ examination of surface properties of oxide materials during processing at elevated temperatures and in gas phases of controlled composition.",

In the present paper a system consisting of blocks of Si3N4 coated with a preceramic film containing a fine dispersion of silicon and a thin layer of germanium powder has been investigated to determine the effect of the thickness of the germanium film. The maximum service temperature is not determined by the melting point of the germanium since the germanium forms a higher melting point solid solution with the silicon in the film. Control of the thickness of the germanium film is found to be critical as a thicker layers results in lower strength bonds owing to differences in thermal expansion, and the maximum service temperature is lower owing to the lower liquidus temperature of the leaner Ge–Si solid solution. This technique has potential applications in fuel cells as a result of the small differences in thermal expansion coefficients and firing shrinkage in fuel cell materials, thus allowing successful fabrication and joining of monolithic solid oxide fuel cells (MSOFCs) with few defects.",

This necessitated raising the sintering temperature as the silicon nitride content increased in order to reduce the viscosity of the glass and enhance the Darcian flow. However, these higher sintering temperatures caused porosity due to thermal degradation of the glass, and as a consequence, the density of the composites decreased monotonically with increasing silicon nitride content. The hardness results revealed two conflicting effects of increasing the silicon nitride content and as a result, an optimum silicon nitride content of 30 vol.-% giving a hardness of over 680 HV was found. The silicon nitride was also found to have a greater effect on scratch resistance than hardness due to its greater ability for inhibiting crack development than shear banding.",

The photosensitive composite had better adhesion with a dry film resist and showed lower porosity, surface roughness, stiffness and elastic modulus than a normal composite, which was attributed to the remaining polymer.

To address this difficulty, feedstock powder for plasma spray deposition has been developed in which each particle is a composite of silicon nitride in a low temperature borosilicate glass matrix. The research showed that the silicon nitride did not decompose in the plasma because the low thermal conductivity of the glass matrix ensured a low heat transfer rate and the particle temperature remaining below the decomposition temperature. The coating density initially increased with plasma arc power because of increasing splat flow but then declined at high power levels owing to decomposition of the glass matrix. The silicon nitride dispersion substantially reduced the splat flow, particularly near the maximum packing fraction, but also had the beneficial effect of restricting crack propagation, resulting in an optimum content for wear resistance of 30 vol.-% silicon nitride.",

With that come lower structural dead loading, smaller structural members, reduced material demand, reduced embodied energy, and a more sustainable construction.

For this purpose, the two-piece extrusion die was designed and extrudable water-based paste was prepared by using sodium beta-alumina powder, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, as a binder, and ethylene glycol as a plasticizer. The effect of solvent content on the rheological parameters of the paste and the ram extrusion velocity on the liquid phase separation are investigated. The results indicate that the optimum solvent content for making the extrudable paste is in the range of 30–35 wt-%, and the liquid phase separation is obviously occurred when the ram velocity is lower than 1.2 mm s−1. It was also shown that by using backward extrusion, and by applying optimum conditions, closed-end tubes with high density (about 97%) and good surface quality could be fabricated successfully.",

The remnant polarisation (Pr), maximum polarisation (Pmax) and coercive field (Ec) slightly decreased as a function of increasing temperature, while the strain (Spol) was observed to increase. Additionally, d33* values of 362 and 411 pm/V were achieved at 25 °C and 120 °C, respectively, with a change ratio <14%. The Mn0.25 ceramics exhibit low ϵr and tan δ values, leading to small average power dissipation, which is beneficial for high-frequency actuator applications.",

Yb2O3 is an amphoteric oxide with both acid and base character, which presents the potential for producing different hydrocarbons when used as a Fischer–Tropsch (FT) catalyst. It was found that Yb2O3 is indeed catalytically active and can be used to convert syngas (CO + H2) into useful hydrocarbons. Production of methane, ethene, and ethane was detected in the catalytic experiment performed at 500°C, but propane, propene, butane, and methanol were also detected in the experiment performed at 250°C. Hydrocarbons heavier than C4 were not observed. The limited data show deviation from a Flory–Schulz distribution suggesting additional surface processes are occurring beyond chain growth and termination.",

Pastes were prepared with different water/cement ratios, 15–25 wt-% hemihydrate and cured at 20 and 40°C. It was found that with higher total amounts of sulphates and increase in temperature, compressive strength is enhanced in the first days of curing and setting times decreased. Ettringite was found to be the main reaction product forming dense structures over time. Calcium sulphates hydration changed the ettringite formation causing fluctuations in the strength development, nevertheless, in some cases the strength surpassed 40 MPa at 28 days.

The introduction of TiO2 decreases the crystallising peak temperature T p and the crystallising activation energy E and improves the crystallisation stage to obtain fine crystal with a size of ∼100 nm. A controlled surface reaction of the ceramic is an important factor governing the bioinert and biodegradation nature of the implanted ceramic. The addition of TiO2 improves the chemical durability of the glass ceramic, by reducing the number of non-bridging oxygens, suppressing the tendency for amorphous phase separation and provides a more dense and stable structure. This results in a decrease in the release rate of Li+, Al3+ and Si4+ ions in a simulated body fluid.",

The catalysts were characterised by techniques including XRD, HRTEM, AAS and N2 adsorption analysis. Experimental results show that the value of surface areas and pore volumes increase with increasing Au amounts. The surface area and pore volume of catalyst with high gold loading (3.1 wt-%) are 325 m2 g−1 and 1.34 cm3 g−1. The photocatalytic performance for degradation of MTBE markedly depends on gold concentration. The activity drop is attributed to the size growth and agglomeration of the gold nanoparticles. Photoactivity improvement is related to the number of nucleation centres and fine particles size. It can be concluded that there is a 10% improvement in efficiency for deposition of gold in the highest concentration compared to pure titanium nanotubes during the first 20 min of the reaction. So the photocatalytic degradation of MTBE occurs in a shorter time.",

Then they were thermally treated at 600, 900, 1100 and 1250°C and the crystallisation of C2S and C2AS was characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The evolution of the heat of hydration of these samples was investigated at 70°C using a conduction calorimeter. The microstructure of the samples, separately cured under hydrothermal conditions (7 days at 70°C), has been examined by means of SEM. Calorimetric measurements of hydration heat evolution showed that C2AS and C2S, synthesised via sol–gel method are much more active during hydration than their related clinker minerals synthesised by the conventional method. Furthermore, hydration activity of samples depends chiefly on calcination temperature. While C2S calcined at 900°C has the most intense hydration rate, C2AS has the same aspect when calcined at 1100°C. The hydration products of C2S, heat treated at 600°C, are well crystallised as characterised by XRD analysis. Large gehlenite hydrate crystals were observed to form during the hydration C2AS prepared via sol–gel processing.",

In the present work, the development of a single step process to synthesise and grow ZnAl2O4 spinel at low temperature is described. In this context, novel, economical and spontaneous growth of a bulk crystal of a ternary oxide material is reported. ZnAl2O4 crystals were grown at room temperature (30°C). Material to be grown as metal incorporated single crystals was taken as precursor and put into a neutral bath containing acid as reaction acceleration reagent (catalyst) as well as solvent with a metal foil (cation scavenger). Zinc aluminate crystals have been grown in a single step process using a chemical bath under optimised conditions in an average period of 15 days. Crystals were grown with hexagonal facets and XRD measurement confirmed the growth of a single crystal. Elemental (Zn, Al, O) and chemical compositional characterisation was done by EDAX. Thus the technique was found to be an advantageous low cost method for the growth of bulk single crystals of ternary oxide materials.",

The influence of the lip-shaped matrix crack distribution and crack density on the failure progress and stress–strain response was investigated. It was found that the onset of damage initiation commenced from the lip-shaped matrix crack when the interface fracture energy was smaller than the critical interface fracture energy. The failure progress and the predicted results were in good agreement with the experimental results. The different matrix cracks distribution affected the failure progress. Finally, the tensile strength and the elastic modulus both decreased with the crack density increasing.",

A comprehensive evaluation of mechanical properties and thermal expansion characteristics correlates well with the presence of phases. Depth-sensing nanoindentation exemplifies high elastic recovery of 91% typically seen in glassy carbons. The hardness and Young’s modulus measured to be ∼4.5 and ∼29.5 GPa respectively, seem to be governed mainly by the presence of glassy carbon, and secondarily by stiff B–C bonds and the UHT phases. The linear coefficient of thermal expansion measured from 130°C to 1550°C is ∼7.9 × 10−6 K−1 and the thermal expansion behaviour is found to be strongly driven by the constituent UHT phases.",

All ceramic specimens were bonded to the etched bovine enamel with adhesive resin cement. Shear bond strength of both sol–gel coated SZ groups with different strategies (SZc1 and SZc2) was 20.00 ± 7.07 MPa and 18.32 ± 3.63 MPa, respectively, which was comparable to that of LDe, 18.44 ± 2.27 MPa (p > 0.05) and significantly higher than that of CZa, 11.72 ± 1.48 MPa, and SZ, 3.06 ± 1.66 MPa (p < 0.05). Lots of voids between zirconia clusters were observed on the bonding surface of SZc1, yet that of SZc2 showed homogeneous honeycomb nanoporous structure. All groups exhibited mixed failure except SZ, and the fracture surfaces of SZc1, SZc2, and LDe showed better wettability than CZa. Sol–gel coating could improve the bond strength of SZ to enamel, and the sol–gel coated SZ might have the potential to make minimally invasive restorations.",

In the DSEC, the Al2O3 phase is the matrix phase mixed with part of MgAl2O4 phase and the other part of MgAl2O4 phase forms slice structure. Both the DSEC density and hardness decrease with the increase of the growth rate, due to the increase of micropores in DSEC with the higher growth rate. However, its fracture toughness improved due to the fine interface spacing toughening and the dispersion toughening. The highest hardness and fracture toughness of DSEC are 19.3 GPa and 3.74 MPa·m1/2, respectively, the toughening effect could be attributed to the crack deflection and bifurcation hindering the propagation of crack in DSEC.",

Recently, advances in computational power have allowed researchers to build computer models to predict the material properties of any chemical formula. From energy minimization techniques to machine learning-based models, these algorithms have unique strengths and weaknesses. However, a computational model is only as good as its accuracy when compared to real-world measurements. In this work, we take two recommendations from a thermoelectric machine learning model, TaVO[Formula: see text] and GdTaO[Formula: see text], and measure their thermoelectric properties of Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity. We see that the predictions are mixed; thermal conductivities are correctly predicted, while electrical conductivities and Seebeck coefficients are not. Furthermore, we explore TaVO[Formula: see text]’s unusually low thermal conductivity of 1.2 Wm[Formula: see text]K[Formula: see text], and we discover a possible new avenue of research of a low thermal conductivity oxide family.",

In this study, the effects of conventional sintering at 1250°C for 4 h and FS at various electric fields (12.5, 25, 50 and 75 V/mm) on copper smelting slag (CSS), which is a multiphase material system, are investigated. The results show that FS occurs at substantially lower temperatures with much shorter times than conventional sintering, in conjunction with improved density and hardness values for CSS. The optimum condition for better densification is observed for the sample applied the 25 V/mm electric field in 554 s, and the maximum power density of about 76.49 mW/mm 3 . On the other hand, the shortest FS duration is achieved with the sample applied 75 V/mm in 114 s. Flash sintering at lower temperatures also stabilizedthe magnetite-hematite the phase transition, which arouses at higher temperatures. Overall, FS has made a huge contribution to reducing sintering time and temperature while providing better microstructure integrity and mechanical properties in multiphase materials systems.",

Irrespective of the dispersant used, in Xyl-EtOH (50∶50), when the dispersant concentration is 0–2 wt-%, shear thinning behaviour only is observed. Optimum dispersant concentration for MFO and KD-1 is found to be 3 wt-%. Even for other solvent systems such as Tol-EtOH and MEK-EtOH, MFO and KD-1 were found to be good dispersants. For a given dispersant, Xyl-EtOH with 50∶50 ratio was found to be the optimum with minimum viscosity and yield stress. Based on this, tape casting of carbon powder was carried out using Xyl-EtOH (50∶50) as the solvent system with KD-1 (3 wt-%) as the dispersant for a solid loading of 30 wt-%. The tapes were agglomerate free yet severe drying related problems were observed. Defect free carbon tapes of desired thickness were achieved by controlling the evaporation and diffusion rates of solvents.",

Influence of infiltration temperature on the microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties of the composites was examined. Almost dense MoSi2–RSiC composites with the designed structure were obtained at 1900°C. Formation of the gradient interface modified the interface combination and enhanced the mechanical and electrical properties of the composite. Flexural strength of the composites reached approximately 114.262 MPa (room temperature) and 128.392 MPa (1400°C), respectively, indicating corresponding increases of 37.08 and 35.69% compared with the RSiC matrix. Volume resistivity decreased to 57.63 mΩ cm, nearly five orders of magnitude lower than that of RSiC. Influence of the interpenetrated network structure and interface combination on the electrical conductivity behaviour of the composites was discussed via a modified mixture rule.",

The intergranular phases, formed by reactions between the silicon in Mg-PSZ and MgO addition, reduced the grain boundary resistance, because the siliceous phase which is a hindrance for oxygen ion conduction was scavenged by the formation of Mg2SiO4.",

Silica from direct addition segregated at the grain boundary and intergranular mullite was formed whereas silica from oxidation was surrounded by alumina matrix and intragranular mullite was formed after reaction sintering. The most significant difference was fracture behaviour where intragranular mullite nanoparticles promoted transgranular fracture in alumina matrix due to thermal mismatch around nanoparticles and intergranular mullite nanoparticles gave rise to intergranular fracture similar to pure alumina. Wear resistance of the nanocomposites was better than that of alumina. Pull-out formation in the nanocomposites was less and pull-out size was also smaller.

Tungsten doping increased the ratio of Ce3+ from 12.0% to 29.6%, which was confirmed by XPS. The doped tungsten was present as W5+ in a ratio of 71.5%. In O K-edge XAS spectra, increase in Ieg/It2g indicated the formation of oxygen vacancies through tungsten doping. The decrease in W 5d-eg peak intensity demonstrated the occupation of the W 5d orbital by electrons formed at the oxygen vacancies. The enrichment of W5+ was owing to transfer of electrons to 5d-eg orbital of tungsten rather than to cerium ions. The acid sites were analysed using FTIR and NH3-TPD. The peak intensity of Brønsted acid sites and amount of NH3 desorption increased from 66.2 to 136.1 µmol g−1 with tungsten doping. The doped tungsten formed Brønsted acid sites and led to enhanced surface acidity and catalytic activity.",

The electric field facilitated the sintering of HA at relatively lower furnace temperatures than that obtained using the conventional sintering method. The voltage required for the onset of the flash decreased with increasing furnace temperature. The effects of the DC electric field strength at different sintering furnace temperatures were examined in terms of the phase evolution and stability of HA. HA phase dissociation was not observed regardless of the electric field strength or furnace temperature because of the very short FS time.

The measured grain size exponent of 6·7 is not compatible with the values expected for volume diffusion or grain boundary diffusion under the assumptions of the Combined Stage Sintering Model and hence the Master Sintering Curve. The measured exponent for a previously defined flux weighted effective diffusion distance gave a more reasonable value of 3·4. The theoretical exponent in the Combined Stage Sintering Model was then corrected to accommodate a non-linear relationship between the effective diffusion length and pore size.

    "abstract": "Surface modification of nanocrystalline ZrO2 powder with an ultrathin MoO3 layer was successfully carried out by a polymeric resin route using polyacrylic acid and ethylene glycol as precursors. Polyacrylic acid plays a vital role in this process, not only as the chelating agent for the molybdate cluster but also to form the uniform layer of molybdate dispersed polymeric resin on the surface of ZrO2. Thermal decomposition of the resin intermediate at 500°C creates the organic free MoO3 layer on the ZrO2 surface. Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction and SEM energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis confirm the uniform formation of crystalline MoO3 on the surface of the ZrO2 powder. Further, the MoO3 layer thickness was identified by TEM characterisation and was found to be ∼3 nm.",

Using ZnO previously calcined at 950°C as starting material, which has lower diffusion ability than normal ZnO, leads to higher saturation magnetisation values. This indicates that the kinetics of the diffusion of Zn into MnO2 plays a crucial role in the magnetic properties of this system.",

A simple sol-gel process was firstly engaged to synthesise a sol with a Ca/P molar ratio of 0·56 (Ca0·56P) and then it was introduced into pure HA powders not only to be used to create liquid phase to enhance densification but also to allow it to react with HA to form biphasic HA/β-TCP ceramics during sintering. The effect of the content of Ca0·56P on biphasic β-TCP/HA components and densification during the sintering process was investigated. The resulting samples were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and density measurement using the Archimedes’ method. This study provides a simple and cheap approach to synthesise biphasic HA/β-TCP and pure β-TCP ceramics.",

A texture diffractometer was used to investigate the preferential orientation of the crystallographic planes and their relation to the microstructural morphology of the hot forged samples.

Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry analysis demonstrated considerable leaching of Pb2+ and La3+ ions under acidic conditions. The addition of an ammonium salt of poly(methacrylate), or PMA-NH4, decreased the IEP to pH 5-6. Suspensions were readily stabilised at basic pH using low PMA-NH4 concentration (<0·1 wt-% of solids). Concentrated suspensions exhibited shear thinning behaviour under low shear rates, with a transition to shear thickening at modest rates (i.e. 100 s−1). Excessive shear thickening imposed a maximum solids loading of 46 vol.-% on concentrated suspensions, which related to the somewhat ‘flake-like’ particle morphology.

    "abstract": "Abstract Macroporous hydroxyapatite is a widely researched implant material due to its biocompatibility and bone bonding ability. The process of preparing macroporous HAp foam by foaming and gelcasting using ovalbumin involved four variables, namely ovalbumin amount, pH of ovalbumin solution, method of foaming and hydroxyapatite (HAp) amount, each varied in two levels. The properties for optimisation in this process were density and porosity. Pore size of the foam was considered as an additional criterion. The normal trial and error method of optimising the foam properties do not infer the effect of each factor on the properties. Design of experiment based on Taguchi method reduced the number of trials to eight and also identified the effect of each factor on the properties using the objective function calculated for each trial. The factor effect analysis indicated that HAp amount had the maximum influence and ovalbumin amount had least influence on density, and pH amount had the maximum influence and ovalbumin amount and foaming method had least influence on porosity. It also enabled the calculation of the objective functions for untried combinations which assisted in identifying the combinations that could offer optimum properties. The optimum properties were identified to be produced by one tried combination and two untried combinations. The identified untried combinations were then tried and the properties were calculated experimentally. The optimum combination with higher porosity and higher density with pore size >150 μm was identified using the objective functions and SEM images. This analysis indicated that the macroporous HAp prepared by the addition of 16 vol.-% HAp to 70 wt-% ovalbumin foam prepared at pH 4·7 by agitator had appropriate properties.",

Bioglass based scaffolds with porosity in the range of 90–95% were fabricated using the foam replica technique and sintering at 1100°C for 1 h. Scaffolds (5 × 5 × 2 mm3) were placed on the CAM at 10 days of total incubation. The embryos were killed 5 days after implantation. The scaffolds and CAM were explanted, fixed in formalin solution and processed for embedding in methyl methacrylate. Histological analysis using ground sections showed that the scaffolds were surrounded by CAM. There was no occurrence of macrophages or related inflammatory cells. The results described in this paper indicate that the developed bioassay is an appropriate approach as an alternative to conventional animal models to evaluate the biocompatibility of scaffold biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.Keywords: TISSUE ENGINEERINGBIOGLASSBIOCOMPATIBILITYSCAFFOLDSCHICK EMBRYO",

    "abstract": "AbstractAbstractThe degradation of refractory barrier bricks used in the cathode of aluminium electrolysis cells is mainly caused by the chemical attack of fluoride melts and sodium vapour. As the bricks react with the corrosive agents they experience a number of physical and chemical transformations, ultimately impairing the efficiency of the cell operation and even shortening its life.Recent studies on the characterisation of aluminosilicate refractories showed a reasonable correlation between the materials’ permeability and their resistance to a chemical attack. Nevertheless, in all reported cases this property was measured at room temperature, which does not reproduce the real situation. With the aid of newly developed equipment, various experiments were carried out in the present work to investigate how the permeability varied from room temperature up to 700°C, attempting to find a better representation of the actual conditions to which the barrier bricks are subjected. The room and high temperature results were compared and an analysis was presented in order to suggest the best approach for the selection of aluminium cells refractory lining.Keywords: REFRACTORIESPERMEABILITYPOTLININGALUMINIUM",

When carbonisation temperature increases from 900 to 1300°C, the C=C, C–O–C and C–H bonds existing in BCT transform into C–C bonds slowly and the transformation finishes at 1300°C. The oxidation reaction of carbon template carbonised at 1300°C begins at 421·5°C, and reaction rate reaches a maximum when temperature is 465·4°C. The oxidation mechanism is random nucleation.",

The phase composition and microstructure of fired bodies were also determined. The densification of the crystalline phases developed microstructure. The electrical properties are greatly influenced by andesite content, maximum firing temperature and annealing time. The results suggested that the addition of 20 mass% of andesite to electroceramic bodies increased the density and the densification temperature before and after annealing. The increase in anorthite and cristobalite at the expense of quartz, mullite and augite phases increased electrical resisitvity. The permittivity and power loss were improved by increasing andesite content and annealing time as a result of reduction in porosity.",

    "abstract": "Within the Fe2O3–BaO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass system, the influence of different fluorine source and TiO2 on the crystallisation behaviour and thermal expansion characteristics has been investigated. These aluminosilicate glasses, with different nucleation catalysts (TiO2, AlF3 and NH4F), were successfully prepared from Saudi Arabia raw materials (red clay and magnesite). Thermal behaviour, crystalline phases, microstructures, and thermal expansion coefficient were studied by DTA, XRD, SEM techniques, as well as a dilatometer. Spinel, hexacelsian, monocelsian, kinoshitalite, and Ba-osumilite were developed in glass ceramic samples. Spinel was the early phase formed in all glasses; however, with increasing temperature, hexacelsian and kinoshitalite were developed in fluorine free glasses and fluorine containing glasses respectively. Ba-osumilite was developed and hexacelsian was converted into monocelsian during lengthy heat treatment at 1150°C. A bulk crystalline microstructure was obtained; however, a microscale structure was observed in fluorine free samples and a homogeneous nanoscale microstructure was developed in fluorine containing samples. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) varied according to the phases and the heat treatment parameters. Development of spinel, hexacelsian and kinoshitalite in glass ceramic samples gave CTE values between 86·44 × 10−7 and 52·53 × 10−7°C−1, whereas crystallisation of Ba-osumilite and monocelsian gave CTE values between 51·29 × 10−7 and −7·35 × 10−7°C−1.",

The relationships between damage parameters and internal damage of matrix cracking, interface debonding and slipping, and fibres fracture have been established. The experimental fatigue hysteresis, interface slip lengths, peak strain, and the fatigue life curves of cross-ply CMCs under cyclic loading at elevated temperature have been predicted.

A perovskite structure of strontium titanate with 5 mol-% doped lanthanum was obtained after calcination of the freshly-prepared precipitate at 500°C. However, the ageing powder revealed the presence of the second phase of strontium carbonate after calcination at the same condition.

While the incorporation of aluminosilicate fibers was observed to lower the thermal conductivity of the composite foams, it did not contribute to their compressive strength. Exposure of the foams to air at 1300°C for 90 min didn’t change their density, while it increased the compressive strength by up to 46% due to improved fiber-matrix adhesion and rounding of cracks.",

The ceramic samples were surrounded by alumina-graphite powder particles in the AGPB method, which provided indirect homogeneous heating to the samples. This powder bath setup changed convection-radiation heat to conduction heat and produced sintered product with pore-free microstructures. The hardness of the AGPB-AZC composite was 43% higher than the CS-AZC, demonstrating the exponential property enhancement caused by cutting-edge AGPB sintering.

This study develops an algorithm for predicting the GSDs of BSCF dependence of sintering condition (time and temperature). In addition, the GSDs predicted by the algorithm agree reasonably with those experimentally observed. When individual grain size is non-dimensionalised by the median grain size, the GSDs data of all BSCF samples reduce to a single self-similar GSD curve.

The Temperature Coefficient of Capacitance results demonstrate that the samples can be classified as a class 4 ceramic capacitor. The activation energy measurement profile is similar for all samples. The results showed that samples obtained from the sludge present low dielectric permittivity, two thermo-activated processes one to water loss and another to conduction with activation energy of approximately 0.6 eV for all analysed samples.

Heating at 1500°C s results in platelike and equiaxed BN particles, compose B inside and H3BO3 layer, nano-petal particles, compose InN and number of fullerene-like particles with complicated ‘core shell’ structure. The last was formed as a result of segregation of transparent shell of B components around crystalline fullerene-like InN. These structures arise from a bubbles evolution of B and In components in conformity with ‘gaseous model for nanotubes and fullerenes formation and growth’. InN prevents the formation of new modifications of BN and shifting stretching band of BN according to FTIR. BN disclosed itself as an excellent getter for InN.",

The pore volume and specific surface area of the PA-added LSCF layer increased by about 3.2 and 2.7 times, respectively, relative to the existing LSCF layer. Coarse pores of 2 μm diameter were observed by PA agglomeration. The double-layered LSCF (LSCF_PA1) coated with PA-added LSCF on an LSCF single layer presented the lowest polarisation resistance at all measured temperatures. This was due to increased oxygen reduction reaction by the LSCF + PA layer with high porosity that promoted oxygen gas diffusion. Charge transfer was also improved by the wide contact area between the LSCF layer with lower porosity and the Sm-doped ceria powder electrolyte. Micro-porous LSCF showed about 19% lower polarisation resistance than the nano-porous LSCF at 600°C because of mass transfer through oxygen diffusion.",

The XRD and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results showed that the porcelain was mainly amorphous. The SEM and TEM microphotographs showed that the shape of the porcelain particles was irregular and their sizes range from 5 to 25 μm, while there were no obvious pores on the porcelain surface. The flexure strength significantly increased from 18.9 to 70.6 MPa when the sintering temperature of the porcelain increased from 600 to 675°C and then slowly decreased to 49.1 MPa when the sintering temperature elevated to 700°C. The improvement of the strength was mainly due to the decrease of pores and increase of density. A closely bonded dense coating was fused on the Ti surface by microwave.",

For M = V, Cr, Mo, W the magnetic susceptibility is low and only weakly temperature dependent, but higher than α-U, which can be ascribed to a higher density of states at the Fermi level. Heat capacity results point to a very high Debye temperature for both structures, which is associated with very high lattice stiffness of the boron network. However, for W and Mo the boron vibrations are accompanied by low-energy Einstein modes coming from vibrations of the atoms inside the boron cages that could lead to superconductivity. The electronic structure of UMB4 is influenced by a strong 5f-d hybridization and by the B-2p states, which explains the observed weak Pauli paramagnetism.",

The creep strain and matrix cracking stress (σmc) were used to determine the creep strengthening effect. Moreover, the stress redistribution model was applied to explain the stress transfer from the matrix to fibre, and therefore the creep strengthening mechanisms. The results indicate that 2D-C/SiC can be strengthened by creep at certain conditions. The ability to resist the creep strain and σmc can be improved by certain creep treatments with creep temperature of 1400°C, lower stress and longer time. The strengthening effect is resulted from the stress redistribution during the creep. The tensile residual stress is relaxed in the matrix and transferred to the fibre. The stress redistribution leads to compressive stress in the matrix and takes the advantage of superior creep resistance of carbon fibres.",

X-ray powder diffraction revealed that EuTaO1.75N1.25 crystallized with the cubic perovskite-type structure, S.G. Pm3¯m, and a lattice constant of a = 4.0283(7) Å. Thermogravimetric studies revealed that EuTaO1.75 N1.25 decomposed at around 345 under the oxygen atmosphere, giving a final product of decomposition as EuTaO4 and Eu5Ta4O15 oxides. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicated EuTaO1.75 N1.25's paramagnetic behavior with an estimated Tc=9.9 K. The saturation moment of 6.82 μB which is smaller than 7 μB expected for Eu2+ can be due to the existence of Eu3+. The extremely low value obtained for remanence and coercive field agrees to the isotropic character of the 8S7/2 ground state associated to the Eu2+.",

The current work has reported a comparative study to explain thermodynamically the effects of the increasing DC electric field strength at 1000°C and 1100°C sintering furnace temperatures during flash sintering in terms of the grain growth and densification of the HA in air. The abrupt change in current density and conductivity of HA during the flash peak correlates the high grain growth and rapid densification with increasing electric field strength. The increased electric field strength reduced the power dissipation from the HA. The abrupt high-rise grain growth phenomenon during flash sintering might consist of the thermal effect and enhancement in ionic conductivity due to the application of an electric field.",

With the assistance of molten salt, the reduction rate was dramatically enhanced. Additionally, the results showed that ZrB2 products with different particle shapes were prepared by changing the type of molten salt (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2). However, the particle size of products could not be properly refined when nano-ZrO2 was used as the raw material. During the process of reducing ZrO2 by CaB6, B2O3 could be formed, which would cause the loss of B source. To decrease the consumption of CaB6, Ca-assisted reduction was performed, and monophase ZrB2 was obtained. The varied morphologies of ZrB2 particles obtained by Ca-assisted reduction were the result of complex reaction mechanisms.",

A method for determining the distribution of slip regions under arbitrary loading was proposed based on the shear lag model and slip law. Furthermore, a method for judging the closure of the matrix cracks was given based on the assumption that the fibre strain consists of the elastic strain and the pseudo-plastic strain of CMCsss. The stress–strain response of CMCs was obtained in form of matrices based on the distribution of the slip regions instead of the integration of fibre stress in each slip region. The simulated results show that the proposed method improves the computing efficiency greatly compared with previous approaches.

The impact of the detailed sintering conditions on the sinterability, dielectric and ferroelectric properties of K0.5Na0.5NbO3 is systematically investigated. Attributed to the three-step sintering, the highest density of 4.07 g cm−3 can be observed, which is strongly improved compared with that of the single-step sintering technique and is increased up to 90% of the theoretical density. Furthermore, through the analysis on the tunability of the dielectric and ferroelectric performances, it is found that the maxima of permittivity and polarisation can be obtained in K0.5Na0.5NbO3 sintering at 1160–1220–1120°C. These results illustrate that both the dielectric and ferroelectric behaviours can be effectively modulated through the simple modification of sintering technique, which would provide a novel route to achieve tunable electrical properties in ferroelectrics.",
