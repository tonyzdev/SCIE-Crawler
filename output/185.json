    "abstract": "Exosomes, a subgroup of extracellular vesicles (EVs), have been recognized as important mediators of long distance intercellular communication and are involved in a diverse range of biological processes. Because of their ideal native structure and characteristics, exosomes are promising nanocarriers for clinical use. Exosomes are engineered at the cellular level under natural conditions, but successful exosome modification requires further exploration. The focus of this paper is to summarize passive and active loading approaches, as well as specific exosome modifications and examples of the delivery of therapeutic and imaging molecules. Examples of exosomes derived from a variety of biological origins are also provided. The biocompatible characteristics of exosomes, with suitable modifications, can increase the stability and efficacy of imaging probes and therapeutics while enhancing cellular uptake. Challenges in clinical translation of exosome-based platforms from different cell sources and the advantages of each are also reviewed and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Androgens and androgen receptors (AR) play a pivotal role in expression of the male phenotype. Several diseases, such as androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and prostate cancer, are associated with alterations in AR functions. Indeed, androgen blockade by drugs that prevent the production of androgens and/or block the action of the AR inhibits prostate cancer growth. However, resistance to these drugs often occurs after 2–3 years as the patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In CRPC, a functional AR remains a key regulator. Early studies focused on the functional domains of the AR and its crucial role in the pathology. The elucidation of the structures of the AR DNA binding domain (DBD) and ligand binding domain (LBD) provides a new framework for understanding the functions of this receptor and leads to the development of rational drug design for the treatment of prostate cancer. An overview of androgen receptor structure and activity, its actions in prostate cancer, and how structural information and high-throughput screening have been or can be used for drug discovery are provided herein.",

Although considerable progress has been made in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of CVD, there is still a critical need for novel diagnostic biomarkers and new therapeutic interventions to decrease the incidence of this disease. Recently, there is increasing evidence that circulating miRNAs (miRNAs), i.e. endogenous, stable, single-stranded, short, non-coding RNAs, can be used as diagnostic biomarkers for CVD. Furthermore, miRNAs represent potential novel therapeutic targets for several cardiovascular disorders. In this review we provides an overview of the effects of several CVD; including heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and pulmonary hypertension; on levels of circulating miRNAs. In addition, the use of miRNA as therapeutic targets is also discussed, as well as challenges and recommendations in their use in the diagnosis of CVD.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified as rare cell populations in many cancers, including leukemia and solid tumors. Accumulating evidence has suggested that CSCs are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into various types of cancer cells. Aberrant regulation of gene expression and some signaling pathways has been observed in CSCs compared to other tumor cells. CSCs are thought to be responsible for cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, recurrence and drug resistance. The CSC hypothesis has recently attracted much attention due to the potential for discovery and development of CSC-related therapies and the identification of key molecules involved in controlling the unique properties of CSC populations. Over the past several years, a tremendous amount of effort has been invested in the development of new drugs, such as nanomedicines, that can take advantage of the \"Achilles' heel\" of CSCs by targeting cell-surface molecular markers or various signaling pathways. Novel compounds and therapeutic strategies that selectively target CSCs have been identified, some of which have been evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. In this article, we review new findings related to the investigation of the CSC hypothesis, and discuss the crucial pathways involved in regulating the development of CSC populations and the advances in studies of drug resistance. In addition, we review new CSC-targeted therapeutic strategies aiming to eradicate malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Human infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and there is no cure currently. The 3CL protease (3CLpro) is a highly conserved protease which is indispensable for CoVs replication, and is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In this study we investigated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of Shuanghuanglian preparation, a Chinese traditional patent medicine with a long history for treating respiratory tract infection in China. We showed that either the oral liquid of Shuanghuanglian, the lyophilized powder of Shuanghuanglian for injection or their bioactive components dose-dependently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro as well as the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. Baicalin and baicalein, two ingredients of Shuanghuanglian, were characterized as the first noncovalent, nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography was distinctly different from those of known 3CLpro inhibitors. Baicalein was productively ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a \"shield\" in front of the catalytic dyad to effectively prevent substrate access to the catalytic dyad within the active site. Overall, this study provides an example for exploring the in vitro potency of Chinese traditional patent medicines and effectively identifying bioactive ingredients toward a specific target, and gains evidence supporting the in vivo studies of Shuanghuanglian oral liquid as well as two natural products for COVID-19 treatment.",

The design and implementation of high-throughput GPCR assays that allow the cost-effective screening of large compound libraries to identify novel drug candidates are critical in early drug discovery. Early functional GPCR assays depend primarily on the measurement of G-protein-mediated 2nd messenger generation. Taking advantage of the continuously deepening understanding of GPCR signal transduction, many G-protein-independent pathways are utilized to detect the activity of GPCRs, and may provide additional information on functional selectivity of candidate compounds. With the combination of automated imaging systems and label-free detection systems, such assays are now suitable for high-throughput screening (HTS). In this review, we summarize the most widely used GPCR assays and recent advances in HTS technologies for GPCR drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cisplatin is a clinically advanced and highly effective anticancer drug used in the treatment of a wide variety of malignancies, such as head and neck, lung, testis, ovary, breast cancer, etc. However, it has only a limited use in clinical practice due to its severe adverse effects, particularly nephrotoxicity; 20%–35% of patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI) after cisplatin administration. The nephrotoxic effect of cisplatin is cumulative and dose dependent and often necessitates dose reduction or withdrawal. Recurrent episodes of AKI result in impaired renal tubular function and acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease, uremia, and hypertensive nephropathy. The pathophysiology of cisplatin-induced AKI involves proximal tubular injury, apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular injury in the kidneys. At present, there are no effective drugs or methods for cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies show that numerous natural products (flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, polysaccharide, phenylpropanoids, etc.) have specific antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties that regulate the pathways associated with cisplatin-induced kidney damage. In this review we describe the molecular mechanisms of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and summarize recent findings in the field of natural products that undermine these mechanisms to protect against cisplatin-induced kidney damage and provide potential strategies for AKI treatment.",

    "abstract": "It has been widely recognized that inflammation, particularly chronic inflammation, can increase the risk of cancer and that the simultaneous treatment of inflammation and cancer may produce excellent therapeutic effects. Berberine, an alkaloid isolated from Rhizoma coptidis, has broad applications, particularly as an antibacterial agent in the clinic with a long history. Over the past decade, many reports have demonstrated that this natural product and its derivatives have high activity against both cancer and inflammation. In this review, we summarize the advances in studing berberine and its derivatives as anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agents in the digestive system; we also discuss their structure-activity relationship. These data should be useful for the development of this natural product as novel anticancer drugs with anti-inflammation activity.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become the greatest current threat to global public health. The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily attacks pulmonary tissues and impairs gas exchange leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic hypoxia. The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 largely rely on supportive and anti-thrombi treatment and the repurposing of antimalarial and antiviral drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. For a better mechanistic understanding of COVID-19, our present review focuses on its primary pathophysiologic features: hypoxia and cytokine storm, which are a prelude to multiple organ failure and lethality. We discussed a possible link between the activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, since HIF-1α is shown to suppress the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and upregulate disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17). In addition, the protein targets of HIF-1α are involved with the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and the subsequent inflammatory process. Furthermore, we hypothesized a potential utility of so-called \"hypoxic conditioning\" to activate HIF-1α-induced cytoprotective signaling for reduction of illness severity and improvement of vital organ function in patients with COVID-19. Taken together, we would propose further investigations into the hypoxia-related molecular mechanisms, from which novel targeted therapies can be developed for the improved management of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Peripheral nerve injury (PNI), one of the most common concerns following trauma, can result in a significant loss of sensory or motor function. Restoration of the injured nerves requires a complex cellular and molecular response to rebuild the functional axons so that they can accurately connect with their original targets. However, there is no optimized therapy for complete recovery after PNI. Supplementation with exogenous growth factors (GFs) is an emerging and versatile therapeutic strategy for promoting nerve regeneration and functional recovery. GFs activate the downstream targets of various signaling cascades through binding with their corresponding receptors to exert their multiple effects on neurorestoration and tissue regeneration. However, the simple administration of GFs is insufficient for reconstructing PNI due to their short half‑life and rapid deactivation in body fluids. To overcome these shortcomings, several nerve conduits derived from biological tissue or synthetic materials have been developed. Their good biocompatibility and biofunctionality made them a suitable vehicle for the delivery of multiple GFs to support peripheral nerve regeneration. After repairing nerve defects, the controlled release of GFs from the conduit structures is able to continuously improve axonal regeneration and functional outcome. Thus, therapies with growth factor (GF) delivery systems have received increasing attention in recent years. Here, we mainly review the therapeutic capacity of GFs and their incorporation into nerve guides for repairing PNI. In addition, the possible receptors and signaling mechanisms of the GF family exerting their biological effects are also emphasized.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Both mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation are implicated in neurodegeneration and neurodegenerative diseases. Accumulating evidence shows multiple links between mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Mitochondrial-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are recognized by immune receptors of microglia and aggravate neuroinflammation. On the other hand, inflammatory factors released by activated glial cells trigger an intracellular cascade, which regulates mitochondrial metabolism and function. The crosstalk between mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammatory activation is a complex and dynamic process. There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction precedes neuroinflammation during the progression of diseases. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the specific molecular mechanisms associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and the progression of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases may contribute to the identification of new targets for the treatment of diseases. In this review, we describe in detail the DAMPs that induce or aggravate neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases including mtDNA, mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), transcription factor A mitochondria (TFAM), cardiolipin, cytochrome c , mitochondrial Ca 2+ and iron.",

    "abstract": "Immune-checkpoint inhibitors show promising effects in the treatment of multiple tumor types. Biomarkers are biological indicators used to select patients for a systemic anticancer treatment, but there are only a few clinically useful biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden, which can be used to predict immunotherapy response. In this study, we established a database consisting of both gene expression and clinical data to identify biomarkers of response to anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies. A GEO screening was executed to identify datasets with simultaneously available clinical response and transcriptomic data regardless of cancer type. The screening was restricted to the studies involving administration of anti-PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab), anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab) or anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) agents. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Mann-Whitney test were executed across all genes to identify features related to therapy response. The database consisted of 1434 tumor tissue samples from 19 datasets with esophageal, gastric, head and neck, lung, and urothelial cancers, plus melanoma. The strongest druggable gene candidates linked to anti-PD-1 resistance were SPIN1 (AUC = 0.682, P = 9.1E-12), SRC (AUC = 0.667, P = 5.9E-10), SETD7 (AUC = 0.663, P = 1.0E-09), FGFR3 (AUC = 0.657, P = 3.7E-09), YAP1 (AUC = 0.655, P = 6.0E-09), TEAD3 (AUC = 0.649, P = 4.1E-08) and BCL2 (AUC = 0.634, P = 9.7E-08). In the anti-CTLA-4 treatment cohort, BLCAP (AUC = 0.735, P = 2.1E-06) was the most promising gene candidate. No therapeutically relevant target was found to be predictive in the anti-PD-L1 cohort. In the anti-PD-1 group, we were able to confirm the significant correlation with survival for the mismatch-repair genes MLH1 and MSH6. A web platform for further analysis and validation of new biomarker candidates was set up and available at https://www.rocplot.com/immune . In summary, a database and a web platform were established to investigate biomarkers of immunotherapy response in a large cohort of solid tumor samples. Our results could help to identify new patient cohorts eligible for immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ferroptotic cell death is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation that is initiated by ferrous iron and H 2 O 2 via Fenton reaction, in which the role of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) remains elusive. Brucine is a weak alkaline indole alkaloid extracted from the seeds of Strychnos nux-vomica , which has shown potent antitumor activity against various tumors, including glioma. In this study, we showed that brucine inhibited glioma cell growth in vitro and in vivo, which was paralleled by nuclear translocation of ATF3, lipid peroxidation, and increases of iron and H 2 O 2 . Furthermore, brucine-induced lipid peroxidation was inhibited or exacerbated when intracellular iron was chelated by deferoxamine (500 μM) or improved by ferric ammonium citrate (500 μM). Suppression of lipid peroxidation with lipophilic antioxidants ferrostatin-1 (50 μM) or liproxstatin-1 (30 μM) rescued brucine-induced glioma cell death. Moreover, knockdown of ATF3 prevented brucine-induced accumulation of iron and H 2 O 2 and glioma cell death. We revealed that brucine induced ATF3 upregulation and translocation into nuclei via activation of ER stress. ATF3 promoted brucine-induced H 2 O 2 accumulation via upregulating NOX4 and SOD1 to generate H 2 O 2 on one hand, and downregulating catalase and xCT to prevent H 2 O 2 degradation on the other hand. H 2 O 2 then contributed to brucine-triggered iron increase and transferrin receptor upregulation, as well as lipid peroxidation. This was further verified by treating glioma cells with exogenous H 2 O 2 alone. Moreover, H 2 O 2 reversely exacerbated brucine-induced ER stress. Taken together, ATF3 contributes to brucine-induced glioma cell ferroptosis via increasing H 2 O 2 and iron.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus and a major cause of end-stage renal disease with limited treatment options. Wogonin is a flavonoid derived from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, which has shown a potent renoprotective effect. But the mechanisms of action in DKD are not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of wogonin on glomerular podocytes in DKD using mouse podocyte clone 5 (MPC5) cells and diabetic mice model. MPC5 cells were treated with high glucose (30 mM). We showed that wogonin (4, 8, 16 μM) dose-dependently alleviated high glucose (HG)-induced MPC5 cell damage, accompanied by increased expression of WT-1, nephrin, and podocin proteins, and decreased expression of TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β as well as phosphorylated p65. Furthermore, wogonin treatment significantly inhibited HG-induced apoptosis in MPC5 cells. Wogonin reversed HG-suppressed autophagy in MPC5 cells, evidenced by increased ATG7, LC3-II, and Beclin-1 protein, and decreased p62 protein. We demonstrated that wogonin directly bound to Bcl-2 in MPC5 cells. In HG-treated MPC5 cells, knockdown of Bcl-2 abolished the beneficial effects of wogonin, whereas overexpression of Bcl-2 mimicked the protective effects of wogonin. Interestingly, we found that the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly decreased in biopsy renal tissue of diabetic nephropathy patients. In vivo experiments were conducted in STZ-induced diabetic mice, which were administered wogonin (10, 20, 40 mg · kg-1 · d-1, i.g.) every other day for 12 weeks. We showed that wogonin administration significantly alleviated albuminuria, histopathological lesions, and p65 NF-κB-mediated renal inflammatory response. Wogonin administration dose-dependently inhibited podocyte apoptosis and promoted podocyte autophagy in STZ-induced diabetic mice. This study for the first time demonstrates a novel action of wogonin in mitigating glomerulopathy and podocytes injury by regulating Bcl-2-mediated crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis. Wogonin may be a potential therapeutic drug against DKD.",

Cell metabolism, converting food to energy in organisms, is the primary self-sustaining mechanism for cell proliferation and reproduction, structure maintenance, and fight-or-flight responses to stimuli. Four major metabolic processes take place in the energy-producing process, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, glutamine metabolism, and fatty acid oxidation. Among them, glycolysis is the primary energy-producing mechanism in endothelial cells. The present review focused on glycolysis in endothelial cells under both physiological and pathological conditions. Since the switches among metabolic processes precede the functional changes and disease developments, some prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategies concerning the role of glycolysis in cardiovascular disease are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling is initiated by activation of transmembrane TGF-β receptors (TGFBR), which deploys Smad2/3 transcription factors to control cellular responses. Failure or dysregulation in the TGF-β signaling pathways leads to pathological conditions. TGF-β signaling is regulated at different levels along the pathways and begins with the liberation of TGF-β ligand from its latent form. The mechanisms of TGFBR activation display selectivity to cell types, agonists, and TGF-β isoforms, enabling precise control of TGF-β signals. In addition, the cell surface compartments used to release active TGF-β are surprisingly vibrant, using thrombospondins, integrins, matrix metalloproteinases and reactive oxygen species. The scope of TGFBR activation is further unfolded with the discovery of TGFBR activation initiated by other signaling pathways. The unique combination of mechanisms works in series to trigger TGFBR activation, which can be explored as therapeutic targets. This comprehensive review provides valuable insights into the diverse mechanisms underpinning TGFBR activation, shedding light on potential avenues for therapeutic exploration.",

Glutamate, while crucial for these processes, can lead to neuronal damage and death when present in excessive amounts. Our previous review delved into the cascade of excitotoxic injury events and the underlying mechanisms of excitotoxicity. Building on that foundation, this update summarizes the latest research on the role of excitotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as new cutting-edge techniques applied in the study of excitotoxicity. We also explore the mechanisms of action of various excitotoxicity inhibitors and their clinical development status. This comprehensive analysis aims to enhance our understanding of the nexus between excitotoxicity and neurodegenerative diseases, offering valuable insights for therapeutic strategies in these conditions.",

In this review, we address the current understanding of the oncogenic role of EZH2, including its PRC2-dependent transcriptional repression and PRC2-independent gene activation. We also discuss the connections between EZH2 and other silencing enzymes, such as DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase. We comprehensively address the architecture of the PRC2 complex and the crucial roles of each subunit. Finally, we summarize new progress in developing EZH2 inhibitors, which could be a new epigenetic therapy for cancers.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms linking hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. Natural killer (NK) cells account for 25%–50% of the total number of liver lymphocytes, suggesting that NK cells play an important role in liver immunity. The number of NK cells in the blood and tumor tissues of HCC patients is positively correlated with their survival and prognosis. Furthermore, a group of NK cell-associated genes in HCC tissues is positively associated with the prolonged survival. These facts suggest that NK cells and HCC progression are strongly associated. In this review, we describe the abnormal NK cells and their functional impairment in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection, which contribute to the progression of HCC. Then, we summarize the association of NK cells with HCC based on the abnormalities in the numbers and phenotypes of blood and liver NK cells in HCC patients. In particular, the exhaustion of NK cells that represents lower cytotoxicity and impaired cytokine production may serve as a predictor for the occurrence of HCC. Finally, we present the current achievements in NK cell immunotherapy conducted in mouse models of liver cancer and in clinical trials, highlighting how chemoimmunotherapy, NK cell transfer, gene therapy, cytokine therapy and mAb therapy improve NK cell function in HCC treatment. It is conceivable that NK cell-based anti-HCC therapeutic strategies alone or in combination with other therapies will be great promise for HCC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide responsible for 500 000 deaths annually. A number of risk factors are associated with either the induction of the disease or its progression; these include infection with hepatitis B or C virus, alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and certain congenital disorders. In around 80% of the cases, HCC is associated with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis and with inflammation and oxidative stress. In this review we focus firstly on the different risk factors for HCC and summarize the mechanisms by which each is considered to contribute to HCC. In the second part we look at the molecular processes involved in cancer progression. HCC development is recognized as a multistep process that normally develops over many years. Over this period several mutations accumulate in the cell and that stimulate malign transformation, growth, and metastatic behavior. Over the recent years it has become evident that not only the tumor cell itself but also the tumor microenviroment plays a major role in the development of a tumor. There is a direct link between the role of inflammation and cirrhosis with this microenviroment. Both in vitro and in vivo it has been shown that tumor formation and metastatic properties are linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process by which facillitates the tumor cell's attempts to migrate to a more favourable microenviroment. Several groups have analyzed the gene expression in HCC and its surrounding tissue by microarray and this has resulted in the molecular classification into a distinct number of classes. Here we also found a role for hypoxia induced gene expression leading to a clinically more aggressive gene expression in HCC. Molecular analysis also helped to identify important cellular pathways and possible therapeutic targets. The first molecule that in this way has shown clinical application for liver cancer is the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, others are currently in different stages of clinical studies like the mTOR inhibitor everolimus.",

    "abstract": "Secreted proteins play critical roles in physiological and pathological processes and can be used as biomarkers and therapies for aging and disease. Metrnl is a novel secreted protein homologous to the neurotrophin Metrn. But this protein, unlike Metrn that is mainly expressed in the brain, shows a relatively wider distribution in the body with high levels of expression in white adipose tissue and barrier tissues. This protein plays important roles in neural development, white adipose browning and insulin sensitization. Based on its expression and distinct functions, this protein is also called Cometin, Subfatin and Interleukin 39, which refer to its neurotrophic effect, adipokine function and the possible action as a cytokine, respectively. The spectrum of Metrnl functions remains to be determined, and the mechanisms of Metrnl action need to be elucidated. In this review, we focus on the discovery, structural characteristics, expression pattern and physiological functions of Metrnl, which will assist in developing this protein as a new therapeutic target or agent.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia plays an important role in the tumor microenvironment by allowing the development and maintenance of cancer cells, but the regulatory mechanisms by which tumor cells adapt to hypoxic conditions are not yet well understood. MicroRNAs are recognized as a new class of master regulators that control gene expression and are responsible for many normal and pathological cellular processes. Studies have shown that hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) regulates a panel of microRNAs, whereas some of microRNAs target HIF1. The interaction between microRNAs and HIF1 can account for many vital events relevant to tumorigenesis, such as angiogenesis, metabolism, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to anticancer therapy. This review will summarize recent findings on the roles of hypoxia and microRNAs in human cancer and illustrate the machinery by which microRNAs interact with hypoxia in tumor cells. It is expected to update our knowledge about the regulatory roles of microRNAs in regulating tumor microenvironments and thus benefit the development of new anticancer drugs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Current cancer immunotherapy has limited response rates in a large variety of solid tumors partly due to the low immunogenicity of the tumor cells and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM). A number of clinical cancer treatment modalities, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, photothermal and photodynamic therapy, have been shown to elicit immunogenicity by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). However, ICD-based immunotherapy is restricted by the ITM limiting its efficacy in eliciting a long-term antitumor immune response, and by severe systemic toxicity. To address these challenges, nanomedicine-based drug delivery strategies have been exploited for improving cancer immunotherapy by boosting ICD of the tumor cells. Nanosized drug delivery systems are promising for increasing drug accumulation at the tumor site and codelivering ICD inducers and immune inhibitors to simultaneously elicit the immune response and relieve the ITM. This review highlights the recent advances in nanomedicine-based immunotherapy utilizing ICD-based approaches. A perspective on the clinical translation of nanomedicine-based cancer immunotherapy is also provided.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a calcium (Ca 2+ )-permeable non-selective cation channel belonging to the TRP ion channel family. Oxidative stress-induced TRPM2 activation provokes aberrant intracellular Ca 2+ accumulation and cell death in a variety of cell types, including neurons. Aberrant TRPM2 function has been implicated in several neurological disorders including ischemia/stroke, Alzheimer's disease, neuropathic pain, Parkinson's disease and bipolar disorder. In addition to research identifying a role for TRPM2 in disease, progress has been made in the identification of physiological functions of TRPM2 in the brain, including recent evidence that TRPM2 is necessary for the induction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent long-term depression, an important form of synaptic plasticity at glutamate synapses. Here, we summarize recent evidence on the role of TRPM2 in the central nervous system (CNS) in health and disease and discuss the potential therapeutic implications of targeting TRPM2. Collectively, these studies suggest that TRPM2 represents a prospective novel therapeutic target for neurological disorders.",

The cancer immunotherapy is being emerged nowadays as a promising therapeutic modality in order to achieve a highly efficient therapeutic performance while circumventing tumor metastasis and relapse. Liposomal nanoparticles (NPs) may serve as an ideal platform for systemic delivery of the immune modulators. In this review, we summarize the cutting-edge progresses in liposomal NPs for cancer immunotherapy, with focus on dendritic cells, T cells, tumor cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages. The review highlights the major challenges and provides a perspective regarding the clinical translation of liposomal nanoparticle-based immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy has been widely used in treating cancer patients. Despite the tremendous progress in cancer treatment achieved during the last decades, drug resistance still accounts for most of the tumor relapses in chemotherapy-treated patients. Emerging evidence shows that microRNAs play an important role in regulating the drug sensitivity of tumor cells. However, the mechanism of microRNA-mediated drug resistance is not fully understood. Current data suggest that microRNAs can be categorized as oncogenic or tumor-suppressive based on their functions and targets. In tumor cells undergoing drug treatment, microRNAs can function either by decreasing expression of genes associated with multiple drug resistance or by promoting escape from apoptosis and inducing tumor stem cell development. This review aims to provide an updated understanding of the role of microRNAs in regulating chemotherapy resistance and a discussion of potential therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Gene-editing technology is an emerging therapeutic modality for manipulating the eukaryotic genome by using target-sequence-specific engineered nucleases. Because of the exceptional advantages that gene-editing technology offers in facilitating the accurate correction of sequences in a genome, gene editing-based therapy is being aggressively developed as a next-generation therapeutic approach to treat a wide range of diseases. However, strategies for precise engineering and delivery of gene-editing nucleases, including zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nuclease, and CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated nuclease Cas9), present major obstacles to the development of gene-editing therapies, as with other gene-targeting therapeutics. Currently, viral and non-viral vectors are being studied for the delivery of these nucleases into cells in the form of DNA, mRNA, or proteins. Clinical trials are already ongoing, and in vivo studies are actively investigating the applicability of CRISPR/Cas9 techniques. However, the concept of correcting the genome poses major concerns from a regulatory perspective, especially in terms of safety. This review addresses current research trends and delivery strategies for gene editing-based therapeutics in non-clinical and clinical settings and considers the associated regulatory issues.",

Apart from the stereoselectivity of enantiomer-protein binding, enantiomer-enantiomer interactions that may induce allosteric effects are also described.

Nicotine hijacks nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and interferes with physiological function of the cholinergic system. In this review, we describe the anatomical organization of the cholinergic system and the key nAChR subtypes mediating cholinergic regulation of DA transmission and nicotine reward and dependence, in an effort to identify potential targets for smoking intervention. Cholinergic modulation of midbrain DA systems relies on topographic organization of mesopontine cholinergic projections, and activation of nAChRs in midbrain DA neurons. Previous studies have revealed that α4, α6, and β2 subunit-containing nAChRs expressed in midbrain DA neurons and their terminals in the striatum regulate firings of midbrain DA neurons and activity-dependent dopamine release in the striatum. These nAChRs undergo modification upon chronic nicotine exposure. Clinical investigation has demonstrated that partial agonists of these receptors elevate the success rate of smoking cessation relative to placebo. However, further investigations are required to refine the drug targets to mitigate unpleasant side-effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Immunotherapy, as a powerful strategy for cancer treatment, has achieved tremendous efficacy in clinical trials. Despite these advancements, there is much to do in terms of enhancing therapeutic benefits and decreasing the side effects of cancer immunotherapy. Advanced nanobiomaterials, including liposomes, polymers, and silica, play a vital role in the codelivery of drugs and immunomodulators. These nanobiomaterial-based delivery systems could effectively promote antitumor immune responses and simultaneously reduce toxic adverse effects. Furthermore, nanobiomaterials may also combine with each other or with traditional drugs via different mechanisms, thus giving rise to more accurate and efficient tumor treatment. Here, an overview of the latest advancement in these nanobiomaterials used for cancer immunotherapy is given, describing outstanding systems, including lipid-based nanoparticles, polymer-based scaffolds or micelles, inorganic nanosystems, and others.",

Moreover, Wnt pathway inhibitors have been identified as novel antitumor drugs and applied in ongoing clinical trials. This research progress has generated increasing interests for investigating the effects of Wnt pathway inhibitors on MI healing. In this short review, we summarize the roles of Wnt signaling pathways in post-MI heart and the therapeutic effects of Wnt pathway inhibitors on MI, and discuss the underlying mechanisms of Wnt pathway inhibitors in cardiac repairing.",

Antiviral tests using native SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells confirmed that 7 of these drugs (clemastine, amiodarone, trimeprazine, bosutinib, toremifene, flupenthixol, and azelastine) significantly inhibited SARS2 replication, reducing supernatant viral RNA load with a promising level of activity. Three of the drugs were classified as histamine receptor antagonists with clemastine showing the strongest anti-SARS2 activity (EC50 = 0.95 ± 0.83 µM). Our work suggests that these 7 drugs could enter into further in vivo studies and clinical investigations for COVID-19 treatment.",

    "abstract": "Sulforaphane is a common antioxidant selectively abundant in cruciferous plants, which exhibits effective anti-cancer actions in control of tumorigenesis or progression of various cancers. A recent study has shown that sulforaphane attenuates the EGFR signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), suggesting its potential anti-metastatic effects. In this study we assessed the involvement of sulforaphane and miR-616-5p in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and NSCLC metastasis. Sulforaphane suppressed the cell proliferation in human NSCLC cell lines H1299, 95C and 95D with IC50 values of 9.52±1.23, 9.04±1.90 and 17.35±2.03 μmol/L, respectively. At low concentrations (1–5 μmol/L), sulforaphane dose-dependently inhibited the migration and invasion of 95D and H1299 cells with relatively high metastatic potential. The anti-metastatic action of sulforaphane was confirmed in 95D and H1299 cell xenografts in vivo. In fresh NSCLC tissue samples from 179 patients, miR-616-5p levels were upregulated in late-stage NSCLCs, and strongly correlated with risk of NSCLC recurrence and metastasis. Consistent with the clinic observation, miR-616-5p levels in the 3 NSCLC cell lines were correlated with their metastatic ability, and were decreased by sulforaphane treatment. Silencing miR-616-5p markedly suppressed the migration and invasion of 95D cells in vitro and NSCLC metastasis in vivo. Further studies revealed that miR-616-5p directly targeted GSK3β and decreased its expression, whereas sulforaphane decreased miR-616-5p levels by histone modification, and followed by inactivation of the GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway and inhibition of EMT, which was characterized by loss of epithelial markers and acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype in NSCLC cells. Our findings suggest that sulforaphane is a potential adjuvant chemotherapeutic agent for the prevention of NSCLC recurrence and metastasis, and miR-616-5p can be clinically utilized as a biomarker or therapeutic target to inhibit metastasis.",

Exacerbating this issue, there are currently few drugs reported to effectively treat silicosis. Tetrandrine is the only drug approved for silicosis treatment in China, and despite more than decades of use, its efficacy and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Here, in this study, we established silicosis mouse models to investigate the effectiveness of tetrandrine of early and late therapeutic administration. To this end, we used multiple cardiopulmonary function test, as well as markers for inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, using single cell RNA sequencing and transcriptomics of lung tissue and quantitative microarray analysis of serum from silicosis and control mice, our results provide a novel description of the target pathways for tetrandrine. Specifically, we found that tetrandrine attenuated silicosis by inhibiting both the canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in lung macrophages. Taken together, our work showed that tetrandrine yielded promising results against silicosis-associated inflammation and fibrosis and further lied the groundwork for understanding its molecular targets. Our results also facilitated the wider adoption and development of tetrandirne, potentially accelerating a globally accepted therapeutic strategy for silicosis.",

    "abstract": "Sorafenib, which inhibits multiple kinases, is an effective frontline therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferroptosis is a form of iron-dependent programmed cell death regulated by lipid peroxidation, which can be induced by sorafenib treatment. Oncoprotein hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) participates in multiple biological pro-tumor processes, including growth, metastasis, drug resistance, and metabolic reprogramming. However, the role of HBXIP in sorafenib-induced ferroptotic cell death remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that HBXIP prevents sorafenib-induced ferroptosis in HCC cells. Sorafenib decreased HBXIP expression, and overexpression of HBXIP blocked sorafenib-induced HCC cell death. Interestingly, suppression of HBXIP increased malondialdehyde (MDA) production and glutathione (GSH) depletion to promote sorafenib-mediated ferroptosis and cell death. Ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, reversed the enhanced anticancer effect of sorafenib caused by HBXIP silencing in HCC cells. Regarding the molecular mechanism, HBXIP transcriptionally induced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) via coactivating the transcriptional factor ZNF263, resulting in the accumulation of free fatty acids and suppression of ferroptosis. Functionally, activation of the HBXIP/SCD axis reduced the anticancer activity of sorafenib and suppressed ferroptotic cell death in vivo and in vitro. HBXIP/SCD axis-mediated ferroptosis can serve as a novel downstream effector of sorafenib. Our results provide new evidence for clinical decisions in HCC therapy.",

However, the role and molecular mechanisms of CA in GC are not completely understood. In the present study, we found that CA-induced ER stress and cell death via the PERK-CHOP axis and Ca2+ release in GC cells. Inhibition of ER stress using specific-siRNA blocked CA-induced cell death. Interestingly, CA treatment resulted in autophagic cell death by inducing Beclin-1, ATG5, and LC3B expression and by inhibiting p62 expression whereas autophagy inhibition suppressed CA-induced cell death. We showed that CA induces the inhibition of G9a and the activation of LC3B. Moreover, CA inhibited G9a binding on Beclin-1 and LC3B promoter. Overall, these results suggested that CA regulates the PERK-CHOP signaling, and G9a inhibition activates autophagic cell death via ER stress in GC cells.",

The purpose of the three phase I studies was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending oral doses of VV116 in healthy subjects, as well as the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics and safety of VV116. Three studies were launched sequentially: Study 1 (single ascending-dose study, SAD), Study 2 (multiple ascending-dose study, MAD), and Study 3 (food-effect study, FE). A total of 86 healthy subjects were enrolled in the studies. VV116 tablets or placebo were administered per protocol requirements. Blood samples were collected at the scheduled time points for pharmacokinetic analysis. 116-N1, the metabolite of VV116, was detected in plasma and calculated for the PK parameters. In SAD, AUC and Cmax increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner in the dose range of 25-800 mg. T1/2 was within 4.80-6.95 h. In MAD, the accumulation ratio for Cmax and AUC indicated a slight accumulation upon repeated dosing of VV116. In FE, the standard meal had no effect on Cmax and AUC of VV116. No serious adverse event occurred in the studies, and no subject withdrew from the studies due to adverse events. Thus, VV116 exhibited satisfactory safety and tolerability in healthy subjects, which supports the continued investigation of VV116 in patients with COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute, progressive hypoxic respiratory failure that could develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with very high mortality rate. ALI is believed to be caused by uncontrolled inflammation, and multiple types of immune cells, especially neutrophils, are critically involved in the development of ALI. The treatment for ALI/ARDS is very limited, a better understanding of the pathogenesis and new therapies are urgently needed. Here we discover that GPR84, a medium chain fatty acid receptor, plays critical roles in ALI development by regulating neutrophil functions. GPR84 is highly upregulated in the cells isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of LPS-induced ALI mice. GPR84 deficiency or blockage significantly ameliorated ALI mice lung inflammation by reducing neutrophils infiltration and oxidative stress. Further studies reveal that activation of GPR84 strongly induced reactive oxygen species production from neutrophils by stimulating Lyn, AKT and ERK1/2 activation and the assembly of the NADPH oxidase. These results reveal an important role of GPR84 in neutrophil functions and lung inflammation and strongly suggest that GPR84 is a potential drug target for ALI.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver damage starting with liver steatosis and lipid disorders presented as the hallmark. Cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R) is the receptor of endocannabinoids mainly expressed in immune cells. Our preliminary study revealed the preventative role of CB2R in liver injury related to lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of CB2R in NAFLD and the underlying mechanism related to microbial community. High-fat diet-induced NAFLD model was established in mice. We found that hepatic CB2R expression was significantly reduced in NAFLD mice and CB2R-/- mice fed with normal chow. Interestingly, cohousing with or transplanted with microbiota from WT mice, or treatment with an antibiotic cocktail ameliorated the NAFLD phenotype of CB2R-/- mice. The gut dysbiosis in CB2R-/- mice including increased Actinobacteriota and decreased Bacteroidota was similar to that of NAFLD patients and NAFLD mice. Microbial functional analysis and metabolomics profiling revealed obviously disturbed tryptophan metabolism in NAFLD patients and NAFLD mice, which were also seen in CB2R-/- mice. Correlation network showed that the disordered tryptophan metabolites such as indolelactic acid (ILA) and xanthurenic acid in CB2R-/- mice were mediated by gut dysbiosis and related to NAFLD severity indicators. In vitro and in vivo validation experiments showed that the enriched tryptophan metabolites ILA aggravated NAFLD phenotypes. These results demonstrate the involvement of CB2R in NAFLD, which is related to gut microbiota-mediated tryptophan metabolites. Our findings highlight CB2R and the associated microbes and tryptophan metabolites as promising targets for the treatment of NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in the ability of phytochemicals to prevent chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. However, some of these agents have poor bioavailability and many of the in-depth studies into their mechanisms of action have been carried out in vitro using doses which are unachievable in humans. In order to optimize the design of chemopreventive treatment, it is important to determine which of the many reported mechanisms of action are clinically relevant. In this review we consider the physiologically achievable doses for a few of the best studied agents (indole-3-carbinol, diindolylmethane, curcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate and resveratrol) and summarize the data derived from studies using these low concentrations in cell culture. We then cite examples of in vitro effects which have been observed in vivo. Finally, the ability of agent combinations to act synergistically or antagonistically is considered. We conclude that each of the compounds shows an encouraging range of activities in vitro at concentrations which are likely to be physiologically relevant. There are also many examples of in vivo studies which validate in vitro observations. An important consideration is that combinations of agents can result in significant activity at concentrations where any single agent is inactive. Thus, for each of the compounds reviewed here, in vitro studies have provided useful insights into their mechanisms of action in humans. However, data are lacking on the full range of activities at low doses in vitro and the benefits or otherwise of combinations in vivo.",

Therefore, autophagy is considered a protein and organelle quality control mechanism that maintains normal cellular homeostasis. Dysfunctional autophagy has been observed in ageing tissues and several ageing-associated diseases. Lifespan of model organisms such as yeast, worms, flies, and mice can be extended through promoting autophagy, either by genetic manipulations such as over-expression of Sirtuin 1, or by administrations of rapamycin, resveratrol or spermidine. The evidence supports that autophagy may play an important role in delaying ageing or extending lifespan. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about autophagy and its regulation, outline recent developments ie the genetic and pharmacological manipulations of autophagy that affects the lifespan, and discuss the role of autophagy in the ageing-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) along with carbon monoxide and nitric oxide is an important signaling molecule that has undergone large numbers of fundamental investigations. H2S is involved in various physiological activities associated with the regulation of homeostasis, vascular contractility, pro- and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as pro- and anti-apoptotic activities etc. However, the actions of H2S are influenced by its concentration, reaction time, and cell/disease types. Therefore, H2S is a signaling molecule without definite effect. The use of existing H2S donors is limited because of the instant release and short lifetime of H2S. Thus, translational medicine involving the sustained and controlled release of H2S is of great value for both scientific and clinical uses. H2S donation can be manipulated by different ways, including where H2S is given, how H2S is donated, or the specific structures of H2S-releasing drugs and H2S donor molecules. This review briefly summarizes recent progress in research on the physiological and pathological functions of H2S and H2S-releasing drugs, and suggests hope for future investigations.",

    "abstract": "Stroke creates a complex interplay of multiple signaing pathways including excitotoxicity, ionic imbalance, inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. There are very few treatments that have been shown to be beneficial in acute stroke. Recent findings have provided insights into the pathophysiology and mechanisms of ischemic stroke, complementing the traditional glutamate hypothesis: the molecular interaction between PSD95 and GluN2B has been identified as a culprit in stroke-mediated excitotoxicity, leading to the discovery of NA-1, a peptide that disrupts that interaction, as a potent neuroprotective agent for the treatment of acute stroke. In this review we describe its signaling cascade, the target of its therapeutic intervention and its translation from bench to clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in the invasion and metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Eighty six HCC tissues samples and HCC cell line Bel-7402 were examined. The protein expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh), nuclear glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli1), MMP-9 and p-ERK1/2 in HCC was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Boyden chamber assay and wound-healing assay were used to quantify the invasion and metastasis of Bel-7402 cells. In 86 HCC tissue samples, the positive ratio of Shh and nucleus Gli1 was 67.44% (58/86) and 60.47% (52/86), respectively; the expression of nucleus Gli1 was correlated with the tumor pathological grade (P=0.034), and with the ability of the tumor to invade and metastasize (P=0.001); the expression of nucleus Gli1 was also correlated with p-ERK1/2 (P=0.031) and with MMP-9 (P=0.034). Neither Shh, nor nucleus Gli1 was observed in normal liver tissue. KAAD-cyclopamine (KAAD-cyc), a specific inhibitor of the Hh pathway, at the concentrations of 1 and 4 μmol/L inhibited the invasion and migration of Bel-7402 cells and decreased the expression of Gli1 in nucleus and MMP-9, p-ERK1/2 proteins in Bel-7402 cells. On the other hand, Shh, a ligand of the Hh pathway, at the concentration of 0.5 μg/mL produced opposite effects. The MAPK pathway inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 at the concentrations of 5 and 10 μmol/L inhibited invasion and metastasis of Bel-7402 cells induced by Shh, and decreased the expression of p-ERK1/2 and MMP-9. However, U0126 and PD98059 had no effect on the expression of Gli1. Hh signaling pathway mediates invasion and metastasis of human HCC by up-regulating the protein expression of MMP-9 via ERK pathway.",

    "abstract": "Ginseng, the root of Panax ginseng, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine as a tonic herb that provides many beneficial effects. Pharmacologic studies in the last decades have shown that ginsenosides (ginseng saponins) are primarily responsible for the actions of ginseng. However, the effects of ginseng are not fully explained by ginsenosides. Recently, another class of active ingredients called gintonin was identified. Gintonin is a complex of glycosylated ginseng proteins containing lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) that are the intracellular lipid mitogenic mediator. Gintonin specifically and potently activates the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for LPA. Thus, the actions of ginseng are now also linked to LPA and its GPCRs. This linkage opens new dimensions for ginseng pharmacology and LPA therapeutics. In the present review, we evaluate the pharmacology of ginseng with the traditional viewpoint of Yin and Yang components. Furthermore, we will compare ginsenoside and gintonin based on the modern view of molecular pharmacology in terms of ion channels and GPCRs.",

The secondary injury in traumatic brain injury consists of a complex cascade of processes that simultaneously react to the primary injury to the brain. This cascade has been the target of numerous therapeutic agents investigated over the last 30 years, but no neuroprotective treatment option is currently available that improve neurological outcome after traumatic brain injury. Progesterone has long been considered merely a female reproductive hormone. Numerous studies, however, show that progesterone has substantial pleiotropic properties as a neuroprotective agent in both animal models and humans. Here, we review the increasing evidence that progesterone can act as a neuroprotective agent to treat traumatic brain injury and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Additionally, we discuss the current progress of clinical studies on the application of progesterone in the treatment of traumatic brain injuries.",

It also plays critical roles in diseases such as cancer and retinopathy. A delicate balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors ensures normal physiological homeostasis. Endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors are proteins or protein fragments that are formed in the body and have the ability to limit angiogenesis. Many endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors have been discovered, and the list continues to grow. Endogenous protein/peptide inhibitors are relatively less toxic, better tolerated and have a lower risk of drug resistance, which makes them attractive as drug candidates. In this review, we highlight ten novel endogenous protein angiogenesis inhibitors discovered within the last five years, including ISM1, FKBPL, CHIP, ARHGAP18, MMRN2, SOCS3, TAp73, ZNF24, GPR56 and JWA. Although some of these proteins have been well characterized for other biological functions, we focus on their new and specific roles in angiogenesis inhibition and discuss their potential for therapeutic application.",

    "abstract": "MK-8776 is a recently described inhibitor that is highly selective for checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), which can weaken the DNA repair capacity in cancer cells to achieve chemo-sensitization. A number of studies show that MK-8776 enhances the cytotoxicity of hydroxyurea and gemcitabine without increasing normal tissue toxicities. Thus far, there is no evidence that MK-8776 can be used as a radiotherapy sensitization agent. In this study, we investigated the effects of MK-8776 on the radiosensitivity of 3 human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines MDA-MB-231, BT-549 and CAL-51. MK-8776 dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231, BT-549 and CAL-51 cells with IC50 values of 9.4, 17.6 and 2.1 μmol/L, respectively. Compared with irradiation-alone treatment, pretreatment with a low dose of MK-8776 (100-400 nmol/L) significantly increased irradiation-induced γH2A.X foci in the 3 TNBC cell lines, suggesting enhanced DNA damage by MK-8776, inhibited the cell proliferation and increased the radiosensitivity of the 3 TNBC cell lines. Similar results were obtained in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors in nude mice that received MK-8776 (15 or 40 mg/kg, ip) 26 d after irradiation. To explore the mechanisms underlying the radio-sensitization by MK-8776, we used TEM and found that irradiation significantly increased the numbers of autophagosomes in the 3 TNBC cell lines. Moreover, irradiation markedly elevated the levels of Atg5, and promoted the transformation of LC3-I to LC3-II in the cells. Pretreatment with the low dose of MK-8776 suppressed these effects. The above results suggest that MK-8776 increases human TNBC radiosensitivity by inhibiting irradiation-induced autophagy and that MK-8776 may be a potential agent in the radiosensitization of human TNBC.",

    "abstract": "To achieve synergistic therapeutic efficacy and prevent cancer relapse, chemotherapy and immunotherapy have been combined as a new modality for tumor treatment. In this work, we designed a redox-responsive immunostimulatory polymeric prodrug carrier, PSSN10, for programmable co-delivery of an immune checkpoint inhibitor NLG919 (NLG) and a chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX). NLG-containing PSSN10 prodrug polymers were self-assembled into nano-sized micelles that served as a carrier to load DOX (DOX/PSSN10 micelles). DOX/PSSN10 micelles displayed spherical morphology with a size of ∼170 nm. DOX was effectively loaded into PSSN10 micelles with a loading efficiency of 84.0%. In vitro DOX release studies showed that rapid drug release could be achieved in the highly redox environment after intracellular uptake by tumor cells. In 4T1.2 tumor-bearing mice, DOX/PSSN10 micelles exhibited greater accumulation of DOX and NLG in the tumor tissues compared with other organs. The PSSN10 carrier dose-dependently enhanced T-cell immune responses in the lymphocyte-Panc02 co-culture experiments, and significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo. DOX/PSSN10 micelles showed potent cytotoxicity in vitro against 4T1.2 mouse breast cancer cells and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells comparable to that of DOX. In 4T1.2 tumor-bearing mice, DOX/PSSN10 mixed micelles (5 mg DOX/kg, iv) was more effective than DOXIL (a clinical formulation of liposomal DOX) or free DOX in inhibiting the tumor growth and prolonging the survival of the treated mice. In addition, a more immunoactive tumor microenvironment was observed in the mice treated with PSSN10 or DOX/PSSN10 micelles compared with the other treatment groups. In conclusion, systemic delivery of DOX via PSSN10 nanocarrier results in synergistic anti-tumor activity.",

    "abstract": "Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) play important roles in mediating cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. RNS activate multiple signaling pathways and participate in different cellular events in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recent studies have indicated that caveolin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) are important signaling molecules in the pathological process of ischemic brain injury. During cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, the production of nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−), two representative RNS, down-regulates the expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and, in turn, further activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to promote RNS generation. The increased RNS further induce MMP activation and mediate disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), aggravating the brain damage in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, the feedback interaction among RNS/Cav-1/MMPs provides an amplified mechanism for aggravating ischemic brain damage during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Targeting the RNS/Cav-1/MMP pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy for protecting against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this mini-review article, we highlight the important role of the RNS/Cav-1/MMP signaling cascades in ischemic stroke injury and review the current progress of studies seeking therapeutic compounds targeting the RNS/Cav-1/MMP signaling cascades to attenuate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Several representative natural compounds, including calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside, baicalin, Momordica charantia polysaccharide (MCP), chlorogenic acid, lutein and lycopene, have shown potential for targeting the RNS/Cav-1/MMP signaling pathway to protect the brain in ischemic stroke. Therefore, the RNS/Cav-1/MMP pathway is an important therapeutic target in ischemic stroke treatment.",

    "abstract": "ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are ubiquitously expressed on the plasma membrane of cells in multiple organs, including the heart, pancreas and brain. KATP channels play important roles in controlling and regulating cellular functions in response to metabolic state, which are inhibited by ATP and activated by Mg-ADP, allowing the cell to couple cellular metabolic state (ATP/ADP ratio) to electrical activity of the cell membrane. KATP channels mediate insulin secretion in pancreatic islet beta cells, and controlling vascular tone. Under pathophysiological conditions, KATP channels play cytoprotective role in cardiac myocytes and neurons during ischemia and/or hypoxia. KATP channel is a hetero-octameric complex, consisting of four pore-forming Kir6.x and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor SURx subunits. These subunits are differentially expressed in various cell types, thus determining the sensitivity of the cells to specific channel modifiers. Sulfonylurea class of antidiabetic drugs blocks KATP channels, which are neuroprotective in stroke, can be one of the high stoke risk factors for diabetic patients. In this review, we discussed the potential effects of KATP channel blockers when used under pathological conditions related to diabetics and cerebral ischemic stroke.",

Despite a few clinical successes, further endeavors are still needed to tackle unresolved issues, including limited response rates, development of resistance, and immune-related toxicities. Accumulating evidence has pinpointed the tumor microenvironment (TME) as one of the major obstacles in cancer immunotherapy due to its detrimental impacts on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Nanomedicine has been battling with the TME in the past several decades, and the experience obtained could be exploited to improve current paradigms of immunotherapy. Here, we discuss the metabolic features of the TME and its influence on different types of immune cells. The recent progress in nanoenabled cancer immunotherapy has been summarized with a highlight on the modulation of immune cells, tumor stroma, cytokines and enzymes to reverse the immunosuppressive TME.",

    "abstract": "Dominant negative mutant G proteins have provided critical insight into the mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, but the mechanisms underlying the dominant negative characteristics are not completely understood. The aim of this study was to determine the structure of the dominant negative Gαi1β1γ2 G203A/A326S complex (Gi-DN) and to reveal the structural basis of the mutation-induced phenotype of Gαi1β1γ2. The three subunits of the Gi-DN complex were co-expressed with a baculovirus expression system. The Gi-DN heterotrimer was purified, and the structure of its complex with GDP was determined through X-ray crystallography. The Gi-DN heterotrimer structure revealed a dual mechanism underlying the dominant negative characteristics. The mutations weakened the hydrogen bonding network between GDP/GTP and the binding pocket residues, and increased the interactions in the Gα-Gβγ interface. Concomitantly, the Gi-DN heterotrimer adopted a conformation, in which the C-terminus of Gαi and the N-termini of both the Gβ and Gγ subunits were more similar to the GPCR-bound state compared with the wild type complex. From these structural observations, two additional mutations (T48F and D272F) were designed that completely abolish the GDP binding of the Gi-DN heterotrimer. Overall, the results suggest that the mutations impede guanine nucleotide binding and Gα-Gβγ protein dissociation and favor the formation of the G protein/GPCR complex, thus blocking signal propagation. In addition, the structure provides a rationale for the design of other mutations that cause dominant negative effects in the G protein, as exemplified by the T48F and D272F mutations.",

    "abstract": "Celastrol is a triterpene derived from the traditional Chinese medicine Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f, which displays potential anticancer activity. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer effects of celastrol against clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and the underlying mechanisms. Using Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) database we conducted a bioinformatics analysis, which showed that the mRNA levels of liver-X receptors α (LXRα) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in ccRCC tissues were significantly lower than those in adjacent normal tissues. This result was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis of 4 ccRCC clinical specimens, which showed that the protein expression of LXRα and ABCA1 was downregulated. Similar results were obtained in a panel of ccRCC cell lines (786-O, A498, SN12C, and OS-RC-2). In 786-O and SN12C cells, treatment with celastrol (0.25–2.0 μM) concentration-dependently inhibited the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Furthermore, we demonstrated that celastrol inhibited the invasion of 786-O cells through reducing lipid accumulation; celastrol concentration-dependently promoted autophagy to reduce lipid storage. Moreover, we revealed that celastrol dramatically activated LXRα signaling, and degraded lipid droplets by inducing lipophagy in 786-O cells. Finally, celastrol promoted cholesterol efflux from 786-O cells via ABCA1. In high-fat diet-promoted ccRCC cell line 786-O xenograft model, administration of celastrol (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg·kg−1·d−1, for 4 weeks, i.p.) dose-dependently inhibited the tumor growth with upregulated LXRα and ABCA1 protein in tumor tissue. In conclusion, this study reveals that celastrol triggers lipophagy in ccRCC by activating LXRα, promotes ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, suppresses EMT progress, and ultimately inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as tumor growth. Thus, our study provides evidence that celastrol can be used as a lipid metabolism-based anticancer therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved and lysosome-dependent process for degrading and recycling cellular constituents. Autophagy is activated following an ischemic insult or preconditioning, but it may exert dual roles in cell death or survival during these two processes. Preconditioning or lethal ischemia may trigger autophagy via multiple signaling pathways involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, AMPK/TSC/mTOR, Beclin 1/BNIP3/SPK2, and FoxO/NF-κB transcription factors, etc. Autophagy then interacts with apoptotic and necrotic signaling pathways to regulate cell death. Autophagy may also maintain cell function by removing protein aggregates or damaged mitochondria. To date, the dual roles of autophagy in ischemia and preconditioning have not been fully clarified. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the recent progress in the mechanisms underlying autophagy activation during ischemia and preconditioning. A better understanding of the dual effects of autophagy in ischemia and preconditioning could help to develop new strategies for the preventive treatment of ischemia.",

Here, we highlight the complex molecular signaling that takes place in neurons, glial cells and the blood-brain barrier following ischemic insult. We also describe the evidence of TRPM2 involvement in these processes, as shown from numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that utilize genetic and pharmacological approaches. This evidence implicates TRPM2 in a broad range of pathways that take place every stage of cerebral ischemic injury, thus making TRPM2 a promising target for drug development for stroke and other neurodegenerative conditions of the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Sorafenib is currently the standard chemotherapy drug for treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). But its efficacy requires improvement, it is imperative to seek therapeutic strategies that combine sorafenib with other anticancer agents. In this study we investigated the synergistic anticancer effect of combining sorafenib and artesunate, an anti-malaria drug derivative, against HCC in vitro and in vivo. We first showed that artesunate (1-100 μM) alone dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of five HCC cell lines tested with IC50 values of around 100 μM. Artesunate treatment dose-dependently increased the ROS level in both HuH7 and Hep3B cells; addition of NAC significantly ameliorated the antiproliferation effect of artesunate against HuH7 and Hep3B cells. Then we demonstrated that combination of sorafenib and artesunate exerted synergistic antiproliferation effect and induced synergistic apoptosis in HCC cell lines. In nude mice bearing Hep3B xenografts, combined administration of sorafenib and artesunate significantly enhanced the suppression on tumor growth. We further revealed that sorafenib dose-dependently decreased the levels of p-ERK and p-STAT3, whereas artesunate markedly increased the levels of p-ERK and p-STAT3 in HuH7 and Hep3B cells. When used in combination, sorafenib abolished artesunate-elevated levels of p-STAT3 and p-ERK. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of ERK by inhibitor PD0325901 or STAT3 by inhibitor Stattic markedly enhanced the anticancer activity of artesunate, suggesting that suppression of ERK and STAT3 signaling by sorafenib contributes to the synergistic anticancer activity against HCC caused by combination of sorafenib and artesunate. Taken together, our results provide an evidence for possible use of sorafenib plus artesunate or artemisinin analogs for treatment of HCC in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), also known as APO2L, belongs to the tumor necrosis factor family. By binding to the death receptor 4 (DR4) or DR5, TRAIL induces apoptosis of tumor cells without causing side toxicity in normal tissues. In recent years TRAIL-based therapy has attracted great attention for its promise of serving as a cancer drug candidate. However, the treatment efficacy of TRAIL protein was under expectation in the clinical trials because of the short half-life and the resistance of cancer cells. TRAIL gene transfection can produce a “bystander effect” of tumor cell killing and provide a potential solution to TRAIL-based cancer therapy. In this review we focus on TRAIL gene therapy and various design strategies of TRAIL DNA delivery including non-viral vectors and cell-based TRAIL therapy. In order to sensitize the tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, combination therapy of TRAIL DNA with other drugs by the codelivery methods for yielding a synergistic antitumor efficacy is summarized. The opportunities and challenges of TRAIL-based gene delivery and therapy are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that agents targeting gut dysbiosis are effective for improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the potential mechanisms remain unclear. In this study we investigated the effects of berberine on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in two rat models of visceral hypersensitivity, i.e., specific pathogen-free SD rats subjected to chronic water avoidance stress (WAS) and treated with berberine (200 mg· kg-1 ·d-1, ig, for 10 days) as well as germ-free (GF) rats subjected to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a patient with IBS (designated IBS-FMT) and treated with berberine (200 mg· kg-1 ·d-1, ig, for 2 weeks). Before the rats were sacrificed, visceral sensation and depressive behaviors were evaluated. Then colonic tryptase was measured and microglial activation in the dorsal lumbar spinal cord was assessed. The fecal microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured. We showed that berberine treatment significantly alleviated chronic WAS-induced visceral hypersensitivity and activation of colonic mast cells and microglia in the dorsal lumbar spinal cord. Transfer of fecal samples from berberine-treated stressed donors to GF rats protected against acute WAS. FMT from a patient with IBS induced visceral hypersensitivity and pro-inflammatory phenotype in microglia, while berberine treatment reversed the microglial activation and altered microbial composition and function and SCFA profiles in stools of IBS-FMT rats. We demonstrated that berberine did not directly influence LPS-induced microglial activation in vitro. In both models, several SCFA-producing genera were enriched by berberine treatment, and positively correlated to the morphological parameters of microglia. In conclusion, activation of microglia in the dorsal lumbar spinal cord was involved in the pathogenesis of IBS caused by dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and the berberine-altered gut microbiome mediated the modulatory effects of the agent on microglial activation and visceral hypersensitivity, providing a potential option for the treatment of IBS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The putative medium-chain free fatty acid receptor GPR84 is a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in myeloid cells that constitute the innate immune system, including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages in the periphery and microglia in the brain. The fact that GPR84 expression in leukocytes is remarkably increased under acute inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNFα suggests that it may play a role in the development of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Here we demonstrate that GPR84 is highly upregulated in inflamed colon tissues of active ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Infiltrating GPR84 + macrophages are significantly increased in the colonic mucosa of both the UC patients and the mice with colitis. Consistently, GPR84 −/− mice are resistant to the development of colitis induced by DSS. GPR84 activation imposes pro-inflammatory properties in colonic macrophages through enhancing NLRP3 inflammasome activation, while the loss of GPR84 prevents the M1 polarization and properties of proinflammatory macrophages. CLH536, a novel GPR84 antagonist discovered by us, suppresses colitis by reducing the polarization and function of pro-inflammatory macrophages. These results define a unique role of GPR84 in innate immune cells and intestinal inflammation, and suggest that GPR84 may serve as a potential drug target for the treatment of UC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract COVID-19 is a multiorgan systemic inflammatory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Patients with COVID-19 often exhibit cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury, but imaging evidence is lacking. In the study we detected and evaluated the severity of myocardial dysfunction in COVID-19 patient population using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2-D STE). A total of 218 consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who had no underlying cardiovascular diseases were enrolled and underwent transthoracic echocardiography. This study cohort included 52 (23.8%) critically ill and 166 noncritically ill patients. Global longitudinal strains (GLSs) and layer-specific longitudinal strains (LSLSs) were obtained using 2-D STE. Changes in GLS were correlated with the clinical parameters. We showed that GLS was reduced (&lt;−21.0%) in about 83% of the patients. GLS reduction was more common in critically sick patients (98% vs. 78.3%, P &lt; 0.001), and the mean GLS was significantly lower in the critically sick patients than those noncritical (−13.7% ± 3.4% vs. −17.4% ± 3.2%, P &lt; 0.001). The alteration of GLS was more prominent in the subepicardium than in the subendocardium ( P &lt; 0.001). GLS was correlated to mean serum pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2 , RR = 0.42, P &lt; 0.0001), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, R = −0.20, P = 0.006) and inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 ( R = −0.21, P = 0.003). In conclusions, our results demonstrate that myocardial dysfunction is common in COVID-19 patients, particularly those who are critically sick. Changes in indices of myocardial strain were associated with indices of inflammatory markers and hypoxia, suggesting partly secondary nature of myocardial dysfunction.",

Due its high morbility and mortality, it is necessary to summarize the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients to provide more theoretical basis for future treatment. In the current study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and explored the risk factors for the severity of illness. A total of 101 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Leishenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) was classified into three sub-types: moderate (n = 47), severe (n = 36), and critical (n = 18); their clinical data were collected from the Electronic Medical Record. We showed that among the 101 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 62 years (IQR 51-74); 50 (49.5%) patients were accompanied by hypertension, while 25 (24.8%) and 22 (21.8%) patients suffered from diabetes and heart diseases, respectively, with complications. All patients were from Wuhan who had a definite history of exposure to the epidemic area. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, diabetes, chronic liver disease, percentage of neutrophils (N%) > 75%, CRP > 4 mg/L, D-dimer > 0.55 mg/L, IL-2R > 710 U/mL, IL-8 > 62 pg/mL, and IL-10 > 9.1 pg/mL were independent variables associated with severe COVID-19. In conclusion, we have identified the independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, including older age, diabetes, chronic liver disease, higher levels of N%, CRP, D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-8, and IL-10, providing evidence for more accurate risk prediction.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress-related cartilage degeneration, synovitis, and joint pain play vital roles in the progress of osteoarthritis (OA). Anti-oxidative stress agents not only prevent structural damage progression but also relieve OA-related pain. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of methylene blue (MB), a classical and important anti-oxidant with strong neural affinity. Experimental OA was established in rats by radial transection of medial collateral ligament and medial meniscus (MCLT + MMT) of the right knee joint. The OA rats received intra-articular injection of MB (1 mg/kg) every week starting one week after surgery. We showed that MB administration exerted significant cartilage protection, synovitis inhibition as well as pain relief in OA rats. In human chondrocytes and fibroblast-like synoviocytes, MB significantly attenuated tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress. We demonstrated that these effects of MB resulted from dual targets of important antioxidant enzymes, Nrf2 and PRDX1, which also mutually reinforcing and participated in an interaction. Furthermore, we found that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neural inflammatory mediator, was accumulated around the vessel in synovium and subchondral bone in OA rats and in TBHP-treated primary cortical neurons; MB administration significantly inhibited CGRP expression through upregulation of Nrf2 and PRDX1. Taken together, these results suggest that MB ameliorates oxidative stress via Nrf2/PRDX1 regulation to prevent progression and relieve pain of OA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Inflammation is one of the pathogenic processes in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Dopamine receptor agonist pramipexole (PPX) is extensively used for PD treatment in clinics. A number of studies show that PPX exerts neuroprotection on dopaminergic (DA) neurons, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of PPX on DA neurons are not fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated whether PPX modulated PD-related neuroinflammation and underlying mechanisms. PD model was established in mice by bilateral striatum injection of lipopolyssaccharide (LPS). The mice were administered PPX (0.5 mg·kg −1 ·d −1 , i.p.) 3 days before LPS injection, and for 3 or 21 days after surgery, respectively, for biochemical and histological analyses. We showed that PPX administration significantly alleviated the loss of DA neurons, and suppressed the astrocyte activation and levels of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β in the substantia nigra of LPS-injected mice. Furthermore, PPX administration significantly decreased the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated proteins, i.e., cleaved forms of caspase-1, IL-1β, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruit domain (ASC) in the striatum. These results were validated in LPS+ATP-stimulated primary mouse astrocytes in vitro. Remarkably, we showed that PPX (100–400 μM) dose-dependently enhanced the autophagy activity in the astrocytes evidenced by the elevations in LC3-II and BECN1 protein expression, as well as the increase of GFP-LC3 puncta formation. The opposite effects of PPX on astrocytic NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy were eliminated by Drd3 depletion . Moreover, we demonstrated that both pretreatment of astrocytes with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (40 μM) in vitro and astrocyte-specific Atg5 knockdown in vivo blocked PPX-caused inhibition on NLRP3 inflammasome and protection against DA neuron damage. Altogether, this study demonstrates an anti-neuroinflammatory activity of PPX via a Drd3-dependent enhancement of autophagy activity in astrocytes, and reveals a new mechanism for the beneficial effect of PPX in PD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as a dilated aorta in diameter at least 1.5 times of a normal aorta. Our previous studies found that activating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) had a protective effect on vascular injury. This work was to investigate whether activating α7nAChR could influence AAA formation and explore its mechanisms. AAA models were established by angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion in ApoE − /− mice or in wild type and α7nAChR −/− mice. In vitro mouse aortic smooth muscle (MOVAS) cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). PNU-282987 was chosen to activate α7nAChR. We found that cell pyroptosis effector GSDMD and NLRP3 inflammasome were activated in abdominal aorta, and inflammatory cytokines in serum were elevated in AAA models of ApoE −/− mice. Activating α7nAChR reduced maximal aortic diameters, preserved elastin integrity and decreased inflammatory responses in ApoE −/− mice with Ang II infusion. While α7nAChR −/− mice led to aggravated aortic injury and increased inflammatory cytokines with Ang II infusion when compared with wild type. Moreover, activating α7nAChR inhibited NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway in AAA model of ApoE −/− mice, while α7nAChR deficiency promoted this pathway. In vitro, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NLRP3 knockdown reduced GSDMD expression, in MOVAS cells treated with TNF-α. Furthermore, activating α7nAChR inhibited oxidative stress, reduced NLRP3/GSDMD expression, and decreased cell pyroptosis in MOVAS cells with TNF-α. In conclusion, our study found that activating α7nAChR retarded AAA through inhibiting pyroptosis mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome. These suggested that α7nAChR would be a potential pharmacological target for AAA.",

    "abstract": "Natural products (NPs) and their structural analogs represent a major source of novel drug development for disease prevention and treatment. The development of new drugs from NPs includes two crucial aspects. One is the discovery of NPs from medicinal plants/microorganisms, and the other is the evaluation of the NPs in vivo at various physiological and pathological states. The heterogeneous spatial distribution of NPs in medicinal plants/microorganisms or in vivo can provide valuable information for drug development. However, few molecular imaging technologies can detect thousands of compounds simultaneously on a label-free basis. Over the last two decades, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) methods have progressively improved and diversified, thereby allowing for the development of various applications of NPs in plants/microorganisms and in vivo NP research. Because MSI allows for the spatial mapping of the production and distribution of numerous molecules in situ without labeling, it provides a visualization tool for NP research. Therefore, we have focused this mini-review on summarizing the applications of MSI technology in discovering NPs from medicinal plants and evaluating NPs in preclinical studies from the perspective of new drug research and development (R&D). Additionally, we briefly reviewed the factors that should be carefully considered to obtain the desired MSI results. Finally, the future development of MSI in new drug R&D is proposed.",

    "abstract": "Aging is one of the main risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. During aging process, the decrease of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the impairment of astrocyte function contribute to the cognitive impairment. Metrnl, a neurotrophic factor, promotes neural growth, migration and survival, and supports neural function. In this study, we investigated the role of Metrnl in cognitive functions. D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging model was used to simulate the process of aging. Cognitive impairment was assessed by the Morris water maze test. We showed that Metrnl expression levels were significantly increased in the hippocampus of D-gal-induced aging mice. Metrnl knockout did not affect the cognitive functions in the baseline state, but aggravated the cognitive impairment in the D-gal-induced aging mice. Furthermore, Metrnl knockout significantly reduced hippocampal BDNF, TrkB, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels in the D-gal-induced aging mice. In the D-gal-induced aging cell model in vitro, Metrnl levels in the hippocampal astrocytes were significantly increased, and Metrnl knockdown and overexpression regulated the BDNF levels in primary hippocampal astrocytes rather than in neurons. We conclude that Metrnl regulates cognitive functions and hippocampal BDNF levels during aging process. As a neurotrophic factor and an endogenous protein, Metrnl is expected to become a new candidate for the treatment or alleviation of aging-related cognitive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Hernandezine (Her) is a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid extracted from the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Thalictrum glandulosissimum. Evidence shows that Her is a natural agonist of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and induces apoptosis and autophagy in tumor cells. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy in Her-induced cell death in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. We showed that Her dose-dependently suppressed cell proliferation, promoted autophagy and induced autophagic death in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines Capan-1 and SW1990. The IC50 values of Her in inhibition of Capan-1 and SW1990 cells were 47.7 μM and 40.1 μM, respectively. Immunoblotting showed that Her (1-40 μM) promoted the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, and Her exerted concentration-dependent and time-dependent effects on autophagy activation in PDAC cells. In transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence image analysis, we found that autophagic vacuoles were significantly increased in Her-treated cells. Knockdown of ATG5, a key gene in the autophagy pathway, alleviated the activation of autophagy by Her. These results demonstrated that Her induced autophagy in PDAC cells. Intensely activated autophagy could promote cell death. The autophagy inhibitors, BafA1 and HCQ significantly inhibited Her-induced cell death, implying that Her induced autophagic cell death in PDAC cells. Moreover, we showed that Her activated autophagy by increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK and decreasing the phosphorylation of mTOR/p70S6K. Knockdown of AMPKα relieves the autophagic cell death induced by Her. Furthermore, Her concentration-dependently enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in PDAC cells. Antioxidants could reduce the phosphorylation of AMPK and suppress autophagic cell death induced by Her. Our study provides evidence for the development of Her as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), an endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducible secreting protein, has evolutionarily conserved immune-regulatory function that contributes to the negative regulation of inflammation in macrophages. In this study, we investigated the profiles of MANF in the macrophages of the patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the mice with experimental colitis, which was induced in both myeloid cell-specific MANF knockout mice and wild-type mice by 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days. We found that MANF expression was significantly increased in intestinal macrophages from both the mice with experimental colitis and patients with active IBD. DSS-induced colitis was exacerbated in myeloid cell-specific MANF knockout mice. Injection of recombinant human MANF (rhMANF, 10 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.v.) from D4 to D6 significantly ameliorated experimental colitis in DSS-treated mice. More importantly, MANF deficiency in myeloid cells resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of Ly6ChiCX3CRint proinflammatory macrophages in colon lamina propria of DSS-treated mice, and the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were upregulated as well. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that MANF attenuated Th17-mediated immunopathology by inhibiting BATF2-mediated innate immune response and downregulating CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and IL-12p40; MANF functioned as a negative regulator in inflammatory macrophages via inhibiting CHOP-BATF2 signaling pathway, thereby protecting against DSS-induced mouse colitis. These results suggest that MANF ameliorates colon injury by negatively regulating inflammatory macrophage transformation, which shed light on a potential therapeutic target for IBD.",

    "abstract": "Depression is one of the common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). In the clinic, botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) has been used to treat depression. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the anti-depressive effect of BoNT/A in a PD mouse model. Mice were administered reserpine (3 μg/mL in the drinking water) for 10 weeks. From the 10th week, BoNT/A (10 U·kg-1·d-1) was injected into the cheek for 3 consecutive days. We showed that chronic administration of reserpine produced the behavioral phenotypes of depression and neurochemical changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum. BoNT/A treatment significantly ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors, but did not improve TH activity in SNpc of reserpine-treated mice. We demonstrated that BoNT/A treatment reversed reserpine-induced complement and microglia activation in the hippocampal CA1 region. Furthermore, BoNT/A treatment significantly attenuated the microglial engulfment of presynaptic synapses, thus ameliorating the apparent synapse and spine loss in the hippocampus in the reserpine-treated mice. Moreover, BoNT/A treatment suppressed microglia-mediated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β in reserpine-treated mice. In addition, we showed that BoNT/A (0.1 U/mL) ameliorated reserpine-induced complement and microglia activation in mouse BV2 microglial cells in vitro. We conclude that BoNT/A ameliorates depressive-like behavior in a reserpine-induced PD mouse model through reversing the synapse loss mediated by classical complement induced-microglial engulfment as well as alleviating microglia-mediated proinflammatory responses. BoNT/A ameliorates depressive-like behavior, and reverses synapse loss mediated by classical complement pathway-initiated microglia engulfment as well as alleviates microglia-mediated proinflammatory response in the reserpine-induced Parkinson's disease mouse model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Paclitaxel resistance is associated with a poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and currently, there is no promising drug for paclitaxel resistance. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemoresistance in human NSCLC-derived cell lines. We constructed paclitaxel-resistant NSCLC cell lines (A549/PR and H460/PR) by long-term exposure to paclitaxel. We found that triptolide, a diterpenoid epoxide isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, effectively enhanced the sensitivity of paclitaxel-resistant cells to paclitaxel by reducing ABCB1 expression in vivo and in vitro. Through high-throughput sequencing, we identified the SHH-initiated Hedgehog signaling pathway playing an important role in this process. We demonstrated that triptolide directly bound to HNF1A, one of the transcription factors of SHH, and inhibited HNF1A/SHH expression, ensuing in attenuation of Hedgehog signaling. In NSCLC tumor tissue microarrays and cancer network databases, we found a positive correlation between HNF1A and SHH expression. Our results illuminate a novel molecular mechanism through which triptolide targets and inhibits HNF1A, thereby impeding the activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and reducing the expression of ABCB1. This study suggests the potential clinical application of triptolide and provides promising prospects in targeting the HNF1A/SHH pathway as a therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with paclitaxel resistance.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a cluster of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in communication and behavior. Increasing evidence suggests that the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the likely related immune imbalance may play a role in the development of this disorder. Gastrointestinal deficits and gut microbiota dysfunction have been linked to the development or severity of autistic behavior. Therefore, treatments that focus on specific diets may improve gastrointestinal function and aberrant behavior in individuals with ASD. In this study, we investigated whether a diet containing specific prebiotic fibers, namely, 3% galacto-oligosaccharide/fructo-oligosaccharide (GOS/FOS; 9:1), can mitigate the adverse effects of in utero exposure to valproic acid (VPA) in mice. Pregnant BALB/cByJ dams were injected with VPA (600 mg/kg, sc.) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on gestational day 11 (G11). Male offspring were divided into four groups: (1) in utero PBS-exposed with a control diet, (2) in utero PBS-exposed with GOS/FOS diet, (3) in utero VPA-exposed with a control diet, and (4) in utero VPA-exposed with GOS/FOS diet. Dietary intervention started from birth and continued throughout the duration of the experiment. We showed that the prebiotic diet normalized VPA-induced alterations in male offspring, including restoration of key microbial taxa, intestinal permeability, peripheral immune homeostasis, reduction of neuroinflammation in the cerebellum, and impairments in social behavior and cognition in mice. Overall, our research provides valuable insights into the gut-brain axis involvement in ASD development. In addition, dietary interventions might correct the disbalance in gut microbiota and immune responses and, ultimately, might improve detrimental behavioral outcomes in ASD.",

    "abstract": "Immunosuppression by the tumor microenvironment is a pivotal factor contributing to tumor progression and immunotherapy resistance. Priming the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) has emerged as a promising strategy for improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. In this study we investigated the effects of noninvasive radiofrequency radiation (RFR) exposure on tumor progression and TIME phenotype, as well as the antitumor potential of PD-1 blockage in a model of pulmonary metastatic melanoma (PMM). Mouse model of PMM was established by tail vein injection of B16F10 cells. From day 3 after injection, the mice were exposed to RFR at an average specific absorption rate of 9.7 W/kg for 1 h per day for 14 days. After RFR exposure, lung tissues were harvested and RNAs were extracted for transcriptome sequencing; PMM-infiltrating immune cells were isolated for single-cell RNA-seq analysis. We showed that RFR exposure significantly impeded PMM progression accompanied by remodeled TIME of PMM via altering the proportion and transcription profile of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. RFR exposure increased the activation and cytotoxicity signatures of tumor-infiltrating CD8",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neuroinflammation is crucial for the pathogenesis of major depression. Preclinical studies have shown the potential of anti-inflammatory agents, specifically costunolide (COS), correlate with antidepressant effects. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of COS. Chronic restraint stress (CRS) was induced in male mice. The mice were treated with either intra-DG injection of COS (5 μM, 1 μL per side) or COS (20 mg/kg, i.p.) for 1 week. We showed that administration of COS through the both routes significantly ameliorated the depressive-like behavior in CRS-exposed mice. Furthermore, administration of COS significantly improved chronic stress-induced adult hippocampal neurogenesis deficits in the mice through attenuating microglia-derived neuroinflammation. We demonstrated that COS (5 μM) exerted anti-neuroinflammatory effects in LPS-treated BV2 cells via inhibiting microglial Akt/mTOR/NF-κB pathway; inactivation of mTOR/NF-κB/IL-1β pathway was required for the pro-neurogenic action of COS in CRS-exposed mice. Our results reveal the antidepressant mechanism of COS that is normalizing neuroinflammation to improve neurogenesis deficits, supporting anti-inflammatory agents as a potential therapeutic strategy for depression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation is pivotal in antitumor immunity, enabling the recognition and destruction of tumor cells by CD8 + T cells. Both the proteasome and autophagy serve as essential cellular degradation mechanisms that regulate the stability and functionality of MHC-I molecules. In melanoma, modulating the pathways that affect MHC-I antigen presentation is pivotal and can profoundly influence the therapeutic outcomes of immunotherapy. Our initial effort of this study was a screening process to identify natural compounds capable of amplifying MHC-I surface expression on B16 melanoma cells. Utilizing flow cytometry with fluorescently tagged antibodies, we identified tetrandrine (Tet), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid derived from the root of Stephania tetrandra , as a potent enhancer of MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation in B16 melanoma cells. We demonstrate that tetrandrine (2.5, 5, 7.5 μM) dose-dependently upregulates both surface and total MHC-I protein levels in B16 or A375 melanoma cells by simultaneously inhibiting autophagy and proteasomal activity, two key pathways involved in MHC-I degradation. This dual inhibition stabilizes MHC-I molecules, leading to enhanced tumor antigen presentation and improved recognition by CD8 + T cells. In co-culture systems, tetrandrine treatment increased CD8 + T cell activation and cytotoxicity against melanoma cells, evidenced by elevated IFN-γ secretion and increased tumor cell apoptosis. Administration of tetrandrine (50 mg·kg -1 ·d -1 , i.g., for 15 days) significantly suppressed melanoma growth in mouse models accompanied by increased CD8 + T cell infiltration and activation within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, tetrandrine synergized with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy, leading to enhanced tumor growth inhibition compared to either treatment alone. We revealed that tetrandrine (7.5 μM) blocked the lysosomal calcium efflux channel TPC2, disrupting lysosomal calcium homeostasis, thus impairing lysosomal acidification and proteasomal activity, thereby stabilizing MHC-I molecules and promoting antigen presentation. These results highlight tetrandrine’s unique mechanism of action in enhancing MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation through dual inhibition of autophagic flux and proteasomal degradation. This study underscores tetrandrine’s potential as a novel immunomodulatory agent to boost CD8 + T cell-mediated tumor cell eradication and enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ischemic stroke is a frequent cause of mortality and disability, and astrocyte reactivity is closely associated with injury outcomes. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), an endogenous regulator, has been shown to perform pleiotropic functions in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, studies on neurological diseases have paid little attention to the effects and detailed mechanisms of FGF21 in astrocytes. Here, we found elevated serum levels of FGF21 in stroke patients and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mice. In the peri-infarct cortex, microglia and astrocytes serve as sources of FGF21 in addition to neurons. MRI and neurobehavioral assessments of wild-type (WT) and FGF21 −/− tMCAO model mice revealed a deteriorated consequence of the loss of FGF21, with exacerbated brain infarction and neurological deficits. Additionally, combined with the pharmacological treatment of WT mice with recombinant human FGF21 (rhFGF21) after tMCAO, FGF21 was identified to suppress astrocytic activation and astrocyte-mediated inflammatory responses after brain ischemia and participated in controlling the infiltration of peripheral inflammatory cells (including macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells) by modulating chemokines expression (such as Ccl3, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2) in astrocytes. Furthermore, rhFGF21 was shown to boost the production of neurotrophic factors (BDNF and NGF) in astrocytes, and by which rescued neuronal survival and promoted synaptic protein expression (postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1), and synaptophysin) in neurons after ischemic injury. Overall, our findings implicate that FGF21 acts as a suppressor of astrocyte activation, and exerts anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic effects after ischemic brain injury through its action on astrocytes, offering an alternative therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Liver cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor survival rates. Current treatments, including liver transplantation, immunotherapy, and gene therapy, are often limited by late-stage diagnosis and significant side effects, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic agents. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Kanglexin (KLX), a novel anthraquinone derivative, in the treatment of liver cancer. In vitro, KLX inhibited the proliferation and migration of HepG2 and Hep3B cells in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, KLX upregulated Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) expression, inducing PANoptosis by directly binding to ZBP1, altering its conformation, and reducing its affinity for the E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 180 (RNF180). This interaction decreased ZBP1 ubiquitination, thereby increasing its stability. Additionally, KLX upregulated the expression of the transcription factor homeobox D10 (HOXD10), which further increased ZBP1 expression. Elevated ZBP1 levels significantly suppressed liver cancer cell proliferation and migration, whereas the inhibitory effects of KLX were reversed upon ZBP1 knockdown. In a xenograft model, KLX significantly inhibited tumor growth with a lower toxicity than oxaliplatin (OXA). In conclusion, KLX promoted PANoptosis in liver cancer cells by upregulating ZBP1 and preventing its degradation, thereby inhibiting liver cancer progression and migration. These findings suggest that KLX is a promising therapeutic agent for liver cancer.",

    "abstract": "The cell biological phenomenon of autophagy has attracted increasing attention in recent years, partly as a consequence of the discovery of key components of its cellular machinery. Autophagy plays a crucial role in a myriad of cellular functions. Autophagy has its own regulatory mechanisms, but this process is not isolated. Autophagy is coordinated with other cellular activities to maintain cell homeostasis. Autophagy is critical for a range of human physiological processes. The multifunctional roles of autophagy are explained by its ability to interact with several key components of various cell pathways. In this review, we focus on the coordination between autophagy and other physiological processes, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), energy homeostasis, aging, programmed cell death, the immune responses, microbial invasion and inflammation. The insights gained from investigating autophagic networks should increase our understanding of their roles in human diseases and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and the 5-HT3 receptors (5-HT3Rs) are cation-selective members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), which are oligomeric protein assemblies that convert a chemical signal into an ion flux through postsynaptic membrane. They are critical components for synaptic transmission in the nervous system, and their dysfunction contributes to many neurological disorders. The diverse subunit compositions of pLGICs give rise to complex mechanisms of ligand recognition, channel gating, and ion-selective permeability, which have been demonstrated in numerous electrophysiological and molecular biological studies, and unraveled by progress in studying the structural biology of this protein family. In this review, we discuss recent insights into the structural and functional basis of two cation-selective pLGICs, the nAChR and the 5-HT3R, including their subunit compositions, ligand binding, and channel gating mechanisms. We also discuss their relevant pharmacology and drug discovery for treating various neurological disorders. Finally, we review a model of two alternative ion conducting pathways based on the latest 5-HT3A crystal structure.",

    "abstract": "Lung metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with no effective therapy at present. It has been proposed that dual-targeted therapy, ie, targeting chemotherapeutic agents to both tumor vasculature and cancer cells, may offer some advantages. The present work was aimed to develop a dual-targeted synergistic drug combination nanomedicine for the treatment of lung metastases of TNBC. Thus, Arg-Gly-Asp peptide (RGD)-conjugated, doxorubicin (DOX) and mitomycin C (MMC) co-loaded polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (RGD-DMPLN) were prepared and characterized. The synergism between DOX and MMC and the effect of RGD-DMPLN on cell morphology and cell viability were evaluated in human MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. The optimal RGD density on nanoparticles (NPs) was identified based on the biodistribution and tumor accumulation of the NPs in a murine lung metastatic model of MDA-MB-231 cells. The microscopic distribution of RGD-conjugated NPs in lung metastases was examined using confocal microscopy. The anticancer efficacy of RGD-DMPLN was investigated in the lung metastatic model. A synergistic ratio of DOX and MMC was found in the MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cells. RGD-DMPLN induced morphological changes and enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro. NPs with a median RGD density showed the highest accumulation in lung metastases by targeting both tumor vasculature and cancer cells. Compared to free drugs, RGD-DMPLN exhibited significantly low toxicity to the host, liver and heart. Compared to non-targeted DMPLN or free drugs, administration of RGD-DMPLN (10 mg/kg, iv) resulted in a 4.7-fold and 31-fold reduction in the burden of lung metastases measured by bioluminescence imaging, a 2.4-fold and 4.0-fold reduction in the lung metastasis area index, and a 35% and 57% longer median survival time, respectively. Dual-targeted RGD-DMPLN, with optimal RGD density, significantly inhibited the progression of lung metastasis and extended host survival.",

    "abstract": "Since 1997, several epizootic avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been transmitted to humans, causing diseases and even deaths. The recent emergence of severe human infections with AIV (H7N9) in China has raised concerns about efficient interpersonal viral transmission, polygenic traits in viral pathogenicity and the management of newly emerging strains. The symptoms associated with viral infection are different in various AI strains: H5N1 and newly emerged H7N9 induce severe pneumonia and related complications in patients, while some H7 and H9 subtypes cause only conjunctivitis or mild respiratory symptoms. The virulence and tissue tropism of viruses as well as the host responses contribute to the pathogenesis of human AIV infection. Several preventive and therapeutic approaches have been proposed to combat AIV infection, including antiviral drugs such as M2 inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, attachment inhibitors and signal-transduction inhibitors etc. In this article, we summarize the recent progress in researches on the epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenicity determinants, and available or potential antivirals of AIV.",

    "abstract": "With the general decline of pharmaceutical research productivity, there are concerns that many components of the drug discovery process need to be redesigned and optimized. For example, the human immortalized cell lines or animal primary cells commonly used in traditional drug screening may not faithfully recapitulate the pathological mechanisms of human diseases, leading to biases in assays, targets, or compounds that do not effectively address disease mechanisms. Recent advances in stem cell research, especially in the development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, provide a new paradigm for drug screening by permitting the use of human cells with the same genetic makeup as the patients without the typical quantity constraints associated with patient primary cells. In this article, we will review the progress made to date on cellular disease models using human stem cells, with a focus on patient-specific iPSCs for neurological diseases. We will discuss the key challenges and the factors that associated with the success of using stem cell models for drug discovery through examples from monogenic diseases, diseases with various known genetic components, and complex diseases caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and other factors.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether the transfer of the IL-37b gene, a newly identified inhibitor of both innate and adaptive immunity, could improve the therapeutic efficacy of mesenchumal stromal cells (MSCs) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The expression of IL-37 in biopsied specimens of the patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) was detected using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Mice were treated with 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 8 days to induce colitis. Before DSS treatment, the mice were injected with MSCs, MSC-eGFP or MSC-IL37b. Their body weight was measured each day, and the colons and spleens were harvested on d 10 for pathological and biochemical analyses. In biopsied specimens of the patients with active UC, the expression of IL-37 was dramatically elevated in inflamed mucosa, mainly in epithelial cells and infiltrating immune cells. Compared to MSC-eGFP or MSCs, MSC-IL37b administration significantly attenuated the body weight and colon length reduction, and decreased the histological score in DSS-induced colitis mice. Furthermore, MSC-IL37b administration increased the percentage of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) among total splenic mononuclear cells as well as the percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) among splenic CD4+ T cells in the mice. Moreover, MSC-IL37b administration increased the IL-2+ cells and decreased the IFN-γ+ cells among splenic CD4+ T cells. IL-37 is involved in the pathophysiology of UC. IL-37b gene transfer enhances the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in DSS-induced colitis mice by inducing Tregs and MDSCs and regulating cytokine production.",

    "abstract": "Neurotrophins are involved in many physiological and pathological processes in the nervous system. They regulate and modify signal transduction, transcription and translation in neurons. It is recently demonstrated that the neurotrophin expression is regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), changing our views on neurotrophins and miRNAs. Generally, miRNAs regulate neurotrophins and their receptors in at least two ways: (1) miRNAs bind directly to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of isoform-specific mRNAs and post-transcriptionally regulate their expression; (2) miRNAs bind to the 3′ UTR of the regulatory factors of neurotrophins and regulate their expression. On the other hand, neurotrophins can regulate miRNAs. The results of BNDF research show that neurotrophins regulate miRNAs in at least three ways: (1) ERK stimulation enhances the activation of TRBP (HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein) and Dicer, leading to the upregulation of miRNA biogenesis; (2) ERK-dependent upregulation of Lin28a (RNA-binding proteins) blocks select miRNA biogenesis; (3) transcriptional regulation of miRNA expression through activation of transcription factors, including CREB and NF-κB. These regulatory processes integrate positive and negative regulatory loops in neurotrophin and miRNA signaling pathways, and also expand the function of neurotrophins and miRNAs. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the regulatory networks between neurotrophins and miRNAs in brain diseases and cancers, for which novel cutting edge therapeutic, delivery and diagnostic approaches are emerging.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade has shown significant clinical benefit in multiple cancer indications, but many patients are either refractory or become resistant to the treatment over time. HER2/neu oncogene overexpressed in invasive breast cancer patients associates with more aggressive diseases and poor prognosis. Anti-HER2 mAbs, such as trastuzumab, are currently the standard of care for HER2-overexpressing cancers, but the response rates are below 30% and patients generally suffer relapse within a year. In this study we developed a bispecific antibody (BsAb) simultaneously targeting both PD1 and HER2 in an attempt to combine HER2-targeted therapy with immune checkpoint blockade for treating HER2-positive solid tumors. The BsAb was constructed by fusing scFvs (anti-PD1) with the effector-functional Fc of an IgG (trastuzumab) via a flexible peptide linker. We showed that the BsAb bound to human HER2 and PD1 with high affinities (EC50 values were 0.2 and 0.14 nM, respectively), and exhibited potent antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the BsAb exhibited both HER2 and PD1 blockade activities and was effective in killing HER2-positive tumor cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In addition, the BsAb could crosslink HER2-positive tumor cells with T cells to form PD1 immunological synapses that directed tumor cell killing without the need of antigen presentation. Thus, the BsAb is a new promising approach for treating late-stage metastatic HER2-positive cancers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract FOXO3a (forkhead box transcription factor 3a) is involved in regulating multiple biological processes in cancer cells. BNIP3 (Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa-interacting protein 3) is a receptor accounting for priming damaged mitochondria for autophagic removal. In this study we investigated the role of FOXO3a in regulating the sensitivity of glioma cells to temozolomide (TMZ) and its relationship with BNIP3-mediated mitophagy. We showed that TMZ dosage-dependently inhibited the viability of human U87, U251, T98G, LN18 and rat C6 glioma cells with IC 50 values of 135.75, 128.26, 142.65, 155.73 and 111.60 μM, respectively. In U87 and U251 cells, TMZ (200 μM) induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and nuclear translocation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), which was accompanied by BNIP3-mediated mitophagy and FOXO3a accumulation in nucleus. TMZ treatment induced intracellular ROS accumulation in U87 and U251 cells via enhancing mitochondrial superoxide, which not only contributed to DNA DSBs and exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction, but also upregulated FOXO3a expression. Knockdown of FOXO3a aggravated TMZ-induced DNA DSBs and mitochondrial damage, as well as glioma cell death. TMZ treatment not only upregulated BNIP3 and activated autophagy, but also triggered mitophagy by prompting BNIP3 translocation to mitochondria and reinforcing BNIP3 interaction with LC3BII. Inhibition of mitophagy by knocking down BNIP3 with SiRNA or blocking autophagy with 3MA or bafilomycin A1 exacerbated mitochondrial superoxide and intracellular ROS accumulation. Moreover, FOXO3a knockdown inhibited TMZ-induced BNIP3 upregulation and autophagy activation. In addition, we showed that treatment with TMZ (100 mg·kg −1 ·d −1 , ip) for 12 days in C6 cell xenograft mice markedly inhibited tumor growth accompanied by inducing FOXO3a upregulation, oxidative stress and BNIP3-mediated mitophagy in tumor tissues. These results demonstrate that FOXO3a attenuates temozolomide-induced DNA double strand breaks in human glioma cells via promoting BNIP3-mediated mitophagy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by a high incidence of metastasis and poor survival. As epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is well recognized as a major factor initiating tumor metastasis, developing EMT inhibitor could be a feasible treatment for metastatic NSCLC. Recent studies show that triptolide isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F attenuated the migration and invasion of breast cancer, colon carcinoma, and ovarian cancer cells, and EMT played important roles in this process. In the present study we investigated the effect of triptolide on the migration and invasion of NSCLC cell lines. We showed that triptolide (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 nM) concentration-dependently inhibited the migration and invasion of NCI-H1299 cells. Triptolide treatment concentration-dependently suppressed EMT in NCI-H1299 cells, evidenced by significantly elevated E-cadherin expression and reduced expression of ZEB1, vimentin, and slug. Furthermore, triptolide treatment suppressed β-catenin expression in NCI-H1299 and NCI-H460 cells, overexpression of β-catenin antagonized triptolide-caused inhibition on EMT, whereas knockout of β-catenin enhanced the inhibitory effect of triptolide on EMT. Administration of triptolide (0.75, 1.5 mg/kg per day, ip, every 2 days) for 18 days in NCI-H1299 xenograft mice dose-dependently suppressed the tumor growth, restrained EMT, and decreased lung metastasis, as evidence by significantly decreased expression of mesenchymal markers, increased expression of epithelial markers as well as reduced number of pulmonary lung metastatic foci. These results demonstrate that triptolide suppresses NSCLC metastasis by targeting EMT via reducing β-catenin expression. Our study implies that triptolide may be developed as a potential agent for the therapy of NSCLC metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) with maladaptive tubular repair leads to renal fibrosis and progresses to chronic kidney disease (CKD). At present, there is no curative drug to interrupt AKI-to-CKD progression. The nuclear factor of the activated T cell (NFAT) family was initially identified as a transcription factor expressed in most immune cells and involved in the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes critical for the immune response. NFAT2 is also expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) and podocytes and plays an important regulatory role in the kidney. In this study, we investigated the renoprotective effect of 11R-VIVIT, a peptide inhibitor of NFAT, on renal fibrosis in the AKI-to-CKD transition and the underlying mechanisms. We first examined human renal biopsy tissues and found that the expression of NFAT2 was significantly increased in RTECs in patients with severe renal fibrosis. We then established a mouse model of AKI-to-CKD transition using bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (Bi-IRI). The mice were treated with 11R-VIVIT (5 mg/kg, i.p.) on Days 1, 3, 10, 17 and 24 after Bi-IRI. We showed that the expression of NFAT2 was markedly increased in RTECs in the AKI-to-CKD transition. 11R-VIVIT administration significantly inhibited the nuclear translocation of NFAT2 in RTECs, decreased the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and attenuated renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis but had no toxic side effects on the heart and liver. In addition, we showed that 11R-VIVIT administration alleviated RTEC apoptosis after Bi-IRI. Consistently, preapplication of 11R-VIVIT (100 nM) and transfection with NFAT2-targeted siRNA markedly suppressed TGFβ-induced HK-2 cell apoptosis in vitro. In conclusion, 11R-VIVIT administration inhibits IRI-induced NFAT2 activation and prevents AKI-to-CKD progression. Inhibiting NFAT2 may be a promising new therapeutic strategy for preventing renal fibrosis after IR-AKI.",

    "abstract": "Renal interstitial fibrosis is the common pathological process of various chronic kidney diseases to end-stage renal disease. Inhibition of fibroblast activation attenuates renal interstitial fibrosis. Our previous studies show that poricoic acid A (PAA) isolated from Poria cocos is a potent anti-fibrotic agent. In the present study we investigated the effects of PAA on renal fibroblast activation and interstitial fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms. Renal interstitial fibrosis was induced in rats or mice by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). UUO rats were administered PAA (10 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.g.) for 1 or 2 weeks. An in vitro model of renal fibrosis was established in normal renal kidney fibroblasts (NRK-49F cells) treated with TGF-β1. We showed that PAA treatment rescued Sirt3 expression, and significantly attenuated renal fibroblast activation and interstitial fibrosis in both the in vivo and in vitro models. In TGF-β1-treated NRK-49F cells, we demonstrated that Sirt3 deacetylated β-catenin (a key transcription factor of fibroblast activation) and then accelerated its ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thus suppressing the protein expression and promoter activity of pro-fibrotic downstream target genes (twist, snail1, MMP-7 and PAI-1) to alleviate fibroblast activation; the lysine-49 (K49) of β-catenin was responsible for Sirt3-mediated β-catenin deacetylation. In molecular docking analysis, we found the potential interaction of Sirt3 and PAA. In both in vivo and in vitro models, pharmacological activation of Sirt3 by PAA significantly suppressed renal fibroblast activation via facilitating β-catenin K49 deacetylation. In UUO mice and NRK-49F cells, Sirt3 overexpression enhanced the anti-fibrotic effect of PAA, whereas Sirt3 knockdown weakened the effect. Taken together, PAA attenuates renal fibroblast activation and interstitial fibrosis by upregulating Sirt3 and inducing β-catenin K49 deacetylation, highlighting Sirt3 functions as a promising therapeutic target of renal fibroblast activation and interstitial fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dynamics, including mitochondrial fission and fusion, are critical for maintaining mitochondrial functions. Evidence shows that TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) regulates mitochondrial fusion and fission and then mitophagy. Since a previous study demonstrates a strong correlation between mitophagy and osteoarthritis (OA), we herein investigated the potential role of TBK1 in OA process and mitochondrial functions. We demonstrated a strong correlation between TBK1 and OA, evidenced by significantly downregulated expression of TBK1 in cartilage tissue samples of OA patients and in the chondrocytes of aged mice, as well as TNF-α-stimulated phosphorylation of TBK1 in primary mouse chondrocytes. TBK1 overexpression significantly attenuated TNF-α-induced apoptosis and abnormal mitochondrial function in primary mouse chondrocytes. Furthermore, TBK1 overexpression induced remodeling of mitochondrial morphology by directly phosphorylating dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) at Ser637, abolishing the fission of DRP1 and preventing its fragmentation function. Moreover, TBK1 recruitment and DRP1 phosphorylation at Ser637 was necessary for engulfing damaged mitochondria by autophagosomal membranes during mitophagy. Moreover, we demonstrated that APMK/ULK1 signaling contributed to TBK1 activation. In OA mouse models established by surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus, intraarticular injection of lentivirus-TBK1 significantly ameliorated cartilage degradation via regulation of autophagy and alleviation of cell apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that the TBK1/DRP1 pathway is involved in OA and pharmacological targeting of the TBK1-DRP1 cascade provides prospective therapeutic benefits for the treatment of OA.",

    "abstract": "Parallel to major changes in fatty acid and glucose metabolism, defect in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism has also been recognized as a metabolic hallmark and potential therapeutic target for heart failure. However, BCAA catabolic enzymes are ubiquitously expressed in all cell types and a systemic BCAA catabolic defect is also manifested in metabolic disorder associated with obesity and diabetes. Therefore, it remains to be determined the cell-autonomous impact of BCAA catabolic defect in cardiomyocytes in intact hearts independent from its potential global effects. In this study, we developed two mouse models. One is cardiomyocyte and temporal-specific inactivation of the E1α subunit (BCKDHA-cKO) of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex, which blocks BCAA catabolism. Another model is cardiomyocyte specific inactivation of the BCKDH kinase (BCKDK-cKO), which promotes BCAA catabolism by constitutively activating BCKDH activity in adult cardiomyocytes. Functional and molecular characterizations showed E1α inactivation in cardiomyocytes was sufficient to induce loss of cardiac function, systolic chamber dilation and pathological transcriptome reprogramming. On the other hand, inactivation of BCKDK in intact heart does not have an impact on baseline cardiac function or cardiac dysfunction under pressure overload. Our results for the first time established the cardiomyocyte cell autonomous role of BCAA catabolism in cardiac physiology. These mouse lines will serve as valuable model systems to investigate the underlying mechanisms of BCAA catabolic defect induced heart failure and to provide potential insights for BCAA targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "The majority of blood malignancies is incurable and has unforeseeable remitting-relapsing paths in response to different treatments. Cynaropicrin, a natural sesquiterpene lactone from the edible parts of the artichoke plant, has gained increased attention as a chemotherapeutic agent. In this study, we investigated the effects of cynaropicrin against multiple myeloma (MM) cells in vitro and assessed its in vivo effectiveness in a xenograft tumor zebrafish model. We showed that cynaropicrin exerted potent cytotoxicity against a panel of nine MM cell lines and two leukemia cell lines with AMO1 being the most sensitive cell line (IC50 = 1.8 ± 0.3 µM). Cynaropicrin (0.8, 1.9, 3.6 µM) dose-dependently reduced c-Myc expression and transcriptional activity in AMO1 cells that was associated with significant downregulation of STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2. Cell cycle analysis showed that cynaropicrin treatment arrested AMO1 cells in the G2M phase along with an increase in the sub-G0G1 phase after 24 h. With prolonged treatment times, cells accumulated more in the sub-G0G1 phase, implying cell death. Using confocal microscopy, we revealed that cynaropicrin disrupted the microtubule network in U2OS cells stably expressing α-tubulin-GFP. Furthermore, we revealed that cynaropicrin promoted DNA damage in AMO1 cells leading to PAR polymer production by PARP1 hyperactivation, resulting in AIF translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus and subsequently to a novel form of cell death, parthanatos. Finally, we demonstrated that cynaropicrin (5, 10 µM) significantly reduced tumor growth in a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) xenograft zebrafish model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cynaropicrin causes potent inhibition of hematopoietic tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive fatal disease with no cure. Canagliflozin (CANA), a novel medication for diabetes, has been found to have remarkable cardiovascular benefits. However, few studies have addressed the effect and pharmacological mechanism of CANA in the treatment of PH. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the effect and pharmacological mechanism of CANA in treating PH. First, CANA suppressed increased pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, and vascular remodeling in both mouse and rat PH models. Network pharmacology, transcriptomics, and biological results suggested that CANA could ameliorate PH by suppressing excessive oxidative stress and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation partially through the activation of PPARγ. Further studies demonstrated that CANA inhibited phosphorylation of PPARγ at Ser225 (a novel serine phosphorylation site in PPARγ), thereby promoting the nuclear translocation of PPARγ and increasing its ability to resist oxidative stress and proliferation. Taken together, our study not only highlighted the potential pharmacological effect of CANA on PH but also revealed that CANA-induced inhibition of PPARγ Ser225 phosphorylation increases its capacity to counteract oxidative stress and inhibits proliferation. These findings may stimulate further research and encourage future clinical trials exploring the therapeutic potential of CANA in PH treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glutamine synthetase (GS) plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of the glutamate–glutamine cycle in the brain. Hypoactive GS causes depressive behaviors. Under chronic stress, GS has no change in expression, but its activity is decreased due to nitration of tyrosine (Tyr). Thus, we speculate that agents that prevent nitration or facilitate denitration of GS would be candidates for new antidepressants. Using human recombinant GS and mouse lysate from the medial prefrontal cortex, we demonstrated that Tyr (0.0313−0.5 µM) dose-dependently protected GS activity against peroxynitrite-induced Tyr-nitration of GS. Diet supplementation with Tyr exerted significant antidepressant effects in a chronic immobilization stress depression mouse model. We further found that dipeptides, such as tyrosyl-glutamine (YQ), that had appropriate chemical properties for medication also increased GS activity both in vitro and in vivo and exerted antidepressant effects. Because reduced GS activity also occurs in epilepsy and hyperammonemia, we evaluated whether Tyr and YQ had therapeutic effects. Interestingly, Tyr or YQ administration significantly attenuated kainic acid-induced seizures in mice and reduced blood ammonia levels in azoxymethane- or bile duct ligation-induced hyperammonemia mouse models, which was accompanied by an increment in GS activity. The activation of GS was accomplished by a decrement in Tyr-nitration, so-called Tyr-denitration. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the activation of GS could be a new strategy to treat depression and other GS-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 ( FLT3 ), a class 3 receptor tyrosine kinase, can be activated by mutations of internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) or point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD), leading to constitutive activation of downstream signaling cascades, including the JAK/STAT5, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK pathways, which promote the progression of leukemic cells. Despite the initial promise of FLT3 inhibitors, the discouraging outcomes in the treatment of FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) promote the pursuit of more potent and enduring therapeutic approaches. The histone acetyltransferase complex comprising the E1A binding protein P300 and its paralog CREB-binding protein (p300/CBP) is a promising therapeutic target, but the development of effective p300/CBP inhibitors faces challenges due to inherent resistance and low efficacy, often exacerbated by the absence of reliable clinical biomarkers for patient stratification. In this study we investigated the role of p300/CBP in FLT3-ITD AML and evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting p300/CBP alone or in combination with FLT3 inhibitors. We showed that high expression of p300 was significantly associated with poor prognosis in AML patients and positively correlated with FLT3 expression. We unveiled that the p300/CBP inhibitors A485 or CCS1477 dose-dependently downregulated FLT3 transcription via abrogation of histone acetylation in FLT3-ITD AML cells; in contrast, the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib reduced the level of H3K27Ac. Concurrent inhibition of p300/CBP and FLT3 enhanced the suppression of FLT3 signaling and H3K27 acetylation, concomitantly reducing the phosphorylation of STAT5, AKT, ERK and the expression of c-Myc, thereby leading to synergistic antileukemic effects both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that p300/CBP-associated transcripts were highly expressed in quizartinib-resistant AML cells with FLT3-TKD mutation. Targeting p300/CBP with A485 or CCS1477 retained the efficacy of quizartinib, suggesting marked synergy when combined with p300/CBP inhibitors in quizartinib-resistant AML models, as well as primary FLT3-ITD + AML samples. These results demonstrate a potential therapeutic strategy of combining p300/CBP and FLT3 inhibitors to treat FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD AML.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common and serious complication of diabetes, characterized by chronic fibro-inflammatory processes with an unclear pathogenesis. Renal fibrosis plays a significant role in the development and progression of DN. While recent research suggests that the neddylation pathway may influence fibrotic processes, its specific dysregulation in DN and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This study identified the neddylation of RhoA as a novel post-translational modification that regulates its expression and promotes renal fibrosis in DN. We here demonstrated that two key components of the neddylation pathway-NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 subunit 1 (NAE1) and NEDD8-are significantly upregulated in human chronic kidney disease (CKD) specimens compared to healthy kidneys, implicating neddylation in CKD-associated fibrosis. Our findings further revealed that both pharmacological inhibition of neddylation using MLN4924 and genetic knockdown of NAE1 mitigate renal fibrosis in mouse models of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and subsequent function assays demonstrated a direct interaction between RhoA and NEDD8. Importantly, neddylation inhibition reduced RhoA protein expression, highlighting a potential therapeutic target. Additionally, a positive correlation was noted between elevated NEDD8 mRNA levels and RhoA mRNA expression in human CKD specimens. RhoA overexpression counteracted the antifibrotic effects of neddylation inhibition, underscoring its critical role in fibrosis progression. Mechanistically, we unveiled that neddylation enhances RhoA protein stability by inhibiting its ubiquitination-mediated degradation, which subsequently activates the ERK1/2 pathway. Collectively, this study provides novel insights into NAE1-dependent RhoA neddylation as a key contributor to renal fibrosis in DN. The NAE1 protein mediates RhoA protein hyper-neddylation and subsequent stabilization of the RhoA protein, which, in turn, contributes to the development of renal fibrosis and inflammation through an ERK1/2-dependent mechanism. Consequently, targeting neddylation inhibition represents a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of renal fibrosis in DN.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant hematological disease caused by the proliferation of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and is still incurable. Relapse and drug resistance are common in MM. New therapeutic targets are urgently needed for MM treatment. Human antigen R (HuR) has been reported to play an important role in the malignant biological behavior of a variety of tumors, but its role in MM remains unclear. In this study, we found that HuR was highly expressed in MM patients and associated with a poor prognosis by analyzing public datasets. We found that targeting HuR with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or its inhibitor CMLD-2 had significant anti-MM effects both in vitro and in vivo. The overexpression of HuR promotes MM cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that bortezomib drug sensitivity increased and decreased with the knockdown and overexpression of HuR, respectively. This result provides a rationale for our subsequent combination of CMLD-2 with bortezomib in the treatment of MM. To further explore the mechanism of HuR in MM, we performed RNA sequencing and identified its downstream molecule, E2F7. HuR upregulated E2F7 expression by increasing the stability of its mRNA in MM cells. Higher levels of E2F7 were associated with a poorer prognosis. E2F7 knockdown had anti-MM effects in vitro and in vivo. E2F7 overexpression partially rescued the cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis caused by targeting HuR in MM cells. We subsequently demonstrated that CMLD-2 synergized with the anti-MM effect of bortezomib both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, targeting the HuR/E2F7 axis synergizes with bortezomib against MM. Therefore, the HuR/E2F7 axis may serve as a promising therapeutic target for MM.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) on the proliferation and invasion capacities of human hepatocellular carcinoma MHCC-97H cells in vitro. The expression levels of FoxM1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma samples, adjacent non-hepatocellular carcinoma liver samples and MHCC-97 cell lines were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. FoxM1 siRNA was transfected into MHCC-97H cells with Lipofectamine 2000. Cell growth was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Protein expression levels were evaluated by Western blotting. Anchorage-independent growth and the invasive potency of MHCC-97H cells were measured by soft agar colony formation and a transwell cell invasion assay, respectively. FoxM1 was over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma samples compared to adjacent non-hepatocellular carcinoma liver samples. FoxM1 siRNA was successfully transfected into MHCC-97H cells, resulting in the significant inhibition of FoxM1 mRNA and protein expression. Down-regulation of FoxM1 inhibited cell proliferation, caused cell cycle arrest, and decreased invasion of MHCC-97H cells. Compared with control and mock groups, the FoxM1 siRNA transfected cells showed decreased protein expressions of cyclin B1 and cyclin D1, whereas p27 protein expression was increased. Down-regulation of FoxM1 reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). FoxM1 is functionally involved in hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion and is a potential target for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether sequestosome 1/p62 (p62), a key cargo adaptor protein involved in both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome system, could directly regulate autophagy in vitro. HEK 293 cells or HeLa cells were transfected with p62-expressing plasmids or siRNA targeting p62. The cells or the cell lysates were subsequently subjected to immunofluorescence assay, immunoprecipitation assay, or immunoblot analysis. In vitro pulldown assay was used to study the interaction of p62 with Bcl-2. Overexpression of p62 significantly increased the basal level of autophagy in both HEK 293 cells and HeLa cells, whereas knockdown of p62 significantly decreased the basal level of autophagy. In vitro pulldown assay showed that p62 directly interacted with Bcl-2. It was observed in HeLa cells that p62 co-localized with Bcl-2. Furthermore, knockdown of p62 in HEK 293 cells significantly increased the amount of Beclin 1 that co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-2. p62 induces autophagy by disrupting the association between Bcl-2 and Beclin 1.",

    "abstract": "A major difficulty in the treatment of cancers is the poor response of many tumors to pharmacological regimens. This situation can be accounted for by the existence of a variety of complex mechanisms of chemoresistance (MOCs), leading to reduced intracellular concentrations of active agents, changes in the molecular targets of the drugs, enhanced repair of drug-induced modifications in macromolecules, stimulation of anti-apoptotic mechanisms, and inhibition of pro-apoptotic mechanisms. The present review focuses on alterations in the expression and appearance of the genetic variants that affect the genes involved in reducing the amount of active agents inside tumor cells. These alterations can occur through two mechanisms: either by lowering uptake or enhancing efflux (so-called MOC-1a and MOC-1b, respectively), or by decreasing the activation of prodrugs or enhancing inactivation of active agents through their biotransformation (MOC-2). The development of chemosensitizers that are useful in implementing the pharmacological manipulation of these processes constitutes a challenge to modern pharmacology. Nevertheless, the important physiological roles of the most relevant genes involved in MOC-1a, MOC-1b, and MOC-2 make it difficult to prevent the side effects of chemosensitizers. A more attainable goal in this area of pharmacological enquiry is the identification of proteomic profiles that will permit oncologists to accurately predict a lack of response to a given regimen, which would be useful for adapting treatment to the personal situation of each patient.",

    "abstract": "To develop a C. elegans model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to evaluate the role of autophagy in the disease.Stable transgenic worms expressing the G93A mutant form of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in GABAergic motor neurons were generated. Axon guidance and protein aggregation in the motor neurons were observed with fluorescence microscopy. A paralysis assay was performed to evaluate the motor function of the transgenic worms. The expression of autophagic genes in daf-2(e1370) mutants was analyzed using real-time PCR. The reporter GFP::LGG-1 was used to verify whether autophagy was induced in motor neurons.Expression of G93A SOD1 in motor neurons caused age-dependent motor defects accompanied by significant SOD1 aggregation and axon guidance failure. After 12 d, over 80% of the G93A worms became paralyzed, whereas less than 10% of the controls showed a paralytic phenotype. In the daf-2(e1370) mutants of C. elegans, the levels of autophagic genes bec-1, atg-7, lgg-1, and atg-18 were upregulated by approximately 1.5-fold, the level of unc-51 increased by approximately fourfold, and autophagosomes in motor neurons was markedly increased. Crossing the daf-2(e1370) mutation into the G93A SOD1 mutant worms significantly ameliorated the motor defects, SOD1 aggregation, and axon guidance failure.G93A SOD1 expression in motor neurons of C. elegans results in characteristic alterations of ALS. Increased autophagy protects C. elegans motor neurons against the toxicity of mutant SOD1.",

    "abstract": "Gelsemine, an alkaloid from the Chinese herb Gelsemium elegans (Gardn & Champ) Benth., is effective in mitigating chronic pain in rats. In the present study we investigated whether the alkaloid improved sleep disturbance, the most common comorbid symptoms of chronic pain, in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. Mice were subjected to partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL). After the mice were injected with gelsemine or pregabalin (the positive control) intraperitoneally, mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were assessed, and electroencephalogram (EEG)/electromyogram (EMG) recording was performed. Motor performance of the mice was assessed using rota-rod test. c-Fos expression in the brain was analyzed with immunohistochemical staining. In PSNL mice, gelsemine (2 and 4 mg/kg) increased the mechanical threshold for 4 h and prolonged the thermal latencies for 3 h. Furthermore, gelsemine (4 mg/kg, administered at 6:30 AM) increased non-rapid eye movement (non-REM, NREM) sleep, decreased wakefulness, but did not affect REM sleep during the first 3 h in PSNL mice. Sleep architecture analysis showed that gelsemine decreased the mean duration of wakefulness and increased the total number of episodes of NREM sleep during the first 3 h after the dosing. Gelsemine (4 mg/kg) did not impair motor coordination in PSNL mice. Immunohistochemical study showed that PSNL increased c-Fos expression in the neurons of the anterior cingulate cortex, and gelsemine (4 mg/kg) decreased c-Fos expression by 58%. Gelsemine (4 mg/kg, administered at either 6:30 AM or 8:30 PM) did not produce hypnotic effect in normal mice. Pregabalin produced similar antinociceptive and hypnotic effects, but impaired motor coordination in PSNL mice. Gelsemine is an effective agent for treatment of both neuropathic pain and sleep disturbance in PSNL mice; anterior cingulate cortex might play a role in the hypnotic effects of gelsemine.",

    "abstract": "Up to 10% of cancers occur through the inherited mutation of a group of genes called cancer predisposition genes. Individuals who carry a mutant allele of these genes have an increased susceptibility to cancer. A growing number of cancer susceptibility genes are being identified, and the physiopathology of germline mutation-based cancer development is also being elucidated with accumulating clinical and molecular data. More importantly, the identification of familial mutations has become routine practice, which is a perfect example of bench-to-bed translational medicine. Recently, other clinical applications of predisposition genes have been exploited, especially as efficient biomarkers predicting prognosis or response to treatment. Thus, it appears interesting to give an overview of the advances and impacts of predisposition genes in personalized cancer care by taking representative and common cancer syndromes as examples: Lynch syndrome for the first example, which is related to cancer susceptibility, and breast and ovary cancer syndrome for the second example, which involves BRCA deficiency-related targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most refractory cancers. The mechanisms by which hypoxia further aggravates therapeutic responses of advanced HCC to anticancer drugs remain to be clarified. Here, we report that hypoxia (1% O2) caused 2.55–489.7-fold resistance to 6 anticancer drugs (sorafenib, 5-fluorouracil [5-FU], gemcitabine, cisplatin, adriamycin and 6-thioguanine) in 3 HCC cell lines (BEL-7402, HepG2 and SMMC-7721). Among the 6 drugs, sorafenib, the sole one approved for HCC therapy, inhibited proliferation with little influence from hypoxia and displayed the smallest variation among the 3 HCC cell lines tested. By contrast, the inhibition of proliferation by 5-FU, which has been extensively tested in clinical trials but has not been approved for HCC therapy, was severely affected by hypoxia and showed a large variation among these cell lines. In 5-FU-treated HCC cells, hypoxia reduced the levels of basal thymidylate synthase (TS) and functional TS, leading to decreased dTMP synthesis and DNA replication. Hypoxia also affected the accumulation of FdUTP and its misincorporation into DNA. Consequently, both single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks in DNA were reduced, although hypoxia also inhibited DNA repair. In 5-FU-treated HCC cells, hypoxia further abated S-phase arrest, alleviated the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, diminished the activation of caspases, and finally resulted in reduced induction of apoptosis. Thus, hypoxia induces universal but differential drug resistance. The extensive impacts of hypoxia on the anticancer mechanisms of 5-FU contributes to its hypoxia-induced resistance in HCC cells. We propose that hypoxia-induced drug resistance and interference of hypoxia with anticancer mechanisms could be used as candidate biomarkers in selecting and/or developing anticancer drugs for improving HCC therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the dynamics of the immune response following late myocardial reperfusion is critical for the development of immunomodulatory therapy for myocardial infarction (MI). Cyclosporine A (CSA) possesses multiple therapeutic applications for MI, but its effects on the inflammation caused by acute MI are not clear. This study aimed to determine the dynamics of the immune response following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and the effects of CSA in a mouse model of prolonged myocardial ischemia designated to represent the human condition of late reperfusion. Adult C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 90 min of closed-chest myocardial I/R, which induced severe myocardial injury and excessive inflammation in the heart. Multicomponent analysis of the immune response caused by prolonged I/R revealed that the peak of cytokines/chemokines in the systemic circulation was synchronized with the maximal influx of neutrophils and T-cells in the heart 1 day after MI. The peak of cytokine/chemokine secretion in the infarcted heart coincided with the maximal macrophage and natural killer cell infiltration on day 3 after MI. The cellular composition of the mediastinal lymph nodes changed similarly to that of the infarcted hearts. CSA (10 mg/kg/day) given after prolonged I/R impaired heart function, enlarged the resulting scar, and reduced heart vascularization. It did not change the content of immune cells in hearts exposed to prolonged I/R, but the levels of MCP-1 and MIP-1α (hearts) and IL-12 (hearts and serum) were significantly reduced in the CSA-treated group in comparison to the untreated group, indicating alterations in immune cell function. Our findings provide new knowledge necessary for the development of immunomodulatory therapy targeting the immune response after prolonged myocardial ischemia/reperfusion.",

They are referred to as orphan receptors because the COUP-TF ligands have yet to be identified. Since the discovery of COUP-TFs in 1986, extensive studies have demonstrated their crucial functions in a variety of developmental processes, such as organogenesis, angiogenesis, and metabolic homeostasis. Recently, emerging evidence has highlighted that COUP-TFs, specifically COUP-TFII, play important roles in tumorigenesis. In this review, we will discuss the critical functions of COUP-TFII in the development of the tumor microenvironment, the progression of various cancers, and its underlying mechanisms.",

Although immunotherapy has shown significant achievements in the treatment of various cancers, it faces challenges that limit its further evolution such as poor permeation and modest responsiveness. The development of nanoparticle drug delivery system has provided an opportunity to overcome these drawbacks and to achieve optimized immunotherapy. Based on the research of our group, we here introduce the new strategies being employed using nanoscale intelligent drug delivery systems to enhance the effects of cancer immunotherapy. We also provide a perspective on the further possible application of nanoparticles in more effective antitumor immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) greatly contributes to vascular remodeling in hypertension. This study is to determine the roles and mechanisms of miR-135a-5p intervention in attenuating VSMC proliferation and vascular remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). MiR-135a-5p level was raised, while fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) mRNA and protein expressions were reduced in VSMCs of SHRs compared with those of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). Enhanced VSMC proliferation in SHRs was inhibited by miR-135a-5p knockdown or miR-135a-5p inhibitor, but exacerbated by miR-135a-5p mimic. VSMCs of SHRs showed reduced myofilaments, increased or even damaged mitochondria, increased and dilated endoplasmic reticulum, which were attenuated by miR-135a-5p inhibitor. Dual-luciferase reporter assay shows that FNDC5 was a target gene of miR-135a-5p. Knockdown or inhibition of miR-135a-5p prevented the FNDC5 downregulation in VSMCs of SHRs, while miR-135a-5p mimic inhibited FNDC5 expressions in VSMCs of both WKYs and SHRs. FNDC5 knockdown had no significant effects on VSMC proliferation of WKYs, but aggravated VSMC proliferation of SHRs. Exogenous FNDC5 or FNDC5 overexpression attenuated VSMC proliferation of SHRs, and prevented miR-135a-5p mimic-induced enhancement of VSMC proliferation of SHR. MiR-135a-5p knockdown in SHRs attenuated hypertension, normalized FNDC5 expressions and inhibited vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and alleviated vascular remodeling. These results indicate that miR-135a-5p promotes while FNDC5 inhibits VSMC proliferation in SHRs. Silencing of miR-135a-5p attenuates VSMC proliferation and vascular remodeling in SHRs via disinhibition of FNDC5 transcription. Either inhibition of miR-135a-5p or upregulation of FNDC5 may be a therapeutically strategy in attenuating vascular remodeling and hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of autophagy has been accepted as a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer, but its clinical application is hindered by lack of effective and specific autophagy inhibitors. We previously identified cepharanthine (CEP) as a novel autophagy inhibitor, which inhibited autophagy/mitophagy through blockage of autophagosome-lysosome fusion in human breast cancer cells. In this study we investigated whether and how inhibition of autophagy/mitophagy by cepharanthine affected the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agent epirubicin in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro and in vivo. In human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells, application of CEP (2 μM) greatly enhanced cepharanthine-induced inhibition on cell viability and colony formation. CEP interacted with epirubicin synergistically to induce apoptosis in TNBC cells via the mitochondrial pathway. We demonstrated that co-administration of CEP and epirubicin induced mitochondrial fission in MDA-MB-231 cells, and the production of mitochondrial superoxide was correlated with mitochondrial fission and apoptosis induced by the combination. Moreover, we revealed that co-administration of CEP and epirubicin markedly increased the generation of mitochondrial superoxide, resulting in oxidation of the actin-remodeling protein cofilin, which promoted formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys39 and Cys80 as well as Ser3 dephosphorylation, leading to mitochondria translocation of cofilin, thus causing mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Finally, in mice bearing MDA-MB-231 cell xenografts, co-administration of CEP (12 mg/kg, ip, once every other day for 36 days) greatly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of epirubicin (2 mg/kg) as compared with administration of either drug alone. Taken together, our results implicate that a combination of cepharanthine with chemotherapeutic agents could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), a functional protein of zinc finger family, was aberrant expressed in many kinds of liver disease including hepatic fibrosis and Hepatitis C virus. Bioinformatics results showed that ZEB1 was abnormally expressed in HCC tissues. However, to date, the potential regulatory role and molecular mechanisms of ZEB1 are still unclear in the occurrence and development of HCC. This study demonstrated that the expression level of ZEB1 was significantly elevated both in liver tissues of HCC patients and cell lines (HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells). Moreover, ZEB1 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. On the downstream regulation mechanism, ZEB1 could activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by upregulating the protein expression levels of β-catenin, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. Novel studies showed that miR-708 particularly targeted ZEB1 3′-UTR regions and inhibited the HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, results of nude mice experiments of HCC model indicated that miR-708 could inhibit tumor growth and xenograft metastasis model was established to validate that miR-708 could inhibit HCC cell metastasis through tail-vein injection in vivo. Together, the study suggested that ZEB1 modulated by miR-708 might be a potential therapeutic target for HCC therapy.",

    "abstract": "Disrupted redox homeostasis contributes to renal ischemia–reperfusion (IR) injury. Abundant natural products can activate nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), thereby providing therapeutic benefits. Methyl eugenol (ME), an analog of the phenolic compound eugenol, has the ability to induce Nrf2 activity. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of ME against renal oxidative damage in vivo and in vitro. An IR-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) model was established in mice. ME (20 mg·kg−1·d−1, i.p.) was administered to mice on 5 consecutive days before IR surgery. We showed that ME administration significantly attenuated renal destruction, improved the survival rate, reduced excessive oxidative stress and inhibited mitochondrial lesions in AKI mice. We further demonstrated that ME administration significantly enhanced Nrf2 activity and increased the expression of downstream antioxidative molecules. Similar results were observed in vitro in hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR)-exposed proximal tubule epithelial cells following pretreatment with ME (40 μmol·L−1). In both renal oxidative damage models, ME induced Nrf2 nuclear retention in tubular cells. Using specific inhibitors (CC and DIF-3) and molecular docking, we demonstrated that ME bound to the binding pocket of AMPK with high affinity and activated the AMPK/GSK3β axis, which in turn blocked the Nrf2 nuclear export signal. In addition, ME alleviated the development of renal fibrosis induced by nonfatal IR, which is frequently encountered in the clinic. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ME modulates the AMPK/GSK3β axis to regulate the cytoplasmic–nuclear translocation of Nrf2, resulting in Nrf2 nuclear retention and thereby enhancing antioxidant target gene transcription that protects the kidney from oxidative damage.",

    "abstract": "Despite pharmacological advances such as lenvatinib approval, therapeutic failure of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a big challenge due to the complexity of its underlying molecular mechanisms. Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a co-receptor involved in several cellular processes associated to chemoresistance development. Since both the double-edged process of autophagy and hypoxia-derived response play crucial roles in the loss of therapeutic effectiveness, herein we investigated the interplay among NRP1, autophagy and hypoxia in development of lenvatinib resistance in HCC cell lines. We first analyzed NRP1 expression levels in human HCC samples from public databases, found significantly increased NRP1 expression in human HCC samples as well as its correlation with advanced tumor and metastasis stages. Among 3 HCC cell lines (HepG2, Huh-7 and Hep3B), Hep3B and Huh-7 cells showed significantly increased NRP1 expression levels and cell migration ability together with higher susceptibility to lenvatinib. We demonstrated that NRP1 gene silencing significantly enhanced the anticancer effects of lenvatinib on Hep3B and Huh-7 cells. Furthermore, lenvatinib suppressed NRP1 expression through promoting autophagy in Hep3B and Huh-7 cells; co-treatment with bafilomycin A1 attenuated the antitumor effects of lenvatinib, and NRP1 silencing prevented this loss of in vitro effectiveness of lenvatinib even in the presence of bafilomycin A1. In addition, exposure to a hypoxic microenvironment significantly decreased NRP1 expression through autophagy in Hep3B and Huh-7 cells. Under hypoxia, HIF-1α directly modulated NRP1 expression; HIF-1α silencing not only enhanced the anticancer effects of combined lenvatinib and hypoxia, but also prevented the loss of effectiveness caused by bafilomycin A1, highlighting the potential role of HIF-1α-derived hypoxia response in the adaptive cellular response to lenvatinib and promoting resistance acquisition by autophagy modulation. Overall, NRP1 may constitute a potential therapeutic target to prevent lenvatinib failure derived from a hypoxia-associated modulation of autophagy in advanced HCC.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) arise from a breakdown in immunological self-tolerance, wherein the adaptive immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells, tissues and organs. AIDs impose excessive treatment costs and currently rely on non-specific and universal immunosuppression, which only offer symptomatic relief without addressing the underlying causes. AIDs are driven by autoantigens, targeting the autoantigens holds great promise in transforming the treatment of these diseases. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying different AIDs and the identification of specific autoantigens are critical. In this review, we categorize AIDs based on their underlying causes and compile information on autoantigens implicated in each disease, providing a roadmap for the development of novel immunotherapy regimens. We will focus on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is an autoimmune disease characterized by irreversible destruction of insulin-producing β cells in the Langerhans islets of the pancreas. We will discuss insulin as possible autoantigen of T1D and its role in T1D pathogenesis. Finally, we will review current treatments of TID and propose a potentially effective immunotherapy targeting autoantigens.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The root of Aconitum carmichaelii Debx . (Fuzi) is an herbal medicine used in China that exerts significant efficacy in rescuing patients from severe diseases. A key toxic compound in Fuzi, aconitine (AC), could trigger unpredictable cardiotoxicities with high-individualization, thus hinders safe application of Fuzi. In this study we investigated the individual differences of AC-induced cardiotoxicities, the biomarkers and underlying mechanisms. Diversity Outbred (DO) mice were used as a genetically heterogeneous model for mimicking individualization clinically. The mice were orally administered AC (0.3, 0.6, 0.9 mg· kg −1 ·d −1 ) for 7 d. We found that AC-triggered cardiotoxicities in DO mice shared similar characteristics to those observed in clinic patients. Most importantly, significant individual differences were found in DO mice (variation coefficients: 34.08%–53.17%). RNA-sequencing in AC-tolerant and AC-sensitive mice revealed that hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB), a toxic-responsive protein in blood with 89% homology to human, was specifically enriched in AC-sensitive mice. Moreover, we found that HBB overexpression could significantly exacerbate AC-induced cardiotoxicity while HBB knockdown markedly attenuated cell death of cardiomyocytes. We revealed that AC could trigger hemolysis, and specifically bind to HBB in cell-free hemoglobin (cf-Hb), which could excessively promote NO scavenge and decrease cardioprotective S-nitrosylation. Meanwhile, AC bound to HBB enhanced the binding of HBB to ABHD5 and AMPK, which correspondingly decreased HDAC-NT generation and led to cardiomyocytes death. This study not only demonstrates HBB achievement a novel target of AC in blood, but provides the first clue for HBB as a novel biomarker in determining the individual differences of Fuzi-triggered cardiotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Antiviral therapeutics have made a critical contribution in mitigating the symptoms and clinical outcomes of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), in which a single-stranded RNA viral pathogen, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes multi-organ injuries. Several antivirals were widely prescribed to treat COVID-19, either through the emergency use authorization (EUA) by the governmental regulatory agencies (i.e., remdesivir, paxlovid, molnupiravir, and the SARS-CoV-2-targeted monoclonal antibodies - tixagevimab and cilgavimab), as well as the repurposed use of the existing antiviral or antimalarial drugs (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and ivermectin). Despite their efficacy in ameliorating COVID-19 symptoms, some adverse side-effects of the antivirals were also reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our current review has aimed to gather and extrapolate the recently published information concerning cardiovascular adverse effects caused by each of the antivirals. We also provide further discussion on the potential cellular mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular adverse effects of the selected antiviral drugs, which should be carefully considered when evaluating risk factors in managing patients with COVID-19 or similar infectious diseases. It is foreseeable that future antiviral drug development assisted with the newest artificial intelligence platform may improve the accuracy to predict the structures of biomolecules of antivirals and therefore to mitigate their associated cardiovascular adversities.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most lethal of human malignancies. During human multistep hepatocarcinogenesis, genomic gain represents an important mechanism in the activation of proto-oncogenes. In many circumstances, activated oncogenes hold clinical implications both as prognostic markers and targets for cancer therapeutics. Gain of chromosome 1q copy is one of the most frequently detected alterations in HCC and 1q21 is the most frequent minimal amplifying region (MAR). A better understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of target genes within 1q21 amplicon will significantly improve our knowledge in HCC pathogenesis, and may lead to a much more effective management of HCC bearing amplification of 1q21. Such knowledge has long term implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for HCC treatment. Our research group and others, focused on the identification and characterization of 1q21 target genes such as JTB, CKS1B, and CHD1L in HCC progression. In this review, we will summarize the current scientific knowledge of known target genes within 1q21 amplicon and the precise oncogenic mechanisms of CHD1L will be discussed in detail.",

    "abstract": "The sequencing of the human genome has fueled the last decade of work to functionally characterize genome content. An important subset of genes encodes membrane proteins, which are the targets of many drugs. They reside in lipid bilayers, restricting their endogenous activity to a relatively specialized biochemical environment. Without a reference phenotype, the application of systematic screens to profile candidate membrane proteins is not immediately possible. Bioinformatics has begun to show its effectiveness in focusing the functional characterization of orphan proteins of a particular functional class, such as channels or receptors. Here we discuss integration of experimental and bioinformatics approaches for characterizing the orphan membrane proteome. By analyzing the human genome, a landscape reference for the human transmembrane genome is provided.",

    "abstract": "Hispidulin, a polyphenolic flavonoid extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant S involucrata, exhibits anti-tumor effects in a wide array of human cancer cells, mainly through growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest. However, its precise anticancer mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that contribute to hispidulin-induced apoptosis of human clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) lines Caki-2 and ACHN. Hispidulin (10, 20 μmol/L) decreased the viability of ccRCC cells in dose- and time-dependent manners without affecting that of normal tubular epithelial cells. Moreover, hispidulin treatment dose-dependently increased the levels of cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-9, but the inhibitors of caspase-8 and caspase-9 only partly abrogated hispidulin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that hispidulin triggered apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Moreover, hispidulin treatment significantly inhibited the activity of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and consequently promoted ceramide accumulation, thus leading to apoptosis of the cancer cells, whereas pretreatment with K6PC-5, an activator of SphK1, or overexpression of SphK1 significantly attenuated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of hispidulin. In addition, hispidulin treatment dose-dependently activated ROS/JNK signaling and led to cell apoptosis. We further demonstrated in Caki-2 xenograft nude mice that injection of hispidulin (20, 40 mg·kg−1·d−1, ip) dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth accompanied by decreased SphK1 activity and increased ceramide accumulation in tumor tissues. Our findings reveal a new explanation for the anti-tumor mechanisms of hispidulin, and suggest that SphK1 and ceramide may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of ccRCC.",

    "abstract": "Active tumor-targeting approaches using specific ligands have drawn considerable attention over the years. However, a single ligand often fails to simultaneously target the cancer cell surface and subcellular organelles, which limits the maximum therapeutic efficacy of delivered drugs. We describe a polymeric delivery system modified with the G3-C12 peptide for sequential dual targeting. In this study, galectin-3-targeted G3-C12 peptide was conjugated onto the N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer for the delivery of D(KLAKLAK)2 (KLA) peptide. G3-C12-HPMA-KLA exhibited increased receptor-mediated internalization into galectin-3-overexpressing PC-3 cells. Furthermore, G3-C12 peptide also directed HPMA-KLA conjugates to mitochondria. This occurred because the apoptosis signal triggered the accumulation of galectin-3 in mitochondria, and the G3-C12 peptide that specifically bound to galectin-3 was trafficked along with its receptor intracellularly. As a result, G3-C12-HPMA-KLA disrupted the mitochondrial membrane, increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced cytochrome c release, which ultimately resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity. An in vivo study revealed that the G3-C12 peptide significantly enhanced the tumor accumulation of the KLA conjugate. In addition, G3-C12-HPMA-KLA exhibited the best therapeutic efficacy and greatly improved the animal survival rate. Our work demonstrates that G3-C12 is a promising ligand with dual-targeting functionality.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery that nano-scaled particulates can easily be incorporated into tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, such nanostructures have been exploited as therapeutic small molecule delivery systems. However, the convoluted synthetic process of conventional nanostructures has impeded their feasibility and reproducibility in clinical applications. Herein, we report an easily prepared formulation of self-assembled nanostructures for systemic delivery of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). Phenylboronic acid (PBA) was grafted onto the polymeric backbone of poly(maleic anhydride). pPBA-DOX nanocomplexes were prepared by simple mixing, on the basis of the strong interaction between the 1,3-diol of DOX and the PBA moiety on pPBA. Three nanocomplexes (1, 2, 4) were designed on the basis of [PBA]:[DOX] molar ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1, respectively, to investigate the function of the residual PBA moiety as a targeting ligand. An acid-labile drug release profile was observed, owing to the intrinsic properties of the phenylboronic ester. Moreover, the tumor-targeting ability of the nanocomplexes was demonstrated, both in vitro by confocal microscopy and in vivo by fluorescence imaging, to be driven by an inherent property of the residual PBA. Ligand competition assays with free PBA pre-treatment demonstrated the targeting effect of the residual PBA from the nanocomplexes 2 and 4. Finally, the nanocomplexes 2 and 4, compared with the free DOX, exhibited significantly greater anti-cancer effects in vitro and even in vivo. Our pPBA-DOX nanocomplex enables a new paradigm for self-assembled nanostructures with potential biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Considering the complicated pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), multi-targets have become a focus in the discovery of drugs for treatment of this disease. In the current work, we established a multi-target strategy for discovering active reagents capable of suppressing both Aβ level and Tau hyperphosphorylation from natural products, and found that the ethanol extract of Thamnolia vermicularis (THA) was able to improve learning ability in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by inhibiting both Aβ levels and Tau hyperphosphorylation. SH-SY5Y and CHO-APP/BACE1 cells and primary astrocytes were used in cell-based assays. APP/PS1 transgenic mice [B6C3-Tg(APPswe, PS1dE9)] were administered THA (300 mg·kg−1·d−1, ig) for 100 d. After the administration was completed, the learning ability of the mice was detected using a Morris water maze (MWM) assay; immunofluorescence staining, Congo red staining and Thioflavine S staining were used to detect the senile plaques in the brains of the mice. ELISA was used to evaluate Aβ and sAPPβ contents, and Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to investigate the relevant signaling pathway regulation in response to THA treatment. In SH-SY5Y cells, THΑ (1, 10, 20 μg/mL) significantly stimulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR and AMPK/raptor/mTOR signaling-mediated autophagy in the promotion of Aβ clearance as both a PI3K inhibitor and an AMPK indirect activator, and restrained Aβ production as a suppressor against PERK/eIF2α-mediated BACE1 expression. Additionally, THA functioned as a GSK3β inhibitor with an IC50 of 1.32±0.85 μg/mL, repressing Tau hyperphosphorylation. Similar effects on Aβ accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation were observed in APP/PS1 transgenic mice treated with THA. Furthermore, administration of THA effectively improved the learning ability of APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and markedly reduced the number of senile plaques in their hippocampus and cortex. The results highlight the potential of the natural product THA for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and an ongoing severe pandemic. Curative drugs specific for COVID-19 are currently lacking. Chloroquine phosphate and its derivative hydroxychloroquine, which have been used in the treatment and prevention of malaria and autoimmune diseases for decades, were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection with high potency in vitro and have shown clinical and virologic benefits in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, chloroquine phosphate was first used in the treatment of COVID-19 in China. Later, under a limited emergency-use authorization from the FDA, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin was used to treat COVID-19 patients in the USA, although the mechanisms of the anti-COVID-19 effects remain unclear. Preliminary outcomes from clinical trials in several countries have generated controversial results. The desperation to control the pandemic overrode the concerns regarding the serious adverse effects of chloroquine derivatives and combination drugs, including lethal arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy. The risks of these treatments have become more complex as a result of findings that COVID-19 is actually a multisystem disease. While respiratory symptoms are the major clinical manifestations, cardiovascular abnormalities, including arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, and ischemic stroke, have been reported in a significant number of COVID-19 patients. Patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions (hypertension, arrhythmias, etc.) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and death. From pharmacological and cardiovascular perspectives, therefore, the treatment of COVID-19 with chloroquine and its derivatives should be systematically evaluated, and patients should be routinely monitored for cardiovascular conditions to prevent lethal adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lack of efficiency has been a major problem shared by all currently developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies. Our previous study shows that SARS-CoV-2 structural envelope (2-E) protein forms a type of cation channel, and heterogeneously expression of 2-E channels causes host cell death. In this study we developed a cell-based high throughput screening (HTS) assay and used it to discover inhibitors against 2-E channels. Among 4376 compounds tested, 34 hits with cell protection activity were found. Followed by an anti-viral analysis, 15 compounds which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication were identified. In electrophysiological experiments, three representatives showing inhibitory effect on 2-E channels were chosen for further characterization. Among them, proanthocyanidins directly bound to 2-E channel with binding affinity ( K D ) of 22.14 μM in surface plasmon resonance assay. Molecular modeling and docking analysis revealed that proanthocyanidins inserted into the pore of 2-E N-terminal vestibule acting as a channel blocker. Consistently, mutations of Glu 8 and Asn 15, two residues lining the proposed binding pocket, abolished the inhibitory effects of proanthocyanidins. The natural product proanthocyanidins are widely used as cosmetic, suggesting a potential of proanthocyanidins as disinfectant for external use. This study further demonstrates that 2-E channel is an effective antiviral drug target and provides a potential antiviral candidate against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Connexin 43 (Cx43) is the most important protein in the gap junction channel between cardiomyocytes. Abnormalities of Cx43 change the conduction velocity and direction of cardiomyocytes, leading to reentry and conduction block of the myocardium, thereby causing arrhythmia. It has been shown that IL-1β reduces the expression of Cx43 in astrocytes and cardiomyocytes in vitro. However, whether caspase-1 and IL-1β affect connexin 43 after myocardial infarction (MI) is uncertain. In this study we investigated the effects of VX765, a caspase-1 inhibitor, on the expression of Cx43 and cell-to-cell communication after MI. Rats were treated with VX765 (16 mg/kg, i.v.) 1 h before the left anterior descending artery (LAD) ligation, and then once daily for 7 days. The ischemic heart was collected for histochemical analysis and Western blot analysis. We showed that VX765 treatment significantly decreased the infarct area, and alleviated cardiac dysfunction and remodeling by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1/IL-1β expression in the heart after MI. In addition, VX765 treatment markedly raised Cx43 levels in the heart after MI. In vitro experiments were conducted in rat cardiac myocytes (RCMs) stimulated with the supernatant from LPS/ATP-treated rat cardiac fibroblasts (RCFs). Pretreatment of the RCFs with VX765 (25 μM) reversed the downregulation of Cx43 expression in RCMs and significantly improved intercellular communication detected using a scrape-loading/dye transfer assay. We revealed that VX765 suppressed the activation of p38 MAPK signaling in the heart tissue after MI as well as in RCMs stimulated with the supernatant from LPS/ATP-treated RCFs. Taken together, these data show that the caspase-1 inhibitor VX765 upregulates Cx43 expression and improves cell-to-cell communication in rat heart after MI via suppressing the IL-1β/p38 MAPK pathway.",

    "abstract": "Parthanatos is a type of programmed cell death initiated by over-activated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Nuclear translocation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) is a prominent feature of parthanatos. But it remains unclear how activated nuclear PARP1 induces mitochondrial AIF translocation into nuclei. Evidence has shown that deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT) induces parthanatos in glioma cells via induction of excessive ROS. In this study we explored the downstream signal of activated PARP1 to induce nuclear translocation of AIF in DPT-triggered glioma cell parthanatos. We showed that treatment with DPT (450 nM) induced PARP1 over-activation and Tax1 binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) distribution to mitochondria in human U87, U251 and U118 glioma cells. PARP1 activation promoted TAX1BP1 distribution to mitochondria by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Knockdown of TAX1BP1 with siRNA not only inhibited TAX1BP1 accumulation in mitochondria, but also alleviated nuclear translocation of AIF and glioma cell death. We demonstrated that TAX1BP1 enhanced the activity of respiratory chain complex I not only by upregulating the expression of ND1, ND2, NDUFS2 and NDUFS4, but also promoting their assemblies into complex I. The activated respiratory complex I generated more superoxide to cause mitochondrial depolarization and nuclear translocation of AIF, while the increased mitochondrial superoxide reversely reinforced PARP1 activation by inducing ROS-dependent DNA double strand breaks. In mice bearing human U87 tumor xenograft, administration of DPT (10 mg· kg-1 ·d-1, i.p., for 8 days) markedly inhibited the tumor growth accompanied by NAD+ depletion, TAX1BP1 distribution to mitochondria, AIF distribution to nuclei as well as DNA DSBs and PARP1 activation in tumor tissues. Taken together, these data suggest that TAX1BP1 acts as a downstream signal of activated PARP1 to trigger nuclear translocation of AIF by activation of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic switching plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Dehydrocorydaline (DHC), a major active component of the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Rhizoma Corydalis , exhibits diverse pharmacological effects. However, its impact on VSMCs remains largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of DHC in phenotypic switching of VSMCs. Our study revealed that DHC increased the mRNA and protein levels of rat VSMC contractile phenotype markers, such as calponin 1 (Cnn1), myosin heavy chain (Myh11, SM-MHC), smooth muscle 22α (Sm22α), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (Acta2, α-SMA) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, DHC inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. In Apoe −/− mice, DHC treatment resulted in reduced carotid plaque areas and macrophage infiltration, along with increased contractile phenotype marker expression. RNA sequencing analysis revealed a significant upregulation of spectrin alpha, erythrocytic 1 (Spta1) in DHC-treated rat VSMCs. Strikingly, Spta1 knockdown effectively negated the increase in contractile phenotype marker expression in VSMCs that was initially prompted by DHC. Therefore, DHC preserves the VSMC contractile phenotype through Spta1, thereby attenuating carotid artery atherosclerotic plaques in Apoe −/− mice. This study provides evidence supporting the potential use of Chinese herbal medicines, particularly those containing DHC such as Rhizoma Corydalis , in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, thus expanding the clinical application of such herbal remedies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) comprises a group of highly malignant tumors of the pancreas. Metabolic reprogramming in tumors plays a pivotal role in promoting cancer progression. However, little is known about the metabolic alterations in tumors that drive cancer drug resistance in patients with PDAC. Here, we identified acyl-CoA thioesterase 8 (ACOT8) as a key player in driving PDAC gemcitabine (GEM) resistance. The expression of ACOT8 is significantly upregulated in GEM-resistant PDAC tissues and is closely associated with poor survival in patients with PDAC. Gain- and loss-of-function studies have shown that ACOT8 drives PDAC GEM resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ACOT8 regulates cellular cholesterol ester (CE) levels, decreases the levels of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) that bind to polyunsaturated fatty acids and promote peroxisome activation. The knockdown of ACOT8 promotes ferroptosis and increases the chemosensitivity of tumors to GEM by inducing ferroptosis-associated pathway activation in PDAC cell lines. The combination of orlistat, an ACOT8 inhibitor, and GEM significantly inhibited tumor growth in PDAC organoid and mouse models. This study reveals the biological importance of ACOT8 and provides a potential combination therapy for treating patients with advanced GEM-resistant PDAC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is a prevalent hematologic malignancy characterized by abnormal proliferation of cloned plasma cells. Given the aggressive nature and drug resistance of MM cells, identification of novel genes could provide valuable insights for treatment. In this study we performed machine learning in the RNA microarray data of purified myeloma plasma cell samples from five independent MM cohorts with 957 MM patients, and identified O-GlcNAcylation transferase ( OGT ) and cell division cycle 27 ( CDC27 ) as the key prognostic genes for MM. We demonstrated a close link between OGT and CDC27 in MM cells by knockdown of OGT with siOGT, pharmacological inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation with OSMI-1 and pharmacological accumulation of O-GlcNAcylation with Thiamet G. Using mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation, we identified the O-GlcNAcylated CDC27 protein as a key target protein that may be directly downregulated by OSMI-1 in MM.1S cells. We further revealed that O-GlcNAcylation maintained CDC27 protein stability by blocking the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). Moreover, we demonstrated the enhanced antitumor efficacy of combined OSMI-1 and bortezomib (BTZ) treatment in MM cells both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, this study identifies a novel function of O-GlcNAcylation-related ALP in regulating CDC27 protein stability and a potential therapeutic strategy for treating MM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Demyelination is a common feature of numerous neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophies. Although myelin can be regenerated spontaneously following injury, this process is often inadequate, potentially resulting in neurodegeneration and exacerbating neurological dysfunction. Several drugs aimed at promoting the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have yielded unsatisfactory clinical effects. A recent study has shifted the strategy of pro-OPC differentiation towards enhancing myelinogenesis. In this study we identified the pro-myelinating drug using a zebrafish model. Five traditional Chinese medicine monomers including gastrodin, paeoniflorin, puerarin, salidroside and scutellarin were assessed by bath-application in Tg (MBP:eGFP-CAAX) transgenic line at 1–5 dpf. Among the 5 monomers, only gastrodin exhibited significant pro-myelination activity. We showed that gastrodin (10 µM) enhanced myelin sheath formation and oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation without affecting the number of OLs. Gastrodin markedly increased the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR in primary cultured OLs via direct interaction with PI3K. Co-treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (5 µM) mitigated gastrodin-induced OL maturation. Furthermore, injection of gastrodin (100 mg·kg −1 ·d −1 , i.p.) effectively facilitated remyelination in a lysophosphatidylcholine-induced demyelinating mouse model and alleviated demyelination in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice. These results identify gastrodin as a promising therapeutic agent for demyelinating diseases and highlight the potential of the zebrafish model for screening pro-myelinogenic pharmacotherapy.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 can encode circular RNAs (circRNAs); however, the potential effects of exogenous SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs on cardiovascular sequelae remain unknown. Three circRNAs derived from the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2, namely, circSARS-CV2-Ns, were identified for functional studies. In particular, circSARS-CV2-N1368 was shown to enhance platelet adhesiveness to endothelial cells (ECs) and inhibit EC-dependent vascular relaxation. Moreover, exogenous expression of circSARS-CV2-N1368 suppressed EC proliferation and migration and decreased angiogenesis and cardiac organoid beating. Mechanistically, we elucidated that circSARS-CV2-N1368 sponged the microRNA miR-103a-3p, which could reverse circSARS-CV2-N1368-induced EC damage. Additionally, activating transcription factor 7 (ATF7) was identified as a target gene of miR-103a-3p, and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was verified as a downstream gene of ATF7 that mediates circARS-CV2-N1368-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and ROS production in ECs. Importantly, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger NAC mitigated the circSARS-CV2-N1368-promoted EC impairment. Our findings reveal that the TLR4/NF-κB/ROS signal pathway is critical for mediating circSARS-CV2-N1368-promoted oxidative damage in ECs, providing insights into the endothelial impairment caused by circSARS-CV2-Ns.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hyperlipidemia, a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, is associated with limitations in clinical lipid-lowering medications. Drug repurposing strategies expedite the research process and mitigate development costs, offering an innovative approach to drug discovery. This study employed systematic literature and guidelines review to compile a training set comprising 176 lipid-lowering drugs and 3254 non-lipid-lowering drugs. Multiple machine learning models were developed to predict the lipid-lowering potential of drugs. A multi-tiered validation strategy was implemented, encompassing large-scale retrospective clinical data analysis, standardized animal studies, molecular docking simulations and dynamics analyses. Through a comprehensive screening analysis utilizing machine learning, 29 FDA-approved drugs with lipid-lowering potential were identified. Clinical data analysis confirmed that four candidate drugs, with Argatroban as the representative, demonstrated lipid-lowering effects. In animal experiments, the candidate drugs significantly improved multiple blood lipid parameters. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations elucidated the binding patterns and stability of candidate drugs in interaction with related targets. We successfully identified multiple non-lipid-lowering drugs with lipid-lowering potential by integrating state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with multi-level validation methods, thereby providing new insights into lipid-lowering drugs, establishing a paradigm for AI-based drug repositioning research, and expanding the repertoire of lipid-lowering medications available to clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by an immunosuppressive and inflammatory microenvironment, thus responds poorly to therapy. Previous studies show that norcantharidin (NCTD), a demethylated cantharidin (CTD) derived from Mylabris , exerts high efficacy in treating various cancers. In this study we investigated the antitumor effects of NCTD against CRC and the underlying mechanisms. Subcutaneous CRC models were established in balb/c mice using mouse colorectal cancer cell line CT26 and in balb/c nude mice using human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116. The mice were administered NCTD (2 or 4 mg·kg −1 ·d −1 , i.p.) for 14 days. We showed that NCTD dose-dependently reduced the tumor growth in both the CRC models. Furthermore, NCTD markedly increased M1 macrophage infiltration in tumor tissue in both the CRC models. NCTD-induced macrophage M1 polarization was confirmed by flow cytometry and qPCR assays in both THP-1 cell-derived and RAW264.7 macrophage models in vitro. We demonstrated that NCTD (20, 40 μM) dose-dependently increased CSF2 secretion from CRC cells and macrophages, and suppressed the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in CRC cells. Concurrently, NCTD (10–40 μM) dose-dependently inhibited CRC cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro. In conclusion, this study provides new evidence for the effects of NCTD against CRC and elucidates its antitumor mechanisms through remodeling the inflammatory microenvironment via CSF2-mediated macrophage M1 polarization and inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation in CRC cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ischaemic heart disease is an important cause of death in humans, and resupply of blood to damaged myocardium can exacerbate the risk of cardiac I/R injury. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important role in cardiovascular disease. In this study we investigated the regulatory role of circDhx32 in the progression of I/R injury. Cardiac I/R model was established in mice by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) for 45 min, followed by blood reperfusion for 24 h or 2 weeks. For in vitro study, neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) assault. CircDhx32 was significantly upregulated in I/R-treated mice and H/R-treated cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockdown of circDhx32 ameliorated the pathological outcomes of cardiac I/R injury including improved cardiac function, reduced infarct size and reduced release of cardiac injury biomarkers. The protective effects of circDhx32 silencing were also observed in cardiomyocytes after H/R. We demonstrated that ALKBH5 functioned as an m 6 A demethylase, removing the m 6 A modification sites of circDhx32. Reduced m 6 A modification inhibited recognition and bindin g by the m 6 A readers YTHDF2 and YTHDC1, leading to circDhx32 degradation and diminished nucleoplasmic export under pathological conditions. Elevated circDhx32 inhibited the transcriptional activation of AdipoR1 by binding to FOXO1. Conversel y , circDhx32 deficiency alleviated the inflammatory responses in I/R-treated mice and H/R-treated cardiomyocytes including decreased mRNA expression levels and release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β potentially through modulation of the AdipoR1-AMPK-NF-κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, ALKBH5 acted as m 6 A eraser accompanied by the m 6 A readers YTHDF2 and YTHDC1 to promote high expression and nuclear retention of circDhx32 under pathological conditions. CircDhx32 regulated the inflammatory responses to cardiac I/R injury by targeting the AdipoR1-AMPK-NF-κB signaling pathway, which competed with AdipoR1 for FOXO1. These results revea l a novel mechanism underlying cardiac ischaemic injury, and circDhx32 is expected to be a potential therapeutic target for early intervention in ischaemic cardiac disease.",

    "abstract": "Negative-stranded segmented RNA viruses (NSVs) employ a cap-snatching mechanism for transcription, which makes cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN) an attractive target for drug development. Pathogenic arenaviruses pose a serious threat to humans, yet no approved treatments exist, underscoring the importance of discovering novel compounds targeting arenaviral CENs. Therefore, this study aimed to identify novel CEN inhibitors for arenaviruses and investigate their antiviral mechanisms. A high-throughput screening system based on enzymatic activity of CEN was established for discovering inhibitors of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Several hit compounds were screened from a vast natural product library, and then evaluated for both toxicity and inhibition through cellular and animal experiments. One candidate compound was finally identified, and its mechanism of action on CEN was elucidated through simulation analysis and biochemical studies. Moreover, its broad-spectrum effects were investigated among pathogenic arenaviruses as well as representative NSVs. Consequently, salvianolic acid A (SAA) from Salvia miltiorrhiza was identified as a promising compound that effectively inhibited LCMV infection and significantly reduced the viral load via intravenous administration. It was shown to bind to the active pocket of arenaviral CENs while chelating their metal ions through its acid carboxyl group, acting in a substrate-competitive manner. Additionally, SAA exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition of pathogenic arenaviruses as well as representative viruses from the order Bunyavirales. This study identified SAA as a novel CEN inhibitor, particularly for pathogenic arenaviruses, showcasing its promise for antiviral drug development.",

The kinetic parameters of the fluorogenic substrate have been determined as Km=404 μmol·L−1, kcat=1.08 min−1, and kcat/Km=2.7 mmol−1·L·min−1. SARS-CoV 3CLpro showed substantial pH and temperature-triggered activity switches, and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of SARS-CoV 3CLpro revealed that substitutions of His41, Cys145, and His163 resulted in complete loss of enzymatic activity, while replacement of Met162 with Ala caused strongly increased activity. This present work has provided valuable information for understanding the catalytic mechanism of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.

The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of AVE8134 on lipid profile and glucose metabolism in dyslipidemic mice and type 2 diabetic rats.A cell based PPAR Gal4 transactivation assay was constructed for testing the activities of AVE8134 at 3 different PPAR isoforms in vitro. Transgenic human Apo A1 (hApo A1) mice and insulin-resistant ZDF rats were used to evaluate the effects of AVE8134 in vivo.AVE8134 was a full PPARα dominated PPAR agonist (the values of EC(50) for human and rodent PPARα receptor were 0.01 and 0.3 μmol/L, respectively). AVE8134 was not active at PPARδ receptor. In female hApo A1 mice, AVE8134 (1-30 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), po for 12 d) dose-dependently lowered the plasma triglycerides, and increased the serum HDL-cholesterol, hApo A1 and mouse Apo E levels. In female ZDF rats, AVE8134 (3-30 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 2 weeks) improved insulin-sensitivity index. In pre-diabetic male ZDF rats (at the age of 7 weeks), AVE8134 (10 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 8 weeks) produced an anti-diabetic action comparable to rosiglitazone, without the PPARγ mediated adverse effects on body weight and heart weight. In male ZDF rats (at the age of 6 weeks), AVE8134 (20 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 12 weeks) increased mRNA levels of the target genes LPL and PDK4 about 20 fold in the liver, and there was no relevant effect with rosiglitazone.AVE8134 improves lipid profile and glucose metabolism in dyslipidemic mice and type 2 diabetic rats.",

    "abstract": "In the past few years, progress being made in stem cell studies has incontestably led to the hope of developing cell replacement based therapy for diseases deficient in effective treatment by conventional ways. The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are of great interest of cell therapy research because of their unrestricted self-renewal and differentiation potentials. Proof of principle studies have successfully demonstrated that iPSCs technology would substantially benefit clinical studies in various areas, including neurological disorders, hematologic diseases, cardiac diseases, liver diseases and etc. On top of this, latest advances of gene editing technologies have vigorously endorsed the possibility of obtaining disease-free autologous cells from patient specific iPSCs. Here in this review, we summarize current progress of stem cell therapy research with special enthusiasm in iPSCs studies. In addition, we compare current gene editing technologies and discuss their potential implications in clinic application in the future.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the mechanisms underlying the hepatotoxicity of timosaponin A3 (TA3), a steroidal saponin from Anemarrhena asphodeloides, in rats.Male SD rats were administered TA3 (100 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), po) for 14 d, and the blood and bile samples were collected after the final administration. The viability of a sandwich configuration of cultured rat hepatocytes (SCRHs) was assessed using WST-1. Accumulation and biliary excretion index (BEI) of d8-TCA in SCRHs were determined with LC-MS/MS. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to analyze the expression of relevant genes and proteins. ROS and ATP levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured. F-actin cytoskeletal integrity was assessed under confocal microscopy.TA3 administration in rats significantly elevated the total bile acid in serum, and decreased bile acid (BA) component concentrations in bile. TA3 inhibited the viability of the SCRHs with an IC50 value of 15.21±1.73 μmol/L. Treatment of the SCRHs with TA3 (1-10 μmol/L) for 2 and 24 h dose-dependently decreased the accumulation and BEI of d8-TCA. The TA3 treatment dose-dependently decreased the expression of BA transporters Ntcp, Bsep and Mrp2, and BA biosynthesis related Cyp7a1 in hepatocytes. Furthermore, the TA3 treatment dose-dependently increased ROS generation and HO-1 expression, decreased the ATP level and MMP, and disrupted F-actin in the SCRHs. NAC (5 mmol/L) significantly ameliorated TA3-induced effects in the SCRHs, whereas mangiferin (10-200 μg/mL) almost blocked TA3-induced ROS generation.TA3 triggers liver injury through inducing ROS generation and suppressing the expression of BA transporters. Mangiferin, an active component in Anemarrhena, may protect hepatocytes from TA3-induced hepatotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "To establish the mechanism responsible for the stimulation of glucose uptake by Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), extracted from Astragalus membranaceus Bunge, in L6 myotubes in vitro. APS-stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes was measured using the 2-deoxy-[3H]-D-glucose method. The adenine nucleotide contents in the cells were measured by HPLC. The phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) was examined using Western blot analysis. The cells transfected with 4P mutant AS160 (AS160-4P) were constructed using gene transfer approach. Treatment of L6 myotubes with APS (100−1600 μg/mL) significantly increased glucose uptake in time- and concentration-dependent manners. The maximal glucose uptake was reached in the cells treated with APS (400 μg/mL) for 36 h. The APS-stimulated glucose uptake was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with Compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor or in the cells overexpressing AS160-4P. Treatment of L6 myotubes with APS strongly promoted the activation of AMPK. We further demonstrated that either Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) or liver kinase B1 (LKB1) mediated APS-induced activation of AMPK in L6 myotubes, and the increased cellular AMP: ATP ratio was also involved. Treatment of L6 myotubes with APS robustly enhanced the phosphorylation of AS160, which was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with Compound C. Our results demonstrate that APS stimulates glucose uptake in L6 myotubes through the AMP-AMPK-AS160 pathway, which may contribute to its hypoglycemic effect.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibition is an important strategy in cancer therapy. Blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 is well developed in clinical practice. In the last few years, LAG-3 has received much interest as an emerging novel target in immunotherapy. It was recently reported that FGL1 is a major ligand of LAG-3, which is normally secreted by the liver but is upregulated in several human cancers. FGL1 is a crucial biomarker and target for cancer immunotherapy. As the efficacy of immunotherapy is limited to specific types of patients, the subset of patients needs to be selected appropriately to receive precise treatment according to different biomarkers. To date, there is no test to accurately assess FGL1 expression levels. Nanobodies have some outstanding features, such as high stability, solubility and affinity for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Here, we report the development and validation of a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective nanobody-based immunoassay for the detection of FGL1 in human serum. In this study, human FGL1 recombinant protein was expressed and purified for the first time as an immunized antigen. Then, we constructed a nanobody phage display library and screened several nanobodies that bind FGL1 with high affinity. We selected two nanobodies targeting different epitopes of FGL1, one as a capture and the other conjugated with HRP as a probe. The double nanobody-based sandwich ELISA to detect the concentration of FGL1 showed a good response relationship in the range of 15.625-2000 ng/mL, and the recoveries from the spiked sample were in the range of 78% and 100%. This assay could be used as a potential approach for evaluating FGL1 expression for patient stratification and for predicting the therapeutic efficacy of targeting the LAG3/FGL1 axis.",

    "abstract": "C1q/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) related proteins (CTRPs) is a newly discovered adipokine family with conservative structure and ubiquitous distribution and is secreted by adipose tissues. Recently, CTRPs have attracted increasing attention due to the its wide-ranging effects upon inflammation and metabolism. To-date, 15 members of CTRPs (CTRP1-15) with the characteristic C1q domain have been characterized. Earlier in-depth phenotypic analyses of mouse models of CTRPs deficiency have also unveiled ample function of CTRPs in inflammation and metabolism. This review focuses on the rise of CTRPs, with a special emphasis on the latest discoveries with regards to the effects of the CTRP family on inflammation and metabolism as well as related diseases. We first introduced the structure of characteristic domain and polymerization of CTRPs to reveal its pleiotropic biological functions. Next, intimate association of CTRP family with inflammation and metabolism, as well as the involvement of CTRPs as nodes in complex molecular networks, were elaborated. With expanding membership of CTRP family, the information presented here provides new perspectives for therapeutic strategies to improve inflammatory and metabolic abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "γ-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that cleaves the C99 fragment of amyloid precursor protein to generate extracellular Aβ peptides. These peptides can oligomerize and aggregate to form amyloid plaques, processes that are widely believed to be causal for Alzheimer's disease. In spite of this critical function, it remains unknown how γ-secretase recognizes C99 and its other substrates, including Notch. In this study we determined E22-K55 as the minimal C99 fragment that was sufficient and required for initial cleavage. Within this fragment, we identified four determinants: (i) a transferable extracellular determinant that differed between C99 and Notch, and which included negative charge in the case of C99, (ii) the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal half of the transmembrane helix, (iii) an invariant lysine or arginine at the intracellular membrane border, and (iv) a positive charge cluster that included the invariant lysine/arginine. We demonstrated that the charge clusters of C99 and Notch receptors could directly bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The PIP2-binding cluster was required for γ-secretase cleavage, and modulation of membrane PIP2 levels strongly affected γ-secretase cleavage levels and the Aβ40/Aβ42 ratio, providing support for the importance of the PIP2 interaction in cells. Together, these studies provide critically needed insight into substrate recognition by γ-secretase.",

    "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) represents a major cause of hospitalization and death. Recent evidence shows that novel biomarkers such as soluble suppression of tumorigenicity (sST2), growth-differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) are correlated with inflammatory and ischemic responses in CHF patients. In this study we examined the effects of Ivabradine that inhibited the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN channel, also called funny current If), thereby leading to selective heart rate reduction and improved myocardial oxygen supply on the cardiac biomarkers sST2, GDF-15, suPAR and H-FABP in 50 CHF patients at the University Hospital of Jena. Patients were divided into three groups based on the etiology of CHF: dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n=20), ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM, n=20) and hypertensive cardiomyopathy (HCM, n=10). The patients were administered Ivabradine (5 mg, bid for 3 months, and 7.5 mg bid for further 3 months). Analyses of cardiovascular biomarkers were performed at baseline as well as at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. At 6-month follow-up, GDF-15 levels were significantly reduced compared to baseline levels (P=0.0215), indicating a reduction in the progress of cardiac remodeling. H-FABP concentration was significantly lower in DCM patients compared to ICM (1.89 vs 3.24 μg/mL) and HCM patients (1.89 vs 3.80 μg/mL), and decreased over the 6-month follow-up (P=0.0151). suPAR median levels remained elevated, implying major ongoing inflammatory processes. As shown by significant decreases in GDF-15 and H-FABP levels, a reduction in ventricular remodeling and sub-clinical ischemia could be assumed. However, markers of hemodynamic stress (sST2) and inflammation (suPAR) showed no change or progression after 6 months of Ivabradine treatment in CHF patients. Further studies are necessary to validate the clinical applicability of these novel cardiovascular biomarkers.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-angiogenic effects of DMU-212 in vitro and in vivo. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used in this study. Cell viability was studied with MTT assay, and cell apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL assay and morphological observation. The expression of the related genes and proteins was analyzed with qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Angiogenesis of HUVECs were studied using cell migration and capillary-like tube formation assays in vitro, and mouse Matrigel plug assay and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay in vivo. The tyrosine kinase activities of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were measured using commercial kits. DMU-212 (5–80 μmol/L) significantly inhibited VEGF-stimulated proliferation of HUVECs (IC50 value was approximately 20 μmol/L), and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, DMU-212 concentration-dependently inhibited VEGF-induced migration of HUVECs and capillary-like structure formation in vitro. DMU-212 also inhibited VEGF-induced generation of new vasculature in Matrigel plugs in vivo with significantly decreased area of infiltrating CD31-positive endothelial cells, and inhibited newly formed microvessels in chick CAMs. Moreover, DMU-212 concentration-dependently suppressed VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR2, and inhibited phosphorylation of multiple downstream signaling components in the VEGFR2 pathway, including c-Src, FAK, Erk1/2, Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K in HUVECs. DMU-212 had no effect on VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR1. DMU-212 is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis that exerts anti-angiogenic activity at least in part through the VEGFR2 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Drug efflux-associated multidrug resistance (MDR) is a main obstacle to effective cancer chemotherapy. Large molecule drugs are not the substrates of P-glycoprotein, and can circumvent drug efflux and be retained inside cells. In this article we report a polymer-drug conjugate nanoparticulate system that can overcome MDR based on size-related exclusion effect.Doxorubicin was coupled with the triblock polymeric material cell-penetrating TAT-PEG-poly(aspartic acid). The amphiphilic macromolecules (termed TAT-PEG-Asp8-Dox) could self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) in water. The antitumor activity was evaluated in drug-resistant human colon cancer HCT8/ADR cells in vitro and in nude mice bearing HCT8/ADR tumor.The self-assembling TAT-PEG-Asp8-Dox NPs were approximately 150 nm with a narrow particle size distribution, which not only increased the cellular uptake efficiency, but also bypassed P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux and improved the intracellular drug retention, thus yielding an enhanced efficacy for killing drug-resistant HCT8/ADR colon cancer cells in vitro. Importantly, the TAT-PEG-Asp8-Dox NPs enhanced the intranuclear disposition of drugs for grater inhibition of DNA/RNA biosynthesis. In nude mice bearing xenografted HCT8/ADR colon cancers, intravenous or peritumoral injection of TAT-PEG-Asp8-Dox NPs for 22 d effectively inhibited tumor growth.TAT-PEG-Asp8-Dox NPs can increase cellular drug uptake and intranuclear drug delivery and retain effective drug accumulation inside the cells, thus exhibiting enhanced anticancer activity toward the drug-resistant human colon cancer HCT8/ADR cells.",

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes by cholesterol-lowering statin therapy, the high rate of CVD is still a great concern worldwide. Dehydrocorydaline (DHC) is an alkaloidal compound isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Corydalis yanhusuo. Emerging evidence shows that DHC has anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic benefits, but whether DHC exerts any antiatherosclerotic effects remains unclear. Our study revealed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of DHC in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice not only inhibited atherosclerosis development but also improved aortic compliance and increased plaque stability. In addition, DHC attenuated systemic and vascular inflammation in ApoE-/- mice. As macrophage inflammation plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, we next examined the direct effects of DHC on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro. Our RNA-seq data revealed that DHC dramatically decreased the levels of proinflammatory gene clusters. We verified that DHC significantly downregulated proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 mRNA levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, DHC decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in BMDMs, as evidenced by the reduced protein levels of CD80, iNOS, NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18. Importantly, DHC attenuated LPS-induced activation of p65 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. Thus, we conclude that DHC ameliorates atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice by inhibiting inflammation, likely by targeting macrophage p65- and ERK1/2-mediated pathways.",

    "abstract": "Rictor is a key component of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) and is required for Akt phosphorylation (Ser473). Our previous study shows that knockdown of Rictor prevents cardiomyocyte differentiation from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and induces abnormal electrophysiology of ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes (ESC-CMs). Besides, knockdown of Rictor causes down-expression of connexin 43 (Cx43), the predominant gap junction protein, that is located in both the sarcolemma and mitochondria in cardiomyocytes. Mitochondrial Cx43 (mtCx43) plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function. In this study, we used the model of cardiomyocyte differentiation from mouse ES cells to elucidate the mechanisms for the mitochondrial damage in ESC-CMs after knockdown of Rictor. We showed swollen and ruptured mitochondria were observed after knockdown of Rictor under transmission electron microscope. ATP production and mitochondrial transmembrane potential were significantly decreased in Rictor-knockdown cells. Furthermore, knockdown of Rictor inhibited the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex. The above-mentioned changes were linked to inhibiting the translocation of Cx43 into mitochondria by knockdown of Rictor. We revealed that knockdown of Rictor inactivated the mTOR/Akt signalling pathway and subsequently decreased HDAC6 expression, resulted in Hsp90 hyper-acetylation caused by HDAC6 inhibition, thus, inhibited the formation of Hsp90-Cx43-TOM20 complex. In conclusion, the mitochondrial Cx43 participates in shRNA-Rictor-induced mitochondrial function damage in the ESC-CMs.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy-lysosome system plays a variety of roles in human cancers. In addition to being implicated in metabolism, it is also involved in tumor immunity, remodeling the tumor microenvironment, vascular proliferation, and promoting tumor progression and metastasis. Transcriptional factor EB (TFEB) is a major regulator of the autophagy-lysosomal system. With the in-depth studies on TFEB, researchers have found that it promotes various cancer phenotypes by regulating the autophagolysosomal system, and even in an autophagy-independent way. In this review, we summarize the recent findings about TFEB in various types of cancer (melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer and lung cancer), and shed some light on the mechanisms by which it may serve as a potential target for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4; formerly known as GPR120) is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. FFA4 has been found to express in the small intestines and colons of mice and humans. In this study we investigate the effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on FFA4 in human colon epithelial cells in vitro. HCT116 and HT-29 human colon epithelial cell lines endogenously expressing FFA4 were used. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured in fura 2-AM-loaded cells with fluorescence spectrophotometry. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to detect FFA4. Ten to 100 μmol/L of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids α-linolenic acid (αLA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) induced dose-dependent [Ca2+]i increase in HCT116 and HT-29 cells, whereas docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had no effect. In addition, the omega-6 fatty acids linoleic acid and γ-linoleic acid also dose-dependently increase [Ca2+]i, but the mono-unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid and saturated fatty acids such as stearic acid and palmitic acid had no effect. In HCT116 and HT-29 cells, the αLA-induced [Ca2+]i increase was partially inhibited by pretreatment with EGTA, phospholipase C inhibitor edelfosine, cADPR inhibitors 8-bro-cADPR or DAB, and abolished by pretreatment with Ca2+ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, but was not affected by Gi/o protein inhibitor PTX or IP3R inhibitor 2-APB. Omega-3 and omega-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (C18-20) induce Ca2+ mobilization responses in human colonic epithelial cells in vitro through activation of FFA4 and PTX-insensitive Gi/o protein, followed by Ca2+ release from thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Physapubenolide (PB), a withanolide-type compound extracted from the traditional herb Physalis minima L., has been demonstrated to exert remarkable cytotoxicity against cancer cells; however, its molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that PB inhibited cell proliferation and migration in melanoma cells by inducing cell apoptosis. The anticancer activity of PB was further verified in a melanoma xenograft model. To explore the mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of PB, we carried out an in silico target prediction study, which combined three approaches (chemical similarity searching, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), and molecular docking) to identify the targets of PB, and found that PB likely targets 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, which promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis. We further demonstrated that PB interacted with HMGCR, decreased its protein expression and inhibited the HMGCR/YAP pathway in melanoma cells. In addition, we found that PB could restore vemurafenib sensitivity in vemurafenib-resistant A-375 cells, which was correlated with the downregulation of HMGCR. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PB elicits anticancer action and enhances sensitivity to vemurafenib by targeting HMGCR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Latest clinical research shows that trimetazidine therapy during the perioperative period relieves endothelial dysfunction in patients with unstable angina induced by percutaneous coronary intervention. In this study we investigated the effects of TMZ on myocardial angiogenesis in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy mice. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in mice by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. TAC mice were administered trimetazidine (2.8 mg/100 µL, i.g.) for 28 consecutive days. We showed that trimetazidine administration significantly increased blood vessel density in the left ventricular myocardium and abrogated cardiac dysfunction in TAC mice. Co-administration of a specific HSF1 inhibitor KRIBB11 (1.25 mg/100 µL, i.h.) abrogated the angiogenesis-promoting effects of trimetazidine in TAC mice. Using luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays we demonstrated that the transcription factor HSF1 bound to the promoter region of VEGF-A, and the transcriptional activity of HSF1 was enhanced upon trimetazidine treatment. In molecular docking analysis we found that trimetazidine directly bound to Akt via a hydrogen bond with Asp292 and a pi–pi bond with Trp80. In norepinephrine-treated HUVECs, we showed that trimetazidine significantly increased the phosphorylation of Akt and the synergistic nuclear translocation of Akt and HSF1, as well as the binding of Akt and HSF1 in the nucleus. These results suggest that trimetazidine enhances myocardial angiogenesis through a direct interaction with Akt and promotion of nuclear translocation of HSF1, and that trimetazidine may be used for the treatment of myocardial angiogenic disorders in hypertensive patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diabetic cognitive impairment (DCI) is a common diabetic complication characterized by learning and memory deficits. In diabetic patients, hyperactivated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis leads to abnormal increase of glucocorticoids (GCs), which causes the damage of hippocampal neurons and cognitive impairment. In this study we investigated the cognition-improving effects of a non-steroidal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist 5-chloro-N-[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]thiophene-2-sulfonamide (FX5) in diabetic mice. Four weeks after T1DM or T2DM was induced, the mice were administered FX5 (20, 40 mg·kg −1 ·d −1 , i.g .) for 8 weeks. Cognitive impairment was assessed in open field test, novel object recognition test, Y-maze test, and Morris water maze test. We showed that FX5 administration significantly ameliorated the cognitive impairments in both type 1 and 2 diabetic mice. Similar cognitive improvement was observed in diabetic mice following brain GR-specific knockdown by injecting AAV- si-GR . Moreover, AAV- si-GR injection occluded the cognition-improving effects of FX5, suggesting that FX5 functioning as a non-steroidal GR antagonist. In PA-treated primary neurons (as DCI model in vitro), we demonstrated that FX5 (2, 5, 10 μM) dose-dependently ameliorated synaptic impairment via upregulating GR/BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway, protected against neuronal apoptosis through repressing GR/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β-mediated tauopathy and subsequent endoplasmic reticulum stress. In LPS-treated primary microglia, FX5 dose-dependently inhibited inflammation through GR/NF-κB/NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1 pathway. These beneficial effects were also observed in the hippocampus of diabetic mice following FX5 administration. Collectively, we have elucidated the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of non-steroidal GR antagonist FX5 on DCI and highlighted the potential of FX5 in the treatment of the disease.",

    "abstract": "TPN171 is a novel phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and erectile dysfunction (ED), which currently is undergoing phase II clinical trials in China. In this single-center, single-dose, nonrandomized, and open design study, radiolabeled [14C]TPN171 was used to investigate the metabolic mechanism, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and clearance pathways of TPN171 in 6 healthy Chinese male volunteers. Each volunteer was administered a single oral suspension of 10 mg (100 μCi) of [14C]TPN171. We found that TPN171 was absorbed rapidly in humans with a peak time (Tmax) of 0.667 h and a half-life (t1/2) of approximately 9.89 h in plasma. Excretion of radiopharmaceutical-related components was collected 216 h after administration, accounting for 95.21% of the dose (46.61% in urine and 48.60% in feces). TPN171 underwent extensive metabolism in humans. Twenty-two metabolites were detected in human plasma, urine, and feces using a radioactive detector combined with a high-resolution mass spectrometer. According to radiochromatograms, a glucuronide metabolite of O-dealkylated TPN171 exceeded 10% of the total drug-related components in human plasma. However, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, no further tests are needed to evaluate the safety of this metabolite because it is a phase II metabolite, but the compound is still worthy of attention. The main metabolic biotransformation of TPN171 was mono-oxidation (hydroxylation and N-oxidation), dehydrogenation, N-dealkylation, O-dealkylation, amide hydrolysis, glucuronidation, and acetylation. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) mainly catalyzed the formation of metabolites, and CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 were involved in the oxidative metabolism of TPN171 to a lesser extent. According to the incubation data, M1 was mainly metabolized to M1G by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9), followed by UGT1A7 and UGT1A10.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a) is an important G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates a variety of functions by binding to ghrelin. It has been shown that the dimerization of GHS-R1a with other receptors also affects ingestion, energy metabolism, learning and memory. Dopamine type 2 receptor (D 2 R) is a GPCR mainly distributed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra (SN), striatum and other brain regions. In this study we investigated the existence and function of GHS-R1a/D 2 R heterodimers in nigral dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s disease (PD) models in vitro and in vivo. By conducting immunofluorescence staining, FRET and BRET analyses, we confirmed that GHS-R1a and D 2 R could form heterodimers in PC-12 cells and in the nigral dopaminergic neurons of wild-type mice. This process was inhibited by MPP + or MPTP treatment. Application of QNP (10 μM) alone significantly increased the viability of MPP + -treated PC-12 cells, and administration of quinpirole (QNP, 1 mg/kg, i.p. once before and twice after MPTP injection) significantly alleviated motor deficits in MPTP-induced PD mice model; the beneficial effects of QNP were abolished by GHS-R1a knockdown. We revealed that the GHS-R1a/D 2 R heterodimers could increase the protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase in the SN of MPTP-induced PD mice model through the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway, ultimately promoting dopamine synthesis and release. These results demonstrate a protective role for GHS-R1a/D 2 R heterodimers in dopaminergic neurons, providing evidence for the involvement of GHS-R1a in PD pathogenesis independent of ghrelin.",

    "abstract": "Abstract P60, a Foxp3 inhibitory peptide, can hinder the regulatory T cell (Treg) activity and impair tumor proliferation. However, low systemic stability and poor specificity have led to daily dosing to achieve therapeutic effect. Therefore, this study aims to improve P60 stability and specific delivery through its encapsulation in liposomes targeting CD25, constitutively expressed in Tregs. P60 liposomes formulated with DSPE-PEG 750 or DSPE-PEG 2000 were incubated with DSPE-PEG 2000 -Maleimide micelles conjugated to Fab’ fragments of anti-CD25 to develop two targeted formulations or immunoliposomes (IL): IL-P60 2000 (DSPE-PEG 2000 only) and IL-P60 750 (combining DSPE-PEG 750 and DSPE-PEG 2000 ). P60 encapsulation efficiency was 50%–60% irrespective of PEG chain length. Treg uptake was 2.5 and 14 times higher for IL-PEG 750 compared with IL-PEG 2000 and non-targeted liposomes, respectively, in in-vitro assays. In fact, IL-P60 750 allowed CD8 + T cells ex-vivo proliferation in presence of Treg at doses 10–20 times lower than for free P60. Antitumor response of P60 and IL-P60 750 in monotherapy and combined with anti-PD-1 was evaluated in MC38 and LLCOVA tumor bearing mice. In MC38 model, IL-P60 750 monotherapy induced total tumor regression in 40% of mice reaching 100% for anti-PD-1 combination. This effect was associated with a significant increase in activated CD8 + T cells in tumors. Notably, IL-P60 750 also inhibited human Treg in ex-vivo assay, showing the translational capability of this formulation. In conclusion, IL-P60 750 formulated with different PEG chain lengths, has demonstrated antitumor efficacy by selective inhibition of Treg activity and enhances the effect of anti-PD1. Altogether, this novel IL represents a promising nanoplatform for cancer immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are promising in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, about half of patients do not respond well to them. Low levels of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) in tumors have been shown to negatively influence prognosis and response to ICIs. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is produced in large amounts by melanoma and is abundantly present in the tumor microenvironment. LPA induces the release of various cytokines and chemokines from tumor cells, which affect cancer development, metastasis, and tumor immunity. In the present study, we investigated the role of LPA-induced IL-10 release in regulating HLA-DR expression and the underlying mechanisms in human melanoma cells. We showed that LPA (0.001–10 μM) dose-dependently increased DR6 transcript levels through activating LPAR1 in HEK293T cells. Knockdown of NF-κB1 abrogated the LPA-increased DR6 expression without affecting basal DR6 expression in both A2058 and A375 melanoma cell lines. LPA (10 µM) significantly increased IL-10 transcripts in A2058 and A375 melanoma cells, the effect was abolished by pharmacological inhibition of LPAR1 or knockdown of DR6. We found a statistically significant correlation between the expression of LPAR1, DR6 and IL-10 in human melanoma tissue and an association between increased expression of LPAR1 and reduced effectiveness of ICI therapy. We demonstrated that LPA (10 µM) markedly suppressed HLA-DR expression in both A375 and A2058 melanoma cells via activating the LPAR1-DR6-IL-10 pathway. These data suggest that the LPAR1-DR6-IL-10 autocrine loop could constitute a novel mechanism used by tumor cells to evade immunosurveillance by decreasing HLA-DR expression.",

GbE 100 mg/kg was administered to rats by ig. After 8 weeks, the expressions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-10R in the brain tissues of AS rats were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.The protein and mRNA expressions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 in the brains were markedly higher in AS groups than that in control groups (6.11+/-0.15, 1.55+/-0.14, 0.54+/-0.04 ng/g wet weight vs 0.80+/-0.14, 0.33+/-0.09, and 0.33+/-0.02 ng/g wet weight, respectively). The protein and mRNA expressions of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in the brains were markedly lower in GbE groups (3.82+/-0.54, 0.95+/-0.08 ng/g wet weight) than that in AS groups, the protein and mRNA expressions of IL-10 and IL-10R in the brains were markedly higher in GbE groups (0.85+/-0.06 ng/g wet weight) than that in AS groups.GbE inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, but up-regulated the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL-10R in brain, which might be related with its anti-AS actions.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) has a wide range of biological functions, including anti-inflammation. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of PPAR-γ on transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2). HK-2 cells were pretreated with 15d-PGJ2 or troglitazone (TGL) and then treated with TGF-β1. Expression of MCP-1 and IL-8 was measured using real-time PCR and ELISA. Treatment with 5 ng/mL TGF-β1 for 24 h increased both MCP-1 and IL-8 mRNA and protein levels in HK-2 cells. Both 15d-PGJ2 at 2.5 and 5 μmol/L and TGL at 2.5 μmol/L exhibited inhibitory effects on TGF-β1-induced MCP-1 expression. Additionally, 15d-PGJ2 at 2.5 and 5 μmol/L and TGL at 2.5 μmol/L inhibited TGF-β1-induced expression of IL-8. PPAR-γ agonists (15d-PGJ2 and TGL) could inhibit the TGF-β1-induced expression of chemokines in HK-2 cells. Our results suggest that PPAR-γ agonists have the potential to be used as a treatment regimen to reduce inflammation in renal tubulointerstitial disease.",

    "abstract": "Tanshinone II-A sodium sulfonate (DS-201), a water-soluble derivative of Tanshinone II-A, has been found to induce vascular relaxation and activate BKCa channels. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying the action of DS-201 on BKCa channels.Human BKCa channels containing α subunit alone or α plus β1 subunits were expressed in HEK293 cells. BKCa currents were recorded from the cells using patch-clamp technique. The expression and trafficking of BKCa subunits in HEK293 cells or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were detected by Western blotting, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.DS-201 (40-160 μmol/L) concentration-dependently increased the total open probability of BKCa channels in HEK293 cells, associated with enhancements of Ca(2+) and voltage dependence as well as a delay in deactivation. Coexpression of β1 subunit did not affect the action of DS-201: the values of EC50 for BKCa channels containing α subunit alone and α plus β1 subunit were 66.6±1.5 and 62.0±1.1 μmol/L, respectively. In both HEK293 cells and VSMCs, DS-201 (80 μmol/L) markedly increased the expression of α subunit without affecting β1 subunit. In HEK293 cells, DS-201 enriched the membranous level of α subunit, likely by accelerating the trafficking and suppressing the internalization of α subunit. In both HEK293 cells and VSMCs, DS-201 (≥320 μmol/L) induced significant cytotoxicity.DS-201 selectively targets the pore-forming α subunit of human BKCa channels, thus enhancing the channel activities and increasing the subunit expression and trafficking, whereas the β1 subunit does not contribute to the action of DS-201.",

    "abstract": "The resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is still a threat because the causative agent remaining in animal reservoirs is not fully understood, and sporadic cases continue to be reported. Developing high titers of anti-SARS hyperimmune globulin to provide an alternative pathway for emergent future prevention and treatment of SARS.SARS coronavirus (CoV)F69 (AY313906) and Z2-Y3 (AY394989) were isolated and identified from 2 different Cantonese onset SARS patients. Immunogen was prepared from SARS-CoV F69 strain. Six health horses were immunized 4 times and serum was collected periodically to measure the profile of specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a microneutralization test. Sera were collected in large amounts at the peak, where IgG was precipitated using ammonium sulphate and subsequently digested with pepsin. The product was then purified using anion-exchange chromatography to obtain F(ab')2 fragments.The specific IgG and neutralizing antibody titers peaked at approximately week 7 after the first immunization, with a maximum value of 1:14210. The sera collected at the peak were then purified. Fragment of approximately 15 g F(ab')2 was obtained from 1litre antiserum and the purity was above 90% with the titer of 1:5120, which could neutralize the other strain (SARS-CoV Z2-Y3) as well.This research provides a viable strategy for the prevention and treatment of SARS coronavirus infection with equine hyperimmune globulin, with the purpose of combating any resurgence of SARS.",

    "abstract": "To explore a novel function of a mutant of the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBxΔ127) in the promotion of hepatoma cell migration. The effect of HBxΔ127 and wild type HBx on the migration ability of hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells were examined using wound healing assays in stable transfection systems. The full-length osteopontin(OPN) promoter sequence was cloned into the pGL3-Basic plasmid. The promoter activities of OPN in stably HBxΔ127-transfected hepatoblastoma HepG2 (HepG2-XΔ127) and hepatocellular carcinoma H7402 (H7402-XΔ127) cells were determined using luciferase reporter gene assays. The mRNA expression levels of OPN were detected by RT-PCR. And the effect of MK886, a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), on OPN promoter activity and mRNA expression in HepG2-XΔ127 and H7402-XΔ127 cells were examined using luciferase reporter gene assays and RT-PCR, respectively. Finally, the migration ability of HepG2-XΔ127 was observed after treatment with siRNA targeting OPN mRNA and HBx mRNA using wound healing assays. HepG2-XΔ127 cells exhibited a greater capacity for wound repair compared to HepG2-X cells. The promoter activity and mRNA expression levels of OPN were also increased in HepG2-XΔ127 and H7402-XΔ127 cells. Moreover, MK886 abolished the HBxΔ127-mediated upregulation of OPN. Wound healing assays demonstrated that the migration ability of HepG2-XΔ127 cells can be suppressed by treatment with siRNA targeting OPN mRNA and siRNA targeting HBx mRNA. HBxΔ127 strongly promotes hepatoma cell migration via activation of OPN involving 5-LOX.",

    "abstract": "Tanshinol is an important catechol in the antianginal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza roots (Danshen). This study aimed to characterize tanshinol methylation. Metabolites of tanshinol were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Metabolism was assessed in vitro with rat and human enzymes. The major metabolites were synthesized for studying their interactions with drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and their vasodilatory properties. Dose-related tanshinol methylation and its influences on tanshinol pharmacokinetics were also studied in rats. Methylation, preferentially in the 3-hydroxyl group, was the major metabolic pathway of tanshinol. In rats, tanshinol also underwent considerable 3-O-sulfation, which appeared to be poor in human liver. These metabolites were mainly eliminated via renal excretion, which involved tubular secretion mainly by organic anion transporter (OAT) 1. The methylated metabolites had no vasodilatory activity. Entacapone-impaired methylation did not considerably increase systemic exposure to tanshinol in rats. The saturation of tanshinol methylation in rat liver could be predicted from the Michaelis constant of tanshinol for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Tanshinol had low affinity for human COMT and OATs; its methylated metabolites also had low affinity for the transporters. Tanshinol and its major human metabolite (3-O-methyltanshinol) exhibited negligible inhibitory activities against human cytochrome P450 enzymes, organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1/1B3, multidrug resistance protein 1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, and breast cancer resistance protein. Tanshinol is mainly metabolized via methylation. Tanshinol and its major human metabolite have low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with synthetic antianginal agents. This study will help define the risk of hyperhomocysteinemia related to tanshinol methylation.",

    "abstract": "An early intervention using biomarkers to predict acute myocardial infarction (AMI) will effectively reduce global heart attack incidence, particularly among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study attempted to identify potential biomarkers by detecting changes in the levels of plasma proteins in T2DM patients following onset of AMI in comparison with those without AMI. Volunteer T2DM patients without AMI (control; n=10) and T2DM patients with AMI (n=10) were recruited. Plasma samples from these patients were evaluated via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) to screen for proteins with level changes between the two groups. The abundance of spots on gel images was analyzed using Progenesis SameSpots and subjected to false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. Protein spots with statistically significant changes of at least 1.5 fold were selected for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Due to strong cardiac connections, tetranectin and titin were evaluated by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The adjusted P-values and fold changes between the two groups resulted in identification of 34 protein spots with significantly altered abundance. Upon MS analysis, 17 plasma proteins were identified: tetranectin, titin, clusterin, haptoglobin, myosin-13, zinc fnger protein 445, DNA repair protein RAD50, serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-IV, caspase-6, aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1, serotransferrin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-I and serum amyloid A. Comparable patterns of changes in tetranectin and titin between the control and AMI groups were confirmed using ELISA. In summary, tetranectin and titin in plasma appeared to be closely associated with the onset of AMI among T2DM patients and can be used as potential biomarkers for prediction of a cardiac event, though this requires validation in a prospective cohort study.",

    "abstract": "Alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) is a ligand-gated Ca2+-permeable ion channel implicated in cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders. Activation of α7 nAChR improves learning, memory, and sensory gating in animal models. To identify novel α7 nAChR agonists, we synthesized a series of small molecules and characterized a representative compound, Br-IQ17B, N-[(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2,2,2]oct-3-yl]-5-bromoindolizine-2-carboxamide, which specifically activates α7 nAChR. Two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) recordings were primarily used for screening in Xenopus oocytes expressing human α7 nAChR. Assays, including radioisotope ligand binding, Western blots, whole-cell recordings of hippocampal culture neurons, and spontaneous IPSC recordings of brain slices, were also utilized to evaluate and confirm the specific activation of α7 nAChR by Br-IQ17B. Br-IQ17B potently activates α7 nAChR with an EC50 of 1.8±0.2 μmol/L. Br-IQ17B is selective over other subtypes such as α4β2 and α3β4, but it blocks 5-HT3A receptors. Br-IQ17B displaced binding of the α7 blocker [3H]-MLA to hippocampal crude membranes with a Ki of 14.9±3.2 nmol/L. In hippocampal neurons, Br-IQ17B evoked α7-like currents that were inhibited by MLA and enhanced in the presence of the α7 PAM PNU-120596. In brain slice recordings, Br-IQ17B enhanced GABAergic synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons. Mechanistically, Br-IQ17B increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was MLA-sensitive. We identified the novel, potent, and selective α7 agonist Br-IQ17B, which enhances synaptic transmission. Br-IQ17B may be a helpful tool to understand new aspects of α7 nAChR function, and it also has potential for being developed as therapy for schizophrenia and cognitive deficits.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a devastating autoimmune disorder associated with severe organ damage. The abnormality of T cell apoptosis is considered as an important pathogenetic mechanism of SLE. Norcantharidin (NCTD), a derivative of Cantharidin, is an efficacious anti-cancer drug by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis. Besides, NCTD has also been proved to protect the function of kidneys, while damaged renal function is the most important predictor of morbidity and mortality in SLE. All these suggest the potential effects of NCTD in SLE treatment. In this study we investigated whether NCTD exerted therapeutic effects in a mouse SLE model. Lupus prone female MRL/lpr mice were treated with NCTD (1, 2 mg·kg-1·d-1, ip) for 8 weeks. We showed that NCTD administration significantly decreased mortality rate, diminished the expression of anti-dsDNA IgG antibody, a diagnostic marker for SLE, as well as restored renal structure and function in MRL/lpr mice. Moreover, NCTD administration dose-dependently inhibited lymphoproliferation and T cell accumulation in the spleens of MRL/lpr mice. We further revealed that NCTD specifically inhibited DN T cell proliferation and Th17 cell differentiation both via blocking activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. On the other hand, NCTD did not affect T cell apoptosis in MRL/lpr mice. Taken together, our data suggest that NCTD may be as a promising therapeutic drug through targeting T cells for the treatment of SLE.",

    "abstract": "Neoplastic cells of non-immunogenic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1), an immunosuppressive enzyme. The metabolites of IDO-1 in cancers provide one-carbon units that annihilate effector T cells, and recruit immunosuppressive cells. In this study we investigated how IDO-1 affected the neoplastic cell behaviors in PDACs. Using multiple markers co-labeling method in 45-µm-thick tissue sections, we showed that IDO-1 expression was uniquely increased in the neoplastic cells extruded from ducts' apical or basal domain, but decreased in lymph metastatic cells. IDO-1+ extruding neoplastic cells displayed increased vimentin expression and decreased cytokeratin expression in PDACs, characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, IDO-1 expression was uncorrelated with immunosuppressive infiltrates and clinicopathological characteristics of grim outcome. We replicated basal extrusion with EMT in murine KPIC PDAC organoids by long-term IFN-γ induction; application of IDO-1 inhibitor INCB24360 or 1-MT partially reversed basal extrusion coupled EMT. Ido-1 deletion in KPIC cells deprived its tumorigenicity in immunocompetent mice, decreased cellular proliferation and macropinocytic ability, and increased immunogenicity. KPIC organoids with IFN-γ-induced basal extrusion did not accelerate distant metastasis, whereas inhibition IFN-γ-induced IDO-1 with INB24360 but not 1-MT in KPIC organoids elicited liver metastasis of subcutaneous KPIC organoid tumors, suggesting that lower IDO-1 activity accelerated distant metastasis, whereas IDO-1 was indispensable for tumorigenicity of PDAC cells and supports the survival of extruding cells.",

Electrophysiological evaluation of KCNQ2 mutations has been proved clinically useful in improving outcome prediction and choosing rational anti-seizure medications (ASMs). In this study we described the clinical characteristics, electrophysiological phenotypes and the in vitro response to KCNQ openers of five KCNQ2 pore mutations (V250A, N258Y, H260P, A265T and G290S) from seven patients diagnosed with KCNQ2-DEE. The KCNQ2 variants were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells alone, in combination with KCNQ3 (1:1) or with wild-type KCNQ2 (KCNQ2-WT) and KCNQ3 in a ratio of 1:1:2, respectively. Their expression and electrophysiological function were assessed. When transfected alone or in combination with KCNQ3, none of these mutations affected the membrane expression of KCNQ2, but most failed to induce a potassium current except A265T, in which trace currents were observed when co-transfected with KCNQ3. When co-expressed with KCNQ2-WT and KCNQ3 (1:1:2), the currents at 0 mV of these mutations were decreased by 30%-70% compared to the KCNQ2/3 channel, which could be significantly rescued by applying KCNQ openers including the approved antiepileptic drug retigabine (RTG, 10 μM), as well as two candidates subjected to clinical trials, pynegabine (HN37, 1 μM) and XEN1101 (1 μM). These newly identified pathologic variants enrich the KCNQ2-DEE mutation hotspots in the pore-forming domain. This electrophysiological study provides a rational basis for personalized therapy with KCNQ openers in DEE patients carrying loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in KCNQ2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) contributes to necroptosis. Our previous study showed that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of RIPK1 protects against ischemic stroke-induced astrocyte injury. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying RIPK1-mediated astrocyte injury in vitro and in vivo. Primary cultured astrocytes were transfected with lentiviruses and then subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). In a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), lentiviruses carrying shRNA targeting RIPK1 or shRNA targeting heat shock protein 70.1B (Hsp70.1B) were injected into the lateral ventricles 5 days before pMCAO was established. We showed that RIPK1 knockdown protected against OGD-induced astrocyte damage, blocked the OGD-mediated increase in lysosomal membrane permeability in astrocytes, and inhibited the pMCAO-induced increase in astrocyte lysosome numbers in the ischemic cerebral cortex; these results suggested that RIPK1 contributed to the lysosomal injury in ischemic astrocytes. We revealed that RIPK1 knockdown upregulated the protein levels of Hsp70.1B and increased the colocalization of Lamp1 and Hsp70.1B in ischemic astrocytes. Hsp70.1B knockdown exacerbated pMCAO-induced brain injury, decreased lysosomal membrane integrity and blocked the protective effects of the RIPK1-specific inhibitor necrostatin-1 on lysosomal membranes. On the other hand, RIPK1 knockdown further exacerbated the pMCAO- or OGD-induced decreases in the levels of Hsp90 and the binding of Hsp90 to heat shock transcription factor-1 (Hsf1) in the cytoplasm, and RIPK1 knockdown promoted the nuclear translocation of Hsf1 in ischemic astrocytes, resulting in increased Hsp70.1B mRNA expression. These results suggest that inhibition of RIPK1 protects ischemic astrocytes by stabilizing lysosomal membranes via the upregulation of lysosomal Hsp70.1B; the mechanism underlying these effects involves decreased Hsp90 protein levels, increased Hsf1 nuclear translocation and increased Hsp70.1B mRNA expression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Doxorubicin is a common chemotherapeutic agent in clinic, but myocardial toxicity limits its use. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 10, a multifunctional paracrine growth factor, plays diverse roles in embryonic and postnatal heart development as well as in cardiac regeneration and repair. In this study we investigated the role of FGF10 as a potential modulator of doxorubicin-induced cardiac cytotoxicity and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Fgf10 +/− mice and an inducible dominant negative FGFR2b transgenic mouse model ( Rosa26 rtTA ; tet(O)sFgfr2b ) were used to determine the effect of Fgf10 hypomorph or blocking of endogenous FGFR2b ligands activity on doxorubicin-induced myocardial injury. Acute myocardial injury was induced by a single injection of doxorubicin (25 mg/kg, i.p.). Then cardiac function was evaluated using echocardiography, and DNA damage, oxidative stress and apoptosis in cardiac tissue were assessed. We showed that doxorubicin treatment markedly decreased the expression of FGFR2b ligands including FGF10 in cardiac tissue of wild type mice, whereas Fgf10 +/− mice exhibited a greater degree of oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis as compared with the Fgf10 +/+ control. Pre-treatment with recombinant FGF10 protein significantly attenuated doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis both in doxorubicin-treated mice and in doxorubicin-treated HL-1 cells and NRCMs. We demonstrated that FGF10 protected against doxorubicin-induced myocardial toxicity via activation of FGFR2/Pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 1 (PHLDA1)/Akt axis. Overall, our results unveil a potent protective effect of FGF10 against doxorubicin-induced myocardial injury and identify FGFR2b/PHLDA1/Akt axis as a potential therapeutic target for patients receiving doxorubicin treatment.",

    "abstract": "To discover novel ligands of estrogen receptor (ER) β using pharmacophore mapping and structure-based screening. A computer-aided strategy combining pharmacophore mapping and structure-based screening was used to screen the Maybridge and Enamine databases. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay was used to detect the activity and selectivity of the chosen compounds. The transcriptional activities of the chosen compounds were demonstrated with luciferase reporter assays. The anti-proliferative effects of ER antagonists against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were examined using MTT assay, and the mechanisms of action were analyzed with flow cytometry analysis and Western blotting. Through in silico screen, 95 compounds were chosen for testing in Y2H assay, which led to 20 potent ligands, including 10 agonists, 8 antagonists and 2 partial agonists with EC50 or IC50 values at μmol/L. Furthermore, 6 agonists exhibited absolute selectivity for ERβ, and 3 agonists showed higher selectivity for ERβ. The agonists 1g and 1h (10, 25, and 50 μmol/L) dose-dependently increased ER transcriptional activities, whereas the antagonists 2a and 2d (10, 25, and 50 μmol/L) caused dose-dependent inhibition on the activities. The antagonists and partial agonists at 100 μmol/L suppressed the proliferation of ERα positive MCF-7 cells and ERβ positive MDA-MB-231 cells, but were more effective against MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with antagonists 2a and 2d (25 and 50 μmol/L) dose-dependently increased the population of cells in the S phase. Both 2a and 2d treatment dose-dependently decreased the expression levels of cyclin A and CDK2. Meanwhile, the downregulation of cyclin E was only caused by 2d, while 2a treatment did not cause significant changes in the protein levels of cyclin E. The selective ligands discovered in this study are promising drug candidates to be used as molecular probes to explore the differences between ERα and ERβ.",

    "abstract": "The glucagon subfamily of class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been proposed to be a crucial drug target for the tretmaent of type 2 diabetes. The challenges associated with determining the crystal structures of class B GPCRs relate to their large amino termini and the lack of available small molecule ligands to stabilize the receptor proteins. Following our discovery of non-peptidic agonists for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) that have therapeutic effects, we initiated collaborative efforts in structural biology and recently solved the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the human glucagon receptor (GCGR) 7-transmembrane domain, providing in-depth information about the underlying signaling mechanisms. In this review, some key milestones in this endeavor are highlighted, including discoveries of small molecule ligands, their roles in receptor crystallization, conformational changes in transmembrane domains (TMDs) upon activation and structure-activity relationship analyses.",

DprE1 inhibitors have shown great potentials in the development of new regimens for tuberculosis (TB) treatment. In this study, an integrated molecular modeling strategy, which combined computational bioactivity fingerprints and structure-based virtual screening, was employed to identify potential DprE1 inhibitors. Two lead compounds (B2 and H3) that could inhibit DprE1 and thus kill Mycobacterium smegmatis in vitro were identified. Moreover, compound H3 showed potent inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro (MICMtb = 1.25 μM) and low cytotoxicity against mouse embryo fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells. Our research provided an effective strategy to discover novel anti-TB lead compounds.",

    "abstract": "Myelin damage and abnormal remyelination processes lead to central nervous system dysfunction. Glial activation-induced microenvironment changes are characteristic features of the diseases with myelin abnormalities. We previously showed that ginsenoside Rg1, a main component of ginseng, ameliorated MPTP-mediated myelin damage in mice, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study we investigated the effects of Rg1 and mechanisms in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination mouse model. Mice were treated with CPZ solution (300 mg· kg−1· d−1, ig) for 5 weeks; from week 2, the mice received Rg1 (5, 10, and 20 mg· kg−1· d−1, ig) for 4 weeks. We showed that Rg1 administration dose-dependently alleviated bradykinesia and improved CPZ-disrupted motor coordination ability in CPZ-treated mice. Furthermore, Rg1 administration significantly decreased demyelination and axonal injury in pathological assays. We further revealed that the neuroprotective effects of Rg1 were associated with inhibiting CXCL10-mediated modulation of glial response, which was mediated by NF-κB nuclear translocation and CXCL10 promoter activation. In microglial cell line BV-2, we demonstrated that the effects of Rg1 on pro-inflammatory and migratory phenotypes of microglia were related to CXCL10, while Rg1-induced phagocytosis of microglia was not directly related to CXCL10. In CPZ-induced demyelination mouse model, injection of AAV-CXCL10 shRNA into mouse lateral ventricles 3 weeks prior CPZ treatment occluded the beneficial effects of Rg1 administration in behavioral and pathological assays. In conclusion, CXCL10 mediates the protective role of Rg1 in CPZ-induced demyelination mouse model. This study provides new insight into potential disease-modifying therapies for myelin abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Smad transcription factors are well known for their role at the core of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signalling. However, recent evidence shows that the Smad transcription factors play a vital role downstream of other classes of receptors including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The versatility of Smad transcription factors originated from the two regions that can be differently activated by the TGF-β receptor superfamily or through the recruitment of intracellular kinases stimulated by other receptors classes such as GPCRs. The classic GPCR signalling cascade is further expanded to conditional adoption of the Smad transcription factor under the stimulation of Akt, demonstrating the unique involvement of the Smad transcription factor in GPCR signalling pathways in disease environments. In this review, we provide a summary of the signalling pathways of the Smad transcription factors as an important downstream mediator of GPCRs, presenting exciting opportunities for discovering new therapeutic targets for diseases.",

Two approaches have been adopted: GLP-1 receptor agonists that mimic the effects of native GLP-1 and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors that increase endogenous GLP-1 levels. During the past two decades, search for orally active, non-peptidic GLP-1 receptor agonists has been the focal point of research and development activities in many multinational pharmaceutical companies. Such efforts have not resulted in any success thus far. Serendipitous discovery of substituted cyclobutanes represented by Boc5 as a new class of GLP-1 receptor agonists led us to believe that a small molecule approach to class B G-protein coupled receptor agonism is no longer a fantasy but a reality. However, major obstacles still pose great challenges, and the reasons of which are discussed in this perspectives.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of disease-causing proteins is a common hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders. Measuring the degradation of such proteins using high-throughput-compatible assays is highly desired for the identification of genetic and chemical modulators of degradation. For example, Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by the cytotoxicity of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). The high-throughput measurement of mHTT degradation is important in HD drug discovery and research. Existing methods for such purposes have limitations due to their dependence on protein tags or pan protein synthesis inhibitors. Here, we report a high-throughput-compatible pulse-chase method (CH-chase) for the measurement of endogenous tag-free huntingtin protein (HTT) degradation based on Click chemistry and Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) technologies. The pulsed-labeled proteins were conjugated with biotin using the click reaction strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC), and the chase signals were calculated by measuring the reduction percentage of the HTT HTRF signals after pull-down with streptavidin beads. We validated that the signals were within the linear detection range and were HTT-specific. We successfully measured the degradation of endogenous HTT in a high-throughput-compatible format using 96-well plates. The predicted changes of HTT degradation by known modifiers were observed, which confirmed that the assay is suitable for the identification of HTT degradation modifiers. We have established the first high-throughput-compatible assay capable of measuring endogenous, tag-free HTT degradation, providing a valuable tool for HD research and drug discovery. The method could be applied to other proteins and can facilitate research on other neurodegenerative disorders and proteinopathies.",

Here, we investigated the effects of DI on human gastric carcinoma cell lines in vitro and elucidated its anti-cancer mechanisms. Human gastric carcinoma AGS and HGC-27 cell lines were treated with DI, and cell viability was detected with MTT assay. Cell cycle stages, apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured using flow cytometry. Protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. Tubulin polymerization assays and immunofluorescence were used to characterize the tubulin polymerization process. DI inhibited the cell viability of AGS and HGC-27 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with IC50 values of 12.0 and 28.8 μmol/L, respectively, at 24 h of treatment. Treatment with DI (10–100 μmol/L) dose-dependently promoted tubulin polymerization, and induced significant G2/M cell cycle arrest in AGS and HGC-27 cells. Moreover, DI treatment disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in AGS and HGC-27 cells. DI induces G2/M-phase arrest by disrupting tubulin polymerization in human gastric cancer cells, which highlights its potent anti-cancer activity and potential application in gastric cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Selective nuclear export inhibitor selinexor (SEL) represents a promising therapeutic strategy for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). But its mechanisms of action as well as factors that influence therapeutic responses have not been fully characterized yet. In this study we employed catTFRE proteomics technique to profile changes in nuclear abundance of activated transcription factors (TFs)/co-factors (TCs) in myeloma cells following SEL treatment. We found that pharmacological inhibition of exportin-1 (XPO1) by SEL leads to a significant nuclear accumulation of Lipin1 in NCI-H929 cells. Nuclear-localized Lipin1 acted as a transcriptional cofactor that suppressed the transcriptional activity of SREBPs. By performing subcellular localization analysis, molecular docking, co-immunoprecipitation and other assays, we demonstrated that Lipin1 was subjected to XPO1-dependent nuclear export. We demonstrated that SEL downregulated the expression of key lipogenesis-related genes regulated by SREBPs including FASN, SCD, DHCR24 and FDPS, leading to reduced fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in MM cell lines and primary CD138 + cells. Using shRNA-mediated knockdown assays, we elucidated the critical role of Lipin1 in mediating the inhibitory effects of SEL on the SREBPs pathway and its contribution to SEL sensitivity both in vitro and in murine xenograft models. In conclusion, we reveal a novel mechanism by which SEL downregulates cellular lipid biosynthesis, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of myeloma cells. This study highlights the critical role of Lipin1 in the anti-myeloma effects of SEL, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from SEL-based therapies.",

But the underlying biological mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this study we generated a rat model with a truncated Satb1 protein. We showed that Satb1 mutant caused growth retardation, microcephaly, altered ultrasonic vocalization and delayed neurobehavioral development in mutant pups as well as social and cognitive behavior deficits in adult mutants, mimicking the typical clinical characteristics of SATB1 -associated NDDs. Injection of a GABAergic enhancer clonazepam (0.04 mg/kg, i.p.) effectively alleviated the abnormal social and cognitive behaviors in Satb1 mutant rats. Finally, RNA sequencing analysis further revealed a potential role of Satb1 in a cortical transcriptional regulatory network associated with NDDs including ID and ASD. Our results confirm the crucial roles of SATB1 in the pathogenesis of NDDs and provide insights into treatment strategies for SATB1 -associated NDDs.",

While existing structural Ab databases provide valuable insights, they still face limitations in data accuracy, completeness, and/or update frequency. Here, we present SAAINT-parser, a computational workflow for rapid, accurate, and robust extraction of Ab and AAI information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). SAAINT-parser features precise detection of Ab chains, accurate pairing of Ab chains, and reliable identification of AAIs. The resulting SAAINT-DB, last updated on May 1, 2025, contains 19,128 data entries from 9757 PDB structures, offering a comprehensive and up-to-date resource. Detailed analyses highlight the advantages of SAAINT-DB over the widely used SAbDab in terms of data accuracy and completeness. Furthermore, SAAINT-DB provides nearly twice as many non-redundant, manually curated Ab-Ag binding affinity entries as SAbDab. To support Ab-related research and benefit the broader scientific community, we provide open access to SAAINT-parser, the SAAINT-DB summary file, unprocessed PDB structures, and SAAINT-parser-processed structure models at https://github.com/tommyhuangthu/SAAINT .",

Our experiments were designed to determine the role, if any, of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins in relaxations attributed to endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). Pig coronary arterial rings with endothelia were suspended in organ chambers filled with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution maintained at 37 °C and continuously aerated with 95%O2 and 5% CO2. Isometric tension was measured during contractions to prostaglandin F2α in the presence of indomethacin and Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Thrombin, the thrombin receptor-activating peptide SFLLRN, bradykinin, substance P, and calcimycin produced dose-dependent relaxations. These relaxations were not inhibited by prior incubation with pertussis toxin, but were abolished upon the addition of charybdotoxin plus apamin. Relaxations to the α2-adrenergic agonist UK14304 and those to serotonin were abolished in the presence of indomethacin and L-NAME. Unlike nitric oxide-mediated relaxations, EDHF-mediated relaxations of pig coronary arteries do not involve pertussis toxin-sensitive pathways and are Gi/o protein independent.",

    "abstract": "Tumorigenesis is the process by which normal cells evolve the capacity to evade and overcome the constraints usually placed upon their growth and survival. To ensure the integrity of organs and tissues, the balance of cell proliferation and cell death is tightly maintained. The proteins controlling this balance are either considered oncogenes, which promote tumorigenesis, or tumor suppressors, which prevent tumorigenesis. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE) is a family of GTP-binding proteins that possess anti-apoptotic functions and play an important role in the central nervous system. Notably, accumulating evidence suggests that PIKE is a proto-oncogene involved in tumor progression. The PIKE gene (CENTG1) is amplified in a variety of human cancers, leading to the resistance against apoptosis and the enhancement of invasion. In this review, we will summarize the functions of PIKE proteins in tumorigenesis and discuss their potential implications in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have been intensively studied for their roles and potential as drug targets in T-cell lymphomas and other hematologic malignancies. Bisthianostat is a novel bisthiazole-based pan-HDACi evolved from natural HDACi largazole. Here, we report the preclinical study of bisthianostat alone and in combination with bortezomib in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), as well as preliminary first-in-human findings from an ongoing phase 1a study. Bisthianostat dose dependently induced acetylation of tubulin and H3 and increased PARP cleavage and apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells. In RPMI-8226 and MM.1S cell xenograft mouse models, oral administration of bisthianostat (50, 75, 100 mg·kg-1·d-1, bid) for 18 days dose dependently inhibited tumor growth. Furthermore, bisthianostat in combination with bortezomib displayed synergistic antitumor effect against RPMI-8226 and MM.1S cell in vitro and in vivo. Preclinical pharmacokinetic study showed bisthianostat was quickly absorbed with moderate oral bioavailability (F% = 16.9%-35.5%). Bisthianostat tended to distribute in blood with Vss value of 0.31 L/kg. This distribution parameter might be beneficial to treat hematologic neoplasms such as MM with few side effects. In an ongoing phase 1a study, bisthianostat treatment was well tolerated and no grade 3/4 nonhematological adverse events (AEs) had occurred together with good pharmacokinetics profiles in eight patients with relapsed or refractory MM (R/R MM). The overall single-agent efficacy was modest, stable disease (SD) was identified in four (50%) patients at the end of first dosing cycle (day 28). These preliminary in-patient results suggest that bisthianostat is a promising HDACi drug with a comparable safety window in R/R MM, supporting for its further phase 1b clinical trial in combination with traditional MM therapies.",

    "abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the major causes of drug-induced acute liver injury, and ethanol may aggravate APAP-induced liver injury. The problem of ethanol- and APAP-induced liver injury becomes increasingly prominent, but the mechanism of ethanol- and APAP-induced liver injury remains ambiguous. p38γ is one of the four isoforms of P38 mitogen activated protein kinases, that contributes to inflammation in different diseases. In this study we investigated the role of p38γ in ethanol- and APAP-induced liver injury. Liver injury was induced in male C57BL/6 J mice by giving liquid diet containing 5% ethanol (v/v) for 10 days, followed by gavage of ethanol (25% (v/v), 6 g/kg) once or injecting APAP (200 mg/kg, ip), or combined the both treatments. We showed that ethanol significantly aggravated APAP-induced liver injury in C57BL/6 J mice. Moreover, the expression level of p38γ was up-regulated in the liver of ethanol-, APAP- and ethanol+APAP-treated mice. Knockdown of p38γ markedly attenuated liver injury, inflammation, and steatosis in ethanol+APAP-treated mice. Liver sections of p38γ-knockdown mice displayed lower levels of Oil Red O stained dots and small leaky shapes. AML-12 cells were exposed to APAP (5 mM), ethanol (100 mM) or combined treatments. We showed that P38γ was markedly increased in ethanol+APAP-treated AML-12 cells, whereas knockdown of p38γ significantly inhibited inflammation, lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in ethanol+APAP-treated AML-12 cells. Furthermore, we revealed that p38γ could combine with Dlg1, a member of membrane-associated guanylate kinase family. Deletion of p38γ up-regulated the expression level of Dlg1 in ethanol+APAP-treated AML-12 cells. In summary, our results suggest that p38γ functions as an important regulator in ethanol- and APAP-induced liver injury through modulation of Dlg1.",

    "abstract": "Cln Three Requiring 9 (CTR9), a scaffold protein of the polymerase-associated factor-1 (PAF1) complex (PAF1c), is primarily localized in the nucleus of cells. Recent studies show that CTR9 plays essential roles in the development of various human cancers and their occurrence; however, its regulatory roles and precise mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of CTR9 using in vitro assays and a xenograft mouse model. We found that CTR9 protein is upregulated in tumor tissues from HCC patients. Knockdown of CTR9 substantially reduced HCC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, whereas its overexpression promoted these activities. In addition, in vitro results revealed that CTR9 silencing dramatically increased cell cycle regulators, p21 and p27, but markedly decreased matrix metalloproteinases, MMP2 and MMP9, with these outcomes reversed upon CTR9 overexpression. Furthermore, the underlying molecular mechanism suggests that CTR9 promoted the oncogene paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) transcription via its promoter region. Finally, the oncogenic roles of CTR9 were confirmed in a xenograft mouse model. This study confirms that CTR9, an oncoprotein that promotes HCC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, increases tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. CTR9 could be a novel therapeutic target. Further investigation is warranted to verify CTR9 potential in novel therapies for HCC.",

Many bile-acid-activated signaling pathways have become attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic disorders. In this study we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of BA in the intestine. We showed that the BA levels in the gallbladder and faeces were significantly increased, whereas serum BA levels decreased in systemic Krüppel-like factor 9 (Klf9) deficiency (Klf9-/-) mice. These phenotypes were also observed in the intestine-specific Klf9-deleted (Klf9vil-/-) mice. In contrast, BA levels in the gallbladder and faeces were reduced, whereas BA levels in the serum were increased in intestinal Klf9 transgenic (Klf9Rosa26+/+) mice. By using a combination of biochemical, molecular and functional assays, we revealed that Klf9 promoted the expression of apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt) in the terminal ileum to enhance BA absorption in the intestine. Reabsorbed BA affected liver BA synthetic enzymes by regulating Fgf15 expression. This study has identified a previously neglected transcriptional pathway that regulates BA homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway is a key mediator of the innate immune response and plays a crucial role in antitumor immunity. The expression of cGAS and STING is often suppressed in tumor cells, and reduced expression is associated with poor prognosis and inferior response to immunotherapy. In this study we systematically investigated the expression pattern of cGAS-STING pathway in tumors and its correlation with immunotherapy response. We showed that the expression of cGAS and STING was significantly decreased or undetectable in most breast cancer and murine tumor cell lines, while high cGAS and STING expression was associated with increased T cell infiltration, elevated PD-L1 and PD-1 levels, improved immunotherapy response and prolonged survival. In cGAS-STING-deficient MDA-MB-453 cells, DNMT inhibitor decitabine (DAC, 0.05-1 μM) dose-dependently restored the impaired pathway by reversing DNA methylation-mediated silencing. Furthermore, DAC combined with a chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin significantly enhanced the antitumor effect in MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231 cells by activating the cGAS-STING pathway through cytoplasmic DNA accumulation. In addition, DNMT inhibition elevated intracellular dsRNA levels and activated the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS pathway. These results suggest that DNMT inhibitors can epigenetically reprogram the cGAS-STING pathway, activate the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS pathway, and in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, synergistically promote antitumor immunity. Together, this study identifies cGAS-STING as a potential predictor of immunotherapy response and highlights a novel therapeutic strategy for restoring innate immune function in cancer. Loss of cGAS-STING signaling in tumors impairs antitumor immunity and correlates with poor immunotherapy response. DNMT inhibition restores cGAS-STING pathway and concurrently activates the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS signaling, synergistically enhancing immune infiltration and antitumor efficacy.",

Two geometrical methods, Method 1 and Method 2, were used to develop the 3D-QSAR models. The most active ligand was used as the template for the alignment of all the ligands in Method 1, and a conformer of the cocrystal ligand was used as the template for the alignment of all the ligands in Method 2. The models suggest that highly active ligands can be designed by varying the R1 substituent at position 7 of the quinazoline ring with positively charged, bulky, hydrophobic groups, while bulky and hydrophobic groups around the thiazole ring are desirable for higher activity. This study emphasizes that the bioactive conformer is rather different from the minima. The steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic field effects contribute to its inhibitory activity.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are essential organelles that provide energy for mammalian cells and participate in multiple functions, such as signal transduction, cellular differentiation, and regulation of apoptosis. Compared with the mitochondria in somatic cells, oocyte mitochondria have an additional level of importance since they are required for germ cell maturation, dysfunction in which can lead to severe inherited disorders. Thus, a systematic proteomic profile of oocyte mitochondria is urgently needed to support the basic and clinical research, but the acquisition of such a profile has been hindered by the rarity of oocyte samples and technical challenges associated with capturing mitochondrial proteins from live oocytes. Here, in this work, using proximity labeling proteomics, we established a mitochondria-specific ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) reaction in live GV-stage mouse oocytes and identified a total of 158 proteins in oocyte mitochondria. This proteome includes intrinsic mitochondrial structural and functional components involved in processes associated with \"cellular respiration\", \"ATP metabolism\", \"mitochondrial transport\", etc. In addition, mitochondrial proteome capture after oocyte exposure to the antitumor chemotherapeutic cisplatin revealed differential changes in the abundance of several oocyte-specific mitochondrial proteins. Our study provides the first description of a mammalian oocyte mitochondrial proteome of which we are aware, and further illustrates the dynamic shifts in protein abundance associated with chemotherapeutic agents.",

However, antibody fragments should be converted to IgG for biological characterizations and affinity of antibodies obtained from phage display library is frequently not sufficient for efficient use in clinical settings. Here, we describe a new approach that combines phage and mammalian cell display, enabling simultaneous affinity screening of full-length IgG antibodies. Using this strategy, we successfully obtained a novel germline-like anti-TIM-3 monoclonal antibody named m101, which was revealed to be a potent anti-TIM-3 therapeutic monoclonal antibody via in vitro and in vivo experiments, indicating its effectiveness and power. Thus, this platform can help develop new monoclonal antibody therapeutics with high affinity and low immunogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Baicalin (BA), a natural component found in many traditional Chinese medicines, exerts protective effects against several viruses. Although our previous studies have revealed that the anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBV) activity of BA depends on hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) signaling, the specific mechanisms remain unclear. The present study explored the potential signaling mechanisms involved in BA-mediated HBV suppression. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that BA significantly modulates the estrogen receptor (ER) and AMPK signaling pathways in HepG2 cells. The ER alpha (ERα) binding affinity of BA and its estrogen-like agonist activity were subsequently verified through molecular docking assays, BA-ERα affinity detection experiments, ERα luciferase reporter gene assays, and qRT-PCR. ERα knockdown (shRNA) and AMPK inhibition (Compound C and doxorubicin [Dox]) experiments revealed that the sequential activation of the ERα-LKB1-AMPK-HNF signaling axis is essential for the anti-HBV effects of BA. This study indicates that BA may trigger the ERα-AMPKα-HNF pathway to inhibit HBV replication, providing insights into its potential protective mechanisms against other viruses.",

    "abstract": "Promoting adult neurogenesis in the enteric nervous system (ENS) may be a potential therapeutic approach to cure enteric neuropathies. Enteric glial cells (EGCs) are the most abundant glial cells in the ENS. Accumulating evidence suggests that EGCs can be a complementary source to supply new neurons during adult neurogenesis in the ENS. In the brain, astrocytes have been intensively studied for their neuronal conversion properties, and small molecules have been successfully used to induce the astrocyte-to-neuron transition. However, research on glia-to-neuron conversion in the ENS is still lacking. In this study, we used GFAP-Cre:Rosa-tdTomato mice to trace glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation in the ENS in vivo and in vitro. We showed that GFAP promoter-driven tdTomato exclusively labelled EGCs and was a suitable marker to trace EGCs and their progeny cells in the ENS of adult mice. Interestingly, we discovered that RepSox or other ALK5 inhibitors alone induced efficient transdifferentiation of EGCs into neurons in vitro. Knockdown of ALK5 further confirmed that the TGFβR-1/ALK5 signalling pathway played an essential role in the transition of EGCs to neurons. RepSox-induced neurons were Calbindin- and nNOS-positive and displayed typical neuronal electrophysiological properties. Finally, we showed that administration of RepSox (3, 10 mg· kg-1 ·d-1, i.g.) for 2 weeks significantly promoted the conversion of EGCs to neurons in the ENS and influenced gastrointestinal motility in adult mice. This study provides a method for efficiently converting adult mouse EGCs into neurons by small-molecule compounds, which might be a promising therapeutic strategy for gastrointestinal neuropathy.",

    "abstract": "To design and synthesize a series of novel amino acid-binding 1,5-diarylpyrazole derivatives, which are intended to act as prodrugs with better aqueous solubility than celecoxib, and which will exert potent anti-inflammatory activities after being converted to their parent compounds in vivo.To introduce an amino acid, celecoxib analogs containing amino or methylamino group were synthesized first through multi-step chemical reactions. All the synthesized compounds were screened in an intact cell-based assay in vitro and in carrageenan-induced mouse paw edema in vivo. Some active compounds were selected for further evaluation in a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model. The preliminary pharmacokinetics experiments were conducted using high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS).Celecoxib, 6 of the 1,5-diarylpyrazole class of celecoxib analogs, and their amino acid derivatives (hydrochloride salts) were synthesized. In vitro screening, the hydrochloride salts showed decreased inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 compared with their parent compounds, but some exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity in vivo. Compound 4a was selected for further evaluation, and its anti-inflammatory effect was equivalent to that of celecoxib after oral administration in the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model. At three doses (25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg) the percentage inhibition on edema was 20.7%, 52.6%, and 62.6% (for compound 4a) and 27.8%, 38.4%, and 40.1% (for celecoxib), respectively. Preliminary pharmacokinetic evaluations support the hypothesis that compound 4a was actually converted to its parent compound, compound 4.The compound bound with amino acid acts like prodrug, which can exert anti-inflammatory effect similar to celecoxib after being converted to its parent compound. This finding will be of great benefit in carrying out structural modifications of prodrug-like selective COX-2 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the possible synergism of hydrochlorothiazide and nitrendipine on reducing both blood pressure (BP) and blood pressure variability (BPV) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).Seventy animals were randomly divided into seven groups. The doses were 5 and 10 mg/kg for nitrendipine, 10 and 20 mg/kg for hydrochlorothiazide and 10 + 5, 20 + 10 mg/kg, respectively, for the combination of these two drugs and 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose as control. The drugs were given via a catheter of gastric fistula. BP was then continuously recorded for 5 h from 1 h before drug administration to the end of 4th hour after drug administration, in conscious and freely moving rats.The effects on both BP and BPV reduction of the combination of hydrochlorothiazide and nitrendipine were greater than the single drug in SHR. The two drugs possessed an obvious synergism on both systolic blood pressure (q = 1.79 with small dose and q = 1.23 with large dose) and systolic blood pressure variability reduction (q = 1.79 with small dose and q = 1.39 with large dose) in SHR.The present work clearly demonstrated that there was a synergistic effect between hydrochlorothiazide and nitrendipine in lowering and stabilizing BP in SHR.",

    "abstract": "Most drugs acting on the cell surface receptors are membrane permeable and thus able to engage their target proteins in different subcellular compartments. However, these drugs' effects on cell surface receptors have historically been studied on the plasma membrane alone. Increasing evidence suggests that small molecules may also modulate their targeted receptors through membrane trafficking or organelle-localized signaling inside the cell. These additional modes of interaction have been reported for functionally diverse ligands of GPCRs, ion channels, and transporters. Such intracellular drug-target engagements affect cell surface expression. Concurrent intracellular and cell surface signaling may also increase the complexity and therapeutic opportunities of small molecule modulation. Here we discuss examples of ligand-receptor interactions that are present in both intra- and extracellular sites, and the potential therapeutic opportunities presented by this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence shows that mRNAs exert regulatory function along with coding proteins. Recently we report that a hairpin within YAP mRNA 3'UTR can modulate the Hippo signaling pathway. PTEN is a tumor suppressor, and is mutated in human cancers. In this study we examined whether PTEN mRNA 3'UTR contained a hairpin structure that could regulate gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level.The secondary structure of PTEN mRNA 3'UTR was analyzed using RNAdraw and RNAstructure. Function of hairpin structure derived from the PTEN mRNA 3'UTR was examined using luciferase reporter assay, RT-PCR and Western blotting. RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay was used to analyze the interaction between PTEN mRNA and microprocessor Drosha and DGCR8. Endogenous siRNA (esiRNA) derived from PTEN mRNA 3'UTR was identified by RT-PCR and rt-PCR, and its target genes were predicted using RNAhybrid.A bioinformatics analysis revealed that PTEN mRNA contained a hairpin structure (termed PTEN-sh) within 3'UTR, which markedly increased the reporter activities of AP-1 and NF-κB in 293T cells. Moreover, treatment with PTEN-sh (1 and 2 μg) dose-dependently inhibited the expression of PTEN in human liver L-O2 cells. RIP assay demonstrated that the microprocessor Drosha and DGCR8 was bound to PTEN-sh in L-O2 cells, leading to the cleavage of PTEN-sh from PTEN mRNA 3'UTR. In addition, microprocessor Dicer was involved in the processing of PTEN-sh. Interestingly, esiRNA (termed PTEN-sh-3p21) cleaved from PTEN-sh was identified in 293T cells and human liver tissues, which was found to target the mRNA 3'UTRs of protein phosphatase PPP2CA and PTEN in L-O2 cells. Treatment of L-O2 or Chang liver cells with PTEN-sh-3p21 (50, 100 nmol/L) promoted the cell proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manners.The endogenous siRNA (PTEN-sh-3p21) cleaved from PTEN-sh within PTEN mRNA 3'UTR modulates PPP2CA and PTEN at the post-transcriptional level in liver cells.",

    "abstract": "Treatment with aprotinin, a broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor with a molecular weight of 6512 Da, was associated with acute kidney injury, which was one of the reasons for withdrawal from the market in 2007. Inhibition of renal serine proteases regulating the epithelial sodium channel ENaC could be a possible mechanism. Herein, we studied the effect of aprotinin in wild-type 129S1/SvImJ mice on sodium handling, tubular function, and integrity under a control and low-salt diet. Mice were studied in metabolic cages, and aprotinin was delivered by subcutaneously implanted sustained release pellets (2 mg/day over 10 days). Mean urinary aprotinin concentration ranged between 642 ± 135 (day 2) and 127 ± 16 (day 8) µg/mL . Aprotinin caused impaired sodium preservation under a low-salt diet while stimulating excessive hyperaldosteronism and unexpectedly, proteolytic activation of ENaC. Aprotinin inhibited proximal tubular function leading to glucosuria and proteinuria. Plasma urea and cystatin C concentration increased significantly under aprotinin treatment. Kidney tissues from aprotinin-treated mice showed accumulation of intracellular aprotinin and expression of the kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1). In electron microscopy, electron-dense deposits were observed. There was no evidence for kidney injury in mice treated with a lower aprotinin dose (0.5 mg/day). In conclusion, high doses of aprotinin exert nephrotoxic effects by accumulation in the tubular system of healthy mice, leading to inhibition of proximal tubular function and counterregulatory stimulation of ENaC-mediated sodium transport.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid mediator that has been found to ameliorate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric injury by acting on lysophosphatidic acid type 2 receptor (LPAR2). In this study, we investigated whether LPAR2 signaling was implicated in the development of NSAID-induced small intestinal injury (enteropathy), another major complication of NSAID use. Wild-type (WT) and Lpar2 deficient ( Lpar2 −/− ) mice were treated with a single, large dose (20 or 30 mg/kg, i.g.) of indomethacin (IND). The mice were euthanized at 6 or 24 h after IND treatment. We showed that IND-induced mucosal enteropathy and neutrophil recruitment occurred much earlier (at 6 h after IND treatment) in Lpar2 −/− mice compared to WT mice, but the tissue levels of inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, TNF-α, inducible COX-2, CAMP) remained at much lower levels. Administration of a selective LPAR2 agonist DBIBB (1, 10 mg/kg, i.g., twice at 24 h and 30 min before IND treatment) dose-dependently reduced mucosal injury and neutrophil activation in enteropathy, but it also enhanced IND-induced elevation of several proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. By assessing caspase-3 activation, we found significantly increased intestinal apoptosis in IND-treated Lpar2 −/− mice, but it was attenuated after DBIBB administration, especially in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice. Finally, we showed that IND treatment reduced the plasma activity and expression of autotaxin (ATX), the main LPA-producing enzyme, and also reduced the intestinal expression of Lpar2 mRNA, which preceded the development of mucosal damage. We conclude that LPAR2 has a dual role in NSAID enteropathy, as it contributes to the maintenance of mucosal integrity after NSAID exposure, but also orchestrates the inflammatory responses associated with ulceration. Our study suggests that IND-induced inhibition of the ATX-LPAR2 axis is an early event in the pathogenesis of enteropathy.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the antiviral effects of vectors expressing specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection in vitro and in vivo.Based on the effects of 4 shRNAs targeting different regions of HTNV genomic RNA on viral replication, the most effective RNA interference fragments of the S and M genes were constructed in pSilencer-3.0-H1 vectors, and designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M, respectively. The antiviral effect of pSilencer-S/M against HTNV was evaluated in both HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells and mice.In HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells, pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M targeted the viral nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins, respectively, as revealed in the immunofluorescence assay. Transfection with pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (1, 2, 4 μg) markedly inhibited the viral antigen expression in dose- and time-dependent manners. Transfection with either plasmid (2 μg) significantly decreased HTNV-RNA level at 3 day postinfectin (dpi) and the progeny virus titer at 5 dpi. In mice infected with lethal doses of HTNV, intraperitoneal injection of pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (30 μg) considerably increased the survival rates and mean time to death, and significantly reduced the mean virus yields and viral RNA level, and alleviated virus-induced pathological lesions in lungs, brains and kidneys.Plasmid-based shRNAs potently inhibit HTNV replication in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide a basis for development of shRNA as therapeutics for HTNV infections in humans.",

    "abstract": "To identify novel small compound inhibitor of p53 protein. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were tested. Cell proliferation rate was determined using a Cell Proliferation Kit. The mRNA and protein levels of p53-related genes were measured using real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Global response in the p53 signaling network was analyzed using Illumina whole-genome expression BeadChips. Treatment of MEF cells with a small molecule 1,4-bis-[4-(3-phenoxy-propoxy)-but-2-ynyl]-piperazine (G5) at 10 μmol/L for 24 h markedly reduced the mRNA and protein levels of the p53 downstream genes MDM2 and p21. In G5-treated ES cells, a total of 372 differentially expressed genes were identified, and 18 among them were direct downstream genes of p53; 6 out of 9 p53-repressed genes were upregulated, and 5 out of 9 p53-activated genes were downregulated. In both MEF cells and ES cells, treatment of with G5 (10 μmol/L) up to 48 h neither affected the proliferation rate nor caused morphological alterations. G5 inhibits p53 activity and simultaneously preserves the normal growth and proliferation of cells, therefore is a new compound for studies of p53-mediated cell manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) is expressed mainly in liver and intestine, but most abundantly in intestine. It hydrolyzes carboxylester, thioester, and amide bonds in many exogenous and endogenous compounds, including lipids. CES2 therefore not only plays an important role in the metabolism of many (pro-)drugs, toxins and pesticides, directly influencing pharmacology and toxicology in humans, but it is also involved in energy homeostasis, affecting lipid and glucose metabolism. In this study we investigated the pharmacological and physiological functions of CES2. We constructed Ces2 cluster knockout mice lacking all eight Ces2 genes ( Ces2 –/– strain) as well as humanized hepatic or intestinal CES2 transgenic strains in this Ces2 –/– background. We showed that oral availability and tissue disposition of capecitabine were drastically increased in Ces2 –/– mice, and tissue-specifically decreased by intestinal and hepatic human CES2 (hCES2) activity. The metabolism of the chemotherapeutic agent vinorelbine was strongly reduced in Ces2 –/– mice, but only marginally rescued by hCES2 expression. On the other hand, Ces2 –/– mice exhibited fatty liver, adipositis, hypercholesterolemia and diminished glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, but without body mass changes. Paradoxically, hepatic hCES2 expression rescued these metabolic phenotypes but increased liver size, adipose tissue mass and overall body weight, suggesting a “healthy” obesity phenotype. In contrast, intestinal hCES2 expression efficiently rescued all phenotypes, and even improved some parameters, including body weight, relative to the wild-type baseline values. Our results suggest that the induction of intestinal hCES2 may combat most, if not all, of the adverse effects of metabolic syndrome. These CES2 mouse models will provide powerful preclinical tools to enhance drug development, increase physiological insights, and explore potential solutions for metabolic syndrome-associated disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system plays an important role in regulating brain function, and its neuronal loss has been well-documented in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The LC-NE neurodegeneration is believed to underlie various nonmotor symptoms in people with PD, including neuropsychiatric deficits, sleep disruptions, and cognitive impairments. Of particular interest, LC-NE neurons send intensive axonal projections to the motor regions of the cerebral cortex. However, how NE depletion in the motor cortex contributes to PD pathophysiology remains poorly understood. In addition, recent studies provided increasing mechanistic insights into secondary changes in the cerebral cortex as LC-NE degenerates, which might involve its interaction with dopaminergic signaling during the chronic course of the disease. In the present article, we briefly discuss clinical and preclinical studies that support the critical roles of LC-NE neurodegeneration and motor cortical dysfunction in both motor and nonmotor deficits in Parkinsonian states. We focus our discussion on the potential impact of LC-NE neurodegeneration on motor cortical function and the subsequent symptom manifestation. Last, we propose future research directions that can advance our understanding of cortical pathophysiology in PD by integrating noradrenergic degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Astrocytes are multifunctional brain cells responsible for maintaining the health and function of the central nervous system. Accumulating evidence suggests that astrocytes might be complementary source across different brain regions to supply new neurons during adult neurogenesis. In this study, we found that neonatal mouse cortical astrocytes can be directly converted into neurons when exposed to neurogenic differentiation culture conditions, with insulin being the most critical component. Detailed comparison studies between mouse cortical astrocytes and neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) demonstrated the converted neuronal cells originate indeed from the astrocytes rather than NPCs. The neurons derived from mouse cortical astrocytes display typical neuronal morphologies, express neuronal markers and possess typical neuronal electrophysiological properties. More importantly, these neurons can survive and mature in the mouse brain in vivo. Finally, by comparing astrocytes from different brain regions, we found that only cortical astrocytes but not astrocytes from other brain regions such as hippocampus and cerebellum can be converted into neurons under the current condition. Altogether, our findings suggest that neonatal astrocytes from certain brain regions possess intrinsic potential to differentiate/transdifferentiate into neurons which may have clinical relevance in the future.",

    "abstract": "To screen human interferon (IFN)-alpha2b antagonist peptides from a phage displayed heptapeptide library.WISH cells and polyclonal anti-IFN-alpha2b antibodies were used to select IFN receptor-binding peptides from a phage displayed heptapeptide library. The specific binding of phage clones was examined by phage ELISA and immunohistochemistry. The specific binding activities of synthetic peptides to WISH cells were detected by competition assay. Effects of synthetic peptides to IFN-induced antiviral activity were analyzed by evaluating the cytopathic effect (CPE) using the MTT method.Twenty-three positive clones were obtained after seven rounds of selection. Ten clones were randomly picked from the positive clones and were sequenced. The corresponding amino acid sequences suggested 3 groups homologous to the 3 domains of IFN-alpha2b, defined by residues 24-41, 43-49, and 148-158 of IFN-alpha2b. As they presented as corresponding to IFN receptor-binding domains, AB loop and E helix, clone No 26 and 35 were chosen for further characterization and shown to bind to WISH cells. Two peptides corresponding to clone No 26 and 35, designated SP-7(SLSPGLP) and FY-7(FSAPVRY) were shown to compete with GFP-IFN-alpha2b for binding to its receptor and to inhibit the IFN-alpha2b-induced antiviral activity.Both IFN-alpha2b antagonist peptides, SP-7 and FY-7, were able to inhibit the IFN-induced antiviral activity, and could be helpful in laying the foundation for the molecular mechanism of the interaction between IFN and its receptor.",

    "abstract": "Survival is one of the most important endpoints in cancer therapy, and parametric survival analysis could comprehensively reveal the overall result of disease progression, drug efficacy, toxicity as well as their interactions. In this study we investigated the efficacy and toxicity of dexamethasone (DEX) combined with gemcitabine (GEM) in pancreatic cancer xenograft. Nude mice bearing SW1990 pancreatic cancer cells derived tumor were treated with DEX (4 mg/kg, i.g.) and GEM (15 mg/kg, i.v.) alone or in combination repeatedly (QD, Q3D, Q7D) until the death of animal or the end of study. Tumor volumes and net body weight (NBW) were assessed every other day. Taking NBW as a systemic safety indicator, an integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model was developed to quantitatively describe the impact of tumor size and systemic safety on animal survival. The PK/PD models with time course data for tumor size and NBW were established, respectively, in a sequential manner; a parametric time-to-event (TTE) model was also developed based on the longitudinal PK/PD models to describe the survival results of the SW1990 tumor-bearing mice. These models were evaluated and externally validated. Only the mice with good tumor growth inhibition and relatively stable NBW had an improved survival result after DEX and GEM combination therapy, and the simulations based on the parametric TTE model showed that NBW played more important role in animals' survival compared with tumor size. The established model in this study demonstrates that tumor size was not always the most important reason for cancer-related death, and parametric survival analysis together with safety issues was also important in the evaluation of oncology therapies in preclinical studies.",

    "abstract": "With the current advances in the field of cancer research particularly in cancer chemoprevention, we have much to celebrate but we also have a lot of challenges before us. Some of the challenges include finding appropriate animal models for predicting efficacy of chemopreventive compounds for human cancers, of which are usually highly complex and involved multiple genes in nature and translating our basic research into clinical practice. One of the other challenges will be to disseminate our ideas into the larger biomedical and pharmaceutical community. With this in mind, I have been asked by the Editorial Team of Acta Pharmacologica Sinica to organize a special issue to discuss the current advances in cancer chemoprevention from prevention to treatment. The distinction and the potential overlapping nature of cancer chemoprevention versus chemotherapeutic treatment has become somewhat blurred, since prevention of carcinogenesis encompasses preventing any or all of the three stages of carcinogenesis namely initiation, promotion and progression. Oftentimes, many cancer chemopreventive compounds can possess all three biological properties that culminate in the overall protection against cancer. To be most effective, cancer chemoprevention of earlier lesions will be the ultimate goal if we are to eradicate this dreadful disease, since advanced metastasized cancers are almost lethal and unresponsive to radiation and chemotherapy. The reviews covered in this special issue, which are based on strong preclinical studies, will hopefully provide the impetus to translate this information to clinical practice and improved patient care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract RAS is the most frequently mutated oncoprotein for cancer driving. Understanding of RAS biology and discovery of druggable lynchpins in RAS pathway is a prerequisite for targeted therapy of RAS-mutant cancers. The recent identification of KRAS G12C inhibitor breaks the “undruggable” curse on RAS and has changed the therapy paradigm of KRAS-mutant cancers. However, KRAS mutations, let alone KRAS G12C mutation, account for only part of RAS-mutated cancers. Targeted therapies for cancers harboring other RAS mutations remain the urgent need. In this study we explored the pivotal regulatory molecules that allow for broad inhibition of RAS mutants. By comparing the expression levels of nucleotide pyrophosphatase (NPPS) in a panel of cell lines and the functional consequence of increased NPPS expression in RAS-mutant cells, we demonstrated that cancer cells with various kinds of RAS mutations depended on NPPS for growth and survival, and that this dependence conferred a vulnerability of RAS-mutant cancer to treatment of NPPS inhibition. RAS-mutant cells, compared with RAS-wildtype cells, bored and required an upregulation of NPPS. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses revealed a NPPS-dependent hyperglycolysis in RAS-mutant cells. We demonstrated that NPPS promoted glucose-derived glycolytic intermediates in RAS-mutant cells by enhancing its interaction with hexokinase 1 (HK1), the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step of glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of NPPS-HK1 axis using NPPS inhibitor Enpp-1-IN-1 or HK1 inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), or genetic interfere with NPPS suppressed RAS-mutant cancers in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, this study reveals an unrecognized mechanism and druggable lynchpin for modulation of pan-mutant-RAS pathway, proposing a new potential therapeutic approach for treating RAS-mutant cancers.",
