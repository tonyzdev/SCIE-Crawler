Observations seem to indicate an approximately constant dark matter density in the inner parts of galaxies, while cosmological computer simulations indicate a steep power-law-like behaviour. This difference has become known as the \"core/cusp problem\", and remains one of the unsolved problems in small-scale cosmology.",

    "abstract": "In this review we present a progress report of the connection between long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their accompanying supernovae (SNe). The analysis is from the point of view of an observer, with much of the emphasis placed on how observations, and the modelling of observations, have constrained what we known about GRB-SNe. We discuss their photometric and spectroscopic properties, their role as cosmological probes, including their measured luminosity$-$decline relationships, and how they can be used to measure the Hubble constant. We present a statistical analysis of their bolometric properties, and use this to determine the properties of the \"average\" GRB-SNe: which has a kinetic energy of $E_{\\rm K} \\approx 2.5\\times10^{52}$ erg, an ejecta mass of $M_{\\rm ej} \\approx 6$ M$_{\\odot}$, a nickel mass of $M_{\\rm Ni} \\approx 0.4$ M$_{\\odot}$, a peak photospheric velocity of $v_{\\rm ph} \\approx 21,000$ km s$^{-1}$, a peak bolometric luminosity of $L_{\\rm p} \\approx 1\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and it reaches peak bolometric light in $t_{\\rm p} \\approx 13$ days. We discuss their geometry, consider the various physical processes that are thought to power the luminosity of GRB-SNe, and whether differences exist between GRB-SNe and the SNe associated with ultra-long duration GRBs. We discuss how observations of the environments of GRB-SNe further constrain the physical properties of their progenitor stars, and give an overview of the current theoretical paradigms of their suspected central engines. We also present an overview of the radioactively powered transients that have been photometrically associated with short-duration GRBs. We conclude the review by discussing what additional research is needed to further our understanding of GRB-SNe, in particular the role of binary-formation channels and the connection of GRB-SNe with superluminous SNe (abridged).",

We first briefly consider three models which generate the non-Gaussianity either at or after the end of inflation; the curvaton scenario, modulated (p)reheating and an inhomogeneous end of inflation. We then focus on ways of generating the non-Gaussianity during inflation. We derive general conditions which a product or sum separable potential must satisfy in order to generate a large local bispectrum during slow-roll inflation. As an application we consider two-field hybrid inflation. We then derive a formalism not based on slow roll which can be applied to models in which the slow-roll parameters become large before inflation ends. An exactly soluble two-field model is given in which this happens. Finally we also consider further non-Gaussian observables; a scale dependence of f_NL and the trispectrum.",

    "abstract": "A decade ago cosmological simulations of increasingly higher resolution were used to demonstrate that virialized regions of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos are filled with a multitude of dense, gravitationally-bound clumps. These dark matter subhalos are central regions of halos that survived strong gravitational tidal forces and dynamical friction during the hierarchical sequence of merging and accretion via which the CDM halos form. Comparisons with observations revealed that there is a glaring discrepancy between abundance of subhalos and luminous satellites of the Milky Way and Andromeda as a function of their circular velocity or bound mass within a fixed aperture. This large discrepancy, which became known as the ``substructure'' or the ``missing satellites'' problem, begs for an explanation. In this paper I review the progress made during the last several years both in quantifying the problem and in exploring possible scenarios in which it could be accommodated and explained in the context of galaxy formation in the framework of the CDM paradigm of structure formation. In particular, I show that the observed luminosity function, radial distribution, and the remarkable similarity of the inner density profiles of luminous satellites can be understood within hierarchical CDM framework using a simple model in which efficiency of star formation monotonically decreases with decreasing virial mass satellites had before their accretion without any actual sharp galaxy formation threshold.",

In this review, I describe the most recent observational results and current theoretical interpretation. Observationally, a major development is the rise of time resolved spectral analysis. These led to (I) identification of a distinguished high energy component, with GeV photons often seen at a delay and (II) firm evidence for the existence of a photospheric (thermal) component in a large number of bursts. These results triggered many theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the physical conditions in the inner jet regions. I highlight some areas of active theoretical research. These include (I) understanding the role played by magnetic fields in shaping the dynamics of GRB outflow and spectra; (II) understanding the microphysics of kinetic and magnetic energy transfer, namely, accelerating particle to high energies in both shock waves and magnetic reconnection layers; (III) understanding how subphotospheric energy dissipation broadens the “Planck” spectrum; and (IV) geometrical light aberration effects.

This is a prediction of numerical relativity simulations, which imply that the newly formed single SMBH, after binary coalescence in a galaxy merger, can receive kick velocities up to several 1000 km/s due to anisotropic emission of gravitational waves. Long-lived oscillations of the SMBHs in galaxy cores, and in rare cases even SMBH ejections from their host galaxies, are the consequence. Observationally, accreting recoiling SMBHs would appear as quasars spatially and/or kinematically off-set from their host galaxies. The presence of the \"kicks\" has a wide range of astrophysical implications which only now are beginning to be explored, including consequences for black hole and galaxy assembly at the epoch of structure formation, black hole feeding, and unified models of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).

The software is able to simultaneously analyze multiple transits observed in different conditions (instrument, filter, weather, etc). The graphical interface allows for the simple execution and interpretation of Bayesian MCMC analysis tailored to a user's specific data set and has been thoroughly tested on ground-based and Kepler photometry.

We confirm that this class of galaxies has black holes with masses less than 10^6 Msolar, if any. We also derive new upper limits for nuclear star cluster (NC) masses in massive galaxies with previously determined black hole masses. We use the newly derived upper limits and a literature compilation to study the low mass end of the global-to-nucleus relations. We find the following (1) The M_BH-sigma relation cannot flatten at low masses, but may steepen. (2) The M_BH-M_bulge relation may well flatten in contrast. (3) The M_BH-Sersic n relation is able to account for the large scatter in black hole masses in low-mass disk galaxies. Outliers in the M_BH-Sersic n relation seem to be dwarf elliptical galaxies. When plotting M_BH versus M_NC we find three different regimes: (a) nuclear cluster dominated nuclei, (b) a transition region, and (c) black hole-dominated nuclei. This is consistent with the picture, in which black holes form inside nuclear clusters with a very low-mass fraction. They subsequently grow much faster than the nuclear cluster, destroying it when the ratio M_BH/M_NC grows above 100. Nuclear star clusters may thus be the precursors of massive black holes in galaxy nuclei.",

Instead of the initial idea that the thermal gas is cooling and flowing toward the center, the new picture envisages a complex dynamical evolution of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) regulated by the radiative cooling and the nongravitational heating from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Understanding the physics of the hot gas and its interplay with the relativistic plasma ejected by the AGN is key for understanding the growth and evolution of galaxies and their central black holes, the history of star formation, and the formation of large-scale structures. It has thus become clear that the feedback from the central black hole must be taken into account in any model of galaxy evolution.

    "abstract": "In the last few decades, advances in observational cosmology have given us a standard model of cosmology. We know the content of the universe to within a few percent. With more ambitious experiments on the way, we hope to move beyond the knowledge of what the universe is made of, to why the universe is the way it is. In this review paper we focus on primordial non-Gaussianity as a probe of the physics of the dynamics of the universe at the very earliest moments. We discuss 1) theoretical predictions from inflationary models and their observational consequences in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies; 2) CMB--based estimators for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity with an emphasis on bispectrum templates; 3) current constraints on non-Gaussianity and what we can hope to achieve in the near future; and 4) non-primordial sources of non-Gaussianities in the CMB such as bispectrum due to second order effects, three way cross-correlation between primary-lensing-secondary CMB, and possible instrumental effects.",

Currently, there are two major methods of independent observational H ( z ) measurement, which we summarize as the “differential age method” and the “radial BAO size method.” Starting with fundamental cosmological notions such as the spacetime coordinates in an expanding universe, we present the basic principles behind the two methods. We further review the two methods in greater detail, including the source of errors. We show how the observational H ( z ) data present itself as a useful tool in the study of cosmological models and parameter constraint, and we also discuss several issues associated with their applications. Finally, we point the reader to a future prospect of upcoming observation programs that will lead to some major improvements in the quality of observational H ( z ) data.",

We mainly focus on the NG generated from the post inflationary evolution of the CMB anisotropies at second order in perturbation theory at large and small angular scales, such as the ones generated at the recombination epoch. We show how to derive the equations to study the second‐order CMB anisotropies and provide analytical computations to evaluate their contamination to primordial NG (complemented with numerical examples).

    "abstract": "Scalar-tensor theories of gravitation have recently regained a great interest after the discovery of the Chameleon mechanism and of the Galileon models. The former allows, in principle, to reconcile the presence of cosmological scalar fields with the constraints from experiments at the Solar System scale. The latter open up the possibility of building inflationary models that, among other things, do not need ad hoc potentials. Further generalizations have finally led to the most general tensor-scalar theory, recently dubbed the \"Fab Four\", with only first and second order derivatives of the fields in the equations of motion and that self-tune to a vanishing cosmological constant. This model has a very rich phenomenology that needs to be explored and confronted with experimental data in order to constrain a very large parameter space. In this paper, we present some results regarding a subset of the theory named \"John\", which corresponds to a non-minimal derivative coupling between the scalar field and the Einstein tensor in the action. We show that this coupling gives rise to an inflationary model with very unnatural initial conditions. Thus, we include a non-minimal, but non-derivative, coupling between scalar field and Ricci scalar, a term named \"George\" in the Fab Four terminology. In this way, we find a more sensible inflationary model, and, by performing a post-newtonian expansion of spherically symmetric solutions, we derive the set of equations that constrain the parameter space with data from experiments in the solar system.",

The only means to get direct information about the supernova engine is from observations of neutrinos emitted by the forming neutron star, and through gravitational waves which are produced when the hydrodynamic flow or the neutrino flux is not perfectly spherically symmetric. The multidimensionality of the supernova engine, which breaks the sphericity of the central core such as convection, rotation, magnetic fields, and hydrodynamic instabilities of the supernova shock, is attracting great attention as the most important ingredient to understand the long-veiled explosion mechanism. Based on our recent work, we summarize properties of gravitational waves, neutrinos, and explosive nucleosynthesis obtained in a series of our multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations and discuss how the mystery of the central engines can be unraveled by deciphering these multimessengers produced under the thick veils of massive stars.",

The SFHs of resolved dwarf galaxies of all morphological types, obtained from the application of the synthetic CMD method, are reviewed and discussed. In short: 1) Only early-type galaxies show evidence of long interruptions in the SF activity; late-type dwarfs present rather continuous, or gasping, SF regimes; 2) A few early-type dwarfs have experienced only one episode of SF activity concentrated at the earliest epochs, whilst many others show extended or recurrent SF activity; 3) No galaxy experiencing now its first SF episode has been found yet; 4) No frequent evidence of strong SF bursts is found; 5) There is no significant difference in the SFH of dwarf irregulars and blue compact dwarfs, except for the current SF rates. Implications of these results on the galaxy formation scenarios are briefly discussed.",

This newly developed theory overcomes the problems of big bang singularity and provides the viable cosmological consequences in the early time universe. Moreover, its implications occur in high curvature regime where the deviations of energy-momentum squared gravity from general relativity is confirmed. We consider the minimal coupling model of this modified theory and formulate symmetry generators as well as corresponding conserved quantities. We use conservation relation and apply some suitable initial conditions to evaluate the metric potentials. Finally, we explore some interesting features of the compact objects for appropriate values of the model parameters through numeric analysis. It is found that compact stellar objects in this particular framework depend on the model parameters as well as conserved quantities. We conclude that Noether symmetries generate solutions that are consistent with the astrophysical observational data and hence confirm the viability of this procedure.",

During that time, it has detected 32 recovered meteorite falls and 20 additional unrecovered but probable falls within and around the U.S. Detections have occurred at all hours of the day and night as the system operates constantly, delivering data to a public internet portal in near real time. It is possible to estimate the mass of meteorites detected based on standard equations of motion, and the total reflected energy can in theory produce a measure of the number of meteorites present. Currently, weather radar data are used to analyze falls at times and places identified by other means such as eyewitness reports, infrasound, and satellite lightning sensors, but recent work suggests that the direct detection of meteorite falls in radar data alone is possible.

We compare such an extra-rate to the estimated corrections to the planetary perihelion precessions by taking their ratio for different pairs of planets instead of using one perihelion at a time for each planet separately, as done so far in literature. The answer is neatly negative, even by further re-scaling by a factor 10 (and even 100 for Saturn) the errors in the estimated extra-precessions of the perihelia released by Pitjeva. Our conclusions hold also for any other metric perturbation having the same dependence on the spatial coordinates, as those induced by other general relativistic cosmological scenarios and by many modified models of gravity.

Even if, on the currently observed angular scales, they can only contribute a small fraction of the CMB angular power spectrum, cosmic strings could actually be the main source of its non-Gaussianities. In this article, after having reviewed the basic cosmological properties of a string network, we present the signatures Nambu-Goto cosmic strings would induce in various observables ranging from the one-point function of the temperature anisotropies to the bispectrum and trispectrum. It is shown that string imprints are significantly different than those expected from the primordial type of non-Gaussianity and could therefore be easily distinguished.",

Such models have attracted interest recently for a variety of reasons, including the possibility of slowing the motion of the inflaton on a steep potential. In this review we show that interactions between the produced particles and the inflaton condensate can lead to a qualitatively new mechanism for generating cosmological fluctuations from inflation. We illustrate this effect using a simple prototype model g^2 (\\phi-\\phi_0)^2\\chi^2 for the interaction between the inflaton, \\phi, and iso-inflaton, \\chi. Such interactions are quite natural in a variety of inflation models from supersymmetry and string theory. Using both lattice field theory simulations and analytical calculations, we study the quantum production of \\chi particles and their subsequent rescatterings off the condensate \\phi(t), which generates bremsstrahlung radiation of light inflaton fluctuations \\delta\\phi. This mechanism leads to observable features in the primordial power spectrum. We derive observational constraints on such features and discuss their implications for popular models of inflation, including brane/axion monodromy. Inflationary particle production also leads to a very novel kind of nongaussian signature which may be observable in future missions. We argue that this mechanism provides a simple and well-motivated option to generate large nongaussianity, without fine-tuning the inflationary trajectory or appealing to re-summation of an infinite series of high dimension operators.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of galaxy surveys which provide large samples of galaxies or galaxy clusters over a volume comparable to the horizon size (SDSS-III, HETDEX, Euclid, JDEM, LSST, Pan-STARRS, CIP etc.) or mass-selected large cluster samples over a large fraction of the extra-galactic sky (Planck, SPT, ACT, CMBPol, B-Pol), it is timely to investigate what constraints these surveys can impose on primordial non-Gaussianity. I illustrate here three different approaches: higher-order correlations of the three dimensional galaxy distribution, abundance of rare objects (extrema of the density distribution), and the large-scale clustering of halos (peaks of the density distribution). Each of these avenues has its own advantages, but, more importantly, these approaches are highly complementary under many respects.",

    "abstract": "In the cold dark matter scenario, dark matter halos are assembled hierarchically from smaller subunits. Some of these subunits are disrupted during the merging process, whereas others survive temporarily in the form of subhalos. A long‐standing problem with this picture is that the number of subhalos predicted by simulations exceeds the number of luminous dwarf galaxies seen in the vicinity of large galaxies like the Milky Way. Many of the subhalos must therefore have remained dark or very faint. If cold dark matter subhalos are as common as predicted, gravitational lensing may in principle offer a promising route to detection. In this paper, we describe the many ways through which lensing by subhalos can manifest itself, and summarize the results from current efforts to constrain the properties of cold dark matter subhalos using such effects.",

    "abstract": "We review numerical work carried out over the last decade on the role of environmental mechanisms in shaping the nature of the faintest galaxies known, dwarf spheroidals (dSphs). In particular we discuss a model in which dSphs originated from gas dominated, disky dwarfs that were accreted by massive galaxies several billions of years ago. Dwarfs accreting at $z > 1$, when the cosmic ultraviolet ionizing flux was much higher than today and was thus able to keep the gas in the dwarfs warm and diffuse, were rapidly stripped of their baryons via ram pressure and tidal forces, producing very dark matter dominated objects with truncated star formation histories, such as the Draco dSph. The low star formation efficiency expected in such low-metallicity objects prior to their infall was crucial for keeping their disks gas dominated until stripping took over. {\\it Therefore gas stripping along with inefficient star formation provides a new feedback mechanism, alternative to photoevaporation or supernovae feedback, playing a crucial role in dwarf galaxy formation and evolution}. Tidally induced instabilities, termed \"tidal stirring\", turned the surviving stellar disk into a spheroid. Moreover, we examine the properties of the newly discovered ultra-faint dSphs in light of this scenario and argue that they likely belong to a different population of lower mass dwarf satellites. These were mostly shaped by reionization rather than by environmental mechanisms and are thus good candidates for being \"reionization fossils\". We discuss implications of the morphological transformation scenario on the substructure problem. (Abridged)",

As noted in previous work, LSB galaxies span a range of luminosities (-10 > M_V > -20) and sizes (0.3 kpc < R_V25 < 10 kpc), although they are consistent in their irregular morphology. Their H-alpha luminosities (L(H-alpha) range from 10^36 to 10^41 ergs s^-1 (corresponding to a range in star formation, using canonical prescriptions, from 10^-5 to 1 M_solar yr^-1). Although their optical colors are at the extreme blue edge for galaxies, they are similar to the colors of dwarf galaxies (van Zee 2001) and gas-rich irregulars (Hunter & Elmegreen 2006). However, their star formation rates per unit stellar mass are a factor of ten less than other galaxies of the same baryonic mass, indicating that they are not simply quiescent versions of more active star forming galaxies. This paper presents the data, reduction techniques and new philosophy of data storage and presentation. Later papers in this series will explore the stellar population and star formation history of LSB galaxies using this dataset.",

This topic has fascinated more than two generations of scientists and slowly unveiled an unexpected scenario regarding the consequences of the angular and spatial distribution of X-ray sources. It was first established from the clustering of sources making the CXB that the source spatial distribution resembles that of optical QSO. It then it became evident that the distribution of X-ray AGN in the Universe was strongly reflecting that of Dark Matter. In particular one of the key result is that X-ray AGN are hosted by Dark Matter Halos of mass similar to that of galaxy groups. This result, together with model predictions, has lead to the hypothesis that galaxy mergers may constitute the main AGN triggering mechanism. However detailed analysis of observational data, acquired with modern telescopes, and the use of the new Halo Occupation formalism has revealed that the triggering of an AGN could also be attributed to phenomena like tidal disruption or disk instability, and to galaxy evolution. This paper reviews results from 1988 to 2011 in the field of X-ray selected AGN clustering.",

The Mount Wilson classification scheme describes the spatial distribution of magnetic polarities in sunspot groups, which plays an important role in forecasting solar flares. With the rapid accumulation of solar observation data, automatic recognition of magnetic type in sunspot groups is imperative for prompt solar eruption forecast. We present in this study, based on the SDO/HMI SHARP data taken during the time interval 2010-2017, an automatic procedure for the recognition of the predefined magnetic types in sunspot groups utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) method. Three different models (A, B, and C) take magnetograms, continuum images, and the two-channel pictures as input, respectively. The results show that CNN has a productive performance in identification of the magnetic types in solar active regions (ARs). The best recognition result emerges when continuum images are used as input data solely, and the total accuracy exceeds 95%, for which the recognition accuracy of Alpha type reaches 98% while the accuracy for Beta type is slightly lower but maintains above 88%.",

These constraints are discussed in detail and are complemented by deriving upper limits on the polarisation of the AME for those objects without published WMAP constraints. For the case of large-scale emission, two recent works, based on WMAP data, are reviewed. Currently, the best constraints on the fractional polarisation of the AME, at frequencies near the peak of the emission (i.e., 20–30 GHz), are at the level of<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>% (95.4% confidence level).

Making use of a synthetic population algorithm, we investigate the possibility of detecting finite source effects in simulated microlensing events due to FFPs. We find a significant efficiency for finite source effect detection that turns out to be between 20% and 40% for a FFP power law mass function index in the range [0.9, 1.6]. For many of such events it will also be possible to measure the angular Einstein radius and therefore constrain the lens physical parameters. These kinds of observations will also offer a unique possibility to investigate the photosphere and atmosphere of Galactic bulge stars.",

But careful analysis of disk galaxies -- including 2D bulge/disk/bar decompositions -- shows that while SMBHs correlate with the stellar mass of the bulge component of galaxies, the masses of NSCs correlate much better with the total galaxy stellar mass. In addition, the mass ratio M_nsc/M_star,tot for NSCs in spirals (at least those with Hubble types Sc and later) is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the mass ratio M_bh/M_star, bulge of SMBHs. The absence of a universal \"central massive object\" correlation argues against common formation and growth mechanisms for both SMBHs and NSCs. We also discuss evidence for a break in the NSC-host galaxy correlation: galaxies with Hubble types earlier than Sbc appear to host systematically more massive NSCs than do types Sc and later.",

In this paper, I discuss a new theoretical framework for a test of the no-hair theorem that is ideal for imaging observations of Sgr A* with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The approach is formulated in terms of a Kerr-like spacetime that depends on a free parameter and is regular everywhere outside of the event horizon.

Cross-correlation and wavelet transform tools were employed to carry out the investigation. The analyses confirmed that the cosmic ray intensity correlates negatively with the sunspot numbers, exhibiting an asynchronous phase relationship with a strong negative correlation. The trend in cosmic ray intensity indicates that it undergoes the 11-year modulation that mainly depends on the solar activity in the heliosphere. On the other hand, the solar wind speed neither shows a clear phase relationship nor correlates with the sunspot numbers but shows a wide range of periodicities that could possibly be connected to the pattern of coronal hole configuration. A number of short and midterm variations were also observed from the wavelet analysis, i.e., 64–128 and 128–256 days for the cosmic ray intensity, 4–8, 32–64, 128–256, and 256–512 days for the solar wind speed, and 16–32, 32–64, 128–256, and 256–512 days for the sunspot numbers.",

The first one is an interior phase which has negative density; the second part consists of thin shell comprising ultrarelativistic stiff fluid for which we have discussed the length, energy, and entropy. By the graphical analysis of entropy, we have shown that our proposed thin shell gravastar model is potentially stable. The third phase of gravastar is defined by the exterior Schwarzschild geometry. For the interior of gravastar, we have found the analytical solutions free from any singularity and the event horizon in the framework of Rastall gravity.",

Flat rotation curves and high dynamical masses may then indicate the presence of an unseen component, and constrain the properties of the \"missing baryons\", known to exist but not directly observed. The number of dwarf galaxies in the Universe is another cosmological problem that can be significantly impacted if tidal dwarf galaxies formed frequently at high redshift, when the merger rate was high, and many of them survived until today.",

A nonlacunar multifractal geometry can encompass three fundamental descriptions of the cosmic structure, namely, the web structure, hierarchical clustering, and halo distributions. Furthermore, it explains our present knowledge of cosmic voids. In this way, a unified theory of the large-scale structure of the universe seems to emerge. The multifractal spectrum that we obtain significantly differs from the one of the adhesion model and conforms better to the laws of gravity. The formation of the cosmic web is best modeled as a type of turbulent dynamics, generalizing the known methods of Burgers turbulence.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of the spin directions of spiral galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has been a topic of debate in the past two decades, with conflicting conclusions reported even in cases where the same data was used. Here we follow one of the previous experiments by applying the SpArcFiRe algorithm to annotate the spin directions in original dataset of Galaxy Zoo 1. The annotation of the galaxy spin directions is done after a first step of selecting the spiral galaxies in three different manners: manual analysis by Galaxy Zoo classifications, by a model-driven computer analysis, and with no selection of spiral galaxies. The results show that when spiral galaxies are selected by Galaxy Zoo volunteers, the distribution of their spin directions as determined by SpArcFiRe is not random, which agrees with previous reports. When selecting the spiral galaxies using a model-driven computer analysis or without selecting the spiral galaxies at all, the distribution is also not random. Simple binomial distribution analysis shows that the probability of the parity violation to occur by chance is lower than 0.01. Fitting the spin directions as observed from Earth to cosine dependence exhibits a dipole axis with statistical strength of 2.33$\\sigma$ to 3.97$\\sigma$. These experiments show that regardless of the selection mechanism and the analysis method, all experiments show similar conclusions. These results are aligned with previous reports using other methods and telescopes, suggesting that the spin directions of spiral galaxies as observed from Earth exhibit a dipole axis formed by their spin directions. Possible explanations can be related to the large-scale structure of the Universe, or to internal structure of galaxies. The catalogs of annotated galaxies generated as part of this study are available.",

The answers depend on the extent to which star formation in the first population of small mass halos may be suppressed by radiative feedback loops. If early populations of dwarf galaxies did form in significant number before reionization, their “fossils” should be found today in the Local Group. This paper reviews our ongoing efforts to simulate and identify fossil dwarfs in the Local Group. It is widely believed that reionization stopped star formation in fossil dwarfs. However, here we dispute this idea and discuss a physical mechanism whereby recent episodes of star formation would be produced in some fossil dwarfs that, hence, may characterized by a bimodal star formation history. The same mechanism could turn dark halos that failed to form stars before reionization into gas‐rich “dark galaxies”. We believe that current observational data supports the thesis that a fraction of the new ultra‐faint dwarfs discovered in the Local Group are fossil dwarfs and we predict the existence of a population of ultra‐faint dwarfs with lower surface brightness than currently observed.",

It is natural therefore to suppose that magnetic fields could be present in the turbulent high temperature environment of the big bang. Such a primordial magnetic field (PMF) would be expected to manifest itself in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies, and also in the formation of large- scale structure. In this review we summarize the theoretical framework which we have developed to calculate the PMF power spectrum to high precision. Using this formulation, we summarize calculations of the effects of a PMF which take accurate quantitative account of the time evolution of the cut off scale. We review the constructed numerical program, which is without approximation, and an improvement over the approach used in a number of previous works for studying the effect of the PMF on the cosmological perturbations. We demonstrate how the PMF is an important cosmological physical process on small scales. We also summarize the current constraints on the PMF amplitude $B_\\lambda$ and the power spectral index $n_B$ which have been deduced from the available CMB observational data by using our computational framework.",

Several formation processes have been proposed in order to explain the wide variety of their observational properties. These properties could indicate that the class of lenticulars is a family formed by galaxies with different formations and evolutions. Here I review the main observational properties of the photometric components of lenticular galaxies reported in recent decades. I revise the main processes proposed in order to explain their origin and evolution. I also explain the different properties of the lenticular galaxies that have evolved through each of these formation processes. A unique opportunity for understanding the origin of S0 galaxies will shortly be forthcoming. This is due to the morphological classifications of large galaxy samples that have recently been published. These classifications have given us our first ever opportunity to study large samples of lenticulars within a wide range of masses and located in a great variety of environments. These large samples will provide us with a real census of nearby lenticular galaxies and could be crucial in finally helping us to understand the origin and evolution of these galaxies.",

    "abstract": "Many studies of anomalous microwave emission (AME) have computed an AME emissivity to compare the strength of the AME detected in different regions. Such a value is usually defined as the ratio between the intensity of the AME at 1 cm and the thermal dust emission at 100 μ m. However, as studies of Galactic dust emission have shown, the intensity of the thermal dust emission at 100 μ m is strongly dependent on the dust temperature, which has severe implications for the AME emissivity defined in this way. In this work, we illustrate and quantify this effect and find that the AME emissivity decreases by a factor of 11.1 between dust temperatures of 20 and 30 K. We, therefore, conclude that computing the AME emissivity relative to the 100 μ m emission does not allow for accurate comparisons between the AME observed in different environments. With this in mind, we investigate the use of other tracers of the dust emission with which to compute the AME emissivity and we ultimately conclude that, despite the difficulty in deriving its value, the column density of the dust would be the most suitable quantity with which to compute the AME emissivity.",

    "abstract": "Given an arbitrary function, we may construct symmetric and antisymmetric functions under a certain operation. Since statistical isotropy and homogeneity of our Universe has been a fundamental assumption of modern cosmology, we do not expect any particular symmetry or antisymmetry in our Universe. Besides fundamental properties of our Universe, we may also figure our contamination and improve the quality of the CMB data products, by matching the unusual symmetries and antisymmetries of the CMB data with known contaminantions. Noting this, we have investigated the symmetry and antisymmetry of CMB anisotropy pattern, which provides the deepest survey. If we let the operation to be a coordinate inversion, the symmetric and antisymmetric functions have even and odd-parity respectively. The investigation on the parity of the recent CMB data shows a large-scale odd-parity preference, which is very unlikely in the statistical isotropic and homogeneous Universe. We have investigated the association of the WMAP systematics with the anomaly, but not found a definite non-cosmological cause. Additionally, we have investigated the phase of even and odd multipole data respectively, and found the behavior distinct from each other. Noting the odd-parity preference anomaly, we have fitted a cosmological model respectively to even and odd multipole data, and found significant parametric tension. Besides anomalies explicitly associated with parity, there are anomalous lack of large-scale correlation in CMB data. Noting the equivalence between the power spectrum and the correlation, we have investigated the association between the lack of large-angle correlation and the odd-parity preference of the angular power spectrum. From our analysis, we find that the odd-parity preference at low multipoles is, in fact, phenomenologically identical with the lack of large-angle correlation.",

Their aim is to address decision-making problems in the real world whenever obtaining accurate and sufficient data is not a straightforward task. In this way, spherical fuzzy sets were recently introduced as a step beyond to modelize such problems more precisely on the basis of the human nature, thus expanding the space of membership levels, which are defined under imprecise circumstances. The main goal in this study is to apply the spherical fuzzy set version of Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a well-established multicriteria decision-making approach, in the context of planetary defense. As of the extraction of knowledge from a group of experts in the field of near-Earth asteroids, they rated four deflection technologies of asteroids (kinetic impactor, ion beam deflection, enhanced gravity tractor, and laser ablation) that had been previously assessed by means of the classical theory of fuzzy series. This way, a comparative study was carried out whose most significant results are the kinetic impactor being the most suitable alternative and the spherical fuzzy set version of the TOPSIS approach behaves more sensitively than the TOPSIS procedure for triangular fuzzy sets with regard to the information provided by our group of experts.",

In this Special Issue of Advances in Astronomy we have collected articles that summarize the theoretical predictions for departures from Gaussianity or statistical isotropy from a variety of potential sources, together with the observational approaches to test these properties using the CMB or large-scale structure. We hope this collection provides an accessible entry point to these topics as they currently stand, indicating what direction future developments may take and demonstrating why these questions are so compelling.

Results were obtained by using the wavelet transformation spectral technique, signal reconstruction by autoregressive spectral analysis (ARMA), and the Lomb-Scargle periodogram method. This 30-year periodicity seems to be significant in nature because several solar and climatic indexes exhibit the same modulation, which may indicate that the 30-year frequency of cosmic rays is probably a modulator agent for terrestrial phenomena, reflecting the control source, namely, solar activity.",

We find that this problem admits the well-known five planar equilibria of the classical problem with the difference that the corresponding collinear points may be stable depending on the parameters of the problem. For all planar equilibria, sufficient parametric conditions for their stability have been established which are used for the numerical determination of the stability regions in various parametric planes. Also, for certain values of the parameters of the problem for which the equilibrium points are stable, the short and long period families have been computed. To do so, semianalytical expressions have been found for the determination of appropriate initial conditions. Special attention has been given to the continuation of the long period family, in the case of the classical restricted three-body problem, where we show numerically that periodic orbits of the short period family, which are bifurcation points with the long period family, are connected through the characteristic curve of the long period family.",

Nonetheless, because magnetized accretion onto rotating black holes involves both the complications of nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics that currently cannot fully be treated numerically, and uncertainties about the origin of magnetic fields that at present are part of the input, the space of possible solutions remains less constrained. Consequently, the literature still bears witness to the proliferation of rather different black hole engine models. But the accumulated wealth of observational data is now sufficient to meaningfully distinguish between them. It is in this light that this critical paper compares the recent retrograde framework with standard \"spin paradigm\" prograde models.",

We found that, even if corrections were made to the detected muons using these three parameters, seasonal variations of the cosmic rays still exist. This suggests that other terrestrial and/or extraterrestrial causes may be considered. The levels of pion production and atmospheric pressure are inversely correlated with the muon rate. On the other hand, the temperature at the pion production level is correlated with muons in spring and winter and inversely correlated in fall and summer. There is no clear explanation for this behavior.",

    "abstract": "Pulsar stars, usually neutron stars, are spherical and compact objects containing a large quantity of mass. Each pulsar star possesses a magnetic field and emits a slightly different pattern of electromagnetic radiation which is used to identify the potential candidates for a real pulsar star. Pulsar stars are considered an important cosmic phenomenon, and scientists use them to study nuclear physics, gravitational waves, and collisions between black holes. Defining the process of automatic detection of pulsar stars can accelerate the study of pulsar stars by scientists. This study contrives an accurate and efficient approach for true pulsar detection using supervised machine learning. For experiments, the high time-resolution (HTRU2) dataset is used in this study. To resolve the data imbalance problem and overcome model overfitting, a hybrid resampling approach is presented in this study. Experiments are performed with imbalanced and balanced datasets using well-known machine learning algorithms. Results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid resampling approach proves highly influential to avoid model overfitting and increase the prediction accuracy. With the proposed hybrid resampling approach, the extra tree classifier achieves a 0.993 accuracy score for true pulsar star prediction.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a composite control algorithm for the radio telescope servo control system to address the target tracking and matched/mismatched disturbance suppression problems. The algorithm consists of the equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) approach and the optimal control method. An EID estimator is developed using the difference between the estimated output of the state observer and the measurement output and then the estimate of the EID is fed forward into the control input to reject the disturbance. A cost function with clear physical meaning is selected and the weighting parameters are adjusted for the optimal controller to improve tracking performance. Considering the nonminimum phase characteristics of the radio telescope system, the state observer gain is computed using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method. The system stability is analyzed using the small gain theorem, and the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control method is utilized to determine the state feedback gain. Finally, the composite controller is designed for an identified telescope model. Simulation results show that for the tracking performance, the settling time of proposed method is 1.13 s and reduces by about 0.32 s and 0.87 s than that of the ADRC controller and PI controller, respectively. For the antidisturbance performance, the RMS value and the maximum error of the proposed method are 0.0039 and 0.0128, which are 42.86% and 40.38% of the ADRC controller and 30.71% and 27.77% of the PI controller, respectively, which indicates that the proposed method has better control performance. In addition, the proposed controller has certain robustness to systematic parameter perturbations.",

However, apart several phenomenological models, there is no final f ( R )‐theory capable of fitting all the observations and addressing all the issues related to the presence of dark energy and dark matter. An alternative approach could be to “reconstruct” the form of f ( R ) starting from data without imposing particular classes of model. Besides, adopting the same philosophy, we take into account the possibility that galaxy cluster masses, estimated at X‐ray wavelengths, could be explained, without dark matter, reconstructing the weak‐field limit of analytic f ( R ) models. The corrected gravitational potential, obtained in this approximation, is used to estimate the total mass of a sample of 12 well‐shaped clusters of galaxies.",

The solar neutron detector FIB can determine both the energy and arrival direction of neutrons. We measured the energy spectra of background neutrons over the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region and elsewhere and found the typical trigger rates to be 20 and 0.22 counts/sec, respectively. It is possible to identify solar neutrons to within a level of 0.028 counts/sec, provided that directional information is applied. Solar neutrons were possibly observed in association with the M-class solar flares that occurred on March 7 (M3.7) and June 7 (M2.5) of 2011. This marked the first time that neutrons had been observed in M-class solar flares. A possible interpretation of the production process is provided.",

Our work is motivated by observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group, for which often a distinction is possible between a cold centrally concentrated metal rich and a hot, extended metal poor population. We find that an important attenuation of the initial differences in the distribution of the two stellar components occurs for orbits with small pericentric radii (r_per < 20 kpc). This is mainly due to: i) the loss of the gravitational support provided by the dark matter component after tidal stripping takes place, which forces a re-configuration of the luminous components, and ii) tides preferentially affect the more extended stellar component, leading to a net decrease in its velocity dispersion as a response for the mass loss, which thus shrinks the kinematical gap. We apply these ideas to the Sculptor and Carina dwarf spheroidals. Differences in their orbits might help to explain, under the assumption of similar initial configurations, why in the former a clear kinematical separation between metal poor and metal rich stars is apparent, while in Carina this segregation is significantly more subtle.",

These flares produced neutrons and/or protons recorded near Earth. The SONG response was consistent with detection of the pion-decay gamma emission and neutrons in these events. We supposed that a time profile of the soft X-ray derivative was a good proxy of time behavior of the flare energy release. Then we showed that time intervals of the maximum both of energy release and pion-decay-emission coincided well. We determined the onset time of GLEs 65, 69 on the basis of neutron monitor data using the superposed epoch method. The time of high-energy proton onset on November 4, 2003 was found from the GOES data. The time delay between the high-energy gamma ray observation and the high-energy protons onset time was &lt;5 minutes. This time lag corresponds to the least possible proton propagation time. So, we conclude that in these events both protons interacted in the solar atmosphere and the first protons which arrived to Earth, belonged to one and the same population of the accelerated particles.",

Since the whole transport is strongly related to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) structure, a better understanding of his description is needed in order to reproduce the cosmic rays intensity at the Earth, as well as outside the ecliptic plane. In this work an interplanetary magnetic field model including the standard description on ecliptic region and a polar correction is presented. This treatment of the IMF, implemented in the HelMod Monte Carlo code (version 2.0), was used to determine the effects on the differential intensity of Proton at 1 AU and allowed one to investigate how latitudinal gradients of proton intensities, observed in the inner heliosphere with the Ulysses spacecraft during 1995, can be affected by the modification of the IMF in the polar regions.",

In the spirit of a simplified analytic theory we also introduce some modifications to the existing models. We give an exact expression for the pressure of an ideal non-relativistic Fermi gas at a finite temperature, therefore allowing for non-zero values of the degeneracy parameter ($\\psi = \\frac{kT}{\\mu_{F}}$, where $\\mu_{F}$ is the Fermi energy). We review the derivation of surface luminosity using an entropy matching condition and the first-order phase transition between the molecular hydrogen in the outer envelope and the partially-ionized hydrogen in the inner region. We also discuss the results of modern simulations of the plasma phase transition, which illustrate the uncertainties in determining its critical temperature. Based on the existing models and with some simple modification we find the maximum mass for a brown dwarf to be in the range $0.064M_\\odot-0.087M_\\odot$. An analytic formula for the luminosity evolution allows us to estimate the time period of the non-steady state (i.e., non-main sequence) nuclear burning for substellar objects. Standard models also predict that stars that are just above the substellar mass limit can reach an extremely low luminosity main sequence after at least a few million years of evolution, and sometimes much longer. We estimate that $\\simeq 11 \\%$ of stars take longer than $10^7$ yr to reach the main-sequence, and $\\simeq 5 \\%$ of stars take longer than $10^8$ yr.",

The casual dashcam recordings from many locations of the Chelyabinsk superbolide associated with the atmospheric entry of an 18 m in diameter near-Earth object (NEO) have provided an excellent opportunity to reconstruct its atmospheric trajectory, deceleration, and heliocentric orbit. In this study, we focus on the study of the ablation properties of the Chelyabinsk bolide on the basis of its deceleration and fragmentation. We explore whether meteoroids exhibiting abrupt fragmentation can be studied by analyzing segments of the trajectory that do not include a disruption episode. We apply that approach to the lower part of the trajectory of the Chelyabinsk bolide to demonstrate that the obtained parameters are consistent. To do that, we implemented a numerical (Runge–Kutta) method appropriate for deriving the ablation properties of bolides based on observations. The method was successfully tested with the cases previously published in the literature. Our model yields fits that agree with observations reasonably well. It also produces a good fit to the main observed characteristics of Chelyabinsk superbolide and provides its averaged ablation coefficient σ = 0.034 s2 km−2. Our study also explores the main implications for impact hazard, concluding that tens of meters in diameter NEOs encountering the Earth in grazing trajectories and exhibiting low geocentric velocities are penetrating deeper into the atmosphere than previously thought and, as such, are capable of producing meteorites and even damage on the ground.",

This study uses large datasets collected by four different robotic telescopes to profile the large-scale distribution of the spin directions of spiral galaxies. These datasets cover the Northern and Southern hemispheres, in addition to data acquired from space by the Hubble Space Telescope. The data were annotated automatically by a fully symmetric algorithm, as well as manually through a long labor-intensive process, leading to a dataset of nearly <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <msup> <mrow> <mn>10</mn> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>6</mn> </mrow> </msup> </math> galaxies. The data show possible patterns of asymmetric distribution of the spin directions, and the patterns agree between the different telescopes. The profiles also agree when using automatic or manual annotation of the galaxies, showing very similar large-scale patterns. Combining all data from all telescopes allows the most comprehensive analysis of its kind to date in terms of both the number of galaxies and the footprint size. The results show a statistically significant profile that is consistent across all telescopes. The instruments used in this study are DECam, HST, SDSS, and Pan-STARRS. The paper also discusses possible sources of bias and analyzes the design of previous work that showed different results.

    "abstract": "Satellite communication and navigation systems have become more essential to everyday life, but at the same time, understanding the effect of solar activity on these systems is vital. Total electron content (TEC) is a key factor affecting satellite signals. Solar flares affect the TEC variations, and this research examines the forecast of TEC during various X‐class solar flares that occurred in February, March, May, June, July, and August 2024, employing a bidirectional long short‐term memory (Bi‐LSTM) coupled with the Adam optimizer (Bi‐LSTM‐AO). The forecasted results were validated with the IRI‐2020. This study uses a robust dataset encompassing more than 1 year of TEC data from the IONOLAB database, along with key solar and geomagnetic parameters such as Kp, Ap, SSN, and F10.7 obtained from NASA OMNIWeb. These potent solar flares were scrutinized to evaluate the model’s performance in forecasting TEC variations under extreme solar activity. The Bi‐LSTM‐AO model exhibited exceptional accuracy in predicting TEC values across these dates, consistently outperforming the IRI‐2020 model. For example, on May 14, 2024, coinciding with the X8.79 solar flare, the Bi‐LSTM‐AO model achieved impressive performance metrics, including a root‐mean‐square error of 3.52, a mean absolute percentage error of 6.88%, a mean absolute gross error of 2.97, and a centered mean square deviation of 9.93. In contrast, the IRI‐2020 model showed significantly higher error metrics, with an RMSE of 13.18, a MAPE of 23.61%, and a MAGE of 10.93. This research provides the development of a more accurate space weather forecasting model to increase the positional accuracy in navigation systems. The improved predictions can enhance the reliability of satellite‐dependent systems, which are increasingly important for global communication and navigation systems.",

    "abstract": "Solar flares, driven by magnetic reconnection on the Sun, pose substantial threats to Earth’s technological infrastructure. Accurate forecasting of flare activity, quantified by the Solar Flare Index (SFI), is crucial for mitigating space weather risks. This study leveraged an optimized long short‐term memory (LSTM+) neural network, to achieve robust long‐term SFI predictions. The LSTM + model incorporated a novel reprediction procedure and fine‐tuned parameter optimization, demonstrating high accuracy in hindcasting SFI for Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The validated model predicted a peak SFI for Solar Cycle 25 in January 2025, aligning with historical trends of SFI lagging behind sunspot number maxima. This projection, along with the recent resurgence in sunspot activity, suggests a potential second, higher SFI peak may occur. Incorporating inherent model uncertainties, the maximum SFI for Solar Cycle 25 was estimated to occur between December 2023 and February 2026. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of solar flare dynamics and provide valuable insights for space weather prediction, enabling proactive measures to protect critical technological systems.",

    "abstract": "In the era of large satellite constellations, there are more than 1000 satellites in orbit. While the signals from these satellites may pose a risk of radio frequency interference (RFI) to radio telescopes, they also present a potential advantage by serving as high‐spatial‐density pointing references for radio telescopes. Compared with traditional astronomical radio sources used for radio telescope pointing measurement, these satellites exhibit significantly higher signal‐to‐noise ratios (SNRs) and more uniform spatial distribution. However, due to the fact that the majority of these satellites are in low Earth orbit (LEO) and move at high velocities, radio telescopes encounter significant challenges in maintaining stable tracking and carrying out cross‐scan observations. Therefore, a pointing measurement method utilizing drift‐scan toward satellites was proposed. Given the diverse drift directions of satellites, the obtained pointing data encompass a wide range of directions. Therefore, this method is expected to be capable of establishing a pointing model based on scanning data from arbitrary directions. The measurement model and simulation experiments of this method were demonstrated. Furthermore, the feasibility of this method was validated using 25 m Nanshan Radio telescope (NSRT‐25m).",

    "abstract": "The Chelyabinsk meteor entered Earth’s atmosphere on 15 February 2013, producing a shock wave that injured about 1500 people and damaged thousands of buildings. Despite its relatively large size (∼20 m), the progenitor asteroid approached Earth undetected. Its apparent radiant was too close to the Sun for standard ground‐based near‐Earth asteroid (NEA) surveys operating in the visible light. In addition, it would have been very faint due to an observing geometry at a large phase angle, and very fast moving. We examine the potential for early detection with current and upcoming infrared (IR) space telescopes, such as NASA’s upcoming NEOSurveyor mission and ESA’s planned NEOMIR mission. We use the 20‐m Chelyabinsk progenitor to demonstrate detection possibilities and limitations of an object on a day‐side trajectory before impact. IR observations from space offer key advantages like an enhanced Sun‐asteroid contrast (compared to visible wavelengths). The small, fast‐rotating objects are (nearly) isothermal which make IR detections at high phase angles easier compared to visible‐light ones, and allow for radiometric size estimation. The latter is crucial for immediate assessment of the impact risk. The Chelyabinsk asteroid would have entered the field‐of‐regard about 39 h (NEO Surveyor) or 54 h (NEOMIR) before impact. However, we find that a 20‐m object on a Chelyabinsk progenitor orbit could be detected theoretically with a 0.5‐m telescope in space (located at the Lagrangian point L1), at mid‐IR wavelengths, with a lead time of 5–12 days. The large uncertainty in the calculation of the detection lead‐time is mainly related to uncertainties in the flux predictions for small, possibly fast‐rotating asteroids seen under very extreme phase angles. However, technical challenges, including detector operations at high sky background due to the low solar elongation, telescope straylight problems for observations close to the Sun, near real‐time application of synthetic tracking techniques, and fast orbit determination also must be overcome to achieve reliable early warning capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Total electron content (TEC), which quantifies the quantity of free electrons in the Earth’s ionosphere, is a crucial parameter that experiences discrepancies during seismic events. This study investigates the potential of utilizing TEC prediction at the BAKO position in Indonesia during earthquakes. TEC data and solar parameters were collected for six preselected earthquakes, encompassing the earthquake event periods. Three prediction models, namely, ARMA, OKSM 1, and OKSM 2, were employed to predict TEC for a period spanning 8 days. The input parameters required for TEC prediction were obtained from the IONOLAB and OMNIWeb database. The OKSM 1 model is constructed with the input parameters like solar radio flux at 10.7 cm (F10.7), disturbance storm time index (Dst), solar wind (Sw), sunspot number (SSN), and TEC values, while the OKSM 2 model is developed with the parameters like geomagnetic indices (Kp and Ap) and solar indices SSN and F10.7 along with TEC data. The ARMA model is constructed with TEC data. The primary objective of this research is to assess the utility of TEC prediction based on the influence on input parameters for the kriging models and to identify the most effective model for predicting TEC variations associated with seismic events. Four evaluation metrics were systematically utilized to gauge the performance of each model. This rigorous evaluation aims to deliver perceptions into the predictive accuracy, reliability, and potential practical implications of TEC predicting during earthquakes. Upon comparison, the OKSM 2 model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, exhibiting a notable agreement with the true TEC. The results suggest that OKSM 2 holds promise as a reliable model for earthquake‐related TEC prediction. The average RMSE values range from 4.06 to 8.06, indicating the models’ ability to predict seismic events with a reasonable magnitude of error. Similarly, the average MAE values, ranging from 3.32 to 6.71, underscore the models’ overall accuracy in predicting the absolute differences between actual and predicted TEC. The CC values, averaging between 0.97 and 0.99, highlight a strong relationship between predicted and actual TEC values. Additionally, the average sMAPE values, ranging from 0.11 to 0.21, demonstrate the models’ effectiveness in minimizing percentage‐based errors. While variations exist across different earthquakes, these average metrics collectively suggest promising predicting capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Radio frequency interference (RFI) is radio wave interference from natural sources or man‐made models. In radio astronomy research, the signals of celestial objects captured by radio telescopes are extremely weak, and the presence of RFI can significantly mask or distort those signals, reducing the accuracy of observational data and seriously affecting the reliability of scientific conclusions. Therefore, accurate RFI detection from radio astronomy data is of great importance. Currently, most RFI detection methods still rely on traditional methods, but due to the limitations of these methods, they are unable to accurately detect RFI in radio telescope observation data. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning–based RFI detection model named ST‐U 2 Net, which combines the Swin Transformer and the Residual U‐block (RSU) of U 2 ‐Net to form a dual‐encoder architecture. The main encoder enhances the feature representation through the efficient multiscale attention (EMA) mechanism, reorganizes the channel information, captures pixel‐level relationships, and improves the detection accuracy in complex backgrounds. The auxiliary encoder introduces a spatial interaction module (SIM) and a feature compression module (FCM) to enhance the feature representation and reduce the detail loss of narrowband RFI, respectively. In addition, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer is replaced by Kolmogorov–Arnold network (KAN) to enhance the modeling capability of narrowband RFI features. The relational aggregation module (RAM) fuses the characteristics of the two encoders to achieve a more accurate detection of RFI. In this study, the proposed ST‐U 2 Net model is verified using actual observation data collected by the 40‐m radio telescope at Yunnan Observatory. The experimental results show that compared to existing deep learning methods, the model proposed in this study achieves a significant improvement in the accuracy of detecting RFI, especially in the detection of narrowband RFI, which exhibits obvious advantages.",

We show that this model can account simultaneously for the anomalous acceleration and anomalous gravitomagnetic fields around rotating superconductors measured by Tajmar et al. and for the anomalous Cooper pair mass in superconductive Niobium, measured by Cabrera and Tate. It is argued that these three different physical effects are ultimately different experimental manifestations of the simultaneous spontaneous breaking of gauge invariance, and of the principle of general covariance in superconductive materials.",

Here we discuss the criteria for a system that is able to perform such a task and describe two cameras we created for wide‐field monitoring with high temporal resolution—FAVOR and TORTORA. Also, we describe basic principles of real‐time data processing for the high frame rates needed to achieve subsecond temporal resolution on a typical hardware.",

This hypothesis, suggested by Milgrom, has been successful in explaining systematic properties of spiral and elliptical galaxies and predicting in detail the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies with only one additional parameter—a critical acceleration which is on the order of the cosmologically interesting value of c H o . MOND may be viewed as an algorithm for calculating the distribution of force in an astronomical object from the observed distribution of baryonic matter. The fact that it works very well on the scale of galaxies is problematic for cold dark matter (CDM). Here I present evidence in favor of this assertion and claim that this is, in effect, a falsification of CDM on the scale of galaxies.",

Traditional methods are often inadequate not merely because of the size in bytes of the data sets, but also because of the complexity of modern data sets. Mathematical limitations of familiar algorithms and techniques in dealing with such data sets create a critical need for new paradigms for the representation, analysis and scientific visualization (as opposed to illustrative visualization) of heterogeneous, multiresolution data across application domains. Some of the problems presented by the new data sets have been addressed by other disciplines such as applied mathematics, statistics and machine learning and have been utilized by other sciences such as space‐based geosciences. Unfortunately, valuable results pertaining to these problems are mostly to be found in publications outside of astronomy. Here we offer brief overviews of a number of concepts, techniques and developments that are vital to the analysis and visualization of complex datasets and images. One of the goals of this paper is to help bridge the gap between applied mathematics and artificial intelligence on the one side and astronomy on the other.",

Our statistical analysis of the spatial distributions of O/H and N/O, as derived using the direct method or strong-line parameters consistent with it, indicates that metallicity is homogeneous in five out of the six analysed objects in scales of the order of several kpc. Only in the object WR404, a gradient of metallicity is found in the direction of the low surface brightness tail. In contrast,we found an overabundance of N/O in spatial scales of the order of hundreds of pc associated with or close to the positions of the WR stars in 4 out of the 6 galaxies. We exclude possible hydrodynamical causes, such as the metal-poor gas inflow, for this local pollution by means of the analysis of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and mass-nitrogen-to-oxygen relation (MNOR) for the WR galaxies catalogued in the SDSS.",

In this work, it is assumed that the initial angular velocity is sufficiently small to achieve the large parameter instead of the small one. In this manner, a lot of energy used for making the motion initially is saved. The obtained analytical periodic solutions are represented graphically using a computer program to show the geometric periodicity of the obtained solutions in some interval of time. In the end, the geometric interpretation of the stability of a motion is given.",

Using the procedures established by Singh and Abouelmagd, we determined the equations of motion of the infinitesimal body for which we assumed that under the effects of radiation and oblateness of the primaries, its mass varies following Jean’s law. We evaluated analytically and numerically the locations of equilibrium points and examined the stability of these equilibrium points. Finally, we found that all the points are unstable.",

Ground telescopes (GTs) experience interference from intersatellite links (ISLs). Astronomy source radio signals received by GTs are analysed at the high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. Furthermore, observation limitation conditions prevent GTs from conducting radio astronomy observations all the time, thereby causing low HPC utilisation. This paper proposes mechanisms that protect GTs from ISL interference without permanent prevention of ISL data transmission and enhance angular resolution. The ISL transmits data by taking advantage of similarities in the sequence of observed astronomy sources to increase ISL connection duration. In addition, the paper proposes a mechanism that enhances angular resolution by using reconfigurable earth stations. Furthermore, the paper presents the opportunistic computing scheme (OCS) to enhance HPC utilisation. OCS enables the underutilised HPC to be used to train learning algorithms of a cognitive base station. The performances of the three mechanisms are evaluated. Simulations show that the proposed mechanisms protect GTs from ISL interference, enhance angular resolution, and improve HPC utilisation.",

Simulations indicate that halos should all have roughly the same spherically-averaged density profile and kinematic structure, and predict simple distributions of shape, formation history and substructure in density and kinematics, over an enormous range of halo mass and for all common variants of the concordance cosmology. I describe observational progress towards testing these predictions by measuring masses, shapes, profiles and substructure in real halos, using baryonic tracers or gravitational lensing. An important property of simulated halos (possibly the most important property) is their dynamical 'age', or degree of internal relaxation. The age of a halo may have almost as much effect as its mass in determining the state of its baryonic contents, so halo ages are also worth trying to measure observationally. I review recent gravitational lensing studies of galaxy clusters which should measure substructure and relaxation in a large sample of individual cluster halos, producing quantitative measures of age that are well-matched to theoretical predictions. The age distributions inferred from these studies will lead to second-generation tests of the cosmological model, as well as an improved understanding of cluster assembly and the evolution of galaxies within clusters.",

    "abstract": "Galaxy surveys have shown that luminous galaxies are mainly distributed in large filaments and galaxy clusters. The remaining large volumes are virtually devoid of luminous galaxies. This is in concordance with the formation of the large-scale structure in Universe as derived from cosmological simulations. However, the numerical results indicate that cosmological voids are abundantly populated with dark matter haloes which may in principle host dwarf galaxies. Observational efforts have in contrast revealed, that voids are apparently devoid of dwarf galaxies. We investigate the formation of dwarf galaxies in voids by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Due to the cosmic ultra-violet background radiation low-mass haloes show generally are reduced baryon fraction. We determine the characteristic mass below which dwarf galaxies are baryon deficient. We show that the circular velocity below which the accretion of baryons is suppressed is approximately 40 km/s. The suppressed baryon accretion is caused by the photo-heating due to the UV-background. We set up a spherical halo model and show that the effective equation of state of the gas in the periphery of dwarf galaxies determines the characteristic mass. This implies that any process which heats the gas around dwarf galaxies increases the characteristic mass and thus reduces the number of observable dwarf galaxies.",

    "abstract": "We present a new analysis of the two-decade-old controversy over interpretation of satellite observations of total solar irradiance (TSI) since 1978 and the implications of our findings for TSI as a driver of climate change. Our approach compares the methods of constructing the two most commonly referenced TSI composites (ACRIM and PMOD) that relate successive observational databases and two others recently constructed using a novel statistical approach. Our primary focus is on the disparate decadal trending results of the ACRIM and PMOD TSI composite time series, namely, whether they indicate an increasing trend from 1980 to 2000 and a decreasing trend thereafter (ACRIM) or a continuously decreasing trend since 1980 (PMOD). Construction of the four-decade observational TSI composites from 1978 to the present requires the use of results from two less precise Earth Radiation Budget experiments (Nimbus7/ERB and ERBS/ERBE) during the so-called ACRIM-Gap (1989.5–1991.8), between the end of the ACRIM1 and the beginning of the ACRIM2 experiments. The ACRIM and PMOD composites used the ERB and ERBE results, respectively, to bridge the gap. The well-established paradigm of positive correlation between Solar Magnetic Field Strength (SMFS) and TSI supports the validity of the upward trend in the ERB results and the corresponding decadal upward trend of the ACRIM composite during solar cycles 21 and 22. The ERBE results have a sensor degradation caused downward gap trend, contrary to the SMFS/TSI paradigm, that biased the PMOD composite decadal trend downward during solar cycles 21 and 22. The different choice of gap bridging data is clearly the cause of the ACRIM and PMOD TSI trending difference, agreeing closely in both magnitude and direction. We also analyze two recently proposed statistical TSI composites. Unfortunately their methodology cannot account for the gap degradation of the ERBE experiment and their resulting uncertainties are too large to uniquely distinguish between the trending of the ACRIM and PMOD composites. Our analysis supports the ACRIM TSI increasing trend during the 1980 to 2000 period, followed by a long-term decreasing trend since.",

The purpose of this work is to take a close look at MRM data in the polar regions of the Moon and analyze the characteristics of the brightness temperature (TB) in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs), especially where evidence of water ice has been found. First, the comparisons of brightness temperature values in the polar region and in low latitudes show that (1) the periodic diurnal (day/night) variation of TB becomes weak in high latitudes since topography plays a dominant role in determining TB in polar region and (2) seasonal effects are more recognizable in polar region than in low latitudes due to the weak illumination condition. Second, even without direct sun illumination, significant seasonal variations of TBs are observed in PSRs, probably caused by the scattering flux from neighboring topography. TB Ratio (TBR) between channel 1 and channel 4, which indicates the differences of TB at different depths of lunar regolith, is higher and shows stronger seasonal variation in PSR than regions with direct illumination. Third, overall the distribution of high TBR values is in consistence with the water ice distributions obtained by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument, the LAMP UV spectra, and the Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer. The proportion of the summation over area with water ice proof in the regions of interest is 0.89 and 0.56 in south pole and north pole, respectively. The causes of the correlation of high TBR between different microwave frequencies and stability of water ice deposits still require further investigation, but MRM data shows unique characteristic in PSRs and could provide important information about the upper few meters of lunar regolith.",

We find that the total mass loss rate in the Galactic centre due to stellar collisions is sensitive to the present-day mass function adopted. We use the observed x-ray luminosity in the Galactic centre to preclude any present-day mass functions that result in mass loss rates $> 10^{-5} \\mathrm{M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}}$ in the vicinity of $\\sim 1\"$.

    "abstract": "The Mount Wilson magnetic classification of sunspot groups is thought to be meaningful to forecast flares’ eruptions. In this paper, we adopt a deep learning method, CornerNet-Saccade, to perform the Mount Wilson magnetic classification of sunspot groups. It includes three stages, generating object locations, detecting objects, and merging detections. The key technologies consist of the backbone as Hourglass-54, the attention mechanism, and the key points’ mechanism including the top-left corners and the bottom-right corners of the object by corner pooling layers. These technologies improve the efficiency of detecting the objects without sacrificing accuracy. A dataset is built by a total of 2486 composited images which are composited with the continuum images and the corresponding magnetograms from HMI and MDI. After training the network, the sunspot groups in a composited solar full image are detected and classified in 3 seconds on average. The test results show that this method has a good performance, with the accuracy, precision, recall, and mAP as 0.94, 0.93, 0.94, and 0.90, respectively.

Since ubiquitous power laws are manifestations of the principle of least action, we interpret the spectrum accordingly. Our analysis complies with understanding that low-energy particles originate mostly from rapidly receding sources throughout the cosmos. The flux peaks about proton rest energy whereafter it decreases because fewer and fewer receding sources are energetic enough to provide particles with high enough velocities to compensate for the recessional velocities. Above 10 15.6 eV the flux from the expanding Universe diminishes below the flux from the nearby nonexpanding part of the Universe. In this spectral feature, known as the “knee,” we relate to a distance of about 1.3 Mpc where the gravitational potential tallies the energy density of free space. At higher energies particles decelerate in a dissipative manner to attain thermodynamic balance with the vacuum. At about 10 17.2 eV a distinct dissipative mechanism opens up for protons to slow down by electron-positron pair production. At about 10 19.6 eV a more effective mechanism opens up via pion production. All in all, the universal principle discloses that the broad spectrum of cosmic rays probes the structure of space from cosmic distances down to microscopic details.",

The proposed model for the calculation of the modulated cosmic ray intensity obtained from the combination of solar indices and heliospheric parameters gives a very satisfactory value of the standard deviation. The best reproduction of the cosmic ray intensity is obtained by taking into account solar and interplanetary indices such as sunspot number, interplanetary magnetic field, CME-index, and heliospheric current sheet tilt.

While neutrinos must stay confined inside the horizon, the antineutrinos should be violently ejected. Hence, a black hole (made from matter) should behave as a point-like source of antineutrinos.

Potential resonant transition or resonant flyby may occur depending on the possibility of the spacecraft approaching the Moon.

    "abstract": "Overexposure may happen for imaging of solar observation as extremely violet solar bursts occur, which means that signal intensity goes beyond the dynamic range of imaging system of a telescope, resulting in loss of signal. For example, during solar flare, Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) often records overexposed images/videos, resulting loss of fine structures of solar flare. This paper makes effort to retrieve/recover missing information of overexposure by exploiting deep learning for its powerful nonlinear representation which makes it widely used in image reconstruction/restoration. First, a new model, namely, mask-Pix2Pix network, is proposed for overexposure recovery. It is built on a well-known Pix2Pix network of conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). In addition, a hybrid loss function, including an adversarial loss, a masked L1 loss and a edge mass loss/smoothness, are integrated together for addressing challenges of overexposure relative to conventional image restoration. Moreover, a new database of overexposure is established for training the proposed model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mask-Pix2Pix network can well recover missing information of overexposure and outperforms the state of the arts originally designed for image reconstruction tasks.",

In this work, the dynamics of Sun-Moon gravitation (SMG) were explored for a rotating Earth and were determined to have a long memory in magma, a mostly ignored geophysical fluid with a mass ~3,400 times that of the atmosphere plus the oceans. Using the basic motion and gravitation (including obliquity) of the Sun and the Moon, we determined that SMG-induced magma motion could produce paleoclimatic variations with multiple periods (e.g., ~23, ~40, ~80, and ~100 ky), with considerable power for Earth’s heat. Such “reproducible” power could possibly maintain an energetic Earth against collapse, radioactivity, and cooling.",

For the last ~7 years it has been exhibiting a continuous optical and near-IR brightening along with a change of the emission-line spectrum appearance and cooling of the star's photosphere. We present the object's $V$--band light curve, analyze the spectral variations, and compare the observed properties with those of other recognized Galactic LBVs, such as AG Car and HR Car.

The SIM is able to detect structural characteristics of a given data set, and has proven to be highly valuable in CMB analysis. It was used for comparing the data set with simulations as well as surrogates, which are full sky maps generated by randomisation of previously selected features of the original map. During these investigations, strong evidence for non-Gaussianities as well as asymmetries and local features could be detected.

Compared with the traditional control method based on the average orbit elements and LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) control method, the SDRE control method has higher control precision and is more suitable for the advantages of continuous control in practical engineering. Finally, the parameter values of the sun-earth libration point L2 are substituted in the equation and simulation is performed.

The importance comes from the fact that these neutrinos point back to the most energetic particle accelerators in the Universe and provide information about their underlying acceleration mechanisms. Atmospheric neutrinos are a background for these challenging measurements, but their rate is expected to be negligible above ≈1 PeV. In this work we describe the feasibility to study ultrahigh-energy neutrinos based on the Earth-skimming technique, by detecting the charged leptons produced in neutrino-nucleon interactions in a high mass target. We propose to detect the charged leptons, or their decay products, with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory and use as a large-mass target for the neutrino interactions the Pico de Orizaba volcano, the highest mountain in Mexico. In this work we develop an estimate of the detection rate using a geometrical model to calculate the effective area of the observatory. Our results show that it may be feasible to perform measurements of the ultrahigh-energy neutrino flux from cosmic origin during the expected lifetime of the HAWC observatory.",

Given the difficulties in measuring accurate SEDs over a wide range of frequencies and in complex environments, many of these detections require more data to confirm them as emitting significant AME. The contribution from optically thick free-free emission from UCHII regions may be also be significant in some cases. The AME emissivity, defined as the ratio of the AME brightness to the 100 micron brightness, is comparable to the value observed in high-latitude diffuse cirrus in some regions, but is significantly lower in others. However, this value is dependent on the dust temperature. More data, both at high frequencies (>5 GHz) and high resolution (~1 arcmin or better) is required to disentangle the emission processes in such complex regions.",

In various stages of the relativistic jet propagation, cosmic-ray ion acceleration and subsequent neutrino emission are expected. GRBs are popular candidate sources of the highest-energy cosmic rays, and their prompt phase has been most widely discussed. IceCube nondetection of PeV neutrinos coincident with GRBs has put interesting constraints on the standard theoretical prediction. The GRB-UHECR hypothesis can critically be tested by future observations. We also emphasize the importance of searches for GeV-TeV neutrinos, which are expected in the precursor/orphan or prompt phase, and lower-energy neutrinos would be more guaranteed and their detections even allow us to probe physics inside a progenitor star. Not only classical GRBs but also low-power GRBs and transrelativistic supernovae can be promising sources of TeV-PeV neutrinos, and we briefly discuss implications for the cumulative neutrino background discovered by IceCube.",

We present the results about the infall rate histories, the formation of the disk, and the evolution of the radial distributions of diffuse and molecular gas surface density, stellar profile, star formation rate surface density, and elemental abundances of C, N, O, and Fe, finding that the radial gradients for these elements begin steeper and flatten with increasing time or decreasing redshift, although the outer disks always show a certain flattening for all times. With the resulting star formation and enrichment histories, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for each radial region by using the ones for single stellar populations resulting from the evolutive synthesis model POPSTAR . With these SEDs we may compute finally the broad band magnitudes and colors radial distributions in the Johnson and in the SLOAN/SDSS systems which are the main result of this work. We present the evolution of these brightness and color profiles with the redshift.",

Here, we briefly review the applications of this method in the afterglow theory. By relating these diverse features to the central engines of GRBs, we find that the steep optical rebrightenings would be caused by the fall-back accretion of black holes, while the shallow optical rebrightenings are the consequence of the injection of the electron-positron-pair wind from the central magnetar. These studies provide useful ways to probe the characteristics of GRB central engines.",

They provide unique laboratory to investigate fundamental physical processes under extreme conditions. Due to extreme luminosities, GRBs are detectable at very high redshifts and potential tracers of cosmic star formation rate at early epoch. While the launch of Swift and Fermi has increased our understanding of GRBs tremendously, many new questions have opened up. Radio observations of GRBs uniquely probe the energetics and environments of the explosion. However, currently only 30% of the bursts are detected in radio bands. Radio observations with upcoming sensitive telescopes will potentially increase the sample size significantly and allow one to follow the individual bursts for a much longer duration and be able to answer some of the important issues related to true calorimetry, reverse shock emission, and environments around the massive stars exploding as GRBs in the early Universe.",

Classification of stellar spectra by applying deep learning is an important research direction for the automatic classification of high-dimensional celestial spectra. In this paper, a robust ensemble convolutional neural network (ECNN) was designed and applied to improve the classification accuracy of massive stellar spectra from the Sloan digital sky survey. We designed six classifiers which consist six different convolutional neural networks (CNN), respectively, to recognize the spectra in DR16. Then, according the cross-entropy testing error of the spectra at different signal-to-noise ratios, we integrate the results of different classifiers in an ensemble learning way to improve the effect of classification. The experimental result proved that our one-dimensional ECNN strategy could achieve 95.0% accuracy in the classification task of the stellar spectra, a level of accuracy that exceeds that of the classical principal component analysis and support vector machine model.",

Cross-analysis of the subsurface WEH values from DAN passive measurements with the distribution of hydrated minerals over the surface of Gale crater according to Specialized Browse Product Mosaics is performed for the initial 20 km part of traverse.

The increase is shown to be higher with the more prominent spectral signature on the surface. Similar WEH increase for the two other types of hydrated minerals, such as monohydrated sulfates and phyllosilicates, was not found for the tested part of the traverse. Polyhydrated sulfates being a part of the sedimentary deposits composing the surface of Gale crater should have considerable thickness that is necessary for the subsurface neutron sensing by DAN measurements.",

    "abstract": "Subreflector misalignment of a large steerable radio telescope induces a pointing error and reduces the gain of the antenna system. To improve the antenna’s operational efficiency, it is necessary to measure and adjust the position and attitude of the subreflector in real time. In this paper, a method based on a position sensitive detector (PSD) and laser array without an optical system is proposed to measure the six degree-of-freedom (DOF) poses of the subreflector. The laser emitted by the laser module array ensures that the PSD can be covered as it moves with the subreflector, and the PSD can obtain more than three laser beams. These ensure the measurement of all attitude changes of a large-aperture antenna subreflector. The two-dimensional coordinates of the centroids of three laser spots are extracted using the PSD, and then the bursa model is established to complete the coordinate transformation. Finally, the 6-DOF attitude information of the antenna subreflector is obtained. The results of a 6.05 m measurement simulation show that it can obtain high 6-DOF PSD attitude information. The experimental results show that the 6-DOF position and attitude information of the subreflector at a distance of 5.78 m can be obtained within seconds. Moreover, the error of the translation is within 0.014 mm and the error of the rotation is within 0.37°. This method can meet the pose measurement requirements of the subreflector.",

Using Kolmogorov‐Smirnov statistics together with parametric fits based on a robust estimator, we find a birth rate of ~1/(1000 years) for AXPs/SGRs and their associated SNRs. These high rates suggest that all massive stars (greater than ~(23–32) M ⊙ ) give rise to remnants with magnetar‐like fields. Observations indicate a limited fraction of high magnetic fields in these progenitors; thus our study is suggestive of magnetic field amplification. Dynamo mechanisms during the birth of the neutron stars require spin rates much faster than either observations or theory indicate. We propose that massive stars produce neutron stars with normal (~10 12 G) magnetic fields, which are then amplified to 10 14 ‐10 15 G after a delay of hundreds of years. The amplification is speculated to be a consequence of color ferromagnetism and to occur with a delay after the neutron star core reaches quark deconfinement density (i.e., the quark‐nova scenario). The delayed amplification allows one to interpret simultaneously the high birth rate and high magnetic fields of AXPs/SGRs and their link to massive stars.",

Further understanding of what these galaxies reveal about cosmology and the small scale structure of dark matter relies in large part on a more detailed interpretation of their internal kinematics. This article discusses a likelihood formalism that extracts important quantities from the kinematic data, including the amplitude of rotation, proper motion, and the mass distribution. In the simplest model the projected error on the rotational amplitude is shown to be $\\sim 0.5 $ km s$^{-1}$ with $\\sim 10^3$ stars from either classical or ultra-faint satellites. The galaxy Sculptor is analyzed for the presence of a rotational signal; no significant detection of rotation is found, and given this result limits are derived on the Sculptor proper motion. A criteria for model selection is discussed that determines the parameters required to describe the dark matter halo density profiles and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Applied to four data sets with a wide range of velocities, the likelihood is found to be more sensitive to variations in the slope of the dark matter density profile than variations in the velocity anisotropy. Models with variable radial velocity anisotropy are shown to be preferred relative to those in which this quantity is constant at all radii in the galaxy.",

The quasar host galaxies have been resolved in 25 out of 26 observed targets. Host galaxy luminosities and stellar masses are computed, under reasonable assumptions on their star formation histories. Combining these results with those from our previous studies, we manage to extend the sampled parameter space of the Mbh-Mhost relation in quasars. The relation holds over 2 dex in both the parameters, similarly to what observed in low-luminosity AGN and in quiescent galaxies. For the first time, we are able to measure the slope of the Mbh-Mhost relation in quasars. We find that it is consistent with the linear case (similarly to what observed in quiescent galaxies).

To study the day-to-day variations of LYRA irradiance, we have compared the LYRA irradiance values (observed Sun as a star) measured in Aluminum filter channel (171 Å–500 Å) with spatially resolved full-disk integrated intensity values measured with SWAP (174 Å) and Ca II K 1 Å index values (ground-based observations from NSO/Sac Peak) for the period from 01 April 2010 to 15 Mar 2011. We found that there is a good correlation between these parameters. This indicates that the spatial resolution of SWAP complements the high temporal resolution of LYRA. Hence SWAP can be considered as an additional radiometric channel. Also the K emission index is the integrated intensity (or flux) over a 1 Å band centered on the K line and is proportional to the total emission from the chromosphere; this comparison clearly explains that the LYRA irradiance variations are due to the various magnetic features, which are contributing significantly. In addition to this we have made an attempt to segregate coronal features from full-disk SWAP images. This will help to understand and determine the actual contribution of the individual coronal feature to LYRA irradiance variations.",

    "abstract": "The Planck 28.5 GHz maps were searched for potential Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) regions on the scale of ~ 3° or smaller, and several new regions of interest were selected. Ancillary data at both lower and higher frequencies were used to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which seem to confirm an excess consistent with spinning dust models. Here we present higher resolution observations of two of these new regions with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Small Array (AMI SA) between 14 and 18 GHz to test for the presence of a compact ( ~ 10 arcmin or smaller) component. For AME-G107.1+5.2, dominated by the Hii region S140, we find evidence for the characteristic rising spectrum associated with either the spinning dust mechanism for AME or an ultra- /hypercompact Hii region across the AMI frequency band; however, for AME-G173.6+208 we find no evidence for AME on scales of ~ 2–10 arcmin.",

We update our previous results the lack of a dependence of the Mass-Metallicity relation with the starformation rate, including new unpublished data. Finally we discuss on the relation between the ionization conditions in the nebulae and the underlying stellar population.

NIRS0S is a magnitude (mB 12.5 mag) and inclination (< 65o) limited sample of 200 nearby galaxies, mainly S0s. It uses deep Ks -band images, typically reaching a surface brightness of 23.5 mag arcsec^(-2) . Detailed visual and photometric classifications were made, for the first time coding also the lenses in a systematic manner. As a comparison sample, a similar sized spiral galaxy sample with similar image quality was used. The main emphasis were to study whether the S0s are former spirals in which star formation has been ceased, and also, how robust are bars in galaxies. Based on our analysis the Hubble sequence was revisited: following the early idea by van den Bergh we suggested that the S0s are spread throughout the Hubble sequence in parallel tuning forks as spirals (S0a, S0b, S0c etc.). This is evidenced by our improved bulge-to-total (B/T) flux ratios, reaching as small values as typically found in late-type spirals. The properties of bulges and disks in S0s were found to be similar to those in spirals. Also, the masses and scale parameters of the bulges and disks were found to be coupled. Bars were found to be fairly robust both in S0s and spirals, but inspite of that bars might evolve significantly within the Hubble sequence.",

In this paper, we review the physical process of accretion onto magnetized NS in X-ray binary systems. We, firstly, give an introduction to accretion-powered NSs and review the accretion mechanism in X-ray binaries. This review is mostly focused on accretion-induced evolution of NSs, which includes scenario of NSs both in high-mass binaries and in low-mass systems.",

The GLT is a 12-m submm telescope to be located at the top of the Greenland ice sheet, where the high-altitude and dry weather porvides excellent conditions for observations at submm wavelengths. With its combination of wavelength window and rapid responding system, the GLT will explore new insights on GRBs. Summarizing the current achievements of submm GRB follow-ups, we identify the following three scientific goals regarding GRBs: (1) systematic detection of bright submm emissions originating from reverse shock (RS) in the early afterglow phase, (2) characterization of forward shock and RS emissions by capturing their peak flux and frequencies and performing continuous monitoring, and (3) detections of GRBs as a result of the explosion of first-generation stars result of GRBs at a high redshift through systematic rapid follow ups. The light curves and spectra calculated by available theoretical models clearly show that the GLT could play a crucial role in these studies.",

Three different types of concave kite configurations are considered based on the masses of the primaries. In case I, one pair of primaries has equal masses; in case II, two pairs of primaries have equal masses; in case III, three of the primaries have equal masses. For all three cases, the regions of central configuration are obtained using both analytical and numerical techniques. The existence and uniqueness of equilibrium positions of the infinitesimal mass are investigated in the gravitational field of the four primaries. It is numerically confirmed that none of the equilibrium points are linearly stable. The Jacobian constant <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M5\"> <mi>C</mi> </math> is used to investigate the regions of possible motion of the infinitesimal mass.",

    "abstract": "This study is about the effects of Yukawa-like corrections to Newtonian potential on the existence and stability of noncollinear equilibrium points in a circular restricted three-body problem when bigger primary is an oblate spheroid. It is observed that ∂x0/∂λ = 0 = ∂y0/∂λ at λ0 = 1/2, so we have a critical point λ0 = 1/2 at which the maximum and minimum values of x0 and y0 can be obtained, where λ ∈ (0, ∞) is the range of Yukawa force and (x0, y0) are the coordinates of noncollinear equilibrium points. It is found that x0 and y0 are increasing functions in λ in the interval 0 &lt; λ &lt; λ0 and decreasing functions in λ in the interval λ0 &lt; λ &lt; ∞ for all α ∈ α+. On the other hand, x0 and y0 are decreasing functions in λ in the interval 0 &lt; λ &lt; λ0 and increasing functions in λ in the interval λ0 &lt; λ &lt; ∞ for all α ∈ α−, where α ∈ (−1, 1) is the coupling constant of Yukawa force to gravitational force. The noncollinear equilibrium points are found linearly stable for the critical mass parameter β0, and it is noticed that ∂β0/∂λ = 0 at <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <msup> <mrow> <mi>λ</mi> </mrow> <mi>∗</mi> </msup> </math> = 1/3; thus, we got another critical point which gives the maximum and minimum values of β0.

Application of the standard reductive perturbation theory is used to derive the corresponding three-dimensional nonlinear a complex Ginzburg–Landau (3D-CGLE) equation which governs the dynamics of the dust-acoustic wave packets. The stationary analytical solutions of the CGLE are numerically analysed where the effect of the physical parameters of the dusty plasma model on the wave’s propagation is taken into account. It has been found that there can be a relationship between the appearance of soliton waves and electromagnetic waves, as well as between shock-like waves and periodic travelling waves. Expression of the importance of these findings is the cornerstone of explaining the true relationship between the propagation of nonlinear waves in the physics of space, for example, the Earth’s magnetic field.",

    "abstract": "MOND is a phenomenological modification of Newton′s law of gravitation which reproduces the dynamics of galaxies, without the need for additional dark matter. This paper reviews the basics of MOND and its application to dwarf galaxies. MOND is generally successful at reproducing stellar velocity dispersions in the Milky Way′s classical dwarf ellipticals, for reasonable values of the stellar mass‐to‐light ratio of the galaxies; two discrepantly high mass‐to‐light ratios may be explained by tidal effects. Recent observations also show MOND describes tidal dwarf galaxies, which form in complex dynamical environments. The application of MOND to galaxy clusters, where it fails to reproduce observed gas temperatures, is also reviewed. Relativistic theories containing MOND in the non‐relativistic limit have now been formulated; they all contain new dynamical fields, which may serve as additional sources of gravitation that could reconcile cluster observations with MOND. Certain limits of these theories can also give the accelerating expansion of the Universe. The standard dark matter cosmology boasts numerous manifest triumphs; however, alternatives should also be pursued as long as outstanding observational issues remain unresolved, including the empirical successes of MOND on galaxy scales and the phenomenology of dark energy.",

    "abstract": "Sky brightness measuring and monitoring are required to mitigate the negative effect of light pollution as a byproduct of modern civilization. Good handling of a pile of sky brightness data includes evaluation and classification of the data according to its quality and characteristics such that further analysis and inference can be conducted properly. This study aims to develop a classification model based on Random Forest algorithm and to evaluate its performance. Using sky brightness data from 1250 nights with minute temporal resolution acquired at eight different stations in Indonesia, datasets consisting of 15 features were created to train and test the model. Those features were extracted from the observation time, the global statistics of nightly sky brightness, or the light curve characteristics. Among those features, 10 are considered to be the most important for the classification task. The model was trained to classify the data into six classes (1: peculiar data, 2: overcast, 3: cloudy, 4: clear, 5: moonlit-cloudy, and 6: moonlit-clear) and then tested to achieve high accuracy (92%) and scores ( F -score = 84% and G -mean = 84%). Some misclassifications exist, but the classification results are considerably good as indicated by posterior distributions of the sky brightness as a function of classes. Data classified as class-4 have sharp distribution with typical full width at half maximum of 1.5 mag/arcsec 2 , while distributions of class-2 and -3 are left skewed with the latter having lighter tail. Due to the moonlight, distributions of class-5 and -6 data are more smeared or have larger spread. These results demonstrate that the established classification model is reasonably good and consistent.",

    "abstract": "Billions of years ago, the Northern Hemisphere of Mars may have been covered by at least one ocean and thousands of lakes and rivers. These findings, based initially on telescopic observations and images by the Mariner and Viking missions, led investigators to hypothesize that stromatolite fashioning cyanobacteria may have proliferated in the surface waters, and life may have been successfully transferred between Earth and Mars via tons of debris ejected into the space following bolide impact. Studies conducted by NASA’s robotic rovers also indicate that Mars was wet and habitable and may have been inhabited in the ancient past. It has been hypothesized that Mars subsequently lost its magnetic field, oceans, and atmosphere when bolides negatively impacted its geodynamo and that the remnants of the Martian seas began to evaporate and became frozen beneath the surface. As reviewed here, twenty-five investigators have published evidence of Martian sedimentary structures that resemble microbial mats and stromatolites, which may have been constructed billions of years ago on ancient lake shores and in receding bodies of water, although if these formations are abiotic or biotic is unknown. These findings parallel the construction of the first stromatolites on Earth. The evidence reviewed here does not prove but supports the hypothesis that ancient Mars had oceans (as well as lakes) and was habitable and inhabited, and life may have been transferred between Earth and Mars billions of years ago due to powerful solar winds and life-bearing ejecta propelled into the space following the bolide impact.",

Here we take the approach that by addressing a fundamental unresolved issue in quantum theory, we can gain a better understanding of the problem. Our starting point is the observation that the notion of classical time is external to quantum mechanics. Hence there must exist an equivalent reformulation of quantum mechanics which does not refer to an external classical time. Such a reformulation is a limiting case of a more general quantum theory which becomes nonlinear on the Planck mass/energy scale. The nonlinearity gives rise to a quantum‐classical duality which maps a “strongly quantum, weakly gravitational” dynamics to a “weakly quantum, strongly gravitational” dynamics. This duality predicts the existence of a tiny nonzero cosmological constant of the order of the square of the Hubble constant, which could be a possible source for the observed cosmic acceleration. Such a nonlinearity could also be responsible for the collapse of the wave function during a quantum measurement.",

Based on the results of impact experiments and assuming a power law for the mass distribution in a differential form, we obtained the cumulative number of fragments as a function of the fragment mass m normalized to the total mass of fragments, the mass fraction of the largest fragment(s), the number of the largest fragments, and the power index. The formula for the cumulative number of fragments of a disrupted body is used to describe the results of impact experiments for different fragmentation types.

In this context, radiative balance alone between The Sun and the Earth was not sufficient to explain the early presence of liquid water on Earth’s surface. This difficulty is called the faint young Sun paradox. Many proposals have been published to solve this paradox. In the present work, we propose an oversimplified finite-time thermodynamic approach that describes the air convective cells in the Earth atmosphere. This model introduces two atmospheric modes of thermodynamic performance: a first mode consisting in the maximization of the power output of the convective cells (maximum power regime) and a second mode that consists in maximizing a functional representing a good trade-off between power output and entropy production (the ecological regime). Within the assumptions of this oversimplified model, we present different scenarios of albedo and greenhouse effects that seem realistic to preserve liquid water on the Earth in the early stage of formation.",

    "abstract": "I review the recent progresses that have been obtained, especially through the use of high-resolution numerical simulations, on the dynamics of self-gravitating accretion discs. A coherent picture is emerging, where the disc dynamics is controlled by a small number of parameters that determine whether the disc is stable or unstable, whether the instability saturates in a self-regulated state or runs away into fragmentation, and whether the dynamics is local or global. I then apply these concepts to the case of AGN discs, discussing the implications of such evolution on the feeding of supermassive black holes. Nonfragmenting, self-gravitating discs appear to play a fundamental role in the process of formation of massive black hole seeds at high redshift ( 10–15) through direct gas collapse. On the other hand, the different cooling properties of the interstellar gas at low redshifts determine a radically different behaviour for the outskirts of the accretion discs feeding typical AGNs. Here the situation is much less clear from a theoretical point of view, and while several observational clues point to the important role of massive discs at a distance of roughly a parsec from their central black hole, their dynamics is still under debate.",

The review is focused on important physical effects that were disregarded in earlier studies for the sake of simplicity and recently accounted for by us, including grain wobbling due to internal relaxation, impulsive excitation by single-ion collisions, the triaxiality of grain shape, charge fluctuations, and the turbulent nature of astrophysical environments. Implications of the spinning dust emission for constraining physical properties of tiny dust grains and environment conditions are discussed. We discuss the alignment of tiny dust grains and possibility of polarized spinning dust emission.

Extragalactic observations of the AME have started as well, and high resolution is even more important in this kind of observations. When cross-correlating with IR-dust emission, high angular resolution is also of fundamental importance in order to obtain unbiased results. The choice of the observational frequency is also of key importance in continuum observation. We calculate a merit function that accounts for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in AME observation given the current state-of-the-art knowledge and technology. We also include in our merit functions the frequency dependence in the case of multifrequency observations. We briefly mention and compare the performance of four of the largest radiotelescopes in the world and hope the observational programs in each of them will be as intense as possible.",

A high-precision heading-determination method will always play a significant role in the rover’s autonomous navigation system, and the precision of the measured heading strongly affects the navigation results. In order to improve the heading precision to the 1-arcminute level, this paper puts forward a novel calibration algorithm for solving the comparable distortion of large-field sun sensor by introducing an antisymmetric matrix. The sun sensor and inclinometer alignment model are then described in detail to maintain a high-precision horizon datum, and a strict sun image centroid-extraction algorithm combining subpixel edge detection with circle or ellipse fitting is presented. A prototype comprising a sun sensor, electronic inclinometer, and chip-scale atomic clock is developed for testing the algorithms, models, and methods presented in this paper. Three field tests were conducted in different months during 2017. The results show that the precision of the heading determination reaches 0.28–0.97′ (1 σ ) and the centroid error of the sun image and the sun elevation are major factors that affect the heading precision.",

For low-cost star sensors with small field of view, fusion of observed images from multiple fields of view is performed and a novel recognition algorithm based on path optimization by randomly distributed ant colony is proposed. According to pheromone intensity, the ant colony can autonomously figure out a close optimal path without starting or ending point, rather than certifying a starting point first. Feature patterns extracted from the optimal path in guiding template and observed image after fusion are compared to perform star recognition. By the proposed algorithm, starting point for path optimization has no influence on the extracted feature pattern. Thus the star recognition rate is improved due to the higher stability of the extracted pattern. Simulations indicate that the algorithm improves recognition accuracy and robustness against noise for sensors with multiple fields of view.",

In order to understand the cause of the solar cycle variation of TSI, we use extension of wavelet transform, wavelet coherence (WTC), and partial wavelet coherence (PWC), to revisit this issue. The WTC of TSI with sunspot area shows that the two time series are very coherent on timescales of one solar cycle, but the PWC of TSI with sunspot area, which can find the results of WTC after eliminating the effect of the Mg II index, indicates that the solar cycle variation of TSI is not related to sunspots on the solar surface. The coherence of two time series at these timescales should be due to a particular phase relation between sunspots and TSI. The WTC and PWC of TSI with Mg II index show that the solar cycle variation of TSI is highly related to Mg II index, which reflects the relation of TSI with the long-term part of Mg II index that shows the intensification contribution by the small magnetic features to TSI. Consequently, the solar cycle variation of TSI is dominated by the small magnetic features on the solar full disk. Additionally, we also show the combined effects of the sunspot darkening and the intensification contribution represented by Mg II index to TSI on timescales of a few days to several months and indicate that the faculae increase TSI and contribute to its variation at these timescales.",

    "abstract": "This work is the extension of author’s research, where the modified theory of induced gravity (MTIG) is proposed. In the framework of the MTIG, the mechanism of phase transitions and the description of multiphase behavior of the cosmological scenario are proposed. The theory describes two systems (stages): Einstein (ES) and “restructuring” (RS). This process resembles the phenomenon of a phase transition, where different phases (Einstein’s gravitational systems, but with different constants) pass into each other. The hypothesis that such transitions are random and lead to stochastic behavior of cosmological parameters is considered. In our model, effective gravitational and cosmological “constants” arise, which are defined by the “mean square” of the scalar fields. These parameters can be compared with observations related to the phenomenon of dark energy. The aim of the work is to solve equations of MTIG for the case of a quadratic potential and compare them with observational cosmology data. The interaction of fundamental scalar fields and matter in the form of an ideal fluid is introduced and investigated. For the case of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time, numerical solutions of nonlinear MTIG equations are obtained using the qualitative theory of dynamical systems and mathematical computer programs. For the case of a linear potential, examples joining of solutions, the ES and RS stages, of the evolution of the cosmological model are given. It is shown that the values of such parameters as “Hubble parameter” and gravitational and cosmological “constants” in the RS stage contain solutions oscillating near monotonically developing averages or have stochastic behavior due to random transitions to different stages (RS or ES). Such a stochastic behavior might be at the origin of the tension between CMB measurements of the value of the Hubble parameter today and its local measurements.",

    "abstract": "The mean mass densities of cosmic dark matter is larger than that of baryonic matter by a factor of about 5 in the $\\Lambda$CDM universe. Therefore, the gravity on large scales should be dominant by the distribution of dark matter in the universe. However, a series of observations incontrovertibly show that the velocity and density fields of baryonic matter are decoupling from underlying dark matter field. This paper shows our attemps to unveil the physics behind this puzzle. In linear approximation, the dynamics of the baryon fluid is completely governed by the gravity of the dark matter. Consequently, the mass density field of baryon matter $\\rho_b({\\bf r},t)$ will be proportional to that of dark matter $\\rho_{\\rm dm}({\\bf r},t)$, even though they are different from each other initially. In weak and moderate nonlinear regime, the dynamics of the baryon fluid can be sketched by Burgers equation. A basic feature of the Burgers dynamics is to yield shocks. When the Reynolds number is large, the Burgers fluid will be in the state of Burgers turbulence, which consists of shocks and complex structures. On the other hand, the collisionless dark matter may not show such shock, but a multivalued velocity field. Therefore, the weak and moderate nonlinear evolution leads to the IGM-dark matter deviation. Yet, the velocity field of Burgers fluid is still irrotational, as gravity is curl-free. In fully nonlinear regime, the vorticity of velocity field developed, and the cosmic baryonic fluid will no longer be potential, as the dynamics of vorticity is independent of gravity and can be self maintained by the nonlinearity of hydrodynamics. In this case, the cosmic baryon fluid is in the state of fully developed turbulence, which is statistically and dynamically decoupling from dark matter. This scenario provides a mechanism of cohenent explanation of observations.",

    "abstract": "We consider the short-lived radionuclide (SLR) <sup>36</sup>Cl in calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) found in primitive meteorites with the solar wind implantation model. In this model, SLRs are produced via nuclear reaction with solar energetic particles (SEPs) interacting with gaseous targets in the protosolar atmosphere in T-Tauri stars. These SLRs are captured by the solar wind and then implanted in CAI precursor materials, which have dropped from the funnel flow leading onto the protostar. This method of incorporating SLRs into solar system materials is currently active in our solar system and has been measured with SLRs from the solar wind being implanted on the lunar surface. T-Tauri stars are capable of SEP fluxes <i>&#x7e;</i>10<sup>5</sup> greater than contemporary SEP fluxes. Here we scale the production rate of <sup>36</sup>Cl to the ancient SEP activity. From the enhanced production rates and the refractory mass inflow rate at 0.06&#x2009;AU from the protosun, we model the ancient <sup>36</sup>Cl content in CAIs.

The adiabaticity is removed by including the optically thin radiative losses, thermal conduction, and heating term in energy equation. We present a local theory of MHD waves to obtain a dispersion relation. The dispersion relation is solved numerically to study the time damping of these waves. It is found that flow influences the damping time and damping per period of both the slow and fast waves significantly. Damping time and damping per period of slow waves are very much higher than the damping time and damping per period of fast waves.",

    "abstract": "Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) was first identified\r\nin the late 1990s, through sensitive high frequency radio CMB\r\nobservations. The usual emission mechanisms (e.g., blackbody,\r\nsynchrotron, and free-free) did not appear to be able\r\nto account for the excess emission in the frequency range 10–\r\n60GHz. Since then, a large body of observational evidence\r\nhas emerged showing that AME appears to be emitted both\r\nin the diffuse interstellar medium at large, and from specific\r\nclouds within our galaxy. Detections from star-forming\r\nregions in an external galaxy have also been made. Nevertheless,\r\ndetailed measurements have been difficult due to the frequency\r\nrange (difficult to observe from the ground) and confusion\r\nwith other emission mechanisms that emit in this frequent\r\nrange. The most promising candidate for the AME\r\nis electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains\r\n(spinning dust emission). This was first predicted in the\r\nlate 50s, with major developments in the theory over the\r\nlast 15 years. The theory predicts a peaked spectrum which\r\nemits at frequencies from about 10GHz to over 100GHz,\r\nbut with a wide range of peak frequencies and emissivities,\r\nwhich depend on the local environment and dust grain size\r\ndistribution. There is still significant debate about the true\r\nnature of the AME, and both observations and theory are still\r\nrelatively unexplored. An exciting possibility is to use detailed\r\nradio observations of spinning dust to study the interstellar\r\nmedium, in a complementary way to the optical, UV, and\r\ninfrared domains. This special issue is dedicated to the study\r\nof AME.",

The tensor-to-scalar ratio concerning the curvature perturbation is worked out for the potential under consideration which is another significant observable and comes out to be nonnegative. In multifield models of inflation, both types of curvature and isocurvature perturbations exist, while, in the present work, during the slow-roll, isocurvature perturbations are suppressed and therefore can be neglected. The surviving perturbations which are due to the curvature only can be tackled suitably by a mechanism developed by Sasaki and Stewart known as Sasaki–Stewart formalism. The effect of augmenting the number of e-folds on the power spectrum through the spectral index and its impact on the observable parameters of the slow-roll inflationary phase is observed by carrying out the analysis. It is observed analytically that the spectrum of multifield inflation is effectively different than its corresponding single-field inflation.

We apply the Finch–Skea ansatz in the static and spherically symmetric geometry to obtain the analytic solution of the derived field equations in the Rastall theory of gravity. We match the internal solution to the corresponding external Schwarzschild space‐time in order to determine the values of the unknown constants involved in the Rastall field equations due to the Finch–Skea ansatz. The resulting model is applied to a few prominent compact stars in order to verify its physical viability. Energy conditions, the TOV equation, stability analysis via sound speeds (radial and transverse in this case), equation of state parameters, mass function, compactness, and surface redshift are some of the analytical expressions that are examined in this inquiry. In order to verify the physical acceptance of the obtained results, we provided a graphical analysis of some necessary analytical expressions. Also, the numerical values of some physical parameters are calculated and are presented in the tabular form to observe the Buchdahl limit and some other important criterion. We note that our model is well consistent with the physical requirements.",

In this stage, the three elements, carbon, oxygen, and neon, are synthesized. The present paper is twofold: firstly, it develops an analytical solution to the system of the conformable fractional differential equations of the helium burning network, where we used, for this purpose, the series expansion method and obtained recurrence relations for the product abundances, that is, helium, carbon, oxygen, and neon. Using four different initial abundances, we calculated 44 gas models covering the range of the fractional parameter <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><a:mi>α</a:mi><a:mo>=</a:mo><a:mn>0.5</a:mn><a:mo>−</a:mo><a:mn>1</a:mn></a:math> with step <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><c:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</c:mi><c:mi>α</c:mi><c:mo>=</c:mo><c:mn>0.05</c:mn></c:math> . We found that the effects of the fractional parameter on the product abundances are small which coincides with the results obtained by a previous study. Secondly, we introduced the mathematical model of the neural network (NN) and developed a neural network algorithm to simulate the helium burning network using a feed-forward process. A comparison between the NN and the analytical models revealed very good agreement for all gas models. We found that NN could be considered as a powerful tool to solve and model nuclear burning networks and could be applied to the other nuclear stellar burning networks.",

This type of monitor represents a low‐cost device suitable for easy replication and still able to detect brighter optical transients simultaneously to GRB triggers. Such OTs have been observed for some of the GRBs such as GRB990123, GRB060117, or recently GRB080319 indicating that some fraction of GRBs can generate optical transient emission accessible by simple small aperture instrumentation as described here. These efforts are accompanied by development of dedicated programmes to access and to evaluate all‐sky images; these efforts will be also briefly described. The All‐Sky Monitor is a space variant optical system and its point spread function (PSF) has not uniform shape in the field of view. The processing and measuring of image data is complicated, and sophisticated deconvolution algorithms are used for image restoration. The second method is the GRB detection based on their ionospheric response.",

We used archival GALEX (FUV and NUV) and SDSS images, as well as Hyperleda and NED databases, to constrain its global properties. GALEX FUV/NUV images show that UGC 7639 inner regions are composed mostly by young stellar populations. In addition, we used smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with chemo-photometric implementation to account for its formation and evolution. UGC 7639 is an example of blue dwarf galaxy whose global properties are well matched by our multi-wavelength and multi-technique approach, that is also a suitable approach to highlight the evolution of these galaxies as a class. We found that the global properties of UGC 7639, namely its total absolute B-band magnitude, its whole spectral energy distribution (SED), and its morphology are well-matched by an encounter with a system four times more massive than our target. Moreover, the current star formation rate (SFR) of the simulated dwarf, ~0.03 M_sun yr-1, is in good agreement with our UV-based estimate. For UGC 7639, we estimated a galaxy age of 8.6 Gyr. Following our simulation, the ongoing star formation will extinguish within 1.6 Gyr, thus leaving a red dwarf galaxy.",

    "abstract": "The difference of photon arrival time, which is known as spectral lag, is well known characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In particular, long duration GRBs show a soft lag which means that high energy photons arrive earlier than soft photons. The lag-luminosity relation is the empirical relationship between the isotropic peak luminosity and the spectral lag. We calculated the spectral lags for 40 known redshift GRBs observed by Swift addition to the previous 31 GRB samples. We confirmed that most of our samples follow the lag-luminosity relation. However, we noticed that there are some GRBs which show a significant scatter from the relation. We also confirm that the relationship between the break time and the luminosity of the X-ray afterglow (so-called Dainotti relation) extends up to the lag-luminosity relation.",

    "abstract": "Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) is an observational technique that has revolutionized our understanding of extended objects in the Universe since the last decade. IFS provides unique contributions to the study ofGalactic ionized nebulae, extragalactic HII regions, and galaxies in the local and in the early Universe, which in some aspects are complementary to the high precision performance of existing wide area photometric and single-aperture spectroscopic surveys. The power of this technique is the possibility of gathering complete spectroscopic information across the spatial extension of astrophysical objects, thus allowing the study of physical spatial variations of their properties, this being specially significant for those properties related to their metal content and star formation activity. With this special issue we want to cover the most relevant aspects related to IFS, in order to illustrate to the reader the wide scope opened by this observational technique. In what follows we present the main contents of this special issue split by subject. Two papers of this issue are devoted to modeling the chemical evolution of spiral and dwarf galaxies by M. Molla and S. Recchi. Theoretical models are a key ingredient in order to be compared with the observational data since either their predictions open new observational avenues or they are constrained by new observational results. Both aspects must walk hand in hand to make progress in the field. Two papers follow, dealing with the study of Galactic objects. The one by L. Lopez-Martin mostly addresses some aspects of the particular technical problems of IFS data handling. A paper by A. Mesa-Delgado faces the chemical abundance discrepancy problem applied to Galactic Herbig Haro objects in the Orion nebula, illustrating how IFS can help to shed light on this issue. A set of four papers follows focused on extragalactic studies with fiber-fed spectrographs: the first two papers, by E. Perez-Montero et al. and P. Lagos and P. Papaderos, deal with the chemical properties of star-forming (HII/BCD) dwarf galaxies and with the interplay of theWR stellar population on the metal enrichment of the interstellar medium. The remaining two papers of this block, by F. F. RosalesOrtega and S. F. Sanchez, are focused on the properties of the HII regions in spiral galaxies and review most recent results on chemical abundance gradients obtained from IFS observations. Last but not least, a set of two papers of this issue are devoted to the description and main properties of two ongoing experiments/instruments. One is a wide-field integral field spectrograph, by G. A. Blanc, with applications in several astrophysical fields, in particular in the study of the properties of nearby galaxies. The second one, by L. Drissen et al., explains the basics of the operation of imaging Fourier transform spectrometers (IFTS), an interesting alternative to the traditional dispersive spectrographs due to their wide field of view, and it shows the main goals that can be achieved using them in the study of the chemical evolution of astrophysical objects.",

It provides a web-based environment where users can do research in astronomy by observing with robotic telescopes and/or by analyzing data that other users have acquired with GLORIA or from other free-access databases. Network of 17 telescopes allows users to control selected telescopes in real time or schedule any more demanding observation. This paper deals with new opportunity that GLORIA project provides to teachers and students of various levels of education. At the moment, there are prepared educational materials related to events like Sun eclipse (measuring local atmosphere changes), Aurora Borealis (calculation of Northern Lights height), or transit of Venus (measurement of the Earth-Sun distance). Student should be able to learn principles of CCD imaging, spectral analysis, basic calibration like dark frames subtraction, or advanced methods of noise suppression. Every user of the network can design his own experiment. We propose advanced experiment aimed at obtaining astronomical image data with high dynamic range. We also introduce methods of objective image quality evaluation in order to discover how HDR methods are affecting astronomical measurements.",

    "abstract": "The higher the pointing accuracy of the radio telescope, the more obvious the influence of wind disturbance on antenna performance. Taking the site of the 110 m aperture QiTai radio Telescope (QTT) as an example, the terrain and air flow characteristics of the site are studied. It is found that the wind direction with high incoming wind frequency and relatively high speed is mostly located in the mountain gap on the periphery of the antenna. If the wind resistance facilities are precisely arranged in the upstream tuyere, the wind speed in the antenna area can be effectively reduced. This study proposes a method to control the wind flow at a telescope site based on the precise arrangement of the windbreak fence. The windbreak fence simulation model is constructed using the theory of porous jump. The mean error of the simulation results is less than 14% compared to the wind tunnel measured data, indicating that the constructed windbreak fence model has high reliability. The computational domain model of the working conditions for the site is constructed. The extreme condition of the windbreak fence arrangement is considered, and the simulation results show that the wind speed in the antenna area can be reduced by more than 30% through the control of the windbreak fence. It verifies the feasibility of the method of controlling the wind flow by the windbreak fence for the site which provides a reference for the subsequent research on the precise arrangement of the windbreak fence.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the importance of the Sun’s large-scale magnetic field to the Sun-Planetary environment. This paper narrows its focus down to the motion and evolution of the photospheric large-scale magnetic field which affects many environments throughout this region. For this purpose we utilize a newly developed Netlogo cellular automata model. The domain of this algorithmic model is the Sun’s photosphere. Within this computational space are placed two types of entities or agents; one may refer to them as bluebirds and cardinals; the former carries outward magnetic flux and the latter carries out inward magnetic flux. One may simply call them blue and red agents. The agents provide a granularity with discrete changes not present in smooth MHD models; they undergo three processes: birth, motion, and death within the photospheric domain. We discuss these processes, as well as how we are able to develop a model that restricts its domain to the photosphere and allows the deeper layers to be considered only through boundary conditions. We show the model’s ability to mimic a number of photospheric magnetic phenomena: the solar cycle (11-year) oscillations, the Waldmeier effect, unipolar magnetic regions (e.g. sectors and coronal holes), Maunder minima, and the march/rush to the poles involving the geometry of magnetic field reversals. We also discuss why the Sun sometimes appears as a magnetic monopole, which of course requires no alteration of Maxwell’s equations.",

The spectrometer Ma_MISS (Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface, Coradini and Da Pieve, 2001) will investigate the lateral wall of the borehole generated by the drill, providing hyperspectral images. It is not fully clear if water ice can be found in the subsurface at Oxia Planum. However, Ma_MISS has the capability to characterize and map the presence of possible ices, in particular water ice. We performed simulations of the subsurface temperatures by varying the thermal inertia, and we quantified the effects of self-heating. Moreover, we quantified the heat released by the drilling operations, by exploring different frictional coefficients and angular drill velocities, in order to evaluate the lifetime of possible water ice.",

Each system uses a 9‐cm Maksutov‐type telescope. The effective focal length is 225 cm, corresponding to an f ‐ratio of 25. The field of view is 0.62 degree square. The images are taken with a 16‐bit 1024 × 1024 CCD camera. The telescope is equipped with UBVRI filters. Each telescope is fully automated. The telescope can be operated either interactively or fully automatically. In the interactive mode, it can be controlled through the Internet. In the fully automatic mode, the telescope operates with preset parameters without any human care, including taking dark frames and flat frames. The network can also be used for studies that require continuous observations for selected objects.",

Because these programs are implemented as servers—clearly separated from the higher levels—scientific instruments, for example, telescopes, can be operated both in a user‐controlled mode (GUI, telnet ) and in a fully automated mode by use of a script. Astronomical instruments such as telescopes or spectrographs will be responded to by ASCII command strings, which are the same for all clients. In case a device control software does not support multiclient operation or in case it is used together with other devices in a complex measuring procedure, it is worthwhile implementing an intermediate layer that relieves the individual device control servers of routine tasks and provides for a safer operational sequence. In addition, the system may make use of an easy‐to‐learn script language specialised for controlling fully automated processes.",

In order to test this scheduling strategy we use a modified version of the genetic scheduler developed for the telescope control system RTS2. In particular, we present example schedules designed for a future 50 cm telescope that will expand the capabilities of the CHASE survey, which aims to detect young supernova events in nearby galaxies.

Complicated structures combining these various components maybe cause restoration failure when using conventional algorithms. Furthermore, the images at different frequencies band are pretty different. Therefore, restoration method for solar radio image is different from other radio sources. Some image restoration methods were applied and obtained good results on Nancay radioheliograph images and Nobeyama radioheliograph images, and some new methods were introduced into processing these complicated solar radio images in recent years. For a new radioheliograph with ultrawide frequency band, new image restoration method which can maximize function of telescope is demanded. Different images could be obtained from the same visibilities data by using different weighting functions in imaging processing. In this paper, a new restoration method for solar radio image was proposed. Two images with different weighting functions from the same data are combined in this method. This restoration method has applied to data processing of Mingantu spectral radioheliograph.",

The method consists of several modules: adaptive background module, candidate CME area detection module, and CME detection module. The core of the method is based on adaptive background learning, where CMEs are assumed to be a foreground moving object outward as observed in running-difference time series. Using the static and dynamic features to model the corona observation scene can more accurately describe the complex background. Moreover, the method can detect the subtle changes in the corona sequences while filtering their noise effectively. We applied this method to a month of continuous corona images, compared the result with CDAW, CACTus, SEEDS, and CORIMP catalogs and found a good detection rate in the automatic methods. It detected about 73% of the CMEs listed in the CDAW CME catalog, which is identified by human visual inspection. Currently, the derived parameters are position angle, angular width, linear velocity, minimum velocity, and maximum velocity of CMES. Other parameters could also easily be added if needed.",

In extradimensional models, we can infer that the four-dimensional matter rises as a geometric manifestation of the extra coordinate. In this way, although we still cannot see the extra dimension, we can relate it to physical quantities that are able to exert such a mechanism of matter induction in the observable universe. In this work we propose that scalar fields are those physical quantities. The models here presented are purely geometrical no matter the fact that Lagrangian is assumed and even the scalar fields are contained in the extradimensional metric. The results are capable of describing different observable cosmic features and yield an alternative to ultimately understand the extra dimension and the mechanism in which it is responsible for the creation of matter in the observable universe.",

We compare in detail LYRA channel 2–4 and SWAP integrated flux in July 2010 and in particular during the solar eclipse that occurred on July 11, 2010. During this eclipse, the discrepancy between the two data channels can be explained to be related to the occultation of active region 11087 by the Moon. In the second half of July 2010, LYRA channel 2–4 and SWAP integrated flux deviate from each other, but these differences can also be explained in terms of features appearing on the solar disk such as coronal holes and active regions. By additionally comparing with timeline of EVE/ESP, we can preliminarily interpret these differences in terms of the difference between the broad bandpass of LYRA channel 2–4 and the, relatively speaking, narrower bandpass of SWAP.",

The expansion of universe is dependent on the dark energy and implies a creation of space; we admit that the space creation mechanism is related to the deformed bosons and so is the dark energy. In order to relate the dark energy and the mechanism for creation of space, we consider Verlinde’s proposal including the Holographic principle for emergence of space, which was recently applied to the deformed bosons. To check the validity of our mechanism, we calculate the ratio of the size of universe before and after the expansion and compare the results with the observational data.

    "abstract": "Estimating the cosmological microwave background is of utmost importance for cosmology. However, its estimation from full-sky surveys such as WMAP or more recently Planck is challenging: CMB maps are generally estimated via the application of some source separation techniques which never prevent the final map from being contaminated with noise and foreground residuals. These spurious contaminations whether noise or foreground residuals are well known to be a plague for most cosmologically relevant tests or evaluations; this includes CMB lensing reconstruction or non-Gaussian signatures search. Noise reduction is generally performed by applying a simple Wiener filter in spherical harmonics; however, this does not account for the non-stationarity of the noise. Foreground contamination is usually tackled by masking the most intense residuals detected in the map, which makes CMB evaluation harder to perform. In this paper, we introduce a novel noise reduction framework coined LIW-Filtering for Linear Iterative Wavelet Filtering which is able to account for the noise spatial variability thanks to a wavelet-based modeling while keeping the highly desired linearity of the Wiener filter. We further show that the same filtering technique can effectively perform foreground contamination reduction thus providing a globally cleaner CMB map. Numerical results on simulated Planck data are provided.",

The fast reaction response mode for GRB reaction (typically with response times below 3 minutes from the GRB onset) still needs some development and testing. The telescope is usually operated in legacy interactive mode, with periods of supervised autonomous runs under RTS2. We show the preliminary results of several GRBs followed up with observer intervention during the testing phase of the 1.23m control software upgrade.",

    "abstract": "We present the observations of penumbra like features (PLFs) near a polarity inversion line (PIL) of flaring region. The PIL is located at the moat boundary of active region (NOAA 10960). The PLFs appear similar to sunspot penumbrae in morphology but occupy small area, about 6$\\times10^{7}$ km$^{2}$, and are not associated with sunspot or pore. We observed a rapid disappearance of the PLFs after a C1.7 class flare, which occurred close to the PIL. The local correlation tracking (LCT) of these features shows presence of horizontal flows directed away from the end-points of the PLFs, similar to the radial outward flow found around regular sunspots, which is also known as the moat flow. Hard X-ray emission, coincident with the location of the PLFs, is found in RHESSI observations, suggesting a spatial correlation between the occurrence of the flare and decay of the PLFs. Vector magnetic field derived from the observations obtained by Hinode spectro-polarimeter SOT/SP instrument, before and after the flare, shows a significant change in the horizontal as well as the vertical component of the field, after the flare. The weakening of both the components of the magnetic field in the flare interval suggests that rapid cancellation and/or submergence of the magnetic field in PLFs occurred during the flare interval.",

First, the model is summarized. It is now shown how to compute the SED with this model. Then the model is adjusted by asking that the SED predicted at our local position in the Galaxy coincides with the available observations. Finally, the first predictions of the model for the spatial variation of the SED in the Galaxy are compared with those of a radiation transfer model. We find that the two predictions do not differ too much. This indicates that, in a future work, it should be possible with the present model to check if the “interaction energy” predicted by an alternative, scalar theory of gravitation, contributes to the dark matter.",

    "abstract": "Filaments are a type of wide-existing astronomical structure. It is a challenge to separate filaments from radio astronomical images, because their radiation is usually weak. What is more, filaments often mix with bright objects, e.g., stars, which makes it difficult to separate them. In order to extract filaments, A. Men’shchikov proposed a method “getfilaments” to find filaments automatically. However, the algorithm removed tiny structures by counting connected pixels number simply. Removing tiny structures based on local information might remove some part of the filaments because filaments in radio astronomical image are usually weak. In order to solve this problem, we applied morphology components analysis (MCA) to process each singe spatial scale image and proposed a filaments extraction algorithm based on MCA. MCA uses a dictionary whose elements can be wavelet translation function, curvelet translation function, or ridgelet translation function to decompose images. Different selection of elements in the dictionary can get different morphology components of the spatial scale image. By using MCA, we can get line structure, gauss sources, and other structures in spatial scale images and exclude the components that are not related to filaments. Experimental results showed that our proposed method based on MCA is effective in extracting filaments from real radio astronomical images, and images processed by our method have higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).",

Therefore, this research investigates the empirical association between geomagnetic activity and stock market return. Overall, we find that geomagnetic activity exerts a negative influence on the return of the US stock market. Further, market liquidity effectively magnifies the effect of geomagnetic activity. Inconsistent with previous literature, this effect is not mainly caused by the semiannual variation of geomagnetic activity. Our research contributes to the introduction of geomagnetic indices to financial economics studies on the impact of geomagnetic activity influence on stock market return.",

Our current understanding of the universe is not yet fully prepared for the possibility that antimatter has negative gravitational mass. This paper proposes a model of cosmology, where the state of high energy density of the big bang is created by the collapse of an antineutrino star that has exceeded its Chandrasekhar limit. To allow the first neutrino stars and antineutrino stars to form naturally from an initial quantum vacuum state, it helps to assume that antimatter has negative gravitational mass. This assumption may also be helpful to identify dark energy. The degenerate remnant of an antineutrino star can today have an average mass density that is similar to the dark energy density of the ΛCDM model. When in hydrostatic equilibrium, this antineutrino star remnant can emit isothermal cosmic microwave background radiation and accelerate matter radially. This model and the ΛCDM model are in similar quantitative agreement with supernova distance measurements. Therefore, this model is useful as a purely academic exercise and as preparation for possible future discoveries.",

By comparing our light curves with those published by previous investigators, it is detected that the O'Connell effect on the light curves is disappeared. By analyzing those multi-color light curves with the Wilson-Devinney code (W-D code), it is discovered that V1853 Ori is an A-type intermediate-contact binary with a degree of contact factor of $f=33.3\\%(3.7\\%)$ and a mass ratio of $q=0.1896(0.0013)$. Combining our 10 new determined times of light minima together with the others published in the literature, the period changes of the system is investigated. We found that the general trend of the observed-calculated $(O-C)$ curve shows a downward parabolic variation that corresponds to a long-term decrease in the orbital period with a rate of $dP/dt=-1.96(0.46)\\times{10^{-7}}$ d yr$^{-1}$. The long-term period decrease could be explained by mass transfer from the more-massive component to the less-massive one. By combining our photometric solutions with the Gaia DR 2 data, absolute parameters were derived as $M_{1}$ = 1.20 M$_{\\odot}$, $M_{2}$ = 0.23 M$_{\\odot}$, $R_{1}$ = 1.36 R$_{\\odot}$, and $R_{2}$ = 0.66 R$_{\\odot}$.

Traditionally, the complexes of activity have been identified from observations of active regions (ARs). Here, we show that a complex of activity comprises both (AR) and coronal holes (CHs). Our analysis is based on observations of magnetic fields of various scales, SOHO/MDI data, and UV observations of CH. The analysis has corroborated the existence of complexes of activity that involve AR and equatorial CH. Both AR and CH are embedded in an extended magnetic region dominated by the magnetic field of one sign, but not strictly unipolar. It is shown that the evolution of CH and AR is a single process. The relationship between the fields of various scales in the course of a cycle is discussed.",

First, the opposite deformation jig and welding process were designed for the QTT’s azimuth track. Then, the welding process was numerically simulated using a finite element model. The simulation results show that a better welding effect will be obtained by appropriately reducing the opposite force on the basis of the original. The three deformation processes of the track are regulated by the opposite deformation jig. The results show that the opposite deformation jig designed for QTT’s azimuth track can make the amount of deformation and flatness meet the design requirements. Finally, nondestructive testing was carried out to check the welding quality of the track surface and interior. The results show that there are no obvious defects in the welds of the azimuth track. The constraint jig and welding processes designed for QTT are effective and feasible.",

Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory is currently the largest field of view (FOV) integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph in the world (1.7'x1.7'). It was designed as a prototype for the highly replicable VIRUS spectrograph which consists of a mosaic of IFUs spread over a 16' diameter FOV feeding 150 spectrographs similar to the Mitchell. VIRUS will be deployed on the 9.2 meter Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) and will be used to conduct the HET Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). Since seeing first light in 2007 the Mitchell Spectrograph has been widely used, among other things, to study nearby galaxies in the local universe where their internal structure and the spatial distribution of different physical parameters can be studied in great detail. These observations have provided important insight into many aspects of the physics behind the formation and evolution of galaxies and have boosted the scientific impact of the 2.7 meter telescope enormously. Here I review the contributions of the Mitchell Spectrograph to the study of nearby galaxies, from the investigation of the spatial distribution of dark matter and the properties of supermassive black holes, to the studies of the process of star formation and the chemical composition of stars and gas in the ISM, which provide important information regarding the formation and evolution of these systems. I highlight the fact that wide field integral field spectrographs on small and medium size telescopes can be powerful cost effective tools to study the astrophysics of galaxies. Finally I briefly discuss the potential of HETDEX for conducting studies on nearby galaxies. The survey parameters make it complimentary and competitive to ongoing and future surveys like SAMI and MANGA.",

Nevertheless, the two-point correlation function is a power-law with the usual exponent $\\gamma=1.71$--$1.82$, which varies with luminosity. The mass concentration property allows us to make a meaningful analysis of the angular distribution of the full flux-limited sample.

    "abstract": "We make a systematic examination of the basic theory of general relativity and reemphasize the meaning of coordinates. Firstly, we prove that Einsteinʼs gravitational field equation has the light speed invariant solution and black holes are not an inevitable prediction of general relativity. Second, we show that the coupling coefficient of the gravitational field equation is not unique and can be modified as <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mn>4</mn> <mi>π</mi> <mi>G</mi> </math> to replace the previous <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mo>−</mo> <mn>8</mn> <mi>π</mi> <mi>G</mi> </math> , distinguish gravitational mass from the inertial mass, and prove that dark matter and dark energy are not certain existence and the expansion and contraction of the universe are proven cyclic, and a new distance-redshift relation which is more practical is derived. After that, we show that galaxies and celestial bodies are formed by gradual growth rather than by the accumulation of existing matter and prove that new matter is generating gradually in the interior of celestial bodies. For example, the radius of the Earth increases by 0.5 mm every year, and its mass increases by 1.2 trillion tons. A more reasonable derivation of the precession of planetary orbits is given, and the evolution equation of planetary orbits in the expanding space-time is also given. In a word, an alive universe unfolds in front of readers and the current cosmological difficulties are given new interpretations.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth in astronomical spectra produced by large sky survey telescopes, traditional manual classification processes can no longer fulfill the requirements of precision and efficiency of spectral classification. There is an urgent need to employ machine learning approaches to conduct automated spectral classification tasks. Feature extraction is a critical step which has a great impact on any classification result. In this paper, a novel gradient-based method together with principal component analysis is proposed for the extraction of partial features of stellar spectra, that is, a feature vector indicating obvious local changes in data, which corresponds to the element line positions in the spectra. Furthermore, a general feature vector is utilized as an additional characteristic centering on the overall tendency of spectra, which can indicate stellar effective temperature. The two feature vectors and raw data are input into three neural networks, respectively, for training and each network votes for a predicted category of spectra. By selecting the class having the maximum votes, different types of spectra can be classified with high accuracy. The experimental results prove that a better performance can be achieved using the partial and general methods in this paper. The method could also be applied to other similar one-dimensional spectra, and the concepts proposed could ultimately expand the scope of machine learning application in astronomical spectral processing.",

    "abstract": "Aims. The complex dynamics of bodies, originating from the interplanetary matter and passing through Earth’s atmosphere, defines their further position, velocity, and final location on Earth’s surface in the form of meteorites. One of the important factors that affect the movement of a body in the atmosphere is its shape and orientation. Our goal is to model the interaction of real shape meteoroids with Earth’s atmosphere and compare the results with the standard spherical body approach. Methods. In the simulation, we use 3D models of fragments of the Košice meteorite with different sizes and shapes. Using a 3D model of fragments, we consider the real shape of the body to define its resistance properties during atmospheric transition more specifically. The simulation is performed using virtual wind tunnel in the MicroCFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software to obtain more realistic drag coefficients and using the µ(m)-Trajectory software to model the particle trajectory in the atmosphere including the wind profile. The final outputs from these programs are the drag coefficient as a function of the altitude and the particle orientation. Using these parameters we get the more realistic body trajectory and the impact area coordinates. Comparison of the results for real and spherical model meteorite impact location is discussed. Results. Simulation showed significant differences in trajectory and the impact area for the different real body orientations compared to the spherically symmetric body. Also, an important result is a difference in the impact area of the real body with a specific orientation without rotation and the body with considered rotation. The significant difference between the modeled impact of a real shape body and its real place of finding compared to a spherically symmetric body indicates the importance of the method used.",

    "abstract": "Conventional equilibrium statistical mechanics of open gravitational systems is known to be problematical. We first recall that spherical stars/galaxies acquire unbounded radii, become infinitely massive, and evaporate away continuously if one uses the standard Maxwellian distribution f B (which maximizes the usual Boltzmann‐Shannon entropy and hence has a tail extending to infinity). Next, we show that these troubles disappear automatically if we employ the exact most probable distribution f (which maximizes the combinatorial entropy and hence possesses a sharp cutoff tail). Finally, if astronomical observation is carried out on a large galaxy, then the Poisson equation together with thermal de Broglie wavelength provides useful information about the cutoff radius r K , cutoff energy ε K , and the huge quantum number K up to which the cluster exists. Thereby, a refinement over the empirical lowered isothermal King models, is achieved. Numerically, we find that the most probable distribution (MPD) prediction fits well the number density profile near the outer edge of globular clusters.",

The simulation results show that the accuracy of Mars position is expected to be better than 50 m for 180-day prediction, when 90-150 days’ range measurements are used to estimate the orbit of the Mars. Range bias affects the prediction accuracy and the arc length for estimation is limited. The prediction accuracy will improve with higher orbit, and the orbit error of probes has an obvious effect on the prediction accuracy of the Martian ephemeris.",

This paper proposes a novel scanning method based on autoguiding system so as to expand the FOV of fiber array solar optical telescope (FASOT) in possession of the special structure in optics and machine. Meanwhile, corresponding experiments are conducted in the FASOT prototype, FASOT-1B, in order to demonstrate that, for both FASOT and FASOT-1B, the proposed scanning method is feasible. First of all, on the basis of the software and hardware characteristics of FASOT and FASOT-1B, the three key technologies related to the proposed scanning method are described: quickly locating and pointing the first scanning step, the closed-loop controlling of multistep scanning, and the disturbance suppression of every scanning step based on Kalman filter. Afterwards, experiments are conducted and corresponding results show that the proposed scanning method is robust for the random disturbances forced on every scanning step and able to meet the scanning requirement of both FASOT and FASOT-1B .",

These local anomalies appear as diffraction in LPR data, which reduces the data quality and limits the structural analysis of lunar regolith. According to the kinematics characteristics of rock caused diffraction, we transform these problems to a problem of steep dip decreasing. To reach this goal, we adopt a data preprocessing workflow to improve the quality of the radar image, firstly. Then, a dip filter based on adaptive f-x empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is proposed to extract the rocks in the regolith and the corresponding removed IMF map indicates the degree of rock enrichment and highlights regolith-basement interface.

Although the track-alidade interaction model is commonly used to investigate the pointing effect of track unevenness (such as the works on DSN 34 m antennas and the Green Bank Telescope), few experiments have been done to test the effectiveness of this model independently from the overall pointing model. To address this issue, a method utilizing an optical pointing telescope (OPT) for determining the impact of track unevenness on pointing is proposed. This method uses a group of reference pointing data collected by an OPT mounted at the bottom of the antenna alidade to extract the twist effect of the alidade from the radio telescope pointing data, thus compared with the predicted twist by the track-alidade model. This method was applied to the 26 meter Nanshan Radio Telescope (NSRT 26 m), achieving good agreement with the model-predicted values.",

The study was conducted based on GPS data taken from the IISC receiver located in Bangalore, India, during the SEs which happened on 26.12.2019 and 21.06.2020. The TEC data were examined to assess the effect of solar eclipses on TEC values. Eighty-day prior TEC data for the IISC station are gathered from IONOLAB servers along with the other parameter data like Dst, Ap, F10.7, and Kp taken from OMNIWEB servers which were used to predict TEC. The reliability of the forecasted results is evaluated using numerical factors like Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. The study demonstrates the usefulness of combining multiple methods for analyzing TEC variations during SEs and highlights the potential of OKSM, FFNN, and DeepAR models for studying TEC variation in the same context. The findings may be useful for satellite broadcasting and navigational services and for further research into the influence of solar eclipses on the TEC changes.",

At this boundary, we obtain that the radial pressure is proportionate to the time‐dependent term of the field and is not zero. Lastly, we investigate the correlation between dark matter and gravitational waves and find that exotic terms disrupt the transmission of gravitational waves.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to explore the evolution of the universe in the background of Palatini f ( R ) gravity. Considering Amendola Gannouji Polarski Tsujikawa (AGPT) f ( R ) gravity model, we perform a dynamical system analysis within the FLRW universe in order to analyze the impacts of this gravity model on large‐scale structure and dynamics of universe. With the aid of fixed points and eigenvalues, stability properties are analyzed to study long term behavior of universe. For analyzing the feasibility of different phases of universe, the equation of state parameter ω eff was utilized. We found that for the f ( R ) model under consideration, the results correspond to both of the early as well as the late time epochs for the said f ( R ) model.",

    "abstract": "The receiver is a signal receiving device in a radio telescope system. As an important parameter to characterize the receiver performance, noise temperature is very practical to calibrate accurately. The traditional receiver noise temperature calibration method is the cold and ambient load method. Through the establishment of K-band ambient receiver, and its amplitude calibration test platform of the cold and ambient load method, chopper wheel method, and ambient and hot load method, comparison and analysis of the above three methods were carried out. The test and calculation results show that the test accuracy of the cold and ambient load method is about 1.3%, that of the chopper wheel method (nonlow elevation) is about 3%, and that of the ambient and hot load method is about 9%. The test accuracy of the ambient and hot load method is slightly lower than that of the above two methods. The analysis is mainly due to the uncertainty of the hot load temperature and the small temperature difference between the two loads, which leads to the deterioration of the overall accuracy. But the advantage is that the method can perform real-time calibration in the process of observation, and it is easier to implement than the traditional cold and ambient load method. The results of noise temperature measurement are compared with those of theoretical calculation, the error is basically within 10%, and it can satisfy the demand of the noise temperature test. In the future, we expect that on the basis of increasing the hot load temperature, further experiments were carried out on the thermostatic treatment of hot load and the accuracy of temperature acquisition, and finally we hope that this method can better meet the testing requirements of receiver noise temperature and radio source amplitude calibration.",

    "abstract": "A systematic examination of the basic theory of general relativity is made, the meaning of coordinates again is emphasized, the confusion caused by unclear meaning of coordinates in the past is corrected, and the expression of the theory is made more accurate. Firstly, the equation of Einstein’s gravitational field is solved in the usual coordinate system, the existence of light speed invariant solution in the spherically symmetric gravitational field is proved, and in the same time, the solution is determined. It turns out that black holes are not an inevitable prediction of general relativity. The more exact formulas for calculating the curvature of light on the surface of the Sun and the precession angle of the orbit of Mercury are given, and the convergence of general relativistic gravity and special relativistic mechanics under the weak field approximation is realized. Finally, it is shown that the coupling coefficient of the gravitational field equation is not unique. Modifying this coefficient is an ideal project to eliminate the singularities of general relativity on the condition keeping the field equation concise and elegant, and moreover, it reveals that dark matter and dark energy are the negative energy field in the matter, the expansion of the universe is the appearance of the gradual formation of galaxies in accordance with fractal rules, not only the space between galaxies is expanding but also the galaxies themselves are also expanding, new matter is continuously generated in the celestial bodies, for the first time, the unity of fractal geometry and cosmic dynamics of general relativity is realized, and the formation and evolution of galaxies are brought into the fractal generation mode. This is a living and vivacious universe in which all aspects are gradually strengthening, in sharp contrast to the dying universe under the current cosmological framework.",

The equations for the liberation points are derived including the charge per unit mass as the controlling parameter.

    "abstract": "The influence of the 15th January 2010 annular solar eclipse on traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) and equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) is studied using data from six global navigation and satellite system (GNSS) receivers spread across the path of annularity over the low latitude region of East Africa. The GNSS receivers are stationed at Nairobi (RCMN), Malindi (MAL2), and Eldoret (MOIU) in Kenya; Mbarara (MBAR) in Uganda; Kigali (NURK) in Rwanda; and Mtwara (MTWA) in Tanzania. The study period ranges from 12th to 18th January 2010, three days before and after the 15th January 2010 annular solar eclipse. The year 2010 marked the beginning phase of solar cycle 24, evidently observed in low total electron content (TEC) values and the disturbed storm time index (Dst). The eclipse started at 7 : 06 LT and ended at 10 : 14 LT, with MOIU and RCMN experiencing eclipse magnitudes of 0.946 and 0.93, respectively. The maximum obscuration occurred between 8 : 21 LT and 8 : 34 LT across most of the stations. A detrending on vertical TEC (VTEC) derived from GNSS receivers across or close to the path of totality revealed a reduction of ∼2-3 TECU during the maximum phase of the eclipse. The level of reduction was highly close to the totality path and decreased smoothly away from the totality path. Using a background polynomial fitting technique on diurnal TEC, we analyzed TIDs along NURK-MBAR-MOIU and MOIU-RCMN-MAL2 GPS arrays. The results revealed a wavelike perturbation with a virtual horizontal velocity of 830m/s and ∼1 TECU amplitude propagating eastward along the MOIU-RCMN-MAL2 GPS array. The study reports a moderate scintillation activity of 0.5 ≤ ROTI ≤ 0.9 values, demonstrating the presence of few EPBs over the region. The results show a latitudinal variation in GPS-TEC scintillation activities and suggest a possible influence of the eclipse on the observed increase in average scintillation levels across East Africa.",

The distance modulus of 82 GRBs at z > 1.4 can be calibrated with the sample at z <= 1.4 by using the cubic spline interpolation method from the Union2.1 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) set. We investigate the joint constraints on the Cardassian expansion model and dark energy with 580 Union2.1 SNe Ia sample (z < 1.4) and 82 calibrated GRBs' data (1.4 < z <= 8.2). In Lambda CDM, we find that adding 82 high-z GRBs to 580 SNe Ia significantly improves the constraint on Omega(m)-Omega(Lambda) plane. In the Cardassian expansion model, the best fit is Omega(m) = 0.24(-0.15)(+0.15) and n = 0.16(-0.52)(+0.30) (1 sigma), which is consistent with the Lambda CDM cosmology (n = 0) in the 1 sigma confidence region. We also discuss two dark energy models in which the equation of state omega(z) is parameterized as omega(z) = omega(0) and omega(z) = omega(0) + omega(1)z/(1+z), respectively. Based on our analysis, we see that our universe at higher redshift up to z = 8.2 is consistent with the concordance model within 1 sigma confidence level.",

However, the X-ray afterglow that was measured with the Swift-XRT and Newton XMM have the canonical behaviour of a synchrotron afterglow produced by a highly relativistic jet. The H-band flux observed with HST 9.41 days after burst is that expected from the measured late-time X-ray afterglow. A late-time flare/re-brightening of a NIR-Optical afterglow of SHB can be produced by jet collision with an interstellar density bump, or by a kilonova, but jet plus kilonova can be produced also by the collapse of compact stars (neutron star, strange star, or quark star) to a more compact object due to cooling, loss of angular momentum, or mass accretion.",

Since the early work of Vasconcelos and collaborators in 2005, this technique has facilitated the investigation of global properties of the nebula and its morphology, providing new clues to better constrain its 3D structure. IFS has led to the discovery of shock-heated zones at the leading working surfaces of prominent Herbig-Haro objects as well as the first attempt to determine the chemical composition of Orion protoplanetary disks, also known as proplyds . The analysis of these morphologies using IFS has given us new insights into the abundance discrepancy problem, a long-standing and unresolved issue that casts doubt on the reliability of current methods used for the determination of metallicities in the universe from the analysis of H II regions. Results imply that high-density clumps and high-velocity flows may play an active role in the production of such discrepancies. Future investigations based on the large-scale IFS mosaic of Orion will be very valuable for exploring how the integrated effect of small-scale structures may have impact at larger scales in the framework of star-forming regions.",

Using the well-known Newton–Raphson iterator, we numerically locate the positions of the points of equilibrium, while we also obtain their linear stability. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the two variable parameters, entering the generalized Hénon–Heiles potential, affect the convergence dynamics of the system as well as the fractal degree of the basin diagrams. The fractal degree is derived by computing the (boundary) basin entropy as well as the uncertainty dimension.",

Under the assumption of a constant flow speed and using a variable (prescribed) Eddington factor, we analytically solve the relativistic moment equations in the comoving frame for several restricted cases, and obtain relativistic Milne-Eddington type solutions. In contrast to the plane-parallel case where the solutions exhibit the exponential behavior on the optical depth, the solutions have power-law forms. In the case of the radiative equilibrium, for example, the radiative flux has a power-law term multiplied by the exponential term. In the case of the local thermodynamic equilibrium with a uniform source function in the comoving frame, the radiative flux has a power-law form on the optical depth. This is because there is an expansion effect (curvature effect) in the spherical wind and the background density decreases as the radius increases.",

In this work, we numerically confirm this expectation. These gauge fields and currents, when combined with the Friedmann equations, were broken into a system of hyperbolic equations and numerically simulated. It was found in our simulation that, by including the effects of the chiral anomaly for the axial vector current, inflation can end satisfactorily after approximately 60 e-folds.",

The second method Wiener filters the CMB TE data to remove the density perturbation contribution to the TE power spectrum. We then use statistical tests to determine if there is a detection of negative residual TE correlation and hence a detection of primordial gravitational waves, the only source of negative TE correlation at these superhorizon scales. In this paper, we will apply these tests to the WMAP 5‐year data. We find that the TE power spectrum consistent with r &lt; 2.0 at 95% confidence with no additional assumptions about the PGWs.

Most satellite projects in space astrophysics focus on high‐energy astrophysics from X‐rays to gamma‐rays. A large fraction of objects of high‐energy astrophysics emit also optical light, which is, in many cases, variable. The observation of these sources at optical wavelengths can provide valuable inputs for multispectral analysis of various categories of celestial high‐energy (HE) sources. As the magnitudes of numerous objects are bright and can be hence accessed by robotic ground‐based observatories, these observations can contribute to investigations and analyses of HE sources. We discuss in detail this possible contribution, with emphasis on the ESA INTEGRAL mission. In addition to this, there are also satellite projects outside the high‐energy astronomy, in which the robotic telescopes can also play an important role. We will illustrate this on the example of the ESA satellite Gaia . In this project, robotic telescopes are expected not only to verify the triggers detected by satellite (such as transients and flares) but also to provide additional (mostly photometric) data for better scientific cases.",

These indicate a highly directional beam/jet of light/particles, with initial collimation factors in excess of 10,000 and velocities in excess of 0.95 c, as an impulsive event of up to 1e-5 solar masses interacting with circumstellar material. These can be produced by a model proposed in 1972, by Bolotovskii and Ginzburg, which employs pulsar emission from polarization currents induced/(modulated faster than c) beyond the pulsar light cylinder by the periodic electromagnetic field (supraluminally induced polarization currents -- SLIP). SLIP accounts for the disruption of progenitors in supernova explosions and their anomalous dimming at cosmological distances, jets from Sco X-1 and SS 433, the lack/presence of intermittent pulsations from the high/low luminosity low mass X-ray binaries, long/short gamma-ray bursts and predicts that their afterglows are the pulsed optical/near infrared emission associated with these pulsars. SLIP may also account for the TeV e+/e- results from PAMELA and ATIC, the WMAP `Haze'/Fermi `Bubbles', and the r-process. SLIP jets from SNe of the first stars may allow galaxies to form without dark matter, and explain the peculiar, non-gravitational motions observed from pairs of distant galaxies by GALEX.",

    "abstract": "There are many factors that cause pointing errors in radio telescopes. As one of the motion positioning mechanisms of the radio telescope, the error caused by the elevation mechanism cannot be ignored. The source of error in the elevation mechanism comes mainly from the key transmission components and the support structure. Accurate measurement of the errors caused by them is the key to analyzing their law of change. Aiming at the main error factors in the antenna elevation mechanism, this study builds a scaled-down experimental platform for the elevation mechanism and proposes an error measurement method based on multiencoder information sources. The method compares the error law of change of the antenna elevation mechanism under different driving modes, different centerline deviations of the bearings, and different backlashes and designs error measurement experiments for the abovementioned operating conditions. The results show that the error measurement method based on multiencoder information sources can accurately measure the error of the antenna elevation mechanism under different driving modes. The method can also accurately reflect the law of change in transmission error when the backlash of the elevation mechanism and the centerline deviation of the bearings increase. The final experimental measurement shows that the driving mode of the dual-motor can eliminate about 70% of the mechanism error caused by the backlash. The average value of the error increases by a factor of 1.9 when the backlash increases from 0.1 mm to 1.26 mm. The average value of the error increases by a factor of 5 when the centerline deviation of the bearings increases from 0 to 1.5 mm. This has a good reference value to correct for the pointing error of a radio telescope.",

    "abstract": "The value of the gravitational wave energy density is unknown. Current progress in gravitational wave detection suggests that the energy density of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) will be estimated in the next decades. A derivation of its value is presented under the assumption that energy lost due to cosmic redshift is fully responsible for the energy gained by the cosmological constant in the expanding universe. This unknown nonlocal mechanism of energy conservation on the cosmic scale could explain dark energy and hint at a property of a theory of quantum gravity.",

The variations of the elements are averaged over the fast and medium angles, thus retaining only the secular and long periodic terms. The models obtained cover the values of the semi-major axis from 1.1 to 2 Earth’s radii, although this is applicable only for 1.1 to 1.3 Earth’s radii due to the radiation belts. The atlas obtained is useful for different purposes, with those having the semi-major axis in this range particularly for remote sensing and meteorology.",

This case of singularity appears in the previous works and deals with different bodies which are classified according to the moments of inertia. Using the large parameter method, the periodic solutions for the equations of motion of this problem are obtained in terms of a large parameter, which will be defined later. The geometric interpretation of the considered motion will be given in terms of Euler’s angles. The numerical solutions for the system of equations of motion are obtained by one of the well-known numerical methods. The comparison between the obtained numerical solutions and analytical ones is carried out to show the errors between them and to prove the accuracy of both used techniques. In the end, we obtain the case of the regular precession type as a special case. The stability of the motion is considered by the phase diagram procedures.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the problem of constructing new integrable problems in the dynamics of the rigid body rotating about its fixed point as results of the effect of a combination of potential and gyroscopic forces possessing a common symmetry axis. We introduce two new integrable problems in a rigid body dynamics that generalize some integrable problems in this field, known by names of Chaplygin and Yehia–Elmandouh.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the chaotic oscillation of the satellite around the Earth due to aerodynamic torque. The orbital plane of the satellite concurs is same as the tropical plane of Earth. The half-width of riotous separatrix is assessed utilizing Chirikov’s measure. Variety of boundary techniques shows that streamlined force boundary (ɛ), unpredictability of circle (e), and mass-proportion (ω0) convert normal wavering to the disorganized one. We studied the behavior of trajectories due to change in parameters with Lyapunov exponents and time series plots. The theory is applied to Resourcesat-1, an artificial satellite of the Earth.",

    "abstract": "The QiTai Radio Telescope (QTT) will be equipped with the active surface adjustment system (ASAS) to correct the main reflector deformation caused by environmental loading. In order to guarantee the stability and performance of the active surface system under fault conditions, it is necessary to adopt the fault-tolerant method when actuator faults have occurred. In this paper, a fault control method based on actuator faults weighting is proposed to solve the active surface fault control problem. According to the coordinates of the adjustable points of the panels corresponding to the faulty actuators, a new paraboloid is fitted by a weighted health matrix, and the fitting surface is taken as the target to adjust the surface shape.",
