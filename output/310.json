    "abstract": "We show that the large N limit of certain conformal field theories in various dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravity on the product of Anti-deSitter spacetimes, spheres and other compact manifolds.This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk.We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large N.The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group).The 't Hooft limit of 3+1 J\\f = 4 super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings.We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes is dual to various conformal field theories.This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five noncompact dimensions. General IdeaIn the last few years it has been extremely fruitful to derive quantum field theories by taking various limits of string or M-theory.In some cases this",

    "abstract": "Recently, it has been proposed by Maldacena that large N limits of certain conformal field theories in d dimensions can be described in terms of supergravity (and string theory) on the product of d 4-1dimensional AdS space with a compact manifold.Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity.In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity.As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on AdS^ x S 5 match with the chiral operators of Af = 4 super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.With some further assumptions, one can deduce a H'amiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the Af = 4 theory has a large N phase transition related to the thermodynamics of AdS black holes.",

    "abstract": "Using the earlier developed classical Hamiltonian framework as the point of departure, we carry out a non-perturbative quantization of the sector of general relativity, coupled to matter, admitting non-rotating isolated horizons as inner boundaries. The emphasis is on the quantum geometry of the horizon. Polymer excitations of the bulk quantum geometry pierce the horizon endowing it with area. The intrinsic geometry of the horizon is then described by the quantum Chern-Simons theory of a U(1) connection on a punctured 2-sphere, the horizon. Subtle mathematical features of the quantum Chern-Simons theory turn out to be important for the existence of a coherent quantum theory of the horizon geometry. Heuristically, the intrinsic geometry is flat everywhere except at the punctures. The distributional curvature of the U(1) connection at the punctures gives rise to quantized deficit angles which account for the overall curvature. For macroscopic black holes, the logarithm of the number of these horizon microstates is proportional to the area, irrespective of the values of (non-gravitational) charges. Thus, the black hole entropy can be accounted for entirely by the quantum states of the horizon geometry. Our analysis is applicable to all non-rotating black holes, including the astrophysically interesting ones which are very far from extremality. Furthermore, cosmological horizons (to which statistical mechanical considerations are known to apply) are naturally incorporated. An effort has been made to make the paper self-contained by including short reviews of the background material.",

As an illustration of these ideas, we consider the sixdimensional (2, 0) field theory of A 1 type compactified on a Riemann surface C. Here, we show (extending previous results) that line operators",

The matching between variants of JT gravity and matrix ensembles depends on the assumed symmetries. Time-reversal symmetry in the boundary theory means that unorientable spacetimes must be considered in the bulk. In such a case, the partition function of JT gravity is still related to the volume of the moduli space of conformal structures, but this volume has a quantum correction and has to be computed using Reidemeister-Ray-Singer torsion. Presence of fermions in the boundary theory (and thus a symmetry $(-1)^F$) means that the bulk has a spin or pin structure. Supersymmetry in the boundary means that the bulk theory is associated to JT supergravity and is related to the volume of the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces rather than of ordinary Riemann surfaces. In all cases we match JT gravity or supergravity with an appropriate random matrix ensemble. All ten standard random matrix ensembles make an appearance -- the three Dyson ensembles and the seven Altland-Zirnbauer ensembles. To facilitate the analysis, we extend to the other ensembles techniques that are most familiar in the case of the original Wigner-Dyson ensemble of hermitian matrices. We also generalize Mirzakhani's recursion for the volumes of ordinary moduli space to the case of super Riemann surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Recently it has been proposed that a strange logarithmic expression for the so-called Barbero-Immirzi parameter, which is one of the ingredients that are necessary for loop quantum gravity (LQG) to predict the correct black hole entropy, is not a sign of an inconsistency of this approach to quantization of general relativity, but is a meaningful number that can be independently justified in classical GR.The alternative justification involves the knowledge of the real part of the frequencies of black hole quasinormal modes whose imaginary part blows up.In this paper we present an analytical derivation of the states with frequencies approaching a large imaginary number plus ln3/87rGjvM; this constant has been only known numerically so far.We discuss the structure of the quasinormal modes for perturbations of various spin.Possible implications of these states for thermal physics of black holes and quantum gravity are mentioned and interpreted in a new way.A general conjecture about the asymptotic states is stated.",

Our main application is to a situation where our proposed theory leads to a well-defined algebro-geometric computation very similar to well-known localization techniques in Gromov–Witten theory. In particular, our computation of the invariants for multiple covers of a generic disc bounding a special Lagrangian submanifold in a Calabi–Yau threefold agrees completely with the original predictions of Ooguri and Vafa based on string duality. Our proposed invariants depend more generally on a discrete parameter which came to light in the work of Aganagic, Klemm, and Vafa which was also based on duality, and our more general calculations agree with theirs up to sign.",

These sigma models have the twistor space of the quaternionic manifold as their target and encode finite non-linear perturbations of the flat structures. In the hyperkahler case our twistor sigma models compute both Plebanski fundamental forms (including the Kahler potential), while in the quaternion-Kahler setting the twistor sigma model computes the Kahler potential for the hyperkahler structure on non-projective twistor space. In four-dimensions, one of the models provides the generating functional of tree-level MHV graviton scattering amplitudes; perturbations of the hyperkahler structure corresponding to positive helicity gravitons. The sigma model's perturbation theory gives rise to a sum of tree diagrams observed previously in the literature, and their summation via a matrix tree theorem gives a first-principles derivation of Hodges' formula for MHV graviton amplitudes directly from general relativity. We generalise the twistor sigma model to higher-degree (defined in the first case with a cosmological constant), giving a new generating principle for the full tree-level graviton S-matrix.",

First we use BRST quantization to construct a topological Lifshitz-type theory for only the spatial metric, with spatial diffeomorphism invariance and no gauge symmetry, associated with Hamilton's Ricci flow: Hamilton's flow equation appears as the localization equation of the primitive theory. Then we extend the primitive theory by gauging foliation-preserving spacetime symmetries. Crucially, all our theories are required to exhibit an ${\\cal N}=2$ extended BRST symmetry. First, we gauge spatial diffeomorphisms, and show that this gives us access to the mathematical technique known as the DeTurck trick. Finally, we gauge foliation-preserving time reparametrizations, both with the projectable and nonprojectable lapse function. The path integral of the full theory is localized to the solutions of Ricci-type flow equations, generalizing those of Perelman. The role of Perelman's dilaton is played by the nonprojectable lapse function. Perelman's ${\\cal F}$-functional appears as the superpotential of our theory. Since there is no spin-statistics theorem in nonrelativistic quantum field theory, the two supercharges of our gravity theory do not have to be interpreted as BRST charges and, after the continuation to real time, the theory can be studied as a candidate for nonrelativistic quantum gravity with propagating bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.",

The solutions are given by known special functions and can be used to extract the strong coupling expansion as well as the non-perturbative content. The strong coupling expansions show the characteristics of D-brane and NS5-brane contributions, this is illustrated for the quintic Calabi-Yau threefold. For the resolved conifold, an expression involving both the Gopakumar-Vafa resummation as well as the refined topological string in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit is obtained and compared to expected results in the literature. Furthermore, a precise relation between the non-perturbative partition function of topological strings and the generating function of non-commutative Donaldson-Thomas invariants is given. Moreover, the expansion of the topological string on the resolved conifold near its singular small volume locus is studied. Exact expressions for the leading singular term as well as the regular terms in this expansion are provided and proved. The constant term of this expansion turns out to be the known Gromov-Witten constant map contribution.",

    "abstract": "We consider membranes of spherical topology in uncompactified Matrix theory.In general for large membranes Matrix theory reproduces the classical membrane dynamics up to 1/N corrections; for certain simple membrane configurations, the equations of motion agree exactly at finite N. We derive a general formula for the one-loop Matrix potential between two finite-sized objects at large separations.Applied to a graviton interacting with a round spherical membrane, we show that the Matrix potential agrees with the naive supergravity potential for large iV, but differs at subleading orders in N. The result is quite general: we prove a pair of theorems showing that for large TV, after removing the effects of gravitational radiation, the one-loop potential between classical Matrix configurations agrees with the long-distance potential expected from supergravity.As a spherical membrane shrinks, it eventually becomes a black hole.This provides a natural framework to study Schwarzschild black holes in Matrix theory.",

This also implies the equality between the Q-deformed A-polynomial and the augmentation polynomial of knot contact homology (in the irreducible case). We also generalize this relation to the case of links and to higher rank representations for knots. The generalization involves a study of the quantum moduli space of special Lagrangian branes with higher Betti numbers probing the Calabi-Yau. This leads to an extension of SYZ, and a new notion of mirror symmetry, involving higher dimensional mirrors. The mirror theory is a topological string, related to D-modules, which we call the \"D-model.\" In the present setting, the mirror manifold is the augmentation variety of the link. Connecting further to contact geometry, we study intersection properties of branches of the augmentation variety guided by the relation to D-modules. This study leads us to propose concrete geometric constructions of Lagrangian fillings for links. We also relate the augmentation variety with the large N limit of the colored HOMFLY, which we conjecture to be related to a Q-deformation of the extension of A-polynomials associated with the link complement.",

Specifically, we explicitly compute the boundary vertex operators for massless Ramond sector states, in open string B models describing Calabi-Yau manifolds at large radius, directly in BCFT using standard methods. Naively these vertex operators are in one-to-one correspondence with certain sheaf cohomology groups (as is typical for such vertex operator calculations), which are related to the desired Ext groups via spectral sequences. However, a subtlety in the physics of the open string B model has the effect of physically realizing those spectral sequences in BRST cohomology, so that the vertex operators are actually in one-to-one correspondence with Ext group elements. This gives an extremely concrete physical test of recent proposals regarding the relationship between derived categories and D-branes. We check these results extensively in numerous examples, and comment on several related issues.",

After reviewing the existing results on such theories in two dimensions, we discuss examples of gerby moduli `spaces' appearing in four-dimensional field theory and string compactifications, and the effect of various dualities. We discuss global topological defects arising when a field or string theory moduli space has a gerbe structure. We also outline how to generalize results of Bagger-Witten and more recent authors on quantization issues in supergravities from smooth manifolds to smooth moduli stacks, focusing particular attention on stacks that have gerbe structures.",

They can be regarded as suitable extensions of the well-known Lie bialgebra in the context of 3-Lie algebras, in two different directions. The local cocycle 3-Lie bialgebra is introduced to extend the connection between Lie bialgebras and the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Its relationship with a ternary variation of the classical Yang-Baxter equation, called the 3-Lie classical Yang-Baxter equation, a ternary $\\mathcal{O}$-operator and a 3-pre-Lie algebra is established. In particular, it is shown that solutions of the 3-Lie classical Yang-Baxter equation give (coboundary) local cocycle 3-Lie bialgebras, whereas 3-pre-Lie algebras give rise to solutions of the 3-Lie classical Yang-Baxter equation. The double construction 3-Lie bialgebra is introduced to extend to the 3-Lie algebra context the connection between Lie bialgebras and double constructions of Lie algebras. Their related Manin triples give a natural construction of pseudo-metric 3-Lie algebras with neutral signature. Moreover, the double construction 3-Lie bialgebra can be regarded as a special class of the local cocycle 3-Lie bialgebra. Explicit examples of double construction 3-Lie bialgebras are provided.",

First, we introduce a higher rank analogue of Fenchel-Nielsen type spectral networks in terms of a generalized Strebel condition. We find new systems of spectral coordinates through the abelianization method and argue that they are higher rank analogues of the Nekrasov-Rosly-Shatashvili Darboux coordinates. Second, we give an explicit parametrization of the locus of opers and determine the generating functions of this Lagrangian subvariety in terms of the higher rank Darboux coordinates in some specific examples. We find that the generating functions indeed agree with the known effective twisted superpotentials.

We show that the two resulting coefficient $L_\\infty$-algebras are naturally related by an $L_\\infty$-isomorphism which we find to act on the super $p$-brane cocycles by the infinitesimal version of the rules of topological T-duality and inducing an isomorphism between $K^0$ and $K^1$, rationally. In particular this is a derivation of the Buscher rules for RR-fields (Hori's formula) from first principles. Moreover, we show that these $L_\\infty$-algebras are the homotopy quotients of the RR-charge coefficients by the \"T-duality Lie 2-algebra\". We find that the induced $L_\\infty$-extension is a gerby extension of a 9+(1+1) dimensional (i.e. \"doubled\") T-duality correspondence super-spacetime, which serves as a local model for T-folds. We observe that this still extends, via the D0-brane cocycle of its type IIA factor, to a 10+(1+1)-dimensional super Lie algebra.

Both kinds of properties are related to the newborn theory of single-valued periods, and our proofs provide an intuitive understanding of this relation. The global property, known in physics as the KLT formula, is a factorisation of the closed string integrals into products of pairs of open string integrals. We deduce it by identifying closed string integrals with special values of single-valued correlation functions in two dimensional conformal field theory, and by obtaining their conformal block decomposition. The local property is of number theoretical nature. We write the asymptotic expansion coefficients as multiple integrals over the complex plane of special functions known as single-valued hyperlogarithms. We develop a theory of integration of single-valued hyperlogarithms, and we use it to demonstrate that the asymptotic expansion coefficients belong to the ring of single-valued multiple zeta values.",

They prove that if the conformal class of the boundary contains a metric of positive scalar curvature, then $M$ and $N$ have several desirable properties: (1) $N$ is connected, (2) the $n$th homology of the compactified $M$ vanishes, and (3) the fundamental group of $M$ is bounded that of $N$. Here it is shown that all of these results extend to the case where the conformal class of the boundary contains a metric of nonnegative scalar curvature. (The case of zero scalar curvature is of interest as it is borderline for the stability of the theory.) The proof method used here is different from, and in some sense dual to, that used by Witten and Yau. While their method involves minimizing the co-dimension one brane action on $M$, and requires the machinery of geometric measure theory, the main arguments presented here use only geodesic geometry.",

Classically, the (0,2) analogue of the B model is equivalent to the previously-discussed (0,2) analogue of the A model, but with the gauge bundle dualized -- our generalization of the A model, also simultaneously generalizes the B model. The A and B analogues sometimes have different regularizations, however, which distinguish them quantum-mechanically. We discuss how properties of the (2,2) B model, such as the lack of quantum corrections, are realized in (0,2) A model language. In an appendix, we also extensively discuss how the Calabi-Yau condition for the closed string B model (uncoupled to topological gravity) can be weakened slightly, a detail which does not seem to have been covered in the literature previously. That weakening also manifests in the description of the (2,2) B model as a (0,2) A model.",

For Landau-Ginzburg models which are believed to flow in the IR to smooth branched double covers, our D-brane probes recover the structure of the branched double cover (and flat nontrivial B fields), verifying previous results. In addition to smooth branched double covers, the same class of Landau-Ginzburg models is also believed to sometimes flow to `noncommutative resolutions' of singular spaces. These noncommutative resolutions are abstract conformal field theories without a global geometric description, but D-brane probes perceive them as non-Kahler small resolutions of a singular Calabi-Yau. We conjecture that such non-Kahler small resolutions are typical in D-brane probes of such theories.",

    "abstract": "We propose a unifying model for FQHE which on the one hand connects it to recent developments in string theory and on the other hand leads to new predictions for the principal series of experimentally observed FQH systems with filling fraction $\\nu ={n\\over 2n\\pm1}$ as well as those with $\\nu ={m\\over m+2}$. Our model relates these series to minimal unitary models of the Virasoro and superVirasoro algebra and is based on $SL(2, {\\bf C})$ Chern-Simons theory in Euclidean space or $SL(2,{\\bf R})\\times SL(2,{\\bf R})$ Chern-Simons theory in Minkowski space. This theory, which has also been proposed as a soluble model for 2+1 dimensional quantum gravity, and its N=1 supersymmetric cousin, provide effective descriptions of FQHE. The principal series corresponds to quantized levels for the two $SL(2,{\\bf R})$'s such that the diagonal $SL(2,{\\bf R})$ has level $ 1$. The model predicts, contrary to standard lore, that for principal series of FQH systems the quasiholes possess non-abelian statistics. For the multi-layer case we propose that complex ADE Chern-Simons theories provide effective descriptions, where the rank of the ADE is mapped to the number of layers. Six dimensional $(2,0)$ ADE theories on the Riemann surface $\\Sigma$ provides a realization of FQH systems in M-theory. Moreover we propose that the q-deformed version of Chern-Simons theories are related to the anisotropic limit of FQH systems which splits the zeroes of the Laughlin wave function. Extensions of the model to 3+1 dimensions, which realize topological insulators with non-abelian topologically twisted Yang-Mills theory is pointed out.",

We find a large class of models in which the large impact parameter scattering scales with energy and impact parameter like Newton`s law. The scattering amplitudes in these models describe scattering of jets of particles, and also include amplitudes for the production of highly meta-stable states with all the parametric properties of black holes. These models have emergent energy, momentum and angular conservation laws, despite being based on time dependent Hamiltonians. The scattering amplitudes in which no intermediate black holes are produced have a time-ordered Feynman diagram space-time structure: local interaction vertices connected by propagation of free particles (really Sterman-Weinberg jets of particles). However, there are also amplitudes where jets collide to form large meta-stable objects, with all the scaling properties of black holes: energy, entropy and temperature, as well as the characteristic time scale for the decay of perturbations. We generalize the conjecture of Sekino and Susskind, to claim that all of these models are fast scramblers. The rationale for this claim is that the interactions are invariant under fuzzy subgroups of the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms, so that they are highly non-local on the holographic screen. We review how this formalism resolves the Firewall Paradox.",

This technique involves making a general Ansatz for the metric and then defining the Killing spinors in terms of very simple projectors on the spinor fields. These projectors and, through them, the spinors, are determined algebraically in terms of the metric Ansatz. The Killing spinor equations then fix the tensor gauge fields algebraically, and, with the Bianchi identities, provide a system of equations for all the metric functions. We illustrate this by constructing an infinite family of massive flows that preserve eight supersymmetries in M-theory. This family constitutes all the radially symmetric Coulomb branch flows of the softly broken, large N scalar-fermion theory on M2-branes. We reduce the problem to the solution of a single, non-linear partial differential equation in two variables. This equation governs the flow of the fermion mass, and the function that solves it then generates the entire M-theory solution algebraically in terms of the function and its first derivatives. While the governing equation is non-linear, it has a very simple perturbation theory from which one can see how the Coulomb branch is encoded.",

We derive Cauchy-Fueter type formulas for these doubly regular functions that can be regarded as another counterpart of Cauchy's integral formula for the second order pole, in addition to the one studied in the first paper with the same title. We also realize the doubly regular functions as a subspace of the quaternionic-valued functions satisfying a Euclidean version of Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field. \r\nThen we return to the study of the original quaternionic analogue of Cauchy's second order pole formula and its relation to the polarization of vacuum. We find the decomposition of the space of quaternionic-valued functions into irreducible components that include the spaces of doubly left and right regular functions. Using this decomposition, we show that a regularization of the vacuum polarization diagram is achieved by subtracting the component corresponding to the one-dimensional subrepresentation of the conformal group. After the regularization, the vacuum polarization diagram is identified with a certain second order differential operator which yields a quaternionic version of Maxwell equations. \r\nNext, we introduce two types of quaternionic algebras consisting of spaces of scalar-valued and quaternionic-valued functions. We emphasize that these algebra structures are invariant under the action of the conformal Lie algebra. This uses techniques from our study of the vacuum polarization diagram. These algebras are not associative, but we can define an infinite family of n-multiplications, and we conjecture that they have structures of weak cyclic A-infinity algebras. We also conjecture the relation between the multiplication operations of the scalar and non-scalar quaternionic algebras with the n-photon Feynman diagrams in the scalar and ordinary conformal QED.",

From the heterotic viewpoint, this effect corresponds to the insertion of 5-branes. These effects can be used to understand nonperturbative aspects of nongeometric heterotic strings.

Since our target framework is the general boundary formulation, the class of field theories that can be quantized in this way includes theories without a metric spacetime background. We also show that this quantization scheme is equivalent to a holomorphic quantization scheme proposed earlier and based on geometric quantization. We proceed to include observables into the scheme, quantized also through the path integral. We show that the quantized observables satisfy the canonical commutation relations, a feature shared with other quantization schemes also discussed. However, in contrast to other schemes the presented quantization also satisfies a correspondence between the composition of classical observables through their product and the composition of their quantized counterparts through spacetime gluing. In the special case of quantum field theory in Minkowski space this reproduces the operationally correct composition of observables encoded in the time-ordered product. We show that the quantization scheme also generalizes other features of quantum field theory such as the generating function of the S-matrix.",

A heterotic string compactification on a gerbe can be understood as, simultaneously, both a compactification on a space with a restriction on nonperturbative sectors, and also, a gauge theory in which a subgroup of the gauge group acts trivially on the massless matter. Gerbes admit more bundles than corresponding spaces, which suggests they are potentially a rich playground for heterotic string compactifications. After we give a general characterization of heterotic strings on stacks, we specialize to gerbes, and consider three different classes of `building blocks' of gerbe compactifications. We argue that heterotic string compactifications on one class is equivalent to compactification of the same heterotic string on a disjoint union of spaces, compactification on another class is dual to compactifications of other heterotic strings on spaces, and compactification on the third class is not perturbatively consistent, so that we do not in fact recover a broad array of new heterotic compactifications, just combinations of existing ones. In appendices we explain how to compute massless spectra of heterotic strings on stacks, derive some new necessary conditions for a heterotic string on a stack or orbifold to be well-defined, and also review some basic properties of bundles on gerbes.",

As an offshoot, we are led to the sought-after connection between the gauge-theoretic realization of the geometric Langlands correspondence by Kapustin-Witten [5,6] and its algebraic CFT formulation by Beilinson-Drinfeld [7], where one can also understand Wilson and 't Hooft-Hecke line operators in 4d gauge theory as monodromy loop operators in 2d CFT, for example. In turn, this will allow us to argue that the higher 5d/6d analog of the geometric Langlands correspondence for simply-laced Lie (Kac-Moody) groups G (G_k), ought to relate the quantization of circle (elliptic)-valued G Hitchin systems to circle/elliptic-valued ^LG (^LG_k)-bundles over a complex curve on one hand, and the transfer matrices of a G (G_k)-type XXZ/XYZ spin chain on the other, where ^LG is the Langlands dual of G. Incidentally, the latter relation also serves as an M-theoretic realization of Nekrasov-Pestun-Shatashvili's recent result in [8], which relates the moduli space of 5d/6d supersymmetric G (G_k)-quiver SU(K_i) gauge theories to the representation theory of quantum/elliptic affine (toroidal) G-algebras.",

This is equivalent to the property of linearisation stability, which was studied in depth throughout the 70s. This framework allows us to prove a conjecture of Sudarsky and Wald (1992), that is, the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics is a suitable condition for stationarity. Since we work with a single end and no boundary conditions, this is equivalent to critical points of the ADM mass subject to variations fixing the Yang-Mills charge corresponding exactly to stationary solutions. The natural extension to this work is to prove the second conjecture of Sudarsky and Wald, which is the case where an interior boundary is present; this will be addressed in future work.",

    "abstract": "In this note we propose a generalization of heterotic/F-theory duality. We introduce a set of non-compact building blocks which we glue together to reach compact examples of generalized duality pairs. The F-theory building blocks consist of non-compact elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds which also admit a K3 fibration. The compact elliptic model obtained by gluing need not have a globally defined K3 fibration. By replacing the K3 fiber of each F-theory building block with a T^2, we reach building blocks in a heterotic dual vacuum which includes a position dependent dilaton and three-form flux. These building blocks are glued together to reach a heterotic flux background. We argue that in these vacua, the gauge fields of the heterotic string become localized, and remain dynamical even when gravity decouples. This enables a heterotic dual for the hyperflux GUT breaking mechanism which has recently figured prominently in F-theory GUT models. We illustrate our general proposal with some explicit examples.",

In previous work we canonically embedded these graphs into explicitly uniformized Riemann surfaces via the dessins d'enfant construction of Grothendieck. The Adinkra graphs carry two additional structures: a selection of dashed edges and an assignment of integral helghts to the vertices. In this paper, we complete the passage from algebra, through discrete structures, to geometry. We show that the dashings correspond to special spin structures on the Riemann surface, defining thereby super Riemann surfaces. Height assignments determine discrete Morse functions, from which we produce a set of Morse divisors which capture the topological properties of the height assignments.",

But these categories only describe the local observables on an open 2-disk in the long wave length limit. For example, the notion of braiding only makes sense locally. It is natural to ask how to obtain global observables on a closed surface. The answer is provided by the theory of factorization homology. We compute the factorization homology of a closed surface $\\Sigma$ with the coefficient given by a unitary modular tensor category, and show that the result is given by a pair $(\\mathbf{H}, u_\\Sigma)$, where $\\mathbf{H}$ is the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and $u_\\Sigma\\in \\mathbf{H}$ is a distinguished object that coincides precisely with the Hilbert space assigned to the surface $\\Sigma$ in Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFT. We also generalize this result to a closed stratified surface decorated by anomaly-free topological defects of codimension 0,1,2. This amounts to compute the factorization homology of a stratified surface with a coefficient system satisfying an anomaly-free condition.",

The result applies for collisions between shock waves coming from different characteristic families, in spherically symmetric spacetimes. We give a constructive proof that there exist coordinate transformations which raise the regularity of the gravitational metric tensor from $C^{0,1}$ to $C^{1,1}$ in a neighborhood of such points of shock wave interaction, and a $C^{1,1}$ metric regularity suffices for locally inertial frames to exist. This result corrects an error in our earlier RSPA-publication, which led us to the wrong conclusion that such coordinate transformations, which smooth the metric to $C^{1,1}$, cannot exist. Our result here proves that regularity singularities, (a type of mild singularity introduced in our RSPA-publication), do not exist at points of interacting shock waves from different families in spherically symmetric spacetimes, and this generalizes Israel's famous 1966 result to the case of such shock wave interactions. The strategy of proof here is an extension of the strategy outlined in our RSPA-paper, but differs fundamentally from the method used by Israel.

The functional derivative Schr\\\"odinger equation underlying the canonical field quantization is derived from the partial derivative covariant analogue of the Schr\\\"odinger equation, which appears in the precanonical field quantization based on the De Donder-Weyl generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism for field theory. The representations of precanonical quantum operators typically contain an ultraviolet parameter $\\varkappa$ of the dimension of the inverse spatial volume. The transition from the precanonical description of quantum fields in terms of Clifford-valued wave functions and partial derivative operators to the standard functional Schr\\\"odinger representation obtained from canonical quantization is accomplished if $\\frac{1}{\\varkappa}\\rightarrow 0$ and $\\frac{1}{\\varkappa}\\gamma_0$ is mapped to the infinitesimal spatial volume element $\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}$.

For polynomials with isolated critical points, the approach yields a complete description of the products. We also reformulate the result for the corresponding categories of equivariant matrix factorizations. In an Appendix written jointly with Alexey Basalaev, we apply the formulas to calculate the Hochschild cohomology of a simple but non-trivial class of so-called invertible LG orbifold models. The resulting algebras turn out to be isomorphic to what has already appeared in the literature on LG mirror symmetry under the name of twisted or orbifolded Milnor/Jacobian algebras. We conjecture that this holds true for all invertible LG models. In the second part of the Appendix, the formulas are applied to a different class of LG orbifolds which have appeared in the context of homological mirror symmetry for varieties of general type as mirror partners of surfaces of genus 2 and higher. In combination with a homological mirror symmetry theorem for the surfaces, our calculation yields a new proof of the fact that the Hochschild cohomology of the Fukaya category of a surface is isomorphic, as an algebra, to the cohomology of the surface.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we expand on results from our previous paper Case Against Smooth Null Infinity I: Heuristics and Counter-Examples [1] by showing that the failure of peeling (and, thus, of smooth null infinity) in a neighbourhood of $i^0$ derived therein translates into logarithmic corrections at leading order to the well-known Price's law asymptotics near $i^+$. This suggests that the non-smoothness of $\\mathcal{I}^+$ is physically measurable. More precisely, we consider the linear wave equation $\\Box_g \\phi=0$ on a fixed Schwarzschild background ($M>0$), and we show the following: If one imposes conformally smooth initial data on an ingoing null hypersurface (extending to $\\mathcal{H}^+$ and terminating at $\\mathcal{I}^-$) and vanishing data on $\\mathcal{I}^-$ (this is the no incoming radiation condition), then the precise leading-order asymptotics of the solution $\\phi$ are given by $r\\phi|_{\\mathcal{I}^+}=C u^{-2}\\log u+\\mathcal{O}(u^{-2})$ along future null infinity, $\\phi|_{r=R>2M}=2C\\tau^{-3}\\log\\tau+\\mathcal{O}(\\tau^{-3})$ along hypersurfaces of constant $r$, and $\\phi|_{\\mathcal{H}^+}=2Cv^{-3}\\log v+\\mathcal{O}(v^{-3})$ along the event horizon. Moreover, the constant $C$ is given by $C=4M I_0^{(\\mathrm{past})}[\\phi]$, where $I_0^{(\\mathrm{past})}[\\phi]:=\\lim_{u\\to -\\infty} r^2\\partial_u(r\\phi_{\\ell=0})$ is the past Newman--Penrose constant of $\\phi$ on $\\mathcal{I}^-$. Thus, the precise late-time asymptotics of $\\phi$ are completely determined by the early-time behaviour of the spherically symmetric part of $\\phi$ near $\\mathcal{I}^-$. Similar results are obtained for polynomially decaying timelike boundary data. The paper uses methods developed by Angelopoulos--Aretakis--Gajic and is essentially self-contained.",

    "abstract": "We present a multisymplectic formulation of the Yang- Mills equations. The connections are represented by normalized equivariant 1-forms on the total space of a principal bundle, with values in a Lie alge- bra. Within the multisymplectic framework we realize that, under reasonable hypotheses, it is not necessary to assume the equivariance condition a priori, since this condition is a consequence of the dynamical equations. The motivation of the following work was at first to provide a Hamiltonian formulation of the Yang-Mills system of equations which would be as much covariant as possible. This means that we look for a formulation which does not depend on choices of space-time coordinates nor on the trivialization of the principal bundle. Among all possible frameworks (covariant phase space, etc.) we favor the multisymplectic formalism which takes automatically into account the locality of fields theories. Following this approach we have been led to discover a new variational formulation of the Yang-Mills equations with nice geometrical features. The origin of the multisymplectic formalism goes back to the discovery by V. Volterra in 1890 (28, 28) of generalizations of the Hamilton equations for variational problems with several variables. These ideas were first developped mainly around 1930 (4, 7, 30, 24) and in 1950 (6). After 1968 this theory was geometrized in a way analogous to the construction of symplectic geometry by several mathematical physicists (10, 12, 23) and in particular by a group",

[15,16] was successfully applied to geometric transitions for noncompact Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. DUILIU-EMANUEL DIACONESCU ANDIn this paper, we consider large N duality for extremal transitions between compact Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties.Geometric transitions for compact Calabi-Yau manifolds have been proposed in ref. [57], but no concrete results are known so far.There are many conceptual as well as technical issues that have to be addressed in this context.Perhaps the most challenging obstacle is the absence of a rigorous mathematical formalism for open string amplitudes on compact Calabi-Yau three-folds.Keeping the details to a minimum, let us summarize our results.We develop a computational approach to genus zero open string A-model amplitudes on a certain class of compact Calabi-Yau target manifolds.This approach follows the basic principles outlined in ref. [58] supplemented by a heavy use of equivariant enumerative techniques.There are two key aspects in the whole process.First, we develop an open string version of the convex obstruction bundle approach usually encountered in Gromov-Witten theory.Second, we propose a formal extension of standard Chern-Simons theory in which the framing is regarded as a formal variable.In particular, it could take fractional values.Using these two elements, plus a great deal of patience, we run a successful genus zero test of large N duality for compact Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties.Along the way, we gain new insights into the structure of Gromov-Witten invariants, and we also clarify some aspects of local geometric transitions [5,15,16].A more detailed overview of the general set-up and the results is included in the next section.The paper is structured as follows.In Section 2, we present the stage, the cast of characters and outline the main plot.Section 3 consists of a conceptual discussion of open string enumerative geometry for compact Calabi-Yau manifolds.In Section 4, we describe the main examples to be used h-e 1 dP dP dP",

The objects and morphisms are all given by Lagrangians living on various fiber products. A special case of this gives a $2$-category of $n$-shifted symplectic derived stacks $Symp^n$. This is a $2$-category version of Weinstein's symplectic category in the setting of derived symplectic geometry. We introduce another $2$-category $Symp^{or}$ of $0$-shifted symplectic derived stacks where the objects and morphisms in $Symp^0$ are enhanced with orientation data. Using this, we define a partially linearized $2$-category $LSymp$. Joyce and his collaborators defined a certain perverse sheaf on any oriented $(-1)$-shifted symplectic derived stack. In $LSymp$, the $2$-morphisms in $Symp^{or}$ are replaced by the hypercohomology of the perverse sheaf assigned to the $(-1)$-shifted symplectic derived Lagrangian intersections. To define the compositions in $LSymp$ we use a conjecture by Joyce, that Lagrangians in $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks define canonical elements in the hypercohomology of the perverse sheaf over the Lagrangian. We refine and expand his conjecture and use it to construct $LSymp$ and a $2$-functor from $Symp^{or}$ to $LSymp$. We prove Joyce's conjecture in the most general local model. Finally, we define a $2$-category of $d$-oriented derived stacks and fillings. Taking mapping stacks into a $n$-shifted symplectic stack defines a $2$-functor from this category to $Symp^{n-d}$.",

We propose alternative top-down gauge theoretic constructions starting from the conformal Cartan bundle and its vectorial and spinorial associated bundles. Our key ingredient is the dressing field method of gauge symmetry reduction, which allows to exhibit tractors and twistors and their associated connections as gauge field of a non-standard kind as far as Weyl rescaling symmetry is concerned. By which we mean that they implement the gauge principle but are of a different geometric nature than the well known differential geometric objects usually underlying gauge theories.

The formalism immediately yields explicit formulae for these curve first integrals. The usual role of Killing tensors and conformal Killing tensors is recovered as a special case, but the construction shows that a significantly larger class of equation solutions also yield curve first integrals. In particular any normal solution to an equation from the class of first BGG equations can yield such a conserved quantity. For some equations the condition of normality is not required. \r\nFor nowhere-null curves in pseudo-Riemannian and conformal geometry additional results are available.

Contents1 We only consider the case in which the stack X is smooth as in [BCS].2 As opposed to Nironi, we consider µ-stability instead of Gieseker stability and we fix the K-group class of the sheaf instead of the modified Hilbert polynomial.Here µ is the linear term of the modified Hilbert polynomial divided by its quadratic term.This means µ depends on a choice of polarization and generating sheaf.when c 1 is odd and qwhen c 1 ≡ 0 mod 4 and qwhen c 1 ≡ 2 mod 4.For P(2, 2, 2) the generating function H vb c 1 ,λ (q) is zero unless c 1 is even, so assume this is the case.For λ even, H vb c 1 ,λ (q) is equal to the generating function H vb c 1 2(q) of Theorem 1.1.For λ odd, H vb c 1 ,λ (q) is equal to the generating function H vb c 1 2 +1 (q) of Theorem 1.1.In each of these cases, when the expression for H vb c 1 ,λ (q) does not involve the sum of divisors function there are no strictly semistable locally free sheaves in the moduli spaces and H vb c 1 ,λ (q) (q = e 2πiz , Im(z) > 0) is the holomorphic part of a modular form of weight 3 2 (up to replacing q by q -1 or q -1 2 and up to an overall power of q in front).We conjecture that in the absence of strictly semistable locally free sheaves in the moduli space, the generating function H vb c 1 ,λ (q) computed in Corollary 7.11 always has modular properties.In Section 7.2 we also give a general expression for the generating function of Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of stable locally free sheaves on any P(a, b, c) which sums over K-group classes instead of holomorphic Euler characteristic (Theorem 7.10).These generating functions depend on more than one variable and are refinements of H vb c 1 ,λ (q).It would be interesting to study their modular properties.Convention.Throughout this paper we fix P := P(a, b, c) with a, b, c arbitrary positive integers.",

Technically, this is due to the fact that supersymmetric and bosonic string world-sheet theories are different.Note, however, that the usual F + B combination is still the combination which remains gauge invariant at the σ-model level.Also, the standard result F = B is, in the D3-brane case, not compatible with S-duality.On the other hand our result, which is derived automatically given the general formalism, offers a non-trivial check of S-duality, to all orders in F , and this leads to an S-dual invariant Moyal deformation.In an appendix, we solve the source equation describing the open superstring in a generic NSNS and RR closed string background, within the super-Poincaré covariant formalism.",

This allows us to guide and control these motions as we like. In the classical case these ellipsoids correspond to a symplectic coarse graining of phase space, and in the case they correspond to the quantum blobs we defined in previous work, and which can be viewed as minimum uncertainty phase space cells which are in a one-to-one correspondence with Gaussian pure states.",

It turns out there are four topologically distinct types of media, of which only one, gyrotropic media, is topologically non-trivial in $d = 2 , 3$. That means there are no as-of-yet undiscovered topological effects; in particular, there is no analog of the Quantum Spin Hall Effect in classical electromagnetism. Moreover, at least qualitatively, Haldane's Quantum Hall Effect for light is analogous to the Quantum Hall Effect from condensed matter physics as both systems as in the same topological class, class A. Our ideas are directly applicable to other classical waves.",

In the special case that the normal components of the electric and magnetic fields are proportional we obtain the area bound A ≥ 8πP Q in terms of the electric and magnetic charges.In the generic case our results are less explicit but imply rigorous 'perturbation' results for the above inequality.All our inequalities are saturated for a 2parameter family of static, extreme solutions found by Gibbons [3].Via the Bekenstein-Hawking relation A = 4S our results give positive lower bounds for the entropy S which are particularly interesting in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton case.",

The observer's \"current time,\" usually given by a point along the geodesic, corresponds to the choice of scale in the decompactification. We also show how arbitrary conformal 3-geometries give rise to \"observer space geometries,\" as defined in recent work, from which spacetime can be reconstructed under certain integrability conditions.

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to analyze some geometric properties of the rigid Calabi-Yau threefold Z obtained by a quotient of E 3 , where E is a specific elliptic curve.We describe the cohomology of Z and give a simple formula for the trilinear form on P ic(Z).We describe some projective models of Z and relate these to its generalized mirror.A smoothing of a singular model is a Calabi-Yau threefold with small Hodge numbers which was not known before. IntroductionOne of the most exciting mathematical implications of string theory is mirror symmetry, which finds its origin in the papers [Di] and [LVW].A phenomenological verification of the conjecture that Calabi-Yau manifolds should appear in pairs was given in [CRL], and the first non trivial examples of mirror pairs appeared in [GP].In [GP] it was also discovered that mirror symmetry can be used to compute the instanton corrections to the Yukawa couplings (the first explicit computations were carried out in [CDGP]), which mathematically corresponds to determine the number of rational curves of given degree embedded in the Calabi-Yau manifold.This led to the notion of Gromov-Witten invariants and more generally to the one of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants [GV1], [GV2].Curiously, in the seminal paper [CHSW], where the relevance of Calabi-Yau manifolds in string theory was established, among the few explicit known examples of Calabi-Yau manifolds there was the manifold Z, realized as the desingularization of the quotient E 3 /ϕ 3 , with ϕ 3 = ϕ × ϕ × ϕ and ϕ the generator of Z 3 which acts on the elliptic curve E. As Z is a rigid manifold, it cannot admit a Calabi-Yau threefold as mirror partner.This created a puzzle in the general framework of mirror symmetry.However, physically, mirror symmetry arises as a complete equivalence between conformal field theories.In this respect, it should not be surprising that in certain exceptional cases the equivalence could involve more general spaces.Indeed, in [CDP] it was proposed that the mirror of Z should be a cubic in P 8 quotiented by a suitable finite group.By using the usual mirror methods, the authors were able to reproduce the right Yukawa couplings of Z.The mirror symmetry generalized to rigid Calabi-Yau manifolds has been considered also in [S], where the mirror is presented as (embedded in) an higher dimensional Fano variety having the mirror diamond as an embedded sub-diamond and in [AG] where it is related to toric geometry.However, a definitive understanding of the question is still open.In this paper, as a preparation to further work on generalized mirror symmetry, we present a very detailed study of the rigid manifold Z. Section 1 is devoted to an explicit description of the cohomology of Z.The Hodge diamond of this threefold is very well known, but here we identify a set of generators of P ic(Z) made up of surfaces and a set of generators of H 4 (Z, Q) made up of curves.Our goal is to describe the trilinear intersection form on the generators of P ic(Z) relating it with the trilinear intersection form on P ic(E 3 ).Indeed the generators of P ic(Z) are of two types: the ones coming from the generators of P ic(E 3 ) and the ones coming from the resolution of the singularities of E 3 /ϕ 3 .The intersection between two divisors of different type is zero, and the trilinear form on the divisors coming from E 3 is, up to a constant, the trilinear form P ic(E 3 ).For this reason it is important to give a good description of the trilinear form on P ic(E 3 ): in (4) the cubic self-intersection form is given for each divisor in P ic(E 3 ).In Section 2, Theorem 2.1, we prove that it can be given in terms of the determinant of a matrix in M at 3,3 (Q[ζ]), ζ 3 = 1.The locus where the determinant",

    "abstract": "We investigate the Einstein vacuum equations as well as the Einstein-null fluid equations describing neutrino radiation. We find new structures in gravitational waves and memory for asymptotically-flat spacetimes of slow decay. These structures do not arise in spacetimes resulting from data that is stationary outside a compact set. Rather the more general situations exhibit richer geometric-analytic interactions displaying the physics of these more general systems. It has been known that for stronger decay of the data gravitational wave memory is finite and of electric parity only. We investigate general spacetimes that are asymptotically flat in a rough sense, where the decay of the data to Minkowski space towards infinity is very slow. Main new feature: We prove that there exists diverging magnetic memory sourced by the magnetic part of the curvature tensor (a) in the Einstein vacuum and (b) in the Einstein-null-fluid equations. The magnetic memory occurs naturally in the Einstein vacuum setting (a) of pure gravity. In case (b), in the ultimate class of solutions, the magnetic memory also contains a curl term from the energy-momentum tensor for neutrinos also diverging at the highest rate. The electric memory diverges too, it is generated by the electric part of the curvature tensor and in the Einstein-null-fluid situation also by the corresponding energy-momentum component. In addition, we find a panorama of finer structures in these manifolds. Some of these manifest themselves as additional contributions to both electric and magnetic memory. Our theorems hold for any type of matter or energy coupled to the Einstein equations as long as the data decays slowly towards infinity and other conditions are satisfied. The new results have many applications ranging from mathematical general relativity to gravitational wave astrophysics, detecting dark matter and other topics in physics.",

The geodesics of T lead to solutions of the periodic Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation by means of V. Arnold's generalization of Euler's equation.

In particular, it is an open problem whether there always exist coordinate transformations which smooth a gravitational metric to optimal regularity, two full derivatives above the curvature tensor, or whether regularity singularities exist. We resolve this open problem above a threshold level of smoothness by proving in this paper that the existence of such coordinate transformations is equivalent to solving a system of nonlinear elliptic equations in the unknown Jacobian and transformed connection, both viewed as matrix valued differential forms. We name these the Regularity Transformation equations, or RT-equations. In a companion paper we prove existence of solutions to the RT-equations for connections $\\Gamma\\in W^{m,p},$ curvature ${\\rm Riem}(\\Gamma) \\in W^{m,p}$, assuming $m\\geq1$, $p>n$. Taken together, these results imply that there always exist coordinate transformations which smooth arbitrary connections to optimal regularity, (one derivative more regular than the curvature), and there are no regularity singularities, above the threshold $m\\geq1$, $p>n$. Authors are currently working on extending these methods to the case of GR shock waves, when gravitational metrics are only Lipschitz continuous, ($m=0$, $p=\\infty$), and optimal regularity is required to recover basic properties of spacetime.",

Furthermore, a slightly generalized exponential measure can generate the cosmological term in the effective action as a quantum correction, with a naturally small value of the cosmological constant. We also find that in the case of a discrete length spectrum, the semiclassical expansion is allowed only if the spectrum gap is much smaller than the Planck length.",

As these global changes are induced by local processes, we use the local form of Morse functions to provide an algebraic formulation of their temporal evolution and propose a potential energy function which, in some cases, could give rise to the local forces related to surgery. We further show how this topological perspective gives new insight for natural phenomena exhibiting surgery, in all dimensions, while emphasizing the $3$-dimensional case, which describes cosmic phenomena.

    "abstract": "Perturbation theory in geometric theories of gravitation is a gauge theory of symmetric tensors defined on a Lorentzian manifold (the background spacetime).The gauge freedom makes uniqueness problems in perturbation theory particularly hard as one needs to understand in depth the process of gauge fixing before attempting any uniqueness proof.This is the first paper of a series of two aimed at deriving an existence and uniqueness result for rigidly rotating stars to second order in perturbation theory in General Relativity.A necessary step is to show the existence of a suitable choice of gauge and to understand the differentiability and regularity properties of the resulting gauge tensors in some \"canonical form\", particularly at the centre of the star.With a wider range of applications in mind, in this paper we analyse the fixing and regularity problem in a more general setting.In particular we tackle the problem of the Hodge-type decomposition into scalar, vector and tensor components on spheres of symmetric and axially symmetric tensors with finite differentiability down to the origin, exploiting a strategy in which the loss of differentiability is as low as possible.Our primary interest, and main result, is to show that stationary and axially symmetric second order perturbations around static and spherically symmetric background configurations can indeed be rendered in the usual \"canonical form\" used in the literature while loosing only one degree of differentiability and keeping all relevant quantities bounded near the origin.",

Additional symmetries, such as crystal symmetries which act non-trivially on the Brillouin zone, or time-reversal symmetry, endow the vector bundle with extra structure. These vector bundles are classified by a suitable version of K-theory. While relatively easy to define, these K-theory groups are notoriously hard to compute in explicit examples. In this paper we describe in detail how one can compute these K-theory groups starting with a decomposition of the Brillouin zone in terms of simple submanifolds on which the symmetries act nicely. The main mathematical tool is the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence associated to such a decomposition, which will not only yield the explicit result for several crystal symmetries, but also sheds light on the origin of the topological invariants. This extends results that have appeared in the literature so far. We also describe examples in which this approach fails to directly yield a conclusive answer, and discuss various open problems and directions for future research.",

The Remodeling Conjecture can be viewed as a version of all genus open-closed mirror symmetry. The SYZ conjecture explains mirror symmetry as $T$-duality. After a brief review on SYZ mirror symmetry and mirrors of symplectic toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds, we give a non-technical exposition of our results on the Remodeling Conjecture for symplectic toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds.

    "abstract": "We construct and study a closed, two-dimensional, quasi-topological (0, 2) gauged sigma model with target space a smooth G-manifold, where G is any compact and connected Lie group. When the target space is a flag manifold of simple G, and the gauge group is a Cartan subgroup thereof, the perturbative model describes, purely physically, the recently formulated mathematical theory of “Twisted Chiral Differential Operators”. This paves the way, via a generalized T -duality, for a natural physical interpretation of the geometric Langlands correspondence for simply-connected, simple, complex Lie groups. In particular, the Hecke eigensheaves and Hecke operators can be described in terms of the correlation functions of certain operators that underlie the infinite-dimensional chiral algebra of the flag manifold model. Nevertheless, nonperturbative worldsheet twisted-instantons can, in some situations, trivialize the chiral algebra completely. This leads to a spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry whilst implying certain delicate conditions for the existence of BeilinsonDrinfeld D-modules. Via supersymmetric gauged quantum mechanics on loop space, these conditions can be understood to be intimately related to a conjecture by Hohn-Stolz [1] regarding the vanishing of the Witten genus on string manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. An interesting connection to Chern-Simons theory is also uncovered, whence we would be able to (i) relate general knot invariants of three-manifolds and Khovanov homology to “quantum” ramified D-modules and Lagrangian intersection Floer homology; (ii) furnish physical proofs of mathematical conjectures by Seidel-Smith [2] and Gaitsgory [3, 4] which relate knots to symplectic geometry and Langlands duality, respectively. ∗E-mail: tan@ias.edu ar X iv :1 11 1. 06 91 v1 [ he pth ] 2 N ov 2 01 1",

The finite dimensional simple modules are classified in terms of highest weights, which are essentially characterised by m+n-2 nonnegative integers and two arbitrary nonzero scalars. In the special case with m=2 and n=1, an explicit basis is constructed for each finite dimensional simple module. For all m and n, the degenerate quantum group has a natural irreducible representation acting on C(q)^(m+n). It admits an R-matrix that satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation and intertwines the co-multiplication and its opposite. This in particular gives rise to isomorphisms between the two module structures of any tensor power of C(q)^(m+n) defined relative to the co-multiplication and its opposite respectively. A topological invariant of knots is constructed from this R-matrix, which reproduces the celebrated HOMFLY polynomial. Degenerate quantum groups of other classical types are briefly discussed.",

We are lead to the notion of an `obstruction complex' associated to a model $(X, T^*_{X, -})$ whose cohomology is referred to as `obstruction cohomology'. We deduce a number of interesting consequences of a vanishing first obstruction cohomology. Among the more interesting consequences are its relation to projectability of supermanifolds and a `Batchelor-type' theorem: if the obstruction cohomology of a `good' model $(X, T^*_{X, -})$ vanishes, then any supermanifold modelled on $(X, T^*_{X, -})$ will be split.",

In this way we derive a remarkable description of the spectrum in terms of this new class of extended motifs, reminiscent of the analogous one for the closed Haldane-Shastry chain.

The main part of the L-function is described by some elliptic newform $g$ of weight 3. Then we construct an automorphic representation $\\Pi$ of ${\\rm GSp}_2(\\A)$ related to $g$ and an explicit vector $E_Z$ sits inside $\\Pi$ which creates a vector valued (non-cuspidal) Siegel modular form of weight $(3,1)$ so that $F_Z$ coincides with $E_Z$ in $H^{2,0}(\\partial W)$ under the Poincare residue map and various identifications of cohomologies.",

    "abstract": "Making use of its smooth structure only, out of a connected oriented smooth $4$-manifold a von Neumann algebra is constructed. It is geometric in the sense that is generated by local operators and as a special four dimensional phenomenon it contains all algebraic (i.e., formal or coming from a metric) curvature tensors of the underlying $4$-manifold. The von Neumann algebra itself is a hyperfinite factor of ${\\rm II}_1$-type hence is unique up to abstract isomorphisms of von Neumann algebras. Over a fixed $4$-manifold this universal von Neumann algebra admits a particular representation on a Hilbert space such that its unitary equivalence class is preserved by orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms consequently the Murray--von Neumann coupling constant of this representation is well-defined and gives rise to a new and computable real-valued smooth $4$-manifold invariant. Its link with Jones' subfactor theory is noticed as well as computations in the simply connected closed case are carried out. Application to the cosmological constant problem is also discussed. Namely, the aforementioned mathematical construction allows to reformulate the classical vacuum Einstein equation with cosmological constant over a $4$-manifold as an operator equation over its tracial universal von Neumann algebra such that the trace of a solution is naturally identified with the cosmological constant. This framework permits to use the observed magnitude of the cosmological constant to estimate by topological means the number of primordial black holes about the Planck era. This number turns out to be negligable which is in agreement with known density estimates based on the Press--Schechter mechanism.",

The role of the `global time' is played by a chosen Cauchy temporal function $\\mathcal{T}$, whereas the instantaneous configurations of the nonlocal quantity are modeled by probability measures $\\mu_t$ supported on the corresponding time slices $\\mathcal{T}^{-1}(t)$. We show that the causality of such an evolution can be expressed in three equivalent ways: (i) via the causal precedence relation $\\preceq$ extended to probability measures, (ii) with the help of a probability measure $\\sigma$ on the space of future-directed continuous causal curves endowed with the compact-open topology and (iii) through a causal vector field $X$ of $L^2_{\\textrm{loc}}$-regularity, with which the map $t \\mapsto \\mu_t$ satisfies the continuity equation in the distributional sense. In the course of the proof we find that the compact-open topology is sensitive to the differential properties of the causal curves, being equal to a topology induced from a suitable $H^1_{\\textrm{loc}}$-Sobolev space. This enables us to construct $X$ as a vector field in a sense `tangent' to $\\sigma$. In addition, we discuss the general covariance of descriptions (i)-(iii), unraveling the geometrical, observer-independent notions behind them.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the connection to 4d N = 2 theories, we study the global behavior of families of tamely-ramified SL N Hitchin integrable systems as the underlying curve varies over the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of stable pointed curves.In particular, we describe a flat degeneration of the Hitchin system to a nodal base curve and show that the behaviour of the integrable system at the node is partially encoded in a pair (O, H) where O is a nilpotent orbit and H is a simple Lie subgroup of F O , the flavour symmetry group associated to O.The family of Hitchin systems is nontrivially-fibered over the Deligne-Mumford moduli space.We prove a non-obvious result that the Hitchin bases fit together to form a vector bundle over the compactified moduli space.For the particular case of M 0,4 , we compute this vector bundle explicitly.Finally, we give a classification of the allowed pairs (O, H) that can arise for any given N .",

    "abstract": "We consider the phase-integral method applied to an arbitrary ordinary linear differential equation of the second-order and study how its symmetries affect the connection matrices associated with its general solution. We reduce the obtained exact general relation for the matrices to its limiting case introducing a concept of the effective Stokes constant. We also propose a concept of an effective Stokes diagram which can be a useful tool for analyzing difficult equations. We show that effective Stokes domains which can be overlapped by a symmetry transformation are associated with the same effective Stokes constant and can be described by the same analytical function. Basing on the derived symmetry relations, we propose a way to write functional equations for the effective Stokes constants. Finally, we provide a generalization of the derived symmetry relations for an arbitrary order linear system of the ordinary linear differential equations. This work also contains an example of usage of the presented ideas in a case of a real physical problem.

For such spacetimes, the anti de-Sitter space is used as the reference for the quasi-local energy. Given a point $p$ in a spacetime $N$, we consider a canonical family of surfaces approaching $p$ along its future null cone and evaluate the limit of the quasi-local energy. The optimal embedding equation which identifies the critical points of the quasi-local energy is solved in order to evaluate the limit. Using the optimal embedding, we show that the limit recovers the stress-energy tensor of the matter field at $p$. For vacuum spacetimes, the quasi-local energy vanishes to a higher order. In this case, the limit of the quasi-local energy is related to the Bel-Robinson tensor at $p$.",

We use recent results by Huang, Lian, Yau and Yu describing the relationship between the Picard-Fuchs equations of these varieties and their Hasse--Witt matrices, which encapsulate information about the number of points. The result allows us to compute the number of points modulo the order of the field explicitly. We illustrate this by computing K3 surface examples related to hypergeometric functions.",

    "abstract": "Quantum or classical mechanical systems symmetric under $SU(2)$ are called spin systems. A $SU(2)$-equivariant map from $(n+1)$-square matrices to functions on the $2$-sphere, satisfying some basic properties, is called a spin-$j$ symbol correspondence ($n=2j\\in\\mathbb N$). Given a spin-$j$ symbol correspondence, the matrix algebra induces a twisted $j$-algebra of symbols. In this paper, we establish a new, more intuitive criterion for when the Poisson algebra of smooth functions on the $2$-sphere emerges asymptotically ($n\\to\\infty$) from the sequence of twisted $j$-algebras. This more geometric criterion, which in many cases is equivalent to the numerical criterion obtained in [Rios&Straume], is given in terms of a classical (asymptotic) localization of symbols of all projectors (quantum pure states) in a certain family. For some important kinds of symbol correspondence sequences, such a classical localization condition is equivalent to asymptotic emergence of the Poisson algebra. But in general, this classical localization condition is stronger than Poisson emergence. We thus also consider some weaker notions of asymptotic localization of projector-symbols. Finally, we obtain some relations between asymptotic localization of a symbol correspondence sequence and its sequential quantizations of the classical spin system, after carefully developing a theory of sequential quantizations of smooth functions on $S^2$ and their asymptotic actions on a ground Hilbert space.",
