The purpose of the study is to understand the drug use experiences, perceptions of overdose risk, and experiences with overdose among former prisoners. This qualitative study included former prison inmates (N = 29) who were recruited within two months after their release. Interviewers conducted in-person, semi-structured interviews which explored participants' experiences and perceptions. Transcripts were analyzed utilizing a team-based method of inductive analysis. The following themes emerged: 1) Relapse to drugs and alcohol occurred in a context of poor social support, medical co-morbidity and inadequate economic resources; 2) former inmates experienced ubiquitous exposure to drugs in their living environments; 3) intentional overdose was considered \"a way out\" given situational stressors, and accidental overdose was perceived as related to decreased tolerance; and 4) protective factors included structured drug treatment programs, spirituality/religion, community-based resources (including self-help groups), and family. Former inmates return to environments that strongly trigger relapse to drug use and put them at risk for overdose. Interventions to prevent overdose after release from prison may benefit from including structured treatment with gradual transition to the community, enhanced protective factors, and reductions of environmental triggers to use drugs.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary advances in addiction neuroscience have paralleled increasing interest in the ancient mental training practice of mindfulness meditation as a potential therapy for addiction. In the past decade, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been studied as a treatment for an array addictive behaviors, including drinking, smoking, opioid misuse, and use of illicit substances like cocaine and heroin. This article reviews current research evaluating MBIs as a treatment for addiction, with a focus on findings pertaining to clinical outcomes and biobehavioral mechanisms. Studies indicate that MBIs reduce substance misuse and craving by modulating cognitive, affective, and psychophysiological processes integral to self-regulation and reward processing. This integrative review provides the basis for manifold recommendations regarding the next wave of research needed to firmly establish the efficacy of MBIs and elucidate the mechanistic pathways by which these therapies ameliorate addiction. Issues pertaining to MBI treatment optimization and sequencing, dissemination and implementation, dose–response relationships, and research rigor and reproducibility are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol and drug use are leading causes of morbidity and mortality that frequently go unidentified in medical settings. As part of a multi-phase study to implement electronic health record-integrated substance use screening in primary care clinics, we interviewed key clinical stakeholders to identify current substance use screening practices, barriers to screening, and recommendations for its implementation.Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 67 stakeholders, including patients, primary care providers (faculty and resident physicians), nurses, and medical assistants, in two urban academic health systems. Themes were identified using an inductive approach, revised through an iterative process, and mapped to the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework, which guides the implementation of new clinical practices (Graham et al. in J Contin Educ Health Prof 26(1):13-24, 2006).Factors affecting implementation based on KTA elements were identified from participant narratives. Identifying the problem: Participants consistently agreed that having knowledge of a patient's substance use is important because of its impacts on health and medical care, that substance use is not properly identified in medical settings currently, and that universal screening is the best approach. Assessing barriers: Patients expressed concerns about consequences of disclosing substance use, confidentiality, and the individual's own reluctance to acknowledge a substance use problem. Barriers identified by providers included individual-level factors such as lack of clinical knowledge and training, as well as systems-level factors including time pressure, resources, lack of space, and difficulty accessing addiction treatment. Adapting to the local context: Most patients and providers stated that the primary care provider should play a key role in substance use screening and interventions. Opinions diverged regarding the optimal approach to delivering screening, although most preferred a patient self-administered approach. Many providers reported that taking effective action once unhealthy substance use is identified is crucial.Participants expressed support for substance use screening as a valuable part of medical care, and identified individual-level as well as systems-level barriers to its implementation. These findings suggest that screening programs should clearly communicate the goals of screening to patients and proactively counteract stigma, address staff concerns regarding time and workflow, and provide education as well as treatment resources to primary care providers.",

    "abstract": "Nicotine is widely recognized as an addictive psychoactive drug. Since most smokers are bio-behaviorally addicted, quitting can be very difficult and is often accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. Research indicates that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can double quit rates. However, the success rate for quitting remains low. E-cigarettes (electronic cigarettes) are battery-powered nicotine delivery devices used to inhale doses of vaporized nicotine from a handheld device similar in shape to a cigarette without the harmful chemicals present in tobacco products. Anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that e-cigarettes may be effective in helping smokers quit and preventing relapse, but there have been few published qualitative studies, especially among successful e-cigarette users, to support this evidence.Qualitative design using focus groups (N = 11); 9 men and 2 women. Focus groups were conducted by posing open-ended questions relating to the use of e-cigarettes, comparison of effectiveness between NRTs and e-cigarettes, barriers to quitting, and reasons for choosing e-cigarettes over other methods.Five themes emerged that describe users' perceptions of why e-cigarettes are efficacious in quitting smoking: 1) bio-behavioral feedback, 2) social benefits, 3) hobby elements, 4) personal identity, and 5) distinction between smoking cessation and nicotine cessation. Additionally, subjects reported their experiences with NRTs compared with e-cigarettes, citing negative side effects of NRTs and their ineffectiveness at preventing relapse.These findings suggest tobacco control practitioners must pay increased attention to the importance of the behavioral and social components of smoking addiction. By addressing these components in addition to nicotine dependence, e-cigarettes appear to help some tobacco smokers transition to a less harmful replacement tool, thereby maintaining cigarette abstinence.",

    "abstract": "Post-release opioid-related overdose mortality is the leading cause of death among people released from jails or prisons (PRJP). Informed by the proximate determinants framework, this paper presents the Post-Release Opioid-Related Overdose Risk Model. It explores the underlying, intermediate, proximate and biological determinants which contribute to risk of post-release opioid-related overdose mortality. PRJP share the underlying exposure of incarceration and the increased prevalence of several moderators (chronic pain, HIV infection, trauma, race, and suicidality) of the risk of opioid-related overdose. Intermediate determinants following release from the criminal justice system include disruption of social networks, interruptions in medical care, poverty, and stigma which exacerbate underlying, and highly prevalent, substance use and mental health disorders. Subsequent proximate determinants include interruptions in substance use treatment, including access to medications for opioid use disorder, polypharmacy, polydrug use, insufficient naloxone access, and a return to solitary opioid use. This leads to the final biological determinant of reduced respiratory tolerance and finally opioid-related overdose mortality. Mitigating the risk of opioid-related overdose mortality among PRJP will require improved coordination across criminal justice, health, and community organizations to reduce barriers to social services, ensure access to health insurance, and reduce interruptions in care continuity and reduce stigma. Healthcare services and harm reduction strategies, such as safe injection sites, should be tailored to the needs of PRJP. Expanding access to opioid agonist therapy and naloxone around the post-release period could reduce overdose deaths. Programs are also needed to divert individuals with substance use disorder away from the criminal justice system and into treatment and social services, preventing incarceration exposure.",

    "abstract": "Brief interventions via the internet have been shown to reduce university students' alcohol intake. This study tested two smartphone applications (apps) targeting drinking choices on party occasions, with the goal of reducing problematic alcohol intake among Swedish university students. Students were recruited via e-mails sent to student union members at two universities. Those who gave informed consent, had a smartphone, and showed risky alcohol consumption according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were randomized into three groups. Group 1 had access to the Swedish government alcohol monopoly's app, Promillekoll, offering real-time estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) calculation; Group 2 had access to a web-based app, PartyPlanner, developed by the research group, offering real-time eBAC calculation with planning and follow-up functions; and Group 3 participants were controls. Follow-up was conducted at 7 weeks. Among 28574 students offered participation, 4823 agreed to join; 415 were excluded due to incomplete data, and 1932 fulfilled eligibility criteria for randomization. Attrition was 22.7–39.3 percent, higher among heavier drinkers and highest in Group 2. Self-reported app use was higher in Group 1 (74%) compared to Group 2 (41%). Per-protocol analyses revealed only one significant time-by-group interaction, where Group 1 participants increased the frequency of their drinking occasions compared to controls (p = 0.001). Secondary analyses by gender showed a significant difference among men in Group 1 for frequency of drinking occasions per week (p = 0.001), but not among women. Among all participants, 29 percent showed high-risk drinking, over the recommended weekly drinking levels of 9 (women) and 14 (men) standard glasses. Smartphone apps can make brief interventions available to large numbers of university students. The apps studied using eBAC calculation did not, however, seem to affect alcohol consumption among university students and one app may have led to a negative effect among men. Future research should: 1) explore ways to increase user retention, 2) include apps facilitating technical manipulation for evaluation of added components, 3) explore the effects of adapting app content to possible gender differences, and 4) offer additional interventions to high-risk users. clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01958398 .",

Variability in assessment and treatment of NAS has been attributed to the lack of high-quality evidence to guide management of exposed neonates. This systematic review examines available evidence for NAS assessment tools, nonpharmacologic interventions, and pharmacologic management of opioid-exposed infants. There is limited data on the inter-observer reliability of NAS assessment tools due to lack of a standardized approach. In addition, most scales were developed prior to the prevalent use of prescribed prenatal concomitant medications, which can complicate NAS assessment. Nonpharmacologic interventions, particularly breastfeeding, may decrease NAS severity. Opioid medications such as morphine or methadone are recommended as first-line therapy, with phenobarbital or clonidine as second-line adjunctive therapy. Further research is needed to determine best practices for assessment, nonpharmacologic intervention, and pharmacologic management of infants with NAS in order to improve outcomes.",

Opioid overdoses were initially driven in the 1990s and 2000s by the increasing availability and misuse of prescription opioids. More recently, opioid overdoses are increasing at alarming rates due to wider use of heroin, which in some places is mixed with fentanyl or fentanyl derivatives. Naloxone access for opioid overdose rescue is one of the US Department of Health and Human Services’ three priority areas for responding to the opioid crisis. This article summarizes the known benefits of naloxone access and details unanswered questions about overdose education and naloxone rescue kits. Hopefully future research will address these knowledge gaps, improve the effectiveness of opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution programs, and unlock the full promise of naloxone rescue kits.",

Few studies have examined the relationship between SUDs and suicide mortality in general populations. Our study estimates the association of SUDs with suicide mortality in a general US population of men and women who receive care across eight integrated health systems.We conducted a case-control study using electronic health records and claims data from eight integrated health systems of the Mental Health Research Network. Participants were 2674 men and women who died by suicide between 2000-2013 and 267,400 matched controls. The main outcome was suicide mortality, assessed using data from the health systems and confirmed by state death data systems. Demographic and diagnostic data on substance use disorders and other health conditions were obtained from each health system. First, we compared descriptive statistics for cases and controls, including age, gender, income, and education. Next, we compared the rate of each substance use disorder category for cases and controls. Finally, we used conditional logistic regression models to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds of suicide associated with each substance use disorder category.All categories of substance use disorders were associated with increased risk of suicide mortality. Adjusted odds ratios ranged from 2.0 (CI 1.7, 2.3) for patients with tobacco use disorder only to 11.2 (CI 8.0, 15.6) for patients with multiple alcohol, drug, and tobacco use disorders. Substance use disorders were associated with increased relative risk of suicide for both women and men across all categories, but the relative risk was more pronounced in women.Substance use disorders are associated with significant risk of suicide mortality, especially for women, even after controlling for other important risk factors. Experiencing multiple substance use disorders is particularly risky. These findings suggest increased suicide risk screening and prevention efforts for individuals with substance use disorders are needed.",

Compound availability has evolved rapidly to evade legal regulation and detection by routine drug testing. Young adults are the primary users, but trends are changing rapidly; use has become popular among members of the military. Acute toxicity is common and often manifests with a constellation of psychiatric and medical effects, which may be severe (e.g., anxiety, agitation, psychosis, and tachycardia), and multiple deaths have been reported with each of these types of designer drugs. Clinicians should keep designer drugs in mind when evaluating substance use in young adults or in anyone presenting with acute neuropsychiatric complaints. Treatment of acute intoxication involves supportive care targeting manifesting signs and symptoms. Long-term treatment of designer drug use disorder can be challenging and is complicated by a lack of evidence to guide treatment.",

    "abstract": "Telemedicine use in addiction treatment and recovery services is limited. Yet, because it removes barriers of time and distance, telemedicine offers great potential for enhancing treatment and recovery for people with substance use disorders (SUDs). Telemedicine also offers clinicians ways to increase contact with SUD patients during and after treatment. A project conducted from February 2013 to June 2014 investigated the adoption of telemedicine services among purchasers of addiction treatment in five states and one county. The project assessed purchasers' interest in and perceived facilitators and barriers to implementing one or more of the following telemedicine modalities: telephone-based care, web-based screening, web-based treatment, videoconferencing, smartphone mobile applications (apps), and virtual worlds. Purchasers expressed the most interest in implementing videoconferencing and smartphone mobile devices. The anticipated facilitators for implementing a telemedicine app included funding available to pay for the telemedicine service, local examples of success, influential champions at the payer and treatment agencies, and meeting a pressing need. The greatest barriers identified were: costs associated with implementation, lack of reimbursement for telemedicine services, providers' unfamiliarity with technology, lack of implementation models, and confidentiality regulations. This paper discusses why the project participants selected or rejected different telemedicine modalities and the policy implications that purchasers and regulators of addiction treatment services should consider for expanding their use of telemedicine. This analysis provides initial observations into how telemedicine is being implemented in addiction services in five states and one county. The project demonstrated that despite the considerable interest in telemedicine, implementation challenges exist. Future studies should broaden the sample analyzed and track technology implementation longitudinally to help the research and practitioner communities develop a greater understanding of technology implementation trends and practices.",

    "abstract": "Unhealthy alcohol use is a major contributor to the global burden of disease and injury. The US Preventive Services Task Force has recommended alcohol screening and intervention in general medical settings since 2004. Yet less than one in six US adults report health care professionals discussing alcohol with them. Little is known about methods for increasing implementation; different staffing models may be related to implementation effectiveness. This implementation trial compared delivery of alcohol screening, brief intervention and referral to specialty treatment (SBIRT) by physicians versus non-physician providers receiving training, technical assistance, and feedback reports.The study was a cluster randomized implementation trial (ADVISe [Alcohol Drinking as a Vital Sign]). Within a private, integrated health care system, 54 adult primary care clinics were stratified by medical center and randomly assigned in blocked groups of three to SBIRT by physicians (PCP arm) versus non-physician providers and medical assistants (NPP and MA arm), versus usual care (Control arm). NIH-recommended screening questions were added to the electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate SBIRT. We examined screening and brief intervention and referral rates by arm. We also examined patient-, physician-, and system-level factors affecting screening rates and, among those who screened positive, rates of brief intervention and referral to treatment.Screening rates were highest in the NPP and MA arm (51 %); followed by the PCP arm (9 %) and the Control arm (3.5 %). Screening increased over the 12 months after training in the NPP and MA arm but remained stable in the PCP arm. The PCP arm had higher brief intervention and referral rates (44 %) among patients screening positive than either the NPP and MA arm (3.4 %) or the Control arm (2.7 %). Higher ratio of MAs to physicians was related to higher screening rates in the NPP and MA arm and longer appointment times to screening and intervention rates in the PCP arm.Findings suggest that time frames longer than 12 months may be required for full SBIRT implementation. Screening by MAs with intervention and referral by physicians as needed can be a feasible model for increasing the implementation of this critical and under-utilized preventive health service within currently predominant primary care models.Clinical Trials NCT01135654.",

    "abstract": "Opioid overdose is a leading cause of death in persons experiencing homelessness (PEH), despite effective medications for opioid use disorder (OUD). In 2016, the San Francisco Street Medicine Team piloted a low barrier buprenorphine program with the primary goal of engaging and retaining PEH with OUD in care as a first step toward reducing opioid use and improving overall health. To characterize the patients; assess treatment retention, retention on buprenorphine, and opioid use; and to describe adverse events. Retrospective chart review of patients receiving at least one buprenorphine prescription from Street Medicine (November 2016–October 2017). We abstracted demographic, medical, substance use, prescription, and health care utilization data from medical records. We assessed retention in care at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, defined as a provider visit 1 week prior to or any time after each time point. We considered patients to be retained on buprenorphine if they had active buprenorphine prescriptions for more than 2 weeks of the month. We estimated opioid use by the percentage of patients with any opioid-negative, buprenorphine-positive urine toxicology test. We reviewed emergency department and hospital records for adverse events, including deaths and nonfatal opioid overdoses. Among the 95 persons eligible for analysis, mean age was 39.2, and 100% reported injecting heroin and homelessness. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities and co-occurring substance use were common. The percentages of patients retained in care at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 63%, 53%, 44%, 38%, and 26%, respectively. The percentages of patients retained on buprenorphine at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 37%, 27%, 27%, 26%, and 18%, respectively. Twenty-three percent of patients had at least one opioid-negative, buprenorphine-positive test result. One patient died from fentanyl overdose, and four patients presented on six occasions for non-fatal overdoses requiring naloxone. This program engaged and retained a subset of PEH with OUD in care and on buprenorphine over 12 months. While uninterrupted treatment and abstinence are reasonable outcomes for conventional treatment programs, intermittent treatment with buprenorphine and decreased opioid use were more common in this pilot and may confer important reductions in opioid and injection-related harms.",

    "abstract": "The global rise in opioid-related harms has impacted the United States severely. Current efforts to manage the opioid crisis have prompted a re-evaluation of many of the existing roles in the healthcare system, in order to maximize their individual effects on reducing opioid-associated morbidity and preventing overdose deaths. As one of the most accessible healthcare professionals in the US, pharmacists are well-positioned to participate in such activities. Historically, US pharmacists have had a limited role in the surveillance and treatment of substance use disorders. This narrative review explores the literature describing novel programs designed to capitalize on the role of the community pharmacist in helping to reduce opioid-related harms, as well as evaluations of existing practices already in place in the US and elsewhere around the world. Specific approaches examined include strategies to facilitate pharmacist monitoring for problematic opioid use, to increase pharmacy-based harm reduction efforts (including naloxone distribution and needle exchange programs), and to involve community pharmacists in the dispensation of opioid agonist therapy (OAT). Each of these activities present a potential means to further engage pharmacists in the identification and treatment of opioid use disorders (OUDs). Through a careful examination of these approaches, we hope that new strategies can be adopted to leverage the unique role of the community pharmacist to help reduce opioid-related harms in the US.",

The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the literature on alcohol reduction apps and the availability of evidenced-based apps on top commercial app stores. Methods We reviewed literature through to December 2019 using the databases PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar and keyword search terms smartphone/mobile/phone AND application/app AND alcohol. Articles were included if the primary intervention was a smartphone app and the study measured participant changes in frequency or volume of alcohol consumption. Results 21 relevant articles were identified that evaluated 19 unique smartphone apps. Of the 19 unique apps, seven were designed for use among youth and 12 in adult populations. The available evidence for the efficacy of alcohol reduction apps among youth is inconclusive, with results from these evaluations not showing a clear benefit in reducing alcohol consumption compared to control groups. The results of apps designed for adult populations appears more promising, but results are still mixed. Of the 19 alcohol reduction apps that have been evaluated only eight of these are currently publicly available in commercial app stores. Of these eight apps, only four were demonstrated in the literature to assist with reducing alcohol consumption. Conclusion The evidence for alcohol reduction apps is promising but inconclusive. Few apps that have been evaluated in the scientific literature are currently available for download in commercial app stores.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted a significant toll on the lives of people who use opioids (PWUOs). At the same time, more flexible regulations around provision of opioid use disorder (OUD) services have led to new opportunities for facilitating access to services for PWUOs. In the current scoping review, we describe new services and service modifications implemented by treatment and harm reduction programs serving PWUO, and discuss implications for policy and practice. Methods Literature searches were conducted within PubMed, LitCovid, Embase, and PsycInfo for English-language studies published in 2020 that describe a particular program, service, or intervention aimed at facilitating access to OUD treatment and/or harm reduction services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Abstracts were independently screened by two reviewers. Relevant studies were reviewed in full and those that met inclusion criteria underwent final data extraction and synthesis (n = 25). We used a narrative synthesis approach to identify major themes around key service modifications and innovations implemented across programs serving PWUO. Results Reviewed OUD treatment and harm reduction services spanned five continents and a range of settings from substance use treatment to street outreach programs. Innovative service modifications to adapt to COVID-19 circumstances primarily involved expanded use of telehealth services (e.g., telemedicine visits for buprenorphine, virtual individual or group therapy sessions, provision of donated or publicly available phones), increased take-home medication allowances for methadone and buprenorphine, expanded uptake of long-acting opioid medications (e.g. extended-release buprenorphine and naltrexone), home delivery of services (e.g. MOUD, naloxone and urine drug screening), outreach and makeshift services for delivering MOUD and naloxone, and provision of a safe supply of opioids. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has posed multiple challenges for PWUOs, while simultaneously accelerating innovations in policies, care models, and technologies to lower thresholds for life-saving treatment and harm reduction services. Such innovations highlight novel patient-centered and feasible approaches to mitigating OUD related harms. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term impact of these approaches and inform policies that improve access to care for PWUOs.",

Bridge clinics offer immediate access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and other SUD treatment and are increasingly numerous. However, given relatively recent implementation, the clinical impact of bridge clinics is not well described. Methods In this narrative review, we describe existing bridge clinic models, services provided, and unique characteristics, highlighting how bridge clinics fill critical gaps in the SUD care continuum. We discuss available evidence for bridge clinic effectiveness in care delivery, including retention in SUD care. We also highlight gaps in available data. Results The first era of bridge clinic implementation has yielded diverse models united in the mission to lower barriers to SUD treatment entry, and preliminary data indicate success in patient-centered program design, MOUD initiation, MOUD retention, and SUD care innovation. However, data on effectiveness in linking to long-term care are limited. Conclusions Bridge clinics represent a critical innovation, offering on-demand access to MOUD and other services. Evaluating the effectiveness of bridge clinics in linking patients to long-term care settings remains an important research priority; however, available data show promising rates of treatment initiation and retention, potentially the most important metric amidst an increasingly dangerous drug supply.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Deaths from opioid overdose have increased dramatically in the past decade. For individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), agonist medications such as methadone and buprenorphine reduce opioid-related morbidity and mortality. Historically, the provision of buprenorphine treatment in office-based settings has relied on frequent in-person contact, likely influencing patients’ access to and retention in care. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providers of office-based buprenorphine treatment rapidly adapted their care processes, increasingly relying on telemedicine visits. To date, relatively few prior studies have combined patient and clinician perspectives to examine the implementation of telemedicine and related care adaptations, particularly in safety-net settings. Methods Qualitative methods were used to explore clinician and patient experiences with telemedicine in an office-based buprenorphine treatment clinic affiliated with an urban safety-net hospital. From this clinic, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 patients and 16 clinicians (including prescribers and non-prescribers). We coded all interview data and used a thematic analysis approach to understand how telemedicine impacted treatment quality and engagement in care, as well as preferences for using telemedicine moving forward. Results Five themes regarding the implementation of telemedicine and other COVID-19-related care adaptations arose from patient and clinician perspectives: (1) telemedicine integration precipitated openness to more flexibility in care practices, (2) concerns regarding telemedicine-related adaptations centered around safety and accountability, (3) telemedicine encounters required rapport and trust between patients and clinicians to facilitate open communication, (4) safety-net patient populations experienced unique challenges when using telemedicine, particularly in terms of the technology required and the need for privacy, and (5) there is an important role for telemedicine in office-based buprenorphine treatment moving forward, primarily through its use in hybrid models of care which integrate both in-person and virtual visits. Conclusions Telemedicine implementation within office-based buprenorphine treatment has the potential to improve patients’ engagement in care; however, our findings emphasize the need for tailored approaches to implementing telemedicine in office-based buprenorphine treatment, particularly within safety-net settings. Overall, this study supports the maintenance of changes to policy and practice that facilitate the use of telemedicine in office-based buprenorphine treatment beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency.",

    "abstract": "The United States has the highest rate of incarceration in the world (937 per 100,000 adults). Approximately one-third of heroin users pass through correctional facilities annually. Few receive medication assisted treatment (MAT; either methadone or buprenorphine) for opioid use disorder during incarceration, and nearly three-quarters relapse to heroin use within 3 months of release. This qualitative study investigated barriers to and facilitators of buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) following release from incarceration (\"re-entry\").We conducted 21 semistructured interviews of former inmates with opioid use disorder recruited from addiction treatment settings. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Themes that emerged upon iterative readings of transcripts were discussed by the research team.Participants reported adverse re-entry conditions, including persistent exposure to drug use and stressful life events, which were perceived to contribute to opioid relapse and affected addiction treatment decisions during re-entry. Themes that emerged relating to BMT included: 1) reliance on willpower; 2) fear of dependency on medications; 3) variable exposure to buprenorphine; and 4) acceptability of BMT following relapse. Willpower was perceived to be more important for recovery than medications. Many participants experienced painful withdrawal from methadone during incarceration and were fearful that using MAT would lead to opioid tolerance and painful withdrawal again in the future. Participants reported both positive and negative experiences taking illicit buprenorphine, which affected interest in BMT. Overall, BMT was perceived to be a good treatment option for opioid use disorder that could reduce the risk of re-incarceration.BMT was perceived to be acceptable, but former inmates with opioid use disorder may be reluctant to utilize BMT upon re-entry. Factors limiting utilization of BMT could be mitigated though policy change or interventions. Policies of the criminal justice system (e.g., forced detoxification) may be dissuading former inmates from utilizing effective treatments for opioid use disorder. Interventions that improve education and access to BMT for former inmates with opioid use disorder could facilitate entrance into treatment. Both policy changes and interventions are urgently needed to reduce the negative consequences of opioid relapse following re-entry.",

Common medical conditions for which marijuana is allowed (i.e., those conditions shared by at least 80 percent of medical marijuana states) were identified as: Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cachexia/wasting syndrome, cancer, Crohn's disease, epilepsy and seizures, glaucoma, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, multiple sclerosis and muscle spasticity, severe and chronic pain, and severe nausea.

Cut-off scores for detecting drinking above recommended limits vary by population, setting, country and potentially format. This validation study aimed to determine AUDIT-C thresholds that indicated risky drinking among a population of people seeking help over the Internet. The data in this study were collected in the pilot phase of the Down Your Drink trial, which recruited people seeking help over the Internet and randomised them to a web-based intervention or an information-only website. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated for AUDIT-C scores, relative to weekly consumption that indicated drinking above limits and higher risk drinking. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created to assess the performance of different cut-off scores on the AUDIT-C for men and women. Past week alcohol consumption was used as the reference-standard and was collected via the TOT-AL, a validated online measure of past week drinking. AUDIT-C scores were obtained from 3720 adults (2053 female and 1667 male) searching the internet for help with drinking, mostly from the UK. The area under the ROC curve for risky drinking was 0.84 (95% CI 0.80, 0.87) (female) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.76, 0.84) (male). AUDIT-C cut-off scores for detecting risky drinking that maximise the sum of sensitivity and specificity were ≥8 for women and ≥8 for men; whereas those identifying the highest proportion of correctly classified individuals were ≥4 for women and ≥5 for men. AUDIT-C cut-off scores for detecting higher risk drinking were also calculated. AUDIT-C cut-off scores for identifying alcohol consumption above weekly limits in this largely UK based study population were substantially higher than those reported in other validation studies. Researchers and practitioners should select AUDIT-C cut-off scores according to the purpose of identifying risky drinkers and hence the relative importance of sensitivity and/or specificity.",

A web-based survey (N = 437) was used to examine the influence of PCP factors (attitudes and knowledge, training, self-efficacy, comfort with alcohol and drug issues); patient characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, comorbidities and risk factors); and organizational factors (screening barriers, staffing resources, confidentiality issues) on AOD screening practices. Self-reported and electronic medical record (EMR)-recorded screening rates were also assessed. More PCPs felt unprepared to diagnose alcohol abuse (42%) and other drug abuse (56%) than depression (29%) (p < 0.001). Overall, PCPs were more likely to screen boys than girls, and male PCPs were even more likely than female PCPs to screen boys (23% versus 6%, p < 0.0001). Having more time and having other staff screen and review results were identified as potential screening facilitators. Self-reported screening rates were significantly higher than actual (EMR-recorded) rates for all substances. Feeling prepared to diagnose AOD problems predicted higher self-reported screening rates (OR = 1.02, p <0.001), and identifying time constraints as a barrier to screening predicted lower self-reported screening rates (OR = 0.91, p < 0.001). Higher average panel age was a significant predictor of increased EMR-recorded screening rates (OR = 1.11, p < 0.001). Organizational factors, lack of training, and discomfort with AOD screening may impact adolescent substance-abuse screening and intervention, but organizational approaches (e.g., EMR tools and workflow) may matter more than PCP or patient factors in determining screening.",

Despite this increase, access to evidence-based medication for opioid agonist treatment (OAT) for youth remains low. Among older adults, barriers to OAT include the paucity of buprenorphine-waivered prescribers and low rates of prescribing among waivered physicians. We have increasingly found in our clinical practice significant stigma related to using OAT to treat addiction for young adults. In this series, we describe three cases of young adults who faced significant stigma related to their treatment. The first case is a young male with a history of significant trauma and a severe opioid use disorder. He started buprenorphine and has found a job, stayed abstinent, and began a healthy relationship. At each step in his recovery, he has faced resistance to taking medication from other treatment providers, directors of sober houses, and his parents. The second case is a young woman who presented to a substance use treatment program after a relapse. She was unable to restart buprenorphine despite our calling to ask that it be restarted. Ultimately, she left against medical advice and was stabilized as an outpatient on buprenorphine. The final case is a young woman who stopped buprenorphine after being told she was “not sober” while attending 12-step group but restarted after conversations with her clinical team. In each case, the patient has continued their medication treatment and are stable. Opioid-related deaths continue to rise among all age groups, including young adults. Stigma related to medication treatment can be a substantial barrier for many young adult patients but there are concrete steps that providers and communities can take to address this stigma.",

    "abstract": "A distinction is made between the clinical and public health justifications for screening and brief intervention (SBI) against hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption. Early claims for a public health benefit of SBI derived from research on general medical practitioners' (GPs') advice on smoking cessation, but these claims have not been realized, mainly because GPs have not incorporated SBI into their routine practice. A recent modeling exercise estimated that, if all GPs in England screened every patient at their next consultation, 96% of the general population would be screened over 10 years, with 70-79% of excessive drinkers receiving brief interventions (BI); assuming a 10% success rate, this would probably amount to a population-level effect of SBI. Thus, a public health benefit for SBI presupposes widespread screening; but recent government policy in England favors targeted versus universal screening, and in Scotland screening is based on new registrations and clinical presentation. A recent proposal for a national screening program was rejected by the UK National Health Service's National Screening Committee because 1) there was no good evidence that SBI led to reductions in mortality or morbidity, and 2) a safe, simple, precise, and validated screening test was not available. Even in countries like Sweden and Finland, where expensive national programs to disseminate SBI have been implemented, only a minority of the population has been asked about drinking during health-care visits, and a minority of excessive drinkers has been advised to cut down. Although there has been research on the relationship between treatment for alcohol problems and population-level effects, there has been no such research for SBI, nor have there been experimental investigations of its relationship with population-level measures of alcohol-related harm. These are strongly recommended. In this article, conditions that would allow a population-level effect of SBI to occur are reviewed, including their political acceptability. It is tentatively concluded that widespread dissemination of SBI, without the implementation of alcohol control measures, might have indirect influences on levels of consumption and harm but would be unlikely on its own to result in public health benefits. However, if and when alcohol control measures were introduced, SBI would still have an important role in the battle against alcohol-related harm.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption has been associated with poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence but less is known about its relationship to HIV viral suppression, or whether certain drinking patterns have a stronger association than others. The objectives of this study were to determine the association of different patterns of alcohol consumption to HIV viral suppression and ART adherence, and to determine whether any associations of alcohol with HIV viral suppression were mediated by poor ART adherence.This observational study used baseline data from 619 HIV+ participants, recruited across 8 clinical and community settings across Florida as part of the Florida Cohort from 2014 to 2016. Alcohol consumption was measured by self-report, and grouped into four categories: heavy drinking (>7/week for women or >14 drinks/week for men); binge, but not heavy drinking (≥4 or >5 drinks/occasion for women and men, respectively), low level drinking (neither heavy nor binge), and abstinence. Serum HIV RNA measurements were obtained from statewide HIV surveillance data, and durable viral suppression was defined as achieving HIV viral suppression (<200 copies/ml) at every assessment in the past 12 months.The majority of the 619 participants were male (63%) and aged 45 or greater (65%). The proportion of participants with heavy, binge, low-level drinking and abstinence was 9, 25, 37 and 30%, respectively. Optimal ART adherence (≥95%) was reported by 68%, and 60% achieved durable viral suppression. In multivariable analysis controlling for demographic factors, drug use, and homelessness, heavy drinking (compared to abstinence) was associated with increased odds of failing to achieve durable viral suppression (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.08-4.32) whereas binge drinking alone was not significantly associated with this outcome (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.64-1.70). Both heavy drinking and binge drinking were significantly associated with suboptimal ART adherence. Mediation analyses suggested that only a small proportion of the relationship between heavy drinking and suboptimal viral suppression was due to poor ART adherence.Exceeding weekly recommended levels of alcohol consumption (heavy drinking) was significantly associated with poor HIV viral suppression and ART non-adherence, while binge drinking was associated with suboptimal ART adherence in this sample. Clinicians should attempt to address heavy drinking in their patients with HIV.",

    "abstract": "The non-medical use of opioids has reached epidemic levels nationwide, and rural areas have been particularly affected by increasing rates of overdose mortality as well as increases in the prison population. Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) are at increased risk for relapse and overdose upon reentry to the community due to decreased tolerance during incarceration. It is crucial to identify barriers to substance use disorder treatment post-release from prison because treatment can be particularly difficult to access in resource-limited rural Appalachia.A social ecological framework was utilized to examine barriers to community-based substance use treatment among individuals with OUD in Appalachian Kentucky following release from prison. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 15 social service clinicians (SSCs) employed by the Department of Corrections were conducted to identify barriers at the individual, interpersonal, organizational/institutional level, community, and systems levels. Two independent coders conducted line-by-line coding to identify key themes.Treatment barriers were identified across the social ecological spectrum. At the individual-level, SSCs highlighted high-risk drug use and a lack of motivation. At the interpersonal level, homogenous social networks (i.e., homophilious drug-using networks) and networks with limited treatment knowledge inhibited treatment. SSC's high case load and probation/parole officer's limited understanding of treatment were organizational/institutional barriers. Easy access to opioids, few treatment resources, and a lack of community support for treatment were barriers at the community level. SSC's noted system-level barriers such as lack of transportation options, cost, and uncertainty about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.More rural infrastructure resources as well as additional education for family networks, corrections staff, and the community at large in Appalachia are needed to address barriers to OUD treatment. Future research should examine barriers from the perspective of other key stakeholders (e.g., clients, families of clients) and test interventions to increase access to OUD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine/amphetamine use has sharply increased among people with opioid use disorder (OUD). It is therefore important to understand whether and how use of these substances may impact receipt of, and outcomes associated with, medications for OUD (MOUD). This systematic review identified studies that examined associations between methamphetamine/amphetamine use or use disorder and 3 classes of outcomes: (1) receipt of MOUD, (2) retention in MOUD, and (3) opioid abstinence during MOUD. We searched 3 databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete) from 1/1/2000 to 7/28/2020 using key words and subject headings, and hand-searched reference lists of included articles. English-language studies of people with documented OUD/opioid use that reported a quantitative association between methamphetamine/amphetamine use or use disorder and an outcome of interest were included. Study data were extracted using a standardized template, and risk of bias was assessed for each study. Screening, inclusion, data extraction and bias assessment were conducted independently by 2 authors. Study characteristics and findings were summarized for each class of outcomes. Thirty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Studies generally found that methamphetamine/amphetamine use or use disorder was negatively associated with receiving methadone and buprenorphine; 2 studies suggested positive associations with receiving naltrexone. Studies generally found negative associations with retention; most studies finding no association had small samples, and these studies tended to examine shorter retention timeframes and describe provision of adjunctive services to address substance use. Studies generally found negative associations with opioid abstinence during treatment among patients receiving methadone or sustained-release naltrexone implants, though observed associations may have been confounded by other polysubstance use. Most studies examining opioid abstinence during other types of MOUD treatment had small samples. Overall, existing research suggests people who use methamphetamine/amphetamines may have lower receipt of MOUD, retention in MOUD, and opioid abstinence during MOUD. Future research should examine how specific policies and treatment models impact MOUD outcomes for these patients, and seek to understand the perspectives of MOUD providers and people who use both opioids and methamphetamine/amphetamines. Efforts to improve MOUD care and overdose prevention strategies are needed for this population.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid use and opioid-related overdose continue to rise among racial/ethnic minorities. Social determinants of health negatively impact these communities, possibly resulting in poorer treatment outcomes. Research is needed to investigate how to overcome the disproportionate and deleterious impact of social determinants of health on treatment entry, retention, drug use and related outcomes among racial/ethnic minorities. The current commentary provides recommendations that may help researchers respond more effectively to reducing health disparities in substance use treatment. We begin with recommendations of best research practices (e.g., ensuring adequate recruitment of racial/ethnic minorities in research, central components of valid analysis, and adequate methods for assessing effect sizes for racial/ethnic minorities). Then, we propose that more NIDA research focuses on issues disproportionately affecting racial/ethnic minorities. Next, techniques for increasing the number of underrepresented racial/ethnic treatment researchers are suggested. We then recommend methods for infusing racial/ethnic expertise onto funding decision panels. This commentary ends with a case study that features NIDA’s National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Conclusions The proposed recommendations can serve as guidelines for substance use research funders to promote research that has the potential to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in substance use treatment and to increase training opportunities for racial/ethnic minority researchers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Though methadone has been shown to effectively treat opioid use disorder, many barriers prevent individuals from accessing and maintaining treatment. Barriers are prevalent in less populated areas where treatment options are limited. This study examines barriers to retention in methadone treatment in a small Midwest community and identifies factors associated with greater endorsement of barriers. Methods Patients at an opioid treatment program (N = 267) were recruited to complete a computer-based survey onsite. Surveys assessed demographics, opioid misuse, depression and anxiety symptoms, trauma history and symptoms, social support, and barriers to retention in treatment (e.g., childcare, work, housing, transportation, legal obligations, cost, health). Descriptive statistics were used to examine individual barriers and multiple regression was calculated to identify demographic and psychosocial factors associated with greater cumulative barriers. Results Most participants reported at least one barrier to retention in treatment and more than half reported multiple barriers. Travel hardships and work conflicts were the most highly endorsed barriers. Past year return to use ( B = 2.31, p = 0.004) and more severe mental health symptomology ( B = 0.20, p = 0.038) were associated with greater cumulative barriers. Greater levels of social support were associated with fewer barriers ( B = − 0.23, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion This study adds to the limited research on barriers to retention in methadone treatment among patients in rural and small urban communities. Findings suggest flexible regulations for dispensing methadone, co-location or care coordination, and family or peer support programs may further reduce opioid use and related harms in small communities. Individuals with past year return to use reported a greater number of barriers, highlighting the time following return to use as critical for wraparound services and support. Those with co-occurring mental health issues may be vulnerable to poor treatment outcomes, as evidenced by greater endorsement of barriers. As social support emerged as a protective factor, efforts to strengthen informal support networks should be explored as adjunctive services to methadone treatment.",

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies may have increased overdose risk for people who use drugs by impacting social, community, and structural factors.The study included a quantitative survey focused on COVID-19 administered to 50 people who use drugs and semi-structured qualitative interviews with 17 people who use drugs, 12 of whom also participated in the quantitative survey. Descriptive statistics were run for the quantitative data. Qualitative coding was line-by-line then grouped thematically. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated during analysis.Findings demonstrate how COVID-19 disruptions at the structural and community level affected outcomes related to mental health and drug use at the individual level. Themes that emerged from the qualitative interviews were (1) lack of employment opportunities, (2) food and housing insecurity, (3) community stigma impacting health service use, (4) mental health strains, and (5) drug market disruptions. Structural and community changes increased anxiety, depression, and loneliness on the individual level, as well as changes in drug use patterns, all of which are likely to increase overdose risk.The COVID-19 pandemic, and mitigation strategies aimed at curbing infection, disrupted communities and lives of people who use drugs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) frequently leave the hospital as patient directed discharges (PDDs) because of untreated withdrawal and pain. Short-acting opioids can complement methadone, buprenorphine, and non-opioid adjuvants for withdrawal and pain, however little evidence exists for this approach. We described the safety and preliminary outcomes of short-acting opioid agonist treatment (sOAT) for hospitalized patients with OUD at an academic hospital in Philadelphia, PA. Methods From August 2021 to March 2022, a pharmacist guided implementation of a pilot sOAT protocol consisting of escalating doses of oxycodone or oral hydromorphone scheduled every four hours, intravenous hydromorphone as needed, and non-opioid adjuvants for withdrawal and pain. All patients were encouraged to start methadone or buprenorphine treatment for OUD. We abstracted data from the electronic health record into a secure platform. The primary outcome was safety: administration of naloxone, over-sedation, or a fall. Secondary outcomes were PDDs and respective length of stay (LOS), discharges on methadone or buprenorphine, and discharges with naloxone. We compared secondary outcomes to hospitalizations in the 12 months prior to the index hospitalization among the same cohort. Results Of the 23 cases, 13 (56.5%) were female, 19 (82.6%) were 40 years or younger, and 22 (95.7%) identified as White. Twenty-one (91.3%) regularly injected opioids and four (17.3%) were enrolled in methadone or buprenorphine prior to hospitalization. sOAT was administered at median doses of 200–320 morphine milligram equivalents per 24-h period. Naloxone administration was documented once in the operating room, over-sedation was documented once after unsanctioned opioid use, and there were no falls. The PDD rate was 44% with median LOS 5 days (compared to PDD rate 69% with median LOS 3 days for prior admissions), 65% of sOAT cases were discharged on buprenorphine or methadone (compared to 33% for prior admissions), and 65% of sOAT cases were discharged with naloxone (compared to 19% for prior admissions). Conclusions Pilot implementation of sOAT was safe. Compared to prior admissions in the same cohort, the PDD rate was lower, LOS for PDDs was longer, and more patients were discharged on buprenorphine or methadone and with naloxone, however efficacy for these secondary outcomes remains to be established.",

Few published studies investigate experiences in the immediate period (i.e., first 24 h) of re-entry among people with OUD. Aim To understand the barriers and facilitators to treatment and reintegration of people with OUD during the initial transition from carceral settings back into the community. Methods From January–December 2017, we conducted 42 semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients with a history of incarceration who were receiving methadone at a not-for-profit, low-barrier opioid treatment program. Interviews probed participants’ community re-entry experiences immediately following incarceration. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a Thematic Analysis approach. Results The main themes described the experiences during the 24 h following release, reacclimating and navigating re-entry barriers, and re-entry preparedness and planning. Participants noted the initial 24 h to be a period of risk for returning to substance use or an opportunity to engage with OUD treatment as well as a tenuous period where many lacked basic resources such as shelter or money. When discussing the subsequent re-entry period, participants noted social challenges and persistent barriers to stable housing and employment. Participants overall described feeling unprepared for release and suggested improvements including formal transition programs, improved education, and support to combat the risk of overdose and return to substance use after incarceration. Conclusions In this study that qualitatively examines the experiences of people with incarceration histories and OUD enrolled in methadone treatment, we found that participants faced many barriers to community re-entry, particularly surrounding basic resources and treatment engagement. Participants reported feeling unprepared for release but made concrete suggestions for interventions that might improve the barriers they encountered. Future work should examine the incorporation of these perspectives of people with lived experience into the development of transition programs or re-entry classes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly comorbid with substance use disorders (SUDs), resulting in high prevalence of PTSD among individuals in residential SUD care. However, there is limited research on integrating trauma treatment into residential SUD care settings. The aim of the present project was to conduct an initial evaluation of the effects of group-based Written Exposure Therapy (WET) on PTSD and depressive symptoms that was integrated into programming for individuals in residential SUD treatment. Methods Participants were 48 Veterans with comorbid PTSD-SUD from a 28 day residential SUD program at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Eligible participants were enrolled in 5 sessions of WET, delivered twice-weekly in an adapted group format. PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms were assessed at each session with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, DSM-5 version (PCL-5) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results Over 5 months, 76.2% of the target population were successfully enrolled. Of the enrolled sample, 48 participants, 92% ( n = 44) completed 3 sessions, while 56% ( n = 28) completed 5 sessions. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) showed significant within-person reductions in PTSD symptoms over time, with an average decrease of 3.18 per session (χ² = 23.21, p = .006) and moderate effect sizes ( d = 0.46 and d = 0.51 at mid- and post-treatment). In addition, there were significant reductions in depressive symptoms within-persons over time, with an average per-session reduction of 1.13 (χ² = 23.10, p = .006). Conclusion Findings demonstrate that brief, group-delivered WET is feasible and shows promise for addressing PTSD and depressive symptoms in residential SUD treatment. Results of the present evaluation could inform further efficacy testing and implementation of PTSD treatment into residential SUD settings.",

Technology-based interventions are highly relevant to this population. This paper comprises a systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized trials of technology-based interventions evaluated in a tertiary (university/college) setting for tobacco and other drug use (excluding alcohol). It extends previous reviews by using a broad definition of technology. PubMed, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane databases were searched using keywords, phrases, and MeSH terms. Retrieved abstracts (n = 627) were double screened and coded. Included studies met the following criteria: (1) the study was a randomized trial or a randomized controlled trial (RCT); (2) the sample was composed of students attending a tertiary (e.g., university, college) institution; (3) the intervention was either delivered by or accessed using a technological device or process (e.g., computer/internet, telephone, mobile short message services [SMS]); (4) the age range or mean of the sample was between 18 and 25 years; and (5) the intervention was designed to alter a drug use outcome relating to tobacco or other drugs (excluding alcohol). A total of 12 papers met inclusion criteria for the current review. The majority of included papers examined tobacco use (n = 9; 75%), two studies targeted marijuana use (17%); and one targeted stress, marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco use. A quantitative meta-analysis was conducted on the tobacco use studies using an abstinence outcome measure (n = 6), demonstrating that the interventions increased the rate of abstinence by 1.5 times that of controls (Risk Ratio [RR] = 1.54; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.20–1.98). Across all 12 studies, a total of 20 technology-based interventions were reviewed. A range of technology was employed in the interventions, including stand-alone computer programs (n = 10), internet (n = 5), telephone (n = 3), and mobile SMS (n = 2). Although technological interventions have the potential to reduce drug use in tertiary students, very few trials have been conducted, particularly for substances other than tobacco. However, the improvement shown in abstinence from tobacco use has the potential to impact substantially on morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Heavy drinking jeopardizes the health of patients in HIV primary care. In alcohol dependent patients in HIV primary care, a technological enhancement of brief intervention, HealthCall administered via interactive voice response (HealthCall-IVR) was effective at reducing heavy drinking. The smartphone offered a technology platform to improve HealthCall. Working with input from patients, technology experts, and HIV clinic personnel, we further developed HealthCall, harnessing smartphone technological capacities (HealthCall-S). In a pilot study, we compared rates of HealthCall-S daily use and drinking outcomes in 41 alcohol dependent HIV-infected patients with the 43 alcohol dependent HIV-infected patients who used HealthCall-IVR in our previous efficacy study. Procedures, clinic, personnel, and measures were largely the same in the two studies, and the two groups of patients were demographically similar (~90% minority). Pilot patients used HealthCall-S a median of 85.0% of the 60 days of treatment, significantly greater than the corresponding rate (63.8%) among comparison patients using HealthCall-IVR (p < .001). Mean end-of-treatment drinks per drinking day was similar in the two groups. Patients were highly satisfied with HealthCall-S (i.e., 92% reported that they liked using HealthCall-S). Among alcohol dependent patients in HIV primary care, HealthCall delivered via smartphone is feasible, obtains better patient engagement than HealthCall-IVR, and is associated with decreased drinking. In HIV primary care settings, HealthCall-S may offer a way to improve drinking outcomes after brief intervention by extending patient engagement with little additional demands on staff time.",

    "abstract": "Substance use remains a leading cause of preventable death globally. A model of intervention known as screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) was developed decades ago to facilitate time- and resource-sensitive interventions in acute care and outpatient settings. SBIRT, which includes a psychosocial intervention incorporating the principles of motivational interviewing, has been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption and consequences in unhealthy drinkers both in primary care and emergency department settings. Subsequently, SBIRT for unhealthy alcohol use has been endorsed by governmental agencies and professional societies in multiple countries. Although most trials support the efficacy of SBIRT for unhealthy alcohol use (McQueen et al. in Cochrane Database Syst Rev 8, 2011; Kaner et al. in Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2, 2007; O'Donnell et al. in Alcohol Alcohol 49(1):66-78, 2014), results are heterogenous; negative studies exist. A newer approach to screening and intervention for substance use can incorporate initiation of medication management at the index visit, for individuals willing to do so, and for providers and healthcare systems that are appropriately trained and resourced. Our group has conducted two successful trials of an approach we call screening, treatment initiation, and referral (STIR). In one trial, initiation of nicotine pharmacotherapy coupled with screening and brief counseling in adult smokers resulted in sustained biochemically confirmed abstinence. In a second trial, initiation of buprenorphine for opioid dependent individuals resulted in greater engagement in treatment at 30 days and greater self-reported abstinence. STIR may offer a new, clinically effective approach to the treatment of substance use in clinical care settings.",

    "abstract": "Substance use disorders (SUDs), whether active or in remission, are often encountered in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain. Clinicians are challenged when managing chronic pain while facing substance abuse issues during the course of chronic opioid therapy (COT). Further, the interrelated behavioral symptomatology of addiction and chronic pain suggests that if one disorder is untreated, effective treatment of the other in not possible. Incomplete understanding of the overlapping presentations of the two disorders, coupled with insufficient management of both conditions, leads to undertreated pain and premature discharge of SUD patients from pain treatment. In order to achieve pain relief and optimal functionality, both conditions need to be carefully managed. This paper reviews the prevalence of SUDs in chronic pain patents; the overlapping presentation of the two disorders; risk factors and stratification for addiction; identification of addiction in the chronic pain population; and suggestions for treating patients with COT, with an emphasis on relapse prevention. With appropriate assessment and treatment, COT for chronic pain patients with a history of SUD can be successful, leading to improved functionality and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Persons living with HIV and substance use disorders face barriers to sustained engagement in medical care, leading to suboptimal antiretroviral treatment outcomes. Innovative mobile technology tools such as customizable smartphone applications have the potential to enhance existing care coordination programs, but have not been rigorously studied. We developed and implemented a two-component intervention consisting of peer health navigation supported by a smartphone application conducting ecologic momentary assessment (EMA) of barriers to care and medication adherence. Patients with a history of antiretroviral treatment failure and substance use were recruited to participate in the 9-month pilot intervention. Three peer health navigators were trained to provide social and logistical support while participants re-engaged in HIV care. We assessed the acceptability of the intervention components using qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews conducted with study participants and peer navigators. Of 19 patients enrolled in the study, 17 participated for at least 2 months and 15 completed the entire 9-month study protocol. The acceptability of the peer navigation intervention was rated favorably by all participants interviewed, who felt that peer support was instrumental in helping them re-engage in HIV care. Participants also responded favorably to the smartphone application, but described its usefulness mostly as providing reminders to take medications and attend appointments, rather than as a facilitator of patient navigation. Peer health navigation and smartphone-based EMA are acceptable approaches to facilitating engagement in HIV care for drug using populations. Future studies to evaluate the efficacy of this approach for improving long-term retention in care and antiretroviral treatment outcomes are warranted.

    "abstract": "Buprenorphine maintenance for opioid dependence remains of limited availability among underserved populations, despite increases in US opioid misuse and overdose deaths. Low threshold primary care treatment models including the use of unobserved, \"home,\" buprenorphine induction may simplify initiation of care and improve access. Unobserved induction and long-term treatment outcomes have not been reported recently among large, naturalistic cohorts treated in low threshold safety net primary care settings.This prospective clinical registry cohort design estimated rates of induction-related adverse events, treatment retention, and urine opioid results for opioid dependent adults offered buprenorphine maintenance in a New York City public hospital primary care office-based practice from 2006 to 2013. This clinic relied on typical ambulatory care individual provider-patient visits, prescribed unobserved induction exclusively, saw patients no more than weekly, and did not require additional psychosocial treatment. Unobserved induction consisted of an in-person screening and diagnostic visit followed by a 1-week buprenorphine written prescription, with pamphlet, and telephone support. Primary outcomes analyzed were rates of induction-related adverse events (AE), week 1 drop-out, and long-term treatment retention. Factors associated with treatment retention were examined using a Cox proportional hazard model among inductions and all patients. Secondary outcomes included overall clinic retention, buprenorphine dosages, and urine sample results.Of the 485 total patients in our registry, 306 were inducted, and 179 were transfers already on buprenorphine. Post-induction (n = 306), week 1 drop-out was 17%. Rates of any induction-related AE were 12%; serious adverse events, 0%; precipitated withdrawal, 3%; prolonged withdrawal, 4%. Treatment retention was a median 38 weeks (range 0-320) for inductions, compared to 110 (0-354) weeks for transfers and 57 for the entire clinic population. Older age, later years of first clinic visit (vs. 2006-2007), and baseline heroin abstinence were associated with increased treatment retention overall.Unobserved \"home\" buprenorphine induction in a public sector primary care setting appeared a feasible and safe clinical practice. Post-induction treatment retention of a median 38 weeks was in line with previous naturalistic studies of real-world office-based opioid treatment. Low threshold treatment protocols, as compared to national guidelines, may compliment recently increased prescriber patient limits and expand access to buprenorphine among public sector opioid use disorder patients.",

    "abstract": "Unhealthy alcohol use includes the spectrum of alcohol consumption from risky drinking to alcohol use disorders. Routine alcohol screening, brief intervention (BI) and referral to treatment (RT) are commonly endorsed for improving the identification and management of unhealthy alcohol use in outpatient settings. However, factors which might impact screening, BI, and RT implementation in inpatient settings, particularly if delivered by nurses, are unknown, and must be identified to effectively plan randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of nurse-delivered BI. The purpose of this study was to identify the potential barriers and facilitators associated with nurse-delivered alcohol screening, BI and RT for hospitalized patients.We conducted audio-recorded focus groups with nurses from three medical-surgical units at a large urban Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Transcripts were analyzed using modified grounded theory techniques to identify key themes regarding anticipated barriers and facilitators to nurse-delivered screening, BI and RT in the inpatient setting.A total of 33 medical-surgical nurses (97% female, 83% white) participated in one of seven focus groups. Nurses consistently anticipated the following barriers to nurse-delivered screening, BI, and RT for hospitalized patients: (1) lack of alcohol-related knowledge and skills; (2) limited interdisciplinary collaboration and communication around alcohol-related care; (3) inadequate alcohol assessment protocols and poor integration with the electronic medical record; (4) concerns about negative patient reaction and limited patient motivation to address alcohol use; (5) questionable compatibility of screening, BI and RT with the acute care paradigm and nursing role; and (6) logistical issues (e.g., lack of time/privacy). Suggested facilitators of nurse-delivered screening, BI, and RT focused on provider- and system-level factors related to: (1) improved provider knowledge, skills, communication, and collaboration; (2) expanded processes of care and nursing roles; and (3) enhanced electronic medical record features.RCTs of nurse-delivered alcohol BI for hospitalized patients should include consideration of the following elements: comprehensive provider education on alcohol screening, BI and RT; record-keeping systems which efficiently document and plan alcohol-related care; a hybrid model of implementation featuring active roles for interdisciplinary generalists and specialists; and ongoing partnerships to facilitate generation of additional evidence for BI efficacy in hospitalized patients.",

The purpose of the present study was to examine past-month marijuana use and the co-use of marijuana and tobacco in a convenience sample of young adult smokers with national US coverage.Young adults age 18 to 25 who had smoked at least one cigarette in the past 30 days were recruited online between 4/1/09 and 12/31/10 to participate in an online survey on tobacco use. We examined past 30 day marijuana use, frequency of marijuana use, and proportion of days co-using tobacco and marijuana by demographic characteristics and daily smoking status.Of 3512 eligible and valid survey responses, 1808 (51.5%) smokers completed the survey. More than half (53%, n = 960) of the sample reported past-month marijuana use and reported a median use of 18 out of the past 30 days (interquartile range [IR] = 4, 30). Co-use of tobacco and marijuana occurred on nearly half (median = 45.5%; IR = 13.1, 90.3) of the days on which either substance was used and was more frequent among Caucasians, respondents living in the Northeast or in rural areas, in nonstudents versus students, and in daily versus nondaily smokers. Residence in a state with legalized medical marijuana was unrelated to co-use or even the prevalence of marijuana use in this sample. Age and household income also were unrelated to co-use of tobacco and marijuana.These results indicate a higher prevalence of marijuana use and co-use of tobacco in young adult smokers than is reported in nationally representative surveys. Cessation treatments for young adult smokers should consider broadening intervention targets to include marijuana.",

The aims of the meeting were to synthesize recent evidence about screening and brief intervention and to set directions for research, practice, and policy in light of this evidence. Screening and brief intervention is efficacious in reducing self-reported alcohol consumption for some with unhealthy alcohol use, but there are gaps in evidence for its effectiveness. Because screening and brief intervention is not known to be efficacious for individuals with more severe unhealthy alcohol use, recent data showing the lack of evidence for referral to treatment as part of screening and brief intervention are alarming. While screening and brief intervention was designed to be a population-based approach, its reach is limited. Implementation in real world care also remains a challenge. This report summarizes practice, research, and policy recommendations and key research developments from our meeting. In order to move the field forward, a research agenda was proposed to (1) address evidence gaps in screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment, (2) develop innovations to address severe unhealthy alcohol use within primary care, (3) describe the stigma of unhealthy alcohol use, which obstructs progress in prevention and treatment, (4) reconsider existing conceptualizations of unhealthy alcohol use that may influence health care, and (5) identify efforts needed to improve the capacity for addressing unhealthy alcohol consumption in all world regions.",

    "abstract": "Buprenorphine effectively reduces opioid craving and illicit opioid use. However, some patients may not take their medication as prescribed and thus experience suboptimal outcomes. The study aim was to qualitatively explore buprenorphine adherence and the acceptability of utilizing video directly observed therapy (VDOT) among patients and their providers in an office-based program. Clinical providers (physicians and staff; n = 9) as well as patients (n = 11) were recruited from an office-based opioid treatment program at an urban academic medical center in the northwestern United States. Using a semi-structured guide, interviewers conducted individual interviews and focus group discussions. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were independently coded to identify key themes related to non-adherence and then jointly reviewed in an iterative fashion to develop a set of content codes. Among providers and patients, perceived reasons for buprenorphine non-adherence generally fell into several thematic categories: social and structural factors that prevented patients from consistently accessing medications or taking them reliably (e.g., homelessness, transportation difficulties, chaotic lifestyles, and mental illness); refraining from taking medication in order to use illicit drugs or divert; and forgetting to take medication, especially in the setting of taking split-doses. Some participants perceived non-adherence to be less of a problem for buprenorphine than for other medications. VDOT was viewed as potentially enhancing patient accountability, leading to more trust from providers who are concerned about diversion. On the other hand, some participants expressed concern that VDOT would place undue burden on patients, which could have the opposite effect of eroding patient-provider trust. Others questioned the clinical indication. Findings suggest potential arenas for enhancing buprenorphine adherence, although structural barriers will likely be most challenging to ameliorate. Providers as well as patients indicated mixed attitudes toward VDOT, suggesting it would need to be thoughtfully implemented.",

Using data from a 20 month post-implementation period, intervention sites (n = 37) were compared to their own 16 month pre-implementation performance and separately to the rest of VHA.From immediately pre-intervention to the end of the observation period, the percent of patients in the intervention sites with AUD who received medication increased over 3.4 % in absolute terms and 68 % in relative terms (i.e., 4.9-8.3 %). This change was significant compared to the pre-implementation period in the intervention sites and secular trends in control sites. Sites with lower pre-implementation adoption, more person hours of detailing, but fewer people detailed, had larger immediate increases in medication receipt after implementation. The average number of detailing encounters per person was associated with steeper increases in slope over time.This study found empirical support for a multifaceted quality improvement strategy aimed at increasing access to and utilization of pharmacotherapy for AUD. Future studies should focus on determining how to enhance the programs effects, especially in non-responsive locations.",

    "abstract": "More than 80% of people in jail or prison report having used illicit substances in their lifetimes. After release from incarceration, resumption of substance use carries risks, including parole revocation, exacerbation of mental health conditions, transmission of infectious diseases, and drug overdose. This cross-sectional study used baseline data from the Transitions Clinic Network (TCN, www.transitionsclinic.org ), a multi-site prospective longitudinal cohort study of post-incarceration medical care. We investigated substance use among adults, with at least one chronic health condition or age ≥ 50 years, who had been recently released from incarceration and initiated care at a TCN site. Our primary outcome was any self-reported illicit substance use (heroin or other opioids, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, hallucinogens, MDMA, or illicit use of prescription medications) following release from incarceration. Alcohol use post-release was a secondary outcome. Using multivariable logistic regression, we also explored factors associated with illicit substance use. Among 751 participants, median age was 47; participants were mostly male (85%), non-white (47% black, 30% Hispanic), and on parole (80%). The proportion of participants reporting any illicit substance use and any alcohol use soon after release from incarceration was 18% and 23%, respectively. In multivariable regression, variables significantly associated with post-release illicit substance use were male gender (aOR = 3.91, 95% CI: 1.73–8.81), housing with friends or family (aOR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.20–9.28), years incarcerated during latest prison term (aOR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89–0.98), weeks elapsed before engagement with TCN (aOR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03–1.10), being on parole (aOR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.34–0.99), and having a drug use disorder (aOR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.40–3.68). Among individuals seeking medical care after release from incarceration, self-reported substance use was lower than previously reported estimates of post-incarceration substance use. Known risk factors, such as male gender and having a drug use disorder, were associated with illicit substance use, as were novel risk factors, such as less supervised housing. Though illicit substance use post-incarceration can carry severe consequences, treatment and surveillance interventions should be targeted toward individuals with greatest risk.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Few studies have documented patient attitudes and experiences with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) opioid relapse prevention in criminal justice settings. This study assessed barriers and facilitators of jail-to-community reentry among adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) treated with XR-NTX, buprenorphine, methadone, and no medications. Methods This qualitative study conducted individual interviews with a purposeful and convenience sample of adults with OUD who were recently released from NYC jails. XR-NTX, no medication, and methadone participants were concurrently enrolled in a large randomized controlled trial evaluating XR-NTX vs. a no medication Enhanced Treatment As Usual (ETAU) condition, or enrolled in a non-randomized quasi-experimental methadone maintenance cohort. Buprenorphine participants were referred from NYC jails to a public hospital office-based buprenorphine program and not enrolled in the parent trial. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, independently coded by two researchers, and analyzed per a grounded theory approach adapted to the Social Cognitive Theory framework. The research team reviewed transcripts and coding to reach consensus on emergent themes. Results N = 33 adults with OUD (28 male, 5 female) completed a single individual interview. Purposeful sampling recruited persons leaving jail on XR-NTX (n = 11), no active medication treatment (n = 9), methadone (n = 9), and buprenorphine (n = 4). Emergent themes were: (1) general satisfaction with XR-NTX’s long-acting antagonist effects and control of cravings; (2) “testing” XR-NTX’s blockade with heroin upon reentry was common; (3) early discontinuation of XR-NTX treatment was most common among persons with high self-efficacy and/or heavy exposure to drug use environments and peers; (4) similar satisfaction regarding effects of methadone and buprenorphine maintenance among retained-in-treatment individuals, alongside general dissatisfaction with daily observed dosing requirements and misinformation and stigmas regarding methadone adverse effects; (5) unstable housing, economic insecurity, and exposure to actively using peers were attributed to early termination of treatment and relapse; (6) individual motivation and willpower as central to long-term opioid abstinence and reentry success. Conclusions In the context of more familiar agonist maintenance treatments, XR-NTX relapse prevention during jail-to-community reentry was viewed as a helpful and unique intervention though with important limitations. Commonly described barriers to treatment retention and heroin abstinence included homelessness, economic insecurity, and drug-using peers.

    "abstract": "Most people with opioid use disorder (OUD) never receive treatment. Medication treatment of OUD in primary care is recommended as an approach to increase access to care. The PRimary Care Opioid Use Disorders treatment (PROUD) trial tests whether implementation of a collaborative care model (Massachusetts Model) using a nurse care manager (NCM) to support medication treatment of OUD in primary care increases OUD treatment and improves outcomes. Specifically, it tests whether implementation of collaborative care, compared to usual primary care, increases the number of days of medication for OUD (implementation objective) and reduces acute health care utilization (effectiveness objective). The protocol for the PROUD trial is presented here.PROUD is a hybrid type III cluster-randomized implementation trial in six health care systems. The intervention consists of three implementation strategies: salary for a full-time NCM, training and technical assistance for the NCM, and requiring that three primary care providers have DEA waivers to prescribe buprenorphine. Within each health system, two primary care clinics are randomized: one to the intervention and one to Usual Primary Care. The sample includes all patients age 16-90 who visited the randomized primary care clinics from 3 years before to 2 years after randomization (anticipated to be > 170,000). Quantitative data are derived from existing health system administrative data, electronic medical records, and/or health insurance claims (\"electronic health records,\" [EHRs]). Anonymous staff surveys, stakeholder debriefs, and observations from site visits, trainings and technical assistance provide qualitative data to assess barriers and facilitators to implementation. The outcome for the implementation objective (primary outcome) is a clinic-level measure of the number of patient days of medication treatment of OUD over the 2 years post-randomization. The patient-level outcome for the effectiveness objective (secondary outcome) is days of acute care utilization [e.g. urgent care, emergency department (ED) and/or hospitalizations] over 2 years post-randomization among patients with documented OUD prior to randomization.The PROUD trial provides information for clinical leaders and policy makers regarding potential benefits for patients and health systems of a collaborative care model for management of OUD in primary care, tested in real-world diverse primary care settings.

    "abstract": "Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unparalleled societal disruption with wide ranging effects on individual liberties, the economy, and physical and mental health. While no social strata or population has been spared, the pandemic has posed unique and poorly characterized challenges for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Given the pandemic’s broad effects, it is helpful to organize the risks posed to specific populations using theoretical models. These models can guide scientific inquiry, interventions, and public policy. Models also provide a visual image of the interplay of individual-, network-, community-, structural-, and pandemic-level factors that can lead to increased risks of infection and associated morbidity and mortality for individuals and populations. Such models are not unidirectional, in that actions of individuals, networks, communities and structural changes can also affect overall disease incidence and prevalence. In this commentary, we describe how the social ecological model (SEM) may be applied to describe the theoretical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). This model can provide a necessary framework to systematically guide time-sensitive research and implementation of individual-, community-, and policy-level interventions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with OUD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In the United States, methadone for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly regulated. Federal agencies announced guidelines in March 2020 allowing for relaxation of take-home methadone dispensing at opioid treatment programs (OTPs) to improve treatment access and reduce COVID-19 transmission risk during the public health emergency. We explored patient perspectives at three OTPs serving rural communities on how take-home policy changes were received and implemented and how these changes impacted their addiction treatment and recovery. Methods We completed semi-structured individual qualitative interviews in 2 phases: (1) August–October 2020 and (2) November 2020–January 2021 (total n = 46), anticipating possible policy changes as the pandemic progressed. We interviewed patients with OUD enrolled at 3 rural OTPs in Oregon. Participants received varying take-home methadone allowances following the COVID-19-related policy changes. All interviews were conducted via phone, audio-recorded, and transcribed. We conducted a thematic analysis, iteratively coding transcripts, and deductively and inductively generating codes. Results The 46 participants included 50% women and 89% had Medicaid insurance. Three main themes emerged in the analysis, with no differences between study phases: (1) Adapting to changing OTP policies throughout the pandemic; (2) Recognizing the benefits, and occasional struggles, with increased take-home methadone dosing; and (3) Continuing policies and procedures post-pandemic. Participants described fears and anxieties around ongoing methadone access and safety concerns prior to OTP policy changes, but quickly adapted as protocols soon seemed “natural.” The majority of participants acknowledged significant benefits to increased take-homes independent of reducing COVID-19 infection risk including feeling “ more like a normal person,” improved recovery support, reduced time traveling, and having more time with family and for work. Looking to a post-pandemic future, participants thought some COVID-19-related safety protocols should continue that would reduce risk of other infections, make OTP settings less stressful, and result in more individualized care. Conclusions As the pandemic progressed, study participants adapted to rapidly changing OTP policies. Participants noted many unanticipated benefits to increased take-home methadone and other COVID-19 protocols including strengthened self-efficacy and recovery and reduced interpersonal conflict, with limited evidence of diversion. Patient perspectives should inform future policies to better address the ongoing overdose epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background South Africa has the highest number of people with HIV (PWH) globally and a significant burden of co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD). Health care worker (HCW) stigma towards SUD is a key barrier to HIV care engagement among PWH with SUD. Support from peers—individuals with lived experience of SUD—may be a promising solution for addressing SUD stigma, while also improving engagement in HIV care. We evaluated the perceived acceptability of integrating a peer role into community-based HIV care teams as a strategy to address SUD stigma at multiple levels and improve patient engagement in HIV care. Methods Patients and stakeholders ( N = 40) were recruited from publicly-funded HIV and SUD organizations in Cape Town, South Africa. We conducted a quantitative assessment of stigma among stakeholders using an adapted Social Distance Scale (SDS) and patient perceptions of working with a peer, as well as semi-structured interviews focused on experiences of SUD stigma, acceptability of a peer model integrated into community-based HIV care, and potential peer roles. Results On the SDS, 75% of stakeholders had high stigma towards a patient with SUD, yet 90% had low stigma when in recovery for at least 2 years. All patients endorsed feeling comfortable talking to someone in recovery and wanting them on their HIV care team. Three main themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) patient-reported experiences of enacted SUD and HIV stigmas were common and impacted HIV care engagement; (2) both patients and stakeholders considered a peer model highly acceptable for integration into HIV care to support engagement and address SUD stigma; and (3) patients and stakeholders identified both individual-level and systems-level roles for peers, how peers could work alongside other providers to improve patient care, and key characteristics that peers would need to be successful in these roles. Conclusions Findings from this formative work point to the promise of a peer model for reducing SUD stigma among patients and HCWs within community-based HIV care teams in SA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Extended-release buprenorphine (XRB) offers a novel approach to sustained monthly treatment for people who use opioids in criminal justice settings (CJS). This study explores the experiences of adults receiving XRB as a jail-to-community treatment. Methods and findings In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted among adult participants with opioid use disorder (OUD; n = 16) who were recently released from NYC jails and maintained on XRB after switching from daily sublingual buprenorphine (SLB). Interviews elaborated on the acceptability and barriers and facilitators of XRB treatment pre- and post-release. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for content related to factors influencing XRB treatment uptake and community reentry. Important themes were grouped into systems, medication, and patient-level factors. Key systems-level factors influencing initiation of XRB in jail included an alternative to perceived stigmatization and privacy concerns associated with daily in-jail SLB administration and less concerns with buprenorphine diversion. In-jail peer networks positively influenced participant adoption of XRB. XRB satisfaction was attributed to reduced in-jail clinic and medication administration visits, perceived efficacy and blockade effects upon the use of heroin/fentanyl following release, and averting the risk of criminal activities to fund opioid use. Barriers to retention included post-injection withdrawal symptoms and cravings attributed to perceived suboptimal medication dosing, injection site pain, and lack of in-jail provider information about the medication. Conclusion Participants were generally favorable to XRB initiation in jail and retention post-release. Further studies are needed to address factors influencing access to XRB in criminal justice settings, including stigma, ensuring patient privacy following initiation on XRB, and patient-, provider-, and correctional staff education pertaining to XRB.

Our objective was to understand hospital-based clinicians’ knowledge, comfort, attitudes, and motivations regarding MOUD initiation to target quality improvement initiatives. Methods General medicine attending physicians and physician assistants at an academic medical center completed questionnaires eliciting barriers to MOUD initiation, including knowledge, comfort, attitudes and motivations regarding MOUD. We explored whether clinicians who had initiated MOUD in the prior 12 months differed in knowledge, comfort, attitudes, and motivations from those who had not. Results One-hundred forty-three clinicians completed the survey with 55% reporting having initiated MOUD for a hospitalized patient during the prior 12 months. Common barriers to MOUD initiation were: (1) Not enough experience (86%); (2) Not enough training (82%); (3) Need for more addiction specialist support (76%). Overall, knowledge of and comfort with MOUD was low, but motivation to address OUD was high. Compared to MOUD non-initiators, a greater proportion of MOUD initiators answered knowledge questions correctly, agreed or strongly agreed that they wanted to treat OUD (86% vs. 68%, p = 0.009), and agreed or strongly agreed that treatment of OUD with medication was more effective than without medication (90% vs. 75%, p = 0.022). Conclusions Hospital-based clinicians had favorable attitudes toward MOUD and are motivated to initiate MOUD, but they lacked knowledge of and comfort with MOUD initiation. To increase MOUD initiation for hospitalized patients, clinicians will need additional training and specialist support.",

Improving alcohol health literacy presents an integrated approach to alcohol prevention and an important complement to alcohol policy. Our aim was to identify and prioritize measures to enhance alcohol health literacy and hence to reduce alcohol consumption, using Germany as an example. Methods A series of recommendations for improving alcohol health literacy were derived from a review of the literature and subsequently rated by five experts. Recommendations were rated according to their likely impact on enhancing (a) alcohol health literacy and (b) reducing alcohol consumption. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using a two-way intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Eleven recommendations were established for three areas of action: (1) education and information, (2) health care system, and (3) alcohol control policy. Education and information measures were rated high to increase alcohol health literacy but low to their impact on alcohol consumption, while this pattern was reversed for alcohol control policies. The ratings showed good agreement (ICC: 0.85–0.88). Conclusions Improving alcohol health literacy and reducing alcohol consumption should be considered complementary and become part of a comprehensive alcohol strategy to curb the health, social, and economic burden of alcohol.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Potential differences in buprenorphine treatment outcomes across various treatment settings are poorly characterized in multi-state administrative data. We thus evaluated the association of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment setting and insurance type with risk of buprenorphine discontinuation among commercial insurance and Medicaid enrollees initiated on buprenorphine. Methods In this observational, retrospective cohort study using the Merative MarketScan databases (2006–2016), we analyzed buprenorphine retention in 58,200 US adults with OUD. Predictor variables included insurance status (Medicaid vs commercial) and treatment setting, operationalized as substance use disorder (SUD) specialty treatment facility versus outpatient primary care physicians (PCPs) versus outpatient psychiatry, ascertained by linking physician visit codes to buprenorphine prescriptions. Treatment setting was inferred based on timing of prescriber visit claims preceding prescription fills. We estimated time to buprenorphine discontinuation using multivariable cox regression. Results Among enrollees with OUD receiving buprenorphine, 26,168 (45.0%) had prescriptions from SUD facilities without outpatient buprenorphine treatment, with the remaining treated by outpatient PCPs (n = 23,899, 41.1%) and psychiatrists (n = 8133, 13.9%). Overall, 50.6% and 73.3% discontinued treatment at 180 and 365 days respectively. Buprenorphine discontinuation was higher among enrollees receiving prescriptions from SUD facilities (aHR = 1.03[1.01–1.06]) and PCPs (aHR = 1.07[1.05–1.10]). Medicaid enrollees had lower buprenorphine retention than those with commercial insurance, particularly those receiving buprenorphine from SUD facilities and PCPs (aHR = 1.24[1.20–1.29] and aHR = 1.39[1.34–1.45] respectively, relative to comparator group of commercial insurance enrollees receiving buprenorphine from outpatient psychiatry). Conclusion Buprenorphine discontinuation is high across outpatient PCP, psychiatry, and SUD treatment facility settings, with potentially lower treatment retention among Medicaid enrollees receiving care from SUD facilities and PCPs.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize the nature and extent of drug use among first-time jail arrestees to inform detection and treatment. This study utilized a naturalistic research design to collect de-identified urine drug screens (UDS), jail characteristics, and arrestee demographic variables among arrestees indicating drug use from 25 jails across the United States in 2023 through a confidential data sharing agreement with NaphCare, Inc. using its proprietary electronic health record operating system. Descriptive statistics were used to detail the features of the dataset, Pearson's chi-square tests of independence were performed to statistically analyze associations between UDS results and jail characteristics and arrestee demographics, and significant chi-square test results were further investigated by examining standardized residuals to clarify the nature and significance of within-group differences in proportions. Of the 43,553 UDS cases comprising the final sample (28.8% of total arrestees), 74.8% (32,561) were positive for one or more drugs, and 25.2% of UDS cases were negative for all drugs. Among those who tested positive, 69.0% were positive for cannabis, 54.8% for stimulants, 29.6% for opioids, and 12.4% for sedatives. Arrestees were positive for multiple drugs half the time, with combinations of cannabis, stimulants, and opioids most common. Significant associations between drug use and both jail characteristics and arrestee demographics were found. Though drug use is not a recent phenomenon, the lethality potential of the drugs being used today is relatively new. Arrestees with positive urine drug screens are at heightened risk of adverse outcome due to sudden cessation of substance use. Findings highlight the need for objective clinical data to guide acute treatment of individuals at risk of withdrawing while detained.",

We describe a 44-year-old woman with a history of cocaine use who presented with a complaint of a painful rash of 2-3 month's duration on her extremities, cheeks, nose, and earlobes. She had not experienced fever, weight loss, alopecia, dry eyes, oral ulcers, photosensitivity, or arthralgia. Examination revealed tender purpuric eruptions with central necrosis on her nose, cheeks, earlobes, and extremities. Laboratory investigations revealed neutropenia, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), presence of lupus anticoagulant, low complement component 3 (C3), and presence of perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). A urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was positive for levamisole. Skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis and small vessel thrombosis. Necrotic lesions of the nose led to its self-amputation. Large bullae on the lower extremities ruptured, leading to wound infection and extensive necrosis that required multiple surgical debridements. When necrosis progressed despite debridement, bilateral above-knee amputation of the legs was performed. Once new lesions stopped appearing, the patient was discharged home. Two months later, she had a recurrence related to cocaine use. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of levamisole-induced vasculitis that required above-knee amputation.",

Pellagra (niacin deficiency) can be a cause of delirium during alcohol withdrawal that may often be overlooked. We present a three-patient case series of pellagrous encephalopathy (delirium due to pellagra) presenting as AWD. We provide a brief review of pellagra’s history, data on pellagra’s epidemiology, and discuss pellagra’s various manifestations, particularly as related to alcohol withdrawal. We conclude by providing a review of existing guidelines on the management of alcohol withdrawal, highlighting that they do not include pellagrous encephalopathy in the differential diagnosis for AWD. Though pellagra has been historically described as the triad of dementia, dermatitis, and diarrhea, it seldom presents with all three findings. The neurocognitive disturbance associated with pellagra is better characterized by delirium rather than dementia, and pellagra may present as an isolated delirium without any other aspects of the triad. Although endemic pellagra is virtually eradicated in Western countries, it continues to present as pellagrous encephalopathy in patients with risk factors for malnutrition such as chronic alcohol intake, homelessness, or AIDS. It may often be mistaken for AWD. Whenever pellagra is suspected, treatment with oral nicotinamide (100 mg three times daily for 3–4 weeks) prior to laboratory confirmation is recommended as an inexpensive, safe, and potentially life-saving intervention.",

    "abstract": "The US Public Health Service smoking cessation practice guideline specifically recommends that physicians and nurses strongly advise their patients who use tobacco to quit, but the best approach for attaining this goal in the emergency department (ED) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize emergency physicians' (EPs) and nurses' (ENs) perceptions of cessation counseling and to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the 5 A's framework (Ask-Advise-Assess-Assist-Arrange) in the ED.We conducted semi-structured, face-to-face interviews of 11 EPs and 19 ENs following a pre-post implementation trial of smoking cessation guidelines in two study EDs. We used purposeful sampling to target EPs and ENs with different attitudes toward cessation counseling, based on their responses to a written survey (Decisional Balance Questionnaire). Conventional content analysis was used to inductively characterize the issues raised by study participants and to construct a coding structure, which was then applied to study transcripts.The main findings of this study converged upon three overarching domains: 1) reactions to the intervention; 2) perceptions of patients' receptivity to cessation counseling; and 3) perspectives on ED cessation counseling and preventive care. ED staff expressed ambivalence toward the implementation of smoking cessation guidelines. Both ENs and EPs agreed that the delivery of smoking cessation counseling is important, but that it is not always practical in the ED on account of time constraints, the competing demands of acute care, and resistance from patients. Participants also called attention to the need for improved role clarity and teamwork when implementing the 5 A's in the ED.There are numerous challenges to the implementation of smoking cessation guidelines in the ED. ENs are generally willing to take the lead in offering brief cessation counseling, but their efforts need to be reinforced by EPs. ED systems need to address workflow, teamwork, and practice policies that facilitate prescription of smoking cessation medication, referral for cessation counseling, and follow-up in primary care. The results of this qualitative evaluation can be used to guide the design of future ED intervention studies.ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT00756704.",

    "abstract": "Effective counseling and pharmacotherapy for unhealthy alcohol use are rarely provided in HIV treatment settings to patients. Our goal was to describe factors influencing implementation of a stepped care model to address unhealthy alcohol use in HIV clinics from the perspectives of social workers, psychologists and addiction psychiatrists. We conducted two focus groups with Social Workers (n = 4), Psychologists (n = 2), and Addiction Psychiatrists (n = 4) involved in an ongoing randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of integrated stepped care for unhealthy alcohol use in HIV-infected patients at five Veterans Health Administration (VA) HIV clinics. Data collection and analyses were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) domains, with a focus on the three domains which we considered to be most relevant: intervention characteristics (i.e. motivational interviewing, pharmacotherapy), the inner setting (i.e. HIV clinics), and characteristics of individuals (i.e. the providers). A multidisciplinary team used directed content analysis to identify major themes. From the providers' perspective, the major implementation themes that emerged by CFIR domain included: (1) Intervention characteristics: providers valued tools and processes for facilitating patient motivation for treatment of unhealthy alcohol use given their perceived lack of motivation, but expressed a desire for greater flexibility; (2) Inner setting: treating unhealthy alcohol use in HIV clinics was perceived by providers to be consistent with VA priorities; and (3) Characteristics of individuals: there was high self-efficacy to conduct the intervention, an expressed need for more consistent utilization to maintain skills, and consideration of alternative models for delivering the components of the intervention. Use of the CFIR framework reveals that implementation of integrated stepped care for unhealthy alcohol use in HIV clinics is facilitated by tools to help providers enhance patient motivation or address unhealthy alcohol use among patients perceived to be unmotivated. Implementation may be facilitated by its consistency with organizational values and existing models of care and attention to optimizing provider self-efficacy and roles (i.e. approaches to treatment integration).",

    "abstract": "In the US, emergency room visits and overdoses related to prescription opioids have soared and the rates of illicit opioid use, including heroin and fentanyl, are increasing. Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, higher HIV and HCV infection rates, and criminal behavior. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT; methadone and buprenorphine) is proven to be effective in treating OUD and decreasing its negative consequences. While the efficacy of OAT has been established, too few providers prescribe OAT to patients with OUD due to patient, provider, or system factors. While the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has made great strides in OAT implementation, national treatment rates remain low (35% of patients with OUD) and several facilities continue to have much lower prescribing rates. Eight VA sites with low baseline prescribing rates (lowest quartile, < 21%) were randomly selected from the 35 low prescribing sites to receive an intensive external facilitation implementation intervention to increase OAT prescribing rates. The intervention includes a site-specific developmental evaluation, a kick-off site visit, and 12 months of ongoing facilitation. The developmental evaluation includes qualitative interviews with patients, substance use disorders clinic staff, and primary care and general mental health leadership to assess site-level barriers. The site visit includes: (1) a review of site-specific barriers and potential implementation strategies; (2) instruction on using available dashboards to track prescribing rates and identify actionable patients; and (3) education on OAT, including, if requested, buprenorphine certification training for prescribers. On-going facilitation consists of monthly conference calls with individual site teams and expert clinical consultation. The primary outcomes is the proportion of Veterans with OUD initiating and sustaining OAT, with intervention sites expected to have larger increases in prescribing compared to control sites. Final qualitative interviews and a cost assessment will inform future implementation efforts. This project will examine and respond to barriers encountered in low prescribing VHA clinics allowing refinement of an intervention to enhance access to medication treatment for OUD in additional facilities.",

The Check Your Drinking Screener (CYD; see www.CheckYourDrinking.net ) is one such intervention. The current treatment dismantling study assessed which components of personalized feedback interventions were effective in motivating change in drinking. Specifically, the major objective of this project was to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the impact of the normative feedback and other personalized feedback components of the CYD intervention in the general population. Participants were recruited to take part in an RCT and received either the complete CYD final report, just the normative feedback sections of the CYD, just the personalized feedback components of the CYD, or were assigned to a no-intervention control group. Participants were followed-up at 3 months to assess changes in alcohol consumption. A total of 741 hazardous drinking participants were recruited for the trial, of which 73 percent provided follow-up data. Analyses using an intent-to-treat approach found some evidence for the impact of the personalized feedback components of the CYD in reducing alcohol consumption on the variables, number of drinks in a week and AUDIT-C (p = .028 and .047 respectively; no impact on highest number of drinks on one occasion; p = .594). However, there was no significant evidence of the impact of the normative feedback components (all p > .3). Personalized feedback elements alone could provide an active intervention for hazardous drinkers, particularly in situations where normative feedback information was not available.

This study aims to determine the association between age of onset of opioid use and comorbid disorders, both physical and psychiatric, in patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for OUD. Understanding this association may inform clinical practice about important prognostic factors of patients on MMT, enabling clinicians to identify high-risk patients.This study includes data collected between June 2011 and August 2016 for the Genetics of Opioid Addiction research collaborative between McMaster University and the Canadian Addiction Treatment Centers. All patients were interviewed by trained health professionals using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and case report forms. Physical comorbidities were verified using patients' electronic medical records. A multi-variable logistic regression model was constructed to determine the strength of the association between age of onset of opioid use and the presence of physical or psychiatric comorbidity while adjusting for current age, sex, body mass index, methadone dose and smoking status.Data from 627 MMT patients with a mean age of 38.8 years (SD = 11.07) were analyzed. Individuals with an age of onset of opioid use younger than 18 years were found to be at higher odds for having a physical or psychiatric comorbid disorder compared to individuals with an age of onset of opioid use of 31 years or older (odds ratio 2.94, 95% confidence interval 1.20, 7.19, p = 0.02). A significant association was not found between the risk of having a comorbidity and an age of onset of opioid use between 18 and 25 years or 26 and 30 years, compared to an age of onset of opioid use of 31 years or older.Our study demonstrates that the younger one begins to use opioids, the greater their chance of having a physical or psychiatric co-morbidity. Understanding the risk posed by an earlier onset of opioid use for the later development of comorbid disorders informs clinical practice about important prognostic predictors and aids in the identification of high-risk patients.",

Case presentation We aimed to use a microdosing regimen to initiate regular dosing of buprenorphine/naloxone in a high-risk patient with a history of failed initiations due, in part, to withdrawal symptoms. Using an assertive outreach model and a buprenorphine/naloxone microdosing schedule, we initiated treatment of an individual’s opioid use disorder. There was a successful buprenorphine/naloxone microdosing induction as the team reached a therapeutic dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. Including the induction period, the medication was used consistently for 4 weeks. Conclusions A microdosing schedule can be used to induce a patient onto buprenorphine/naloxone with no apparent withdrawal; gradually reducing illicit substance use. This case report builds on previous literature, highlighting ways to minimize barriers to induction of buprenorphine/naloxone, using a microdosing schedule and assertive outreach. Given the safety profile of buprenorphine and its potential to be a lifesaving intervention, a larger study of microdosing is indicated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly effective, yet it remains dramatically underutilized. Individuals with OUD have disproportionately high rates of hospitalization and low rates of addiction treatment. Hospital-based addiction consult services offer a potential solution by using multidisciplinary teams to evaluate patients, initiate medication for addiction treatment (MAT) in the hospital, and connect patients to post-discharge care. We are studying the effectiveness of an addiction consult model [Consult for Addiction Treatment and Care in Hospitals (CATCH)] as a strategy for engaging patients with OUD in treatment as the program rolls out in the largest municipal hospital system in the US. The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of CATCH in increasing post-discharge initiation and engagement in MAT. Secondary aims are to assess treatment retention, frequency of acute care utilization and overdose deaths and their associated costs, and implementation outcomes. Methods A pragmatic trial at six hospitals, conducted in collaboration with the municipal hospital system and department of health, will be implemented to study the CATCH intervention. Guided by the RE-AIM evaluation framework, this hybrid effectiveness-implementation study (Type 1) focuses primarily on effectiveness and also measures implementation outcomes to inform the intervention’s adoption and sustainability. A stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design will determine the impact of CATCH on treatment outcomes in comparison to usual care for a control period, followed by a 12-month intervention period and a 6- to 18-month maintenance period at each hospital. A mixed methods approach will primarily utilize administrative data to measure outcomes, while interviews and focus groups with staff and patients will provide additional information on implementation fidelity and barriers to delivering MAT to patients with OUD. Discussion Because of their great potential to reduce the negative health and economic consequences of untreated OUD, addiction consult models are proliferating in response to the opioid epidemic, despite the absence of a strong evidence base. This study will provide the first known rigorous evaluation of an addiction consult model in a large multi-site trial and promises to generate knowledge that can rapidly transform practice and inform the potential for widespread dissemination of these services.

The standard induction method of buprenorphine/naloxone requires patients to be abstinent from opioids and therefore experience withdrawal symptoms prior to induction, which can be a barrier in starting treatment. Rapid micro-induction (micro-dosing) involves the administration of small, frequent does of buprenorphine/naloxone and removes the need for a period of withdrawal prior to the start of treatment. This study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of rapid micro-induction versus standard induction of buprenorphine/naloxone in patients with OUD.This is a randomized, open-label, two-arm, superiority, controlled trial comparing the safety and effectiveness of rapid micro-induction versus standard induction of buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of OUD. A total of 50 participants with OUD will be randomized at one Canadian hospital. The primary outcome is the completion of buprenorphine/naloxone induction with low levels of withdrawal. Secondary outcomes are treatment retention, illicit drug use, self-reported drug use behaviour, craving, pain, physical health, safety, and client satisfaction.This is the first randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of rapid micro-induction versus standard induction of buprenorphine/naloxone.

The identification of risk groups is essential for the establishment of preventive and therapeutic strategies, as for substance users. During COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the use of psychoactive substances during the lockdown, including cannabis. This commentary reviews relevant findings and discusses scientific evidence on the risks of worse clinical and psychiatric complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 in subjects who use cannabis. Although they are not included as a risk group in the health recommendations for that disease, they may have a more vulnerable respiratory system to viral diseases. There are certain similarities between the harmful cardiovascular and respiratory effects of cannabis use and those of smoking. Due to the different modes of smoking, cannabis chemicals are retained in the body for longe and may also contain other toxic substances such as tar, a substance found in tobacco and which has been associated with the development of lung cancer, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema. Therefore, we discuss if individuals who use cannabis regularly might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. This population deserves more clinical attention worldwide and this manuscript can help clinicians become more aware of cannabis risks during pandemics and develop specific intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Telemedicine (TM) enabled by digital health technologies to provide medical services has been considered a key solution to increasing health care access in rural communities. With the immediate need for remote care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care systems have rapidly incorporated digital technologies to support the delivery of remote care options, including medication treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). In responding to the opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials and scientific communities strongly support and advocate for greater use of TM-based medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to improve access to care and have suggested that broad use of TM during the pandemic should be sustained. Nevertheless, research on the implementation and effectiveness of TM-based MOUD has been limited. To address this knowledge gap, the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) funded (via the NIH HEAL Initiative) a study on Rural Expansion of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (Rural MOUD; CTN-0102) to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of adding TM-based MOUD to rural primary care for expanding access to MOUD. In preparation for this large-scale, randomized controlled trial incorporating TM in rural primary care, a feasibility study is being conducted to develop and pilot test implementation procedures. In this commentary, we share some of our experiences, which include several challenges, during the initial two-month period of the feasibility study phase. While these challenges could be due, at least in part, to adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic and new workflows to accommodate the study, they are notable and could have a substantial impact on the larger, planned pragmatic trial and on TM-based MOUD more broadly. Challenges include low rates of identification of risk for OUD from screening, low rates of referral to TM, digital device and internet access issues, workflow and capacity barriers, and insurance coverage. These challenges also highlight the lack of empirical guidance for best TM practice and quality remote care models. With TM expanding rapidly, understanding implementation and demonstrating what TM approaches are effective are critical for ensuring the best care for persons with OUD.",

We aim to systematically review the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine initiation that aims to omit prerequisite withdrawal. Methods We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE and CENTRAL from 1996 through April 10, 2020, augmented with searches in Google Scholar and www.clinicaltrials.gov . A study was included if it was in patients with substance use disorder or chronic pain that were taking a full mu opioid agonist and transitioning to buprenorphine without preceding withdrawal, and reported withdrawal during initiation as an outcome. Two investigators independently screened citations and articles for inclusion, collected data using a standardized data collection tool, and assessed study risk of bias. Results We included 15 case reports/series, reporting 24 unique cases, in our qualitative synthesis. No controlled studies were identified. Microdosing and bridging with a buprenorphine patch were the most common strategies reported. Transition to buprenorphine with complete cessation of opioid agonists was achieved in 87.5% (n = 21) of cases. Withdrawal during initiation occurred in 58.3% (n = 14) of cases, two of which were at least moderate in severity. Conclusion Buprenorphine initiation strategies that omit prerequisite withdrawal have emerged. Low quality evidence from case reports suggests withdrawal during initiation is common but most often mild in severity.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid misuse screening in hospitals is resource-intensive and rarely done. Many hospitalized patients are never offered opioid treatment. An automated approach leveraging routinely captured electronic health record (EHR) data may be easier for hospitals to institute. We previously derived and internally validated an opioid classifier in a separate hospital setting. The aim is to externally validate our previously published and open-source machine-learning classifier at a different hospital for identifying cases of opioid misuse. Methods An observational cohort of 56,227 adult hospitalizations was examined between October 2017 and December 2019 during a hospital-wide substance use screening program with manual screening. Manually completed Drug Abuse Screening Test served as the reference standard to validate a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier with coded word embedding features from the clinical notes of the EHR. The opioid classifier utilized all notes in the EHR and sensitivity analysis was also performed on the first 24 h of notes. Calibration was performed to account for the lower prevalence than in the original cohort. Results Manual screening for substance misuse was completed in 67.8% (n = 56,227) with 1.1% (n = 628) identified with opioid misuse. The data for external validation included 2,482,900 notes with 67,969 unique clinical concept features. The opioid classifier had an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.99–0.99) across the encounter and 0.98 (95% CI 0.98–0.99) using only the first 24 h of notes. In the calibrated classifier, the sensitivity and positive predictive value were 0.81 (95% CI 0.77–0.84) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.68–0.75). For the first 24 h, they were 0.75 (95% CI 0.71–0.78) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.57–0.64). Conclusions Our opioid misuse classifier had good discrimination during external validation. Our model may provide a comprehensive and automated approach to opioid misuse identification that augments current workflows and overcomes manual screening barriers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Morbidity and mortality related to opioid use disorder (OUD) in the U.S. is at an all-time high. Innovative approaches are needed to address gaps in retention in treatment with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Mobile health (mHealth) approaches have shown improvement in engagement in care and associated clinical outcomes for a variety of chronic diseases, but mHealth tools designed specifically to support patients treated with MOUD are limited. Methods Following user-centered development and testing phases, a multi-feature smartphone application called HOPE (Heal. Overcome. Persist. Endure) was piloted in a small cohort of patients receiving MOUD and at high risk of disengagement in care at an office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) clinic in Central Virginia. Outcomes were tracked over a six-month period following patient enrollment. They included retention in care at the OBOT clinic, usage of various features of the application, and self-rated measures of mental health, substance use, treatment and recovery. Results Of the 25 participants in the HOPE pilot study, a majority were retained in care at 6 months (56%). Uptake of bi-directional features including messaging with providers and daily check-ins of mood, stress and medication adherence peaked at one month, and usage persisted through the sixth month. Patients who reported that distance to clinic was a problem at baseline had higher loss to follow up compared to those without distance as a reported barrier (67% vs 23%, p = 0.03). Patients lost to in-person clinic follow up continued to engage with one or more app features, indicating that mHealth approaches may bridge barriers to clinic visit attendance. Participants surveyed at baseline and 6 months (N = 16) scored higher on scales related to overall self-control and self-efficacy related to drug abstinence. Conclusions A pilot study of a novel multi-feature smartphone application to support OUD treatment showed acceptable retention in care and patient usage at 6 months. Further study within a larger population is needed to characterize ‘real world’ uptake and association with outcomes related to retention in care, relapse prevention, and opioid-associated mortality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Until recently, few carceral facilities offered medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Although more facilities are adopting MOUD, much remains to be learned about addressing implementation challenges related to expansion of MOUD in carceral settings and linkage to care upon re-entry. This is particularly important in jails, where individuals cycle rapidly in and out of these facilities, especially in jurisdictions beginning to implement bail reform laws (i.e., laws that remove the requirement to pay bail for most individuals). Increasing access to MOUD in these settings is a key unexplored challenge. Methods In this qualitative study, we interviewed staff from county jails across New Jersey, a state that has implemented state-wide efforts to increase capacity for MOUD treatment in jails. We analyzed themes related to current practices used to engage individuals in MOUD while in jail and upon re-entry; major challenges to delivering MOUD and re-entry services, particularly under bail reform conditions; and innovative strategies to facilitate delivery of these services. Results Jail staff from 11 New Jersey county jails participated in a baseline survey and an in-depth qualitative interview from January–September 2020. Responses revealed that practices for delivering MOUD varied substantially across jails. Primary challenges included jails’ limited resources and highly regulated operations, the chaotic nature of short jail stays, and concerns regarding limited MOUD and resources in the community. Still, jail staff identified multiple facilitators and creative solutions for delivering MOUD in the face of these obstacles, including opportunities brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions Despite challenges to the delivery of MOUD, states can make concerted and sustained efforts to support opioid addiction treatment in jails. Increased use of evidence-based clinical guidelines, greater investment in resources, and increased partnerships with health and social service providers can greatly improve reach of treatment and save lives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the leading etiologies for liver cirrhosis and liver transplantation. Few individuals with AUD receive guideline-based care in the form of screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment, or prescription of pharmacotherapy for relapse prevention. We interviewed clinicians across Alberta to assess the current experience and perceived barriers to managing AUD in people who have cirrhosis. The aim of this paper is to summarize these findings to inform the development of an educational intervention. Methods We used a qualitative descriptive approach to explore the experiences of clinicians who care for patients with cirrhosis and AUD in Alberta. We conducted semi-structured interviews directed by an interview guide. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used an inductive thematic analysis approach whereby transcripts were coded, with codes grouped into larger categories, then themes. Results Sixteen clinicians participated in this study. Many participants acknowledged that they do not use a standardized approach to screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment. Through thematic analysis we identified four themes surrounding barriers to managing AUD in patients with cirrhosis: (i) Practicing within knowledge constraints, (ii) Navigating limited resources and system challenges, (iii) Balancing the complexity of cirrhosis and AUD, and (iv) Acknowledging the influence of provider perceptions on care. Conclusion This article presents the perspectives of clinicians who care for people who have AUD and cirrhosis. Significant barriers exist, including limited knowledge and resources, systemic challenges, and patient complexity. The information gathered will be used to develop an educational intervention that will delve deeper into these issues in order to have the greatest impact on clinicians who routinely interface with this patient population.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Co-use of stimulants and opioids is rapidly increasing. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have established the efficacy of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), but stimulant use may decrease the likelihood of initiating MOUD treatment. Furthermore, trial participants may not represent \"real-world\" populations who would benefit from treatment. METHODS: We conducted a two-stage analysis. First, associations between stimulant use (time-varying urine drug screens for cocaine, methamphetamine, or amphetamines) and initiation of buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) were estimated across two RCTs (CTN-0051 X:BOT and CTN-0067 CHOICES) using adjusted Cox regression models. Second, results were generalized to three target populations who would benefit from MOUD: Housed adults identifying the need for OUD treatment, as characterized by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH); adults entering OUD treatment, as characterized by Treatment Episodes Dataset (TEDS); and adults living in rural regions of the U.S. with high rates of injection drug use, as characterized by the Rural Opioids Initiative (ROI). Generalizability analyses adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics, substance use, housing status, and depression between RCT and target populations using inverse probability of selection weighting. RESULTS: Analyses included 673 clinical trial participants, 139 NSDUH respondents (weighted to represent 661,650 people), 71,751 TEDS treatment episodes, and 1,933 ROI participants. The majority were aged 30-49 years, male, and non-Hispanic White. In RCTs, stimulant use reduced the likelihood of MOUD initiation by 32% (adjusted HR [aHR] = 0.68, 95% CI 0.49-0.94, p = 0.019). Stimulant use associations were slightly attenuated and non-significant among housed adults needing treatment (25% reduction, aHR = 0.75, 0.48-1.18, p = 0.215) and adults entering OUD treatment (28% reduction, aHR = 0.72, 0.51-1.01, p = 0.061). The association was more pronounced, but still non-significant among rural people injecting drugs (39% reduction, aHR = 0.61, 0.35-1.06, p = 0.081). Stimulant use had a larger negative impact on XR-NTX initiation compared to buprenorphine, especially in the rural population (76% reduction, aHR = 0.24, 0.08-0.69, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Stimulant use is a barrier to buprenorphine or XR-NTX initiation in clinical trials and real-world populations that would benefit from OUD treatment. Interventions to address stimulant use among patients with OUD are urgently needed, especially among rural people injecting drugs, who already suffer from limited access to MOUD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hospitalizations involving opioid use disorder (OUD) are increasing. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) reduce mortality and acute care utilization. Hospitalization is a reachable moment for initiating MOUD and arranging for ongoing MOUD engagement following hospital discharge. Despite existing quality metrics for MOUD initiation and engagement, few hospitals provide hospital based opioid treatment (HBOT). This protocol describes a cluster-randomized hybrid type-2 implementation study comparing low-intensity and high-intensity implementation support strategies to help community hospitals implement HBOT. Methods Four state implementation hubs with expertise in initiating HBOT programs will provide implementation support to 24 community hospitals (6 hospitals/hub) interested in starting HBOT. Community hospitals will be randomized to 24-months of either a low-intensity intervention (distribution of an HBOT best-practice manual, a lecture series based on the manual, referral to publicly available resources, and on-demand technical assistance) or a high-intensity intervention (the low-intensity intervention plus funding for a hospital HBOT champion and regular practice facilitation sessions with an expert hub). The primary efficacy outcome, adapted from the National Committee on Quality Assurance, is the proportion of patients engaged in MOUD 34-days following hospital discharge. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include acute care utilization, non-fatal overdose, death, MOUD engagement at various time points, hospital length of stay, and discharges against medical advice. Primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes will be derived from state Medicaid data. Implementation outcomes, barriers, and facilitators are assessed via longitudinal surveys, qualitative interviews, practice facilitation contact logs, and HBOT sustainability metrics. We hypothesize that the proportion of patients receiving care at hospitals randomized to the high-intensity arm will have greater MOUD engagement following hospital discharge. Discussion Initiation of MOUD during hospitalization improves MOUD engagement post hospitalization. Few studies, however, have tested different implementation strategies on HBOT uptake, outcome, and sustainability and only one to date has tested implementation of a specific type of HBOT (addiction consultation services). This cluster-randomized study comparing different intensities of HBOT implementation support will inform hospitals and policymakers in identifying effective strategies for promoting HBOT dissemination and adoption in community hospitals.

    "abstract": "The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a 10-item alcohol screener that has been recommended for use in Aboriginal primary health care settings. The time it takes respondents to complete AUDIT, however, has proven to be a barrier to its routine delivery. Two shorter versions, AUDIT-C and AUDIT-3, have been used as screening instruments in primary health care. This paper aims to identify the AUDIT-C and AUDIT-3 cutoff scores that most closely identify individuals classified as being at-risk drinkers, high-risk drinkers, or likely alcohol dependent by the 10-item AUDIT. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted from June 2009 to May 2010 and from July 2010 to June 2011. Aboriginal Australian participants (N = 156) were recruited through an Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service, and a community-based drug and alcohol treatment agency in rural New South Wales (NSW), and through community-based Aboriginal groups in Sydney NSW. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of each score on the AUDIT-C and AUDIT-3 were calculated, relative to cutoff scores on the 10-item AUDIT for at-risk, high-risk, and likely dependent drinkers. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were conducted to measure the detection characteristics of AUDIT-C and AUDIT-3 for the three categories of risk. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves were high for drinkers classified as being at-risk, high-risk, and likely dependent. Recommended cutoff scores for Aboriginal Australians are as follows: at-risk drinkers AUDIT-C ≥ 5, AUDIT-3 ≥ 1; high-risk drinkers AUDIT-C ≥ 6, AUDIT-3 ≥ 2; and likely dependent drinkers AUDIT-C ≥ 9, AUDIT-3 ≥ 3. Adequate sensitivity and specificity were achieved for recommended cutoff scores. AUROC curves were above 0.90.",

    "abstract": "Interventions have been developed to reduce overestimations of substance use among others, especially for alcohol and among students. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge on misperceptions of use for substances other than alcohol. We studied the prevalence of misperceptions of use for tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol and whether the perception of tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol use by others is associated with one's own use. Participants (n = 5216) in a cohort study from a census of 20-year-old men (N = 11,819) estimated the prevalence of tobacco and cannabis use among peers of the same age and sex and the percentage of their peers drinking more alcohol than they did. Using the census data, we determined whether participants overestimated, accurately estimated, or underestimated substance use by others. Regression models were used to compare substance use by those who overestimated or underestimated peer substance with those who accurately estimated peer use. Other variables included in the analyses were the presence of close friends with alcohol or other drug problems and family history of substance use. Tobacco use by others was overestimated by 46.1% and accurately estimated by 37.3% of participants. Cannabis use by others was overestimated by 21.8% and accurately estimated by 31.6% of participants. Alcohol use by others was overestimated by more than half (53.4%) of participants and accurately estimated by 31.0%. In multivariable models, compared with participants who accurately estimated tobacco use by others, those who overestimated it reported smoking more cigarettes per week (incidence rate ratio [IRR] [95% CI], 1.17 [range, 1.05, 1.32]). There was no difference in the number of cigarettes smoked per week between those underestimating and those accurately estimating tobacco use by others (IRR [95% CI], 0.99 [range, 0.84, 1.17]). Compared with participants accurately estimating cannabis use by others, those who overestimated it reported more days of cannabis use per month (IRR [95% CI], 1.43 [range, 1.21, 1.70]), whereas those who underestimated it reported fewer days of cannabis use per month (IRR [95% CI], 0.62 [range, 0.23, 0.75]). Compared with participants accurately estimating alcohol use by others, those who overestimated it reported consuming more drinks per week (IRR [95% CI], 1.57 [range, 1.43, 1.72]), whereas those who underestimated it reported consuming fewer drinks per week (IRR [95% CI], 0.41 [range, 0.34, 0.50]). Perceptions of substance use by others are associated with one's own use. In particular, overestimating use by others is frequent among young men and is associated with one's own greater consumption. This association is independent of the substance use environment, indicating that, even in the case of proximity to a heavy-usage group, perception of use by others may influence one's own use. If preventive interventions are to be based on normative feedback, and their aim is to reduce overestimations of use by others, then the prevalence of overestimation indicates that they may be of benefit to roughly half the population; or, in the case of cannabis, to as few as 20%. Such interventions should take into account differing strengths of association across substances.",

Horse-assisted therapy (HAT) is increasingly used as a complementary therapy, with claimed motivational and other benefits to physical and psychological health. This naturalistic study aimed to assess HAT's impact on the duration and completion of treatment for young substance users at Oslo University Hospital.Discharge and other data were derived from the Youth Addiction Treatment Evaluation Project (YATEP) database for patients (n = 108) admitted during an 18-month period. An intention-to-treat design, and univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare those receiving treatment as usual (n = 43) with those who received treatment as usual plus HAT (n = 65).Despite a lack of randomization, the baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. However, more HAT participants completed treatment (56.9 vs 14 %, p < 0.001), remained in treatment for longer (mean 141 vs 70 days, p < 0.001) and had a significantly higher chance of completing their treatment than those not given the HAT program. Excluding time in treatment, and after controlling for the potentially confounding influence of age, sex, education, number and severity of substances used, psychological distress and number of temporary exits, the adjusted odds ratio for treatment completion was 8.4 in the HAT group compared with those not participating in HAT (95 % CI 2.7-26.4, p < 0.001).The study found a statistically significant association between HAT participation and time in treatment, and between HAT participation and completion of treatment. This association does not infer causality. However, it adds supporting evidence for the development of an innovative therapy, and warrants investment in further research in relation to its inclusion in substance use disorder treatment.",

Evidence supporting the off-label use of the antiepileptic medication topiramate to treat alcohol dependence may be as strong as these approved medications. However, little is known about the extent to which topiramate is used in clinical practice. The goal of this study was to describe and examine the overall use, facility-level variation in use, and patient -level predictors of topiramate prescription for patients with AUD in the VHA. Using national VHA administrative data in a retrospective cohort study, we examined time trends in topiramate use from fiscal years (FY) 2009–2012, and predictors of topiramate prescription in 375,777 patients identified with AUD (ICD-9-CM codes 303.9x or 305.0x) treated in 141 VHA facilities in FY 2011. Among VHA patients with AUD, rates of topiramate prescription have increased from 0.99% in FY 2009 to 1.95% in FY 2012, although substantial variation across facilities exists. Predictors of topiramate prescription were female sex, young age, alcohol dependence diagnoses, engagement in both mental health and addiction specialty care, and psychiatric comorbidity. Veterans Health Administration facilities are monitored regarding the extent to which patients with AUD are receiving FDA-approved pharmacotherapy. Not including topiramate in the metric, which is prescribed more often than acamprosate and disulfiram combined, may underestimate the extent to which VHA patients at specific facilities and overall are receiving pharmacotherapy for AUD.",

    "abstract": "Three recent sets of null findings from trials of alcohol brief intervention (BI) have been disappointing to those who wish to see a reduction in alcohol-related harm through the widespread dissemination of BI. Saitz (7) has suggested that these null findings result from a failure to translate the effects of BI seen in efficacy trials, which are thought to contribute mainly to the beneficial effects of BI shown in meta-analyses, to effectiveness trials conducted in real-world clinical practice. The present article aims to: (i) clarify the meaning of the terms “efficacy” and “effectiveness” and other related concepts; (ii) review the method and findings on efficacy-effectiveness measurement in the 2007 Cochrane Review by Kaner and colleagues; and (iii) make suggestions for further research in this area. Conclusions are: 1) to avoid further confusion, terms such as “efficacy trial”, “effectiveness trial”, “clinical representativeness”, etc. should be clearly defined and carefully used; 2) applications of BI to novel settings should begin with foundational research and developmental studies, followed by efficacy trials, and political pressures for quick results from premature effectiveness trials should be resisted; 3) clear criteria are available in the literature to guide progress from efficacy research, through effectiveness research, to dissemination in practice; 4) to properly interpret null findings from effectiveness studies, it is necessary to ensure that interventions are delivered as intended; 5) in future meta-analyses of alcohol BI trials, more attention should be paid to the development and application of a psychometrically robust scale to measure efficacy-effectiveness or clinical representativeness; 6) the null findings under consideration cannot be firmly attributed to a failure to translate effects from efficacy trials to real-world practice, because it is possible that the majority of trials included in meta-analyses on which the evidence for the beneficial effects of alcohol BI was based tended to be effectiveness rather than efficacy trials; and 7) a hypothesis to explain the null findings in question is that they are due to lack of fidelity in the implementation of BI in large, organizationally complex, cluster randomized trials.",

    "abstract": "Although screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) has shown promise for alcohol use, relatively little is known about its effectiveness for adult illicit drug use. This randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of the SBIRT approach for outcomes related to drug use among patients visiting trauma and emergency departments (EDs) at two large, urban hospitals. A total of 700 ED patients who admitted using illegal drugs in the past 30 days were recruited, consented, provided baseline measures of substance use and related problems measured with the Addiction Severity Index-Lite (ASI-Lite), and then randomized to the Life Shift SBIRT intervention or to an attention-placebo control group focusing on driving and traffic safety (Shift Gears). Both groups received a level of motivational intervention matched to their condition and risk level by trained paraprofessional health educators. Separate measurement technicians conducted face-to-face follow-ups at 6 months post-intervention and collected hair samples to confirm reports of abstinence from drug use. The primary outcome measure of the study was past 30-day drug abstinence at 6 months post-intervention, as self-reported on the ASI-Lite. Of 700 participants, 292 (42%) completed follow-up. There were no significant differences in self-reported abstinence (12.5% vs. 12.0% , p = 0.88) for Life Shift and Shift Gears groups, respectively. When results of hair analyses were applied, the abstinence rate was 7 percent for Life Shift and 2 percent for Shift Gears (p = .074). In an analysis in which results were imputed (n = 694), there was no significant difference in the ASI-Lite drug use composite scores (Life Shift +0.005 vs. Shift Gears +0.017, p = 0.12). In this randomized controlled trial, there was no evidence of effectiveness of SBIRT on the primary drug use outcome. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01683227 .",

    "abstract": "When used in general medical practices, buprenorphine is an effective treatment for opioid dependence, yet little is known about how use of buprenorphine affects the utilization and cost of health care in commercial health systems. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to examine how buprenorphine affects patterns of medical care, addiction medicine services, and costs from the health system perspective. Individuals with two or more opioid-dependence diagnoses per year, in two large health systems (System A: n = 1836; System B: n = 4204) over the time span 2007–2008 were included. Propensity scores were used to help adjust for group differences. Patients receiving buprenorphine plus addiction counseling had significantly lower total health care costs than patients with little or no addiction treatment (mean health care costs with buprenorphine treatment = $13,578; vs. mean health care costs with no addiction treatment = $31,055; p < .0001), while those receiving buprenorphine plus addiction counseling and those with addiction counseling only did not differ significantly in total health care costs (mean costs with counseling only: $17,017; p = .5897). In comparison to patients receiving buprenorphine plus counseling, those with little or no addiction treatment had significantly greater use of primary care (p < .001), other medical visits (p = .001), and emergency services (p = .020). Patients with counseling only (compared to patients with buprenorphine plus counseling) used less inpatient detoxification (p < .001), and had significantly more PC visits (p = .001), other medical visits (p = .005), and mental health visits (p = .002). Buprenorphine is a viable alternative to other treatment approaches for opioid dependence in commercial integrated health systems, with total costs of health care similar to abstinence-based counseling. Patients with buprenorphine plus counseling had reduced use of general medical services compared to the alternatives.",

    "abstract": "While buprenorphine/naloxone (B/N) is approved for opioid use disorder treatment, effective delivery of B/N comes with significant challenges. Most notably, many patients do not take medication daily as prescribed; this non-adherence worsens treatment outcomes, increases healthcare costs, and leads to persistent worries of diversion among providers and policymakers. The present study examines the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of MySafeRx—a mobile technology platform integrating motivational coaching, adherence monitoring, and electronic pill dispensing designed to address the challenges of office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) with B/N. The MySafeRx platform integrates electronic pill dispensers, text-messaging, and videoconferencing to provide supervised self-administration of medication and daily motivational coaching through an Android app interface. High-risk early adults (18–39 years old) who were enrolled in OBOT with B/N and had documented illicit opioid use in the past month during opioid agonist therapy (n = 12) participated in a 28-day single-arm observational study of the MySafeRx platform in addition to standard care. Two-thirds of participants who completed the study achieved an average of > 5 days per week of supervised B/N self-administration. Visual confirmation of medication adherence was demonstrated for an average of 72% of study days among all participants. All participants achieved platform technical proficiency within 60 min, reporting good levels of usability and acceptability. Illicit opioid abstinence rates confirmed by urine toxicology increased by 53% during MySafeRx but fell 43% within 3 weeks post-intervention. The MySafeRx medication adherence and remote coaching mobile platform is acceptable and can be feasibly implemented in real-world opioid use disorder treatment settings during high-risk periods (i.e., initial stabilization, after illicit opioid lapse), resulting in reduced illicit opioid use; however, the effect did not last after intervention completion, suggesting longer duration or extended taper of program may be needed.

    "abstract": "Effective medications for treating alcohol use disorders (AUD) are available but underutilized. Multiple barriers to their provision have been identified, and optimal strategies for addressing and overcoming barriers to use of medications for AUD treatment remain elusive. We conducted a structured review of published care delivery and implementation studies evaluating interventions that aimed to increase medication treatment for patients with AUD to identify interventions and component strategies that were most effective. We reviewed literature through May 2018 and used networking to identify intervention studies with AUD medication receipt reported as a primary or secondary outcome. Studies were identified as care delivery studies, characterized by patient-level recruitment and willingness to be randomized to candidate treatment options, and implementation studies, characterized by inclusion of all patients treated at sites involved in the study. Each identified study was independently coded by two investigators for strategies used, guided by a published taxonomy of implementation strategies. All authors reviewed coding discrepancies and revised codes based on consensus. After reaching internal consensus, we solicited feedback from lead investigators on studies to code additional strategies. We reviewed implementation strategies used across studies to assess their relationship with medication receipt, as well as alcohol use outcomes, as available. Nine studies were identified: four RCTs of care delivery interventions, four quasi-experimental evaluations of large-scale implementation interventions, and one quasi-experimental evaluation of a targeted single-site implementation intervention. Implementation strategies used were variable across studies; no strategy was universally used. Effects of the interventions on receipt of AUD pharmacotherapy and alcohol use outcomes also varied. Three of four care delivery interventions resulted in increased receipt of AUD medications, but only one of these three improved alcohol use outcomes. One large-scale and one single-site implementation intervention were associated with increased AUD medication receipt, and these studies did not assess alcohol use outcomes. Patterns of implementation strategies did not clearly distinguish studies that successfully increased use of pharmacotherapy versus those that did not. Our review did not reveal strategies most effective for implementing AUD medications. Interventions designed to overcome identified barriers may have missed the mark, or differences in the intensity or targets of strategies may matter more than differences in strategies. Further research is needed to understand effective implementation methods and to better understand patient-level perspective, preferences and barriers to receipt of medications.",

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of substance use disorders (SUDs) among incarcerated adults in the U.S. is well-known, but there has been less examination of SUD treatment and rates of incarceration among the population of adults with SUDs as the denominator. The current study uses a population-based sample to address three questions: (1) What is the rate of lifetime incarceration among the population of U.S. adults with SUDs?; (2) Among adults with SUDs, what proportion of those with incarceration histories use SUD treatment compared to those without incarceration histories?; and (3) What individual characteristics are associated with utilization of SUD treatment among adults with incarceration histories?Data were based on the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III which surveyed a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults through structured interviews. This study focused on the 10,853 respondents who had any lifetime SUD, including 2670 (weighted 22.4%) who reported a lifetime history of incarceration.In the total weighted sample of respondents with SUDs, 22% had been incarcerated before but only 37% had used any alcohol use disorder treatment and 18% had used drug use disorder treatment. Controlling for confounding variables, respondents with SUDs and incarceration histories had 3.1 times the odds of using alcohol use disorder treatment and 1.6 times the odds of using drug use disorder treatment compared to their counterparts with SUDs and no incarceration histories. Having an opioid use disorder, especially heroin use disorder, and a stimulant use disorder, such as cocaine use disorder, had strong associations with any SUD treatment use.Many U.S. adults with SUDs have histories of incarceration but only a minority use any SUD treatment. Public health approaches that increase access and incentives to engage in and complete SUD treatment may help resolve problems of both incarceration and SUDs in the population.",

    "abstract": "Addiction treatment improves substance use and criminal recidivism outcomes among justice-involved individuals with substance use disorders, but is underutilized. Although information exists regarding barriers to addiction treatment among individuals with substance use disorders more generally, less is known about barriers among individuals with previous justice involvement. The purpose of this pilot study was to describe barriers to addiction treatment in a sample of adults with a substance use disorder who participated in a pilot trial of brief interventions and were recently released from jail. Incarcerated individuals who were arrested for an alcohol- or drug-related crime and reported moderate or high alcohol use on the ASSIST (n = 28; 96.4% men) were recruited for a pilot trial of brief interventions to reduce substance use, which were delivered just prior to release from jail. After their release, participants completed the Barriers to Treatment Inventory (BTI), which included 25 numerical items and one open-ended question on additional barriers that provided qualitative data. We described frequency of quantitative responses and qualitatively coded open-ended data using seven previously identified domains of the BTI. The most commonly reported barriers assessed quantitatively were items related to Absence of Problem: \"I do not think I have a problem with drugs\" (42.8%), Privacy Concerns: \"I do not like to talk about my personal life with other people\" (35.8%), and Admission Difficulty: \"I will have to be on a waiting list for treatment\" (28.6%). Items related to Negative Social Support (e.g., \"Friends tell me not to go to treatment\") were rarely endorsed in this sample. Responses to the open-ended question also related to Absence of Problem, Privacy Concerns, and Admission Difficulty. Additional categories of barriers emerged from the qualitative data, including Ambivalence and Seeking Informal Assistance. In this small sample of adults with a substance use disorder recently released from jail, barriers to treatment were frequently endorsed. Future research on larger samples is needed to understand barriers to treatment specific to justice-involved populations. Clinicians may consider using open-ended questions to explore and address barriers to addiction treatment among individuals with current or recent justice involvement.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption among Indigenous Australians can be irregular, depending on social and geographic context. The Finnish method uses the last four drinking occasions to estimate drinking quantity and pattern. The Grog Survey App is an interactive and visual tablet computer application which uses touch-screen technology to deliver questions on drinking. Alcohol consumption recorded on the Grog Survey App using the last four occasions (Finnish) method was compared with a clinical interview conducted by an Indigenous Australian health professional. To assess convergent validity, Spearman's ranked correlations between consumption estimates from the App and from interview were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were used to compare how well the App and clinical interview agreed when classifying drinkers' risk. To assess criterion validity, average grams alcohol per day as estimated by the App (and by interview) were compared against presence of self-reported withdrawal tremors (from App or interview). Test–retest reliability was assessed by correlations between measures of alcohol consumption recorded on two occasions. The App recorded higher numbers of standard drinks consumed per drinking occasion than the interview. There was reasonable agreement between the App and interview across common reference periods (sensitivity 92.7%, specificity 69.8%, short-term risk; sensitivity 70.7%, specificity 68.8%, long-term risk). Average consumption recorded by the App was as good or better predictor of withdrawal tremors than consumption as estimated by interview. The Finnish method, as delivered by the App, offers an innovative way to collect survey data on alcohol in a population with an intermittent drinking pattern.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The TAPS Tool is a substance use screening and brief assessment instrument that was developed for use in primary care medical settings. It is one of the first screening instruments to provide rapid assessment of all commonly used substance classes, including illicit and prescription opioids, and is one of the only available screeners designed and validated in an electronic self-administered format (myTAPS). This secondary analysis of data from the TAPS Tool validation study describes the feasibility and acceptability of the myTAPS among primary care patients. Methods Adult patients (N = 2000) from five primary care clinics completed the TAPS Tool on a tablet computer (myTAPS), and in an interviewer-administered format. Requests for assistance and time required were tracked, and participants completed a survey on ease of use, utilization of audio guidance, and format preference. Logistic regression was used to examine outcomes in defined subpopulations, including groups that may have greater difficulty completing an electronic screener, and those that may prefer an electronic self-administered approach. Results Almost all participants (98.3%) reported that the myTAPS was easy to use. The median time to complete myTAPS screening was 4.0 min (mean 4.48, standard deviation 2.57). More time was required by participants who were older, Hispanic, Black, or reported non-medical prescription drug use, while less time was required by women. Assistance was requested by 25% of participants, and was more frequently requested by those who with lower education (OR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.62–2.67) or age &gt; 65 years (OR = 2.79, 95% CI 1.98–3.93). Audio guidance was utilized by 18.3%, and was more frequently utilized by participants with lower education (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.54–2.63), age &gt; 65 years (OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.22–2.61), or Black race (OR = 1.30, 95% 1.01–1.68). The myTAPS format was preferred by women (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.00–1.66) and individuals with drug use (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.09–1.88), while participants with lower education preferred the interviewer-administered format (OR = 2.75, 95% CI 2.00–3.78). Conclusions Overall, myTAPS screening was feasible and well accepted by adult primary care patients. Clinics adopting electronic screening should be prepared to offer assistance to some patients, particularly those who are older or less educated, and should have the capacity to use an interviewer-administered approach when required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite the high prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), in 2016, only 7.8% of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria received any type of AUD treatment. Developing options for treatment within primary care settings is imperative to increase treatment access. As part of a trial to implement AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care settings, this qualitative study analyzed pre-implementation provider interviews using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to identify implementation barriers. Methods Three large Veterans Health Administration facilities participated in the implementation intervention. Local providers were trained to serve as implementation/clinical champions and received external facilitation from the project team. Primary care providers received a dashboard of patients with AUD for case identification, educational materials, and access to consultation from clinical champions. Veterans with AUD diagnoses received educational information in the mail. Prior to the start of implementation activities, 24 primary care providers (5–10 per site) participated in semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using common coding techniques for qualitative data using the CFIR codebook Innovation/Intervention Characteristics, Outer Setting, Inner Setting, and Characteristics of Individuals domains. Number and type of barriers identified were compared to quantitative changes in AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing rates. Results Four major barriers emerged across all three sites: complexity of providing AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care, the limited compatibility of AUD treatment with existing primary care processes, providers’ limited knowledge and negative beliefs about AUD pharmacotherapy and providers’ negative attitudes toward patients with AUD. Site specific barriers included lack of relative advantage of providing AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care over current practice, complaints about the design quality and packaging of implementation intervention materials, limited priority of addressing AUD in primary care and limited available resources to implement AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care. Conclusions CFIR constructs were useful for identifying pre-implementation barriers that informed refinements to the implementation intervention. The number and type of pre-implementation barriers identified did not demonstrate a clear relationship to the degree to which sites were able to improve AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing rate. Site-level implementation process factors such as leadership support and provider turn-over likely also interacted with pre-implementation barriers to drive implementation outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background We describe addiction consult services (ACS) adaptations implemented during the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic across four different North American sites: St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia; Oregon Health &amp; Sciences University in Portland, Oregon; Boston Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts; and Yale New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut. Experiences ACS made system, treatment, harm reduction, and discharge planning adaptations. System changes included patient visits shifting to primarily telephone-based consultations and ACS leading regional COVID-19 emergency response efforts such as substance use treatment care coordination for people experiencing homelessness in COVID-19 isolation units and regional substance use treatment initiatives. Treatment adaptations included providing longer buprenorphine bridge prescriptions at discharge with telemedicine follow-up appointments and completing benzodiazepine tapers or benzodiazepine alternatives for people with alcohol use disorder who could safely detoxify in outpatient settings. We believe that regulatory changes to buprenorphine, and in Vancouver other medications for opioid use disorder, helped increase engagement for hospitalized patients, as many of the barriers preventing them from accessing care on an ongoing basis were reduced. COVID-19 specific harm reductions recommendations were adopted and disseminated to inpatients. Discharge planning changes included peer mentors and social workers increasing hospital in-reach and discharge outreach for high-risk patients, in some cases providing prepaid cell phones for patients without phones. Recommendations for the future We believe that ACS were essential to hospitals’ readiness to support patients that have been systematically marginilized during the pandemic. We suggest that hospitals invest in telehealth infrastructure within the hospital, and consider cellphone donations for people without cellphones, to help maintain access to care for vulnerable patients. In addition, we recommend hospital systems evaluate the impact of such interventions. As the economic strain on the healthcare system from COVID-19 threatens the very existence of ACS, overdose deaths continue rising across North America, highlighting the essential nature of these services. We believe it is imperative that health care systems continue investing in hospital-based ACS during public health crises.",

Despite evidence of its effectiveness, MBC is rarely adopted in routine substance use disorder (SUD) treatment settings and little is known about the factors that may improve its adoptability in these settings. The current study gathered qualitative data from SUD treatment clinicians about their perceptions of MBC, the clinical outcomes they would most like to monitor in MBC, and suggestions for the design and implementation of MBC systems in their settings. Methods Fifteen clinicians from one publicly-funded and two privately-funded outpatient SUD treatment clinics participated in one-on-one research interviews. Interviews focused on clinicians’ perceived benefits, drawbacks, and ideas related to implementing MBC technology into their clinical workflows. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded to allow for thematic analysis using a mixed deductive and inductive approach. Clinicians also completed a card sorting task to rate the perceived helpfulness of routinely measuring and monitoring different treatment outcomes. Results Clinicians reported several potential benefits of MBC, including improved patient-provider communication, client empowerment, and improved communication between clinicians. Clinicians also expressed potential drawbacks, including concerns about subjectivity in patient self-reports, limits to personalization, increased time burdens, and needing to learn to use new technologies. Clinicians generated several ideas and preferences aimed at minimizing burden of MBC, illustrating clinical changes over time, improving ease of use, and improving personalization. Numerous patient outcomes were identified as “very helpful” to track, including coping skills, social support, and motivation for change. Conclusions MBC may be a beneficial tool for improving clinical care in SUD treatment settings. MBC tools may be particularly adoptable if they are compatible with existing workflows, help illustrate gradual and nonlinear progress in SUD treatment, measure outcomes perceived as clinically useful, accommodate multiple use cases and stakeholder groups, and are framed as an additional source of information meant to augment, rather than replace, existing practices and information sources.",

Both medical and psychological interventions are called for to end this growing epidemic, but too few health care professionals are trained to treat OUD. One proven model of training physicians and cross-disciplinary teams in treating a variety of disorders is exemplified by Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes), a collaborative tele-mentoring program in which specialists train health-care workers to treat medical conditions, especially those that affect underserved populations. This systematic review found that Project ECHO has the potential to effectively extend current services to patients suffering from OUD, but that there is also a gap in knowledge regarding this type of training.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)—a form of hepatitis C (HCV) treatment associated with shorter treatment course and greater efficacy—offers an unprecedented opportunity to eliminate HCV, but only if care delivery systems are developed to extend treatment to people who inject drugs (PWID). To support the design of a community-pharmacy program, we explored perspectives of PWID with chronic HCV with regard to barriers, motivators, preferences, and prior experiences related to HCV treatment and pharmacists. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with people living with HCV who reported active injection drug use. Participants were recruited from local community service and clinical organizations in the Seattle, Washington region, and focus groups and interviews were conducted in-person or via phone/video-conference. Rapid Assessment Process was used to analyze qualitative data. Dual coders used structured templates to summarize findings and engaged in iterative review to identify themes. Results Among the 40 participants, 65% were male, 52.5% were white, and 80% were not stably housed. On average, participants had been injecting drugs for 14 years and living with HCV for 6 years. Analyses revealed 3 themes: (1) limited knowledge regarding HCV and DAA treatments; (2) barriers/motivators for receiving treatment included fear of side effects, prior stigmatizing behaviors from physicians, and desire to protect relatives and the PWID community from HCV transmission; and (3) preferences for HCV care delivery, including a need for person-centered, low-barrier, and collaborative treatment integrated with other care (e.g. primary care and addiction treatment) for PWID. Participants were generally receptive to a community-pharmacy model for HCV treatment, but prior interactions with pharmacists were mixed and there were some concerns expressed that care delivered by pharmacists would not be equivalent to that of physicians. Conclusions Even in the direct-acting antivirals era, people who inject drugs still face major barriers to hepatitis C treatment which may be reduced by providing low-barrier points of access for care through pharmacists. Key recommendations for community-pharmacy design included providing care team training to reduce stigma and ensuring care team structures and culture target PWID-specific needs for education and engagement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol use disorder (AUD) accounts for millions of acute care encounters annually in the United States. Hospitalization represents a vital opportunity to intervene pharmacologically, but low medication adherence is a significant barrier. Two single-dose, adherence-independent interventions are well suited for pre-discharge administration: intravenous (IV) ketamine and intramuscular (IM) naltrexone. Their feasibility and readmission-reducing efficacy in hospital settings are not well-established. Methods A 3-arm, open-label randomized trial was conducted at our safety-net medical hospital among high-utilization inpatients with severe AUD. Consented adults (age 18–65) were randomized to (1) IV ketamine (KET) 0.5 mg/kg over 40 min, (2) IM naltrexone (NTX) 380 mg once, or (3) linkage alone (LA). The primary clinical outcome was 30-day all-cause hospital readmission rate. All were provided enhanced linkage to outpatient addiction clinic. Results We consented and randomized 44 participants (n = 13, 14, 17 for KET, NTX, LA, respectively), with a mean of 3.2 past-year hospitalizations. Compared to the LA arm, both the KET arm (RR 0.37, p = 0.17) and NTX arm (RR 0.52, p = 0.27) had a lower 30-day readmission rate, though the differences were nonsignificant. Immediate acceptability ratings of KET and NTX were 9.50 and 9.17 out of 10, respectively. No serious adverse events or illicit ketamine use was reported. Conclusions Both interventions are feasible and showed promise in reducing readmissions for high-utilization AUD inpatients. Despite randomization, baseline characteristics may have differed in ways that biased against the control arm. Additional pragmatic studies—with larger sample size, blinding, and robust follow-up data collection—are needed to verify findings and better understand mediating factors.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Many primary care clinicians (PCCs) hold stigma toward people with opioid use disorder (OUD), which may be a barrier to care. Few interventions exist to address PCC stigma toward people with OUD. This study examined whether an online training incorporating patient narratives reduced PCCs’ stigma toward people with OUD (primary) and increased intentions to treat people with OUD compared to an attention-control training (secondary). Methods PCCs from 15 primary care clinics were invited to complete a 30 min online training for an electronic health record-embedded clinical decision support (CDS) tool that alerts PCCs to screen, diagnose, and treat people with OUD. PCCs were randomized to receive a stigma-reduction version of the training with patient narrative videos or a control training without patient narratives and were blinded to group assignment. Immediately after the training, PCCs completed surveys of stigma towards people with OUD and intentions and willingness to treat OUD. CDS tool use was monitored for 6 months. Analyses included independent samples t -tests, Pearson correlations, and logistic regression. Results A total of 162 PCCs were randomized; 88 PCCs (58% female; 68% white) completed the training (Stigma = 48; Control = 40) and were included in analyses. There was no significant difference between intervention and control groups for stigma ( t = − 0.48, p = .64, Cohen’s d = − 0.11), intention to get waivered ( t = 1.11, p = .27, d = 0.26), or intention to prescribe buprenorphine if a waiver were no longer required ( t = 0.90, p = 0.37, d = 0.21). PCCs who reported greater stigma reported lower intentions both to get waivered ( r = − 0.25, p = 0.03) and to prescribe buprenorphine with no waiver ( r = − 0.25, p = 0.03). Intervention group and self-reported stigma were not significantly related to CDS tool use. Conclusions Stigma toward people with OUD may require more robust intervention than this brief training was able to accomplish. However, stigma was related to lower intentions to treat people with OUD, suggesting stigma acts as a barrier to care. Future work should identify effective interventions to reduce stigma among PCCs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Acute-care interventions that identify patients with substance use disorders (SUDs), initiate treatment, and link patients to community-based services, have proliferated in recent years. Yet, much is unknown about the specific strategies being used to support continuity of care from emergency department (ED) or inpatient hospital settings to community-based SUD treatment. In this scoping review, we synthesize the existing literature on patient transition interventions, and form an initial typology of reported strategies. Methods We searched Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL and PsychINFO for peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2021 that studied interventions linking patients with SUD from ED or inpatient hospital settings to community-based SUD services. Eligible articles measured at least one post-discharge treatment outcome and included a description of the strategy used to promote linkage to community care. Detailed information was extracted on the components of the transition strategies and a thematic coding process was used to categorize strategies into a typology based on shared characteristics. Facilitators and barriers to transitions of care were synthesized using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Results Forty-five articles met inclusion criteria. 62% included ED interventions and 44% inpatient interventions. The majority focused on patients with opioid (71%) or alcohol (31%) use disorder. The transition strategies reported across studies were heterogeneous and often not well described. An initial typology of ten transition strategies, including five pre- and five post-discharge transition strategies is proposed. The most common strategy was scheduling an appointment with a community-based treatment provider prior to discharge. A range of facilitators and barriers were described, which can inform efforts to improve hospital-to-community transitions of care. Conclusions Strategies to support transitions from acute-care to community-based SUD services, although critical for ensuring continuity of care, vary greatly across interventions and are inconsistently measured and described. More research is needed to classify SUD care transition strategies, understand their components, and explore which lead to the best patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on work satisfaction, work-related stress, and perceived work quality among substance use treatment providers to better understand challenges faced among this group during the pandemic. Methods Participants of this study were 91 addiction treatment providers (e.g., therapists, physicians, community support specialists, administrative staff) recruited from various treatment facilities (e.g., inpatient and outpatient settings). Mixed method analyses were conducted to assess self-reported burnout, sources of work-related stress, and perceived work quality during the pandemic. Responses from providers reporting COVID-19 related decreases in work quality were compared to responses from providers who reported their quality of work had increased or remained the same. Results Results demonstrated half of providers (51%) reported their quality of work had decreased. This perceived decrease in quality of work was associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion ( M = 17.41 vs. M = 12.48, p = 0.002), workplace stress ( M = 42.80 vs. M = 30.84, p = 0.001), as well as decreased enjoyment of work (83% vs. 51%, p = 0.001) and decreased personal accomplishment ( M = 20.64 vs. M = 23.05 p = 0.001). Qualitative investigations further illustrated that increased hours, changes in work schedules, work-life balance challenges, difficulties with client communication, and increased client needs were contributing factors increasing stress/burnout and decreasing perceived work quality. Conclusions Addiction treatment providers experience high levels of burnout and workplace stress. Additionally, many individuals perceived a decrease in their quality of work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addiction treatment facility administration should address these challenges to support the well-being of clinical staff and the clients they serve both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission is primarily driven by injection drug use, and acute HCV infection rates are increased in rural communities with substantial barriers to care. Treatment of HCV in persons who use drugs (PWUD) is cost effective, decreases high risk behaviors and HCV transmission, and achieves high rates of treatment completion and sustained viral response. Adapting HCV care delivery to utilize peer support specialists, telemedicine technology, and streamlined testing and treatment strategies can better reach rural populations living with HCV. Methods This is an open label, two-arm, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial designed to test the superiority of peer-facilitated and streamlined telemedicine HCV care (peer tele-HCV) compared to enhanced usual care (EUC) among PWUD in rural Oregon. In the intervention arm, peers conduct HCV screening in the community, facilitate pretreatment evaluation and linkage to telemedicine hepatitis C treatment providers, and support participants in HCV medication adherence. For participants assigned to EUC, peers facilitate pretreatment evaluation and referral to community-based treatment providers. The primary outcome is sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post treatment (SVR12). Secondary outcomes include: (1) HCV treatment initiation, (2) HCV treatment completion, (3) engagement with harm reduction resources, (4) rates of substance use, and (5) engagement in addiction treatment resources. The primary and secondary outcomes are analyzed using intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons between telemedicine and EUC. A qualitative analysis will assess patient, peer, and clinician experiences of peer-facilitated telemedicine hepatitis C treatment. Discussion This study uses a novel peer-based telemedicine delivery model with streamlined testing protocols to improve access to HCV treatment in rural communities with high rates of injection drug use and ongoing disease transmission. We hypothesize that the peer tele-HCV model will increase treatment initiation, treatment completion, SVR12 rates, and engagement with harm reduction services compared to EUC.

Methods A systematic review was conducted with searches in PubMed and Scopus to identify systematic reviews assessing the impact of interventions aimed at reducing the harms associated with injectable drug use. The overall characteristics of the studies were extracted and their methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2. An evidence gap map was constructed, highlighting the most frequently reported outcomes by intervention (CRD42023387713). Results Thirty-three systematic reviews were included. Of these, 14 (42.2%) assessed the impact of needle/syringe exchange programs (NSEP) and 11 (33.3%) examined opioid agonist therapy (OAT). These interventions are likely to be associated with reductions of HIV/HCV incidence (10–40% risk reduction for NSEP; 50–60% for OAT) and sharing injecting paraphernalia (50% for NSEP, 25–85% for OAT), particularly when combined (moderate evidence). Behavioral/educational interventions were assessed in 12 reviews (36.4%) with most authors in favor/partially in favor of the use of these approaches (moderate evidence). Take-home naloxone programs and supervised-injection facilities were each assessed in two studies (6.1%), which reported inconclusive results (limited/inconsistent evidence). Most authors reported high levels of heterogeneity and risk of bias. Other interventions and outcomes were inadequately reported. Most systematic reviews presented low or critically low quality. Conclusion The evidence is sufficient to support the effectiveness of OAT, NSEP and their combination in reducing blood-borne infection transmission and certain injecting behaviors among PWID. However, evidence of other harm minimizations interventions in different settings and for some outcomes remain insufficient.",

There is a critical need for innovative, efficacious, scalable, and community-driven models of healthcare in non-stigmatizing settings for PWID. We seek to test a Comprehensive-TeleHarm Reduction (C-THR) intervention for HIV prevention services delivered via a syringe services program (SSP). Methods The CHARIOT trial is a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation study using a parallel two-arm randomized controlled trial design. Participants (i.e., PWID; n = 350) will be recruited from a syringe services program (SSP) in Miami, Florida. Participants will be randomized to receive either C-THR or non-SSP clinic referral and patient navigation. The objectives are: (1) to determine if the C-THR intervention increases engagement in HIV prevention (i.e., HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis; PrEP or medications for opioid use disorder; MOUD) compared to non-SSP clinic referral and patient navigation, (2) to examine the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the C-THR intervention, and (3) to assess the barriers and facilitators to implementation and sustainment of the C-THR intervention. The co-primary outcomes are PrEP or MOUD engagement across follow-up at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. For PrEP, engagement is confirmed by tenofovir on dried blood spot or cabotegravir injection within the previous 8 weeks. For MOUD, engagement is defined as screening positive for norbuprenorphine or methadone on urine drug screen; or naltrexone or buprenorphine injection within the previous 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes include PrEP adherence, engagement in HCV treatment and sustained virologic response, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. The short and long term cost-effectiveness analyses and mixed-methods implementation evaluation will provide compelling data on the sustainability and possible impact of C-THR on comprehensive HIV prevention delivered via SSPs. Discussion The CHARIOT trial will be the first to our knowledge to test the efficacy of an innovative, peer-led telehealth intervention with PWID at risk for HIV delivered via an SSP. This innovative healthcare model seeks to transform the way PWID access care by bypassing the traditional healthcare system, reducing multi-level barriers to care, and meeting PWID where they are.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Health care providers are a key source of reports of infants to child welfare related to birthing people’s substance use. Many of these reports are overreports, or reports that exceed what is legally mandated, and reflect racial bias. We developed and evaluated a webinar for health professionals to address overreporting related to birthing people’s substance use. Methods This evaluation study collected data from health professionals registering to participate in a professional education webinar about pregnancy, substance use, and child welfare reporting. It collected baseline data upon webinar registration, immediate post-webinar data, and 6 month follow-up data. Differences in both pre-post-and 6 month follow-up data were used to examine changes from before to after the webinars in beliefs, attitudes, and practices related to pregnant and birthing people who use drugs and child welfare reporting. Results 592 nurses, social workers, physicians, public health professionals, and other health professionals completed the baseline survey. More than half of those completing the baseline survey (n = 307, 52%) completed one or both follow-up surveys. We observed statistically significant changes in five of the eleven opioid attitudes/beliefs and in four of the nine child welfare attitudes/beliefs from baseline to follow-ups, and few changes in “control statements,” i.e. beliefs we did not expect to change based on webinar participation. All of the changes were in the direction of less support for child welfare reporting. In particular, the proportion agreeing with the main evaluation outcome of “I would rather err on the side of overreporting to child welfare than underreporting to child welfare” decreased from 41% at baseline to 28% and 31% post-webinar and at 6-month follow up (p = 0.001). In addition, fewer participants endorsed reporting everyone at the 6 month follow-up than at baseline (12% to 22%) and more participants endorsed reporting no one at the 6-month follow-up than at baseline (28% to 18%), p = 0.013. Conclusions Webinars on the legal, scientific, and ethical aspects of reporting that are co-developed with people with lived experience may be a path to reducing health professional overreporting to child welfare related to birthing people’s substance use.",

    "abstract": "Background: Alcohol-attributable medical disorders are prevalent among individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, there is a lack of research on prescriptions of pharmacological treatment for AUD in those with comorbid conditions. This study aims to investigate the utilization of pharmacological treatment (acamprosate, disulfiram and naltrexone) in specialist care among patients with AUD and comorbid medical diagnoses. Methods: This was a descriptive register-based Swedish national cohort study including 132,728 adults diagnosed with AUD (N = 270,933) between 2007 and 2015. The exposure was alcohol-attributable categories of comorbid medical diagnoses. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using mixed-effect logistic regression analyses for any filled prescription of acamprosate, disulfiram or oral naltrexone within 12 months post AUD diagnosis. Results: Individuals with comorbid alcohol-attributable medical diagnoses had lower odds of filling prescriptions for any type of AUD pharmacotherapy compared to those without such comorbidities. Cardiovascular (OR = 0.41 [95% CI: 0.39–0.43]), neurological (OR = 0.52 [95% CI: 0.48–0.56]) and gastrointestinal (OR = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.54–0.60]) diseases were associated with the lowest rates of prescription receipt. The presence of diagnoses which are contraindications to AUD pharmacotherapy did not fully explain the low prescription rate. Conclusion: There is a substantial underutilization of AUD pharmacotherapy in patients with AUD and comorbid medical disorders in specialist care. Increasing the provision of pharmacotherapy to this group of patients is essential and may prevent morbidity and mortality. There is a need to further understand barriers to medical treatment both from the patient and prescriber perspective.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The postpartum period provides an opportunity for birthing people with opioid use disorder (OUD) to consider their future reproductive health goals. However, the relationship between the use of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and contraception utilization is not well understood. We used multistate administrative claims data to compare contraception utilization rates among postpartum people with OUD initiating buprenorphine (BUP) versus no medication (psychosocial services receipt without MOUD (PSY)) in the United States (US). Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from the Merative™ MarketScan ® Multi-State Medicaid Databases 2016–2021 among postpartum women with OUD who did and did not initiate BUP during pregnancy. Our primary outcome was the receipt of prescribed highly-effective or effective contraception by 90 days postpartum. Highly-effective contraception was defined as female sterilization and long-acting reversible contraception [LARC]). Effective contraception was defined as oral contraceptive pills [OCPs], the contraceptive patch, ring, or injection. We used multivariable Poisson regression models, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, to measure the association of BUP (vs. PSY) on postpartum contraception utilization. Results Our sample consisted of 11,118 postpartum people with OUD. Among those, 3,443 initiated BUP and 7,675 received PSY. By 90 days postpartum, 22.4% ( n = 2,487) of the cohort were prescribed contraception (21.5% PSY vs. 24.3% BUP). Among these participants, most received LARC (41.0%), followed by female sterilization (27.3%), the contraceptive injection (17.3%), pills (8.6%), ring (4.7%), and patch (1.0%), Compared to people engaged in PSY, BUP receipt was associated with a greater use of prescribed contraceptive use by 90 days postpartum (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.17[1.07–1.28]), including a modestly greater use of the patch, ring, and pills, (aRR = 1.13[1.08–1.18]), but a modestly lesser use of injection contraception (aRR = 0.95[0.91–0.99]). There was no relationship observed between BUP and LARC use (aRR = 1.00[0.95–1.04]) and female sterilization (aRR = 1.01[0.98–1.06]). Conclusions Only 22% of pregnant people with OUD in our cohort used effective or highly-effective postpartum contraception. BUP receipt during pregnancy, relative to PSY, was associated with modestly greater use of prescribed effective contraceptive methods but was not associated with greater use of provider-administered contraceptive methods, such as the contraceptive injection, LARC and female sterilization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid-related fatal overdoses are occurring at historically high levels and increasing each year. Accessible social and financial support are imperative to the initiation and success of treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) offer effective treatment but there are many more people with untreated OUD than receiving evidence-based medication. Patient-centered care is associated with increased care utilization for substance use disorders. This qualitative study explored the patient perspective of OUD care through a Patient-Centered Care (PCC) framework to illuminate patients’ sense of engagement in care. Methods Fifteen semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted from August through November of 2021 regarding patient experiences receiving MOUD in 13 Vermont Hub and Spoke clinics. Emergent themes were deductively mapped to PCC domains of Therapeutic Alliance, Individualized Care, Shared Decision-Making, and Holistic Care. Results Participants indicated that PCC fostered engagement and often characterized MOUD clinics they no longer attended as lacking in PCC. Themes related to Therapeutic Alliance were the most prevalent and suggest pathways to retention. Individualizing care through flexible appointment scheduling was strongly valued, while inflexible scheduling fostered fear of not getting medication. Some participants indicated they were less likely to remain in care when providers did not include them in decisions about medication type, dose, or formulation. Participants also appreciated holistic biopsychosocial care and care referrals. Conclusions Patient-centered MOUD care was important to participants and encouraged engagement in care. Prioritizing alliance with patients, adapting care to patient needs and preferences particularly when scheduling, including patients in medication decisions, and biopsychosocial attention to patients are congruent with patient perception of desirable MOUD care. Having this understanding of an established, leading MOUD treatment system may serve to benefit states looking to implement this model, or for states who are looking to improve the model they already have in place, potentially leading to higher treatment and retention rates. Trial registration This was not a clinical trial involving an intervention, and therefore registration was not required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are among the best tools available to combat the opioid epidemic. Yet, use of MOUD among people with opioid use disorder (OUD) remains low. Interventions to increase MOUD access in the United States have largely focused on improving organizational capacity and addressing funding barriers, yet stigma toward MOUD may inhibit uptake even where MOUD is readily available. Non-prescribing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment professionals (e.g. counselors) likely have considerable influence on a client’s choice to initiate and adhere to MOUD, but beliefs that counselors convey about MOUD in interaction with clients are understudied. The current study explores what advantages and disadvantages that counselors communicate about buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone. Methods From June to December 2021, we surveyed counselors from publicly-funded SUD treatment agencies under a municipality-wide mandate to offer MOUD to all clients with OUD. Counselors were asked to describe, in a free-response format, the most important advantages and disadvantages to communicate to their clients about taking buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone. Counselor responses were coded for one or more advantage and disadvantage. Results A total of 271 SUD counselors from 29 agencies in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area completed the survey, generating 1,995 advantages and disadvantages across three types of MOUD. The most frequently reported advantage across all three types of MOUD was their ability to reduce cravings and illicit drug use. The most frequently reported disadvantage related to the potential for some types of MOUD to develop long-term medication dependence. Conclusions As the availability and variety of MOUD treatment options continue to expand, it is important that SUD counselors are equipped with evidence-based recommendations for OUD care. We identified misalignments with the MOUD-prescribing evidence base and stigmatizing language toward MOUD within counselors’ responses, highlighting the potential to refine training materials for MOUD and mitigate stigmatizing beliefs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The increase in opioid use disorder among young, nonurban people has fueled sharp rises in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Innovative treatment models are needed that circumvent healthcare system barriers for people who use drugs (PWUD), particularly in rural areas. The Oregon HOPE TeleHCV study randomized PWUD living with HCV in rural Oregon to peer-facilitated and streamlined telemedicine HCV treatment (Peer TeleHCV) versus enhanced usual care (EUC) and assessed sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post treatment (SVR12). Peer Support Specialists (peers) conducted HCV screening in the community, facilitated pretreatment evaluation and linkage to telemedicine HCV treatment clinicians, and supported Peer TeleHCV study participants in HCV medication adherence. A qualitative investigation queried telemedicine clinicians and peers about their experiences with the implementation of the model and key drivers of implementation effectiveness. Methods Two remote audio/video recorded focus groups were conducted, one with the study’s clinicians and one with the peers. Participants were asked their views of key elements for successful implementation and outcomes of the Peer TeleHCV model. Group interviews lasted one hour. Recordings were professionally transcribed for thematic analysis with a mixed deductive and inductive framework, using Atlas.ti. Patients were surveyed about their interactions and satisfaction with peers. Results Quantitative data (n = 78) indicated patients had high levels of satisfaction with and support from the peers. Three themes were identified from the qualitative data (n = 12) including. (1) Key peer-level elements such as providing support during potentially difficult lab draws, creating a peer-facilitated “bubble of trust” between patients and clinicians, enabling technology access, conducting outreach to maintain contact and support treatment retention, and facilitating stabilizing wrap-around services (e.g., housing vouchers) (2) Key clinician-level factors such as capacity for unscheduled peer-facilitated appointments, having dedicated time for case consults with peers, and clinicians trained in working with PWUD and skilled in identifying related clinical concerns (3) Key systems-level elements such as standing lab orders, challenges related to specialty pharmacies and Medicaid managed care organizations, and streamlined communication strategies between peers and clinicians. Conclusion All participants reported that the Peer TeleHCV model built trust and eased barriers for PWUD initiating and remaining in HCV treatment. This low-barrier model makes space for PWUD to receive HCV treatment, regardless of drug use. Implementing support from peer specialists, telemedicine technology, and streamlined testing and treatment strategies may connect more rural PWUD living with HCV with the cure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Given the opioid overdose crisis, surveillance of evolving opioid use patterns is critical to the effective deployment of mitigation strategies. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) provided the first annual US estimate of illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) use in 2022. However, as a household survey, NSDUH may not capture the full extent of population heroin and IMF use. We compare estimates of past-year heroin and IMF use and correlates of use in NSDUH and the Survey of Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs (NMURx) survey which employ an alternate sampling strategy. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the 2022 NSDUH and NMURx. NSDUH samples respondents using a probability-based approach targeting community-dwelling individuals, while NMURx samples respondents using an opt-in, online survey panel. US adults ages 18 years and older were included. The main outcomes were differences in the weighted percentage of population reporting past-year use of heroin, IMF, and either heroin or IMF between the surveys. Secondary outcomes were the patterns of association of past-year heroin or IMF use with comorbid substance use, treatment utilization, and demographic characteristics between the surveys. Data were analyzed March to June 2024. Results NSDUH ( n = 47,100 respondents) had a lower proportion of respondents who identified as non-Hispanic White and graduated college, and a higher proportion with past week employment than NMURx ( N = 59,041 respondents). Past-year use of heroin, IMF, and either heroin or IMF were lower in the NSDUH than the NMURx. NSDUH estimated 0.52% (95% CI: 0.40%, 0.69%) %) of the US population used either heroin or IMF in the past year compared to 1.05% (95% CI: 0.97%, 1.14 0) in NMURx. In regression models, stimulant and benzodiazepine use were consistently associated with increased heroin or IMF use across both surveys. Conclusions and relevance The estimated prevalence of heroin or IMF use was nearly 50% higher in the NMURx compared to NSDUH. These results highlight the importance of using complementary surveillance approaches to obtain accurate estimates of the prevalence and patterns of heroin or IMF use.",

Home delivery interventions have been shown to improve medication adherence for other chronic diseases, but the relationship between buprenorphine home delivery and opioid use disorder treatment outcomes has not been assessed. We evaluated the association between medication home delivery and retention in treatment in a feasibility study of adults who initiated telemedicine treatment for opioid use disorder and received one or more prescriptions. We described the characteristics of patients and estimated the odds of attending a telemedicine visit three and six months after enrollment as a function of home delivery use using logistic regression. The sample consisted of 337 adults with the following characteristics: mean age 40.8 years (SD 10.1), 51.0% male, and 70.9% commercially insured. In the first 30 days of treatment 6.8% ( n = 23) of patients used home delivery. At three months, the percentages of individuals retained among those with and without home delivery were 82.6% and 58.9%, respectively (odds ratio [OR]: 3.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10–9.96). At six months, the percentages of individuals retained among those with and without home delivery were 78.6% and 45.5%, respectively (OR: 4.39, 95% CI: 1.19–16.25, n = 203). Although uptake of medication delivery through the pharmacy partner was low within this sample of patients receiving treatment for opioid use disorder, its use was associated with increased retention in care at three and six months. Given the small sample size, low uptake, and limited statistical power, additional research is warranted.",

The novelty of these formal training programs, created in response to complex and ever-expanding clinical needs in Addiction Medicine, creates unique educational circumstances that must be understood to support future growth. This study characterizes the current state of these postgraduate training programs in Canada through the perspectives of Program Directors (PDs). Methods This study is a mixed methods study of 12 PDs. In Phase 1, participants completed a quantitative survey analyzed through descriptive statistics. In Phase 2, participants underwent a qualitative semi-structured interview that was coded with a thematic analysis approach. Mixing occurred both during the interim analysis between phases and during the interpretation stage. Results 28 trainees enrolled in a fellowship program in 2021–22 across 10 programs, and 27 trainees enrolled in 2022–23 across 11 programs. In each year, there were significantly fewer available spots than applications (31% and 29%, respectively). PDs identified a funding “bottleneck” as the most difficult and important challenge facing programs, with trainees supported by diverse and unstable funding sources. Qualitative analysis highlighted the need for sustainable funding models, flexibility toward alternative training pathways (shorter durations of training and re-entry from practice), and establishment of a national community of practice to support the co-creation of a robust addictions medical education infrastructure. Conclusion For Addiction Medicine training to meet workforce demands, PDs stressed that funding was the challenge of prime importance. Future studies should examine the perspectives of Addiction Medicine fellows, the clinical and research impacts of fellowship graduates, and the cost-effectiveness of fellowship funding models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background An estimated 84,181 people died due to opioid overdose in 2022 alone [1]. Mobile technologies may offer an additional pathway to provide support to people seeking recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD). To this end, we conducted a content analysis of opioid-related apps to determine to what extent apps exist that provide support to people seeking or in recovery from OUD. For apps specifically targeting OUD recovery, we identified the tools these apps offer to users seeking support in their recovery. Methods Our team conducted a content analysis of publicly available opioid-related apps identified via web-scraping in the Apple and Google app stores. Using a two-step qualitative coding process, we first identified which apps were meaningfully related to OUD recovery and second identified what tools, if any, these apps provided. Results Web-scraping identified 1,136 apps from the Apple App Store ( n = 247) and Google Play ( n = 889). Of those, 290 apps were specific to OUD recovery (65% of iOS apps, 35% of Android apps). Of those, 161 apps were included in our final analysis. The most common type of tools provided support for motivation (65.2%) and accountability (65.8%). Many apps (53%) also supported linkage to recovery support (e.g., meeting finder, telehealth). Surprisingly, fewer apps provided information about OUD recovery (43.5%) or tools for cravings (33.5%). 42.9% of apps had limited accessibility (e.g., paywalls, private invite). Conclusions Our results show a substantial increase in the number of apps designed to support OUD recovery. Nevertheless, there remains a need for apps that provide empirically supported information and tools. Furthermore, restrictions in accessibility (i.e., findability, cost, private) may limit the impact of available apps.",

Despite its broad use, translation into several languages, and validation in various settings, no study has yet confirmed the psychometric properties of a Moroccan version. The present research aims to adapt and validate the Moroccan Arabic dialect version of the CRAFFT scale among adolescents and young adults with alcohol and drug use disorder. Methods A total of 302 adolescents and young adults (mean age = 18.36 ± 2.36), including 161 males and 41 females, were recruited from a substance use treatment center in Fez City. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to assess the factorial structure and model fit, while internal consistency was evaluated using the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20). Convergent validity was examined using gold standard measures, including the International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Hooked-on Nicotine Checklist (HONC). All statistical analyses were performed using JASP software (version 0.17). Results CFA revealed a one-factor structure with a good overall fit (χ²/df = 1.91, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.06, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.03, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.98, Normed Fit Index (NFI) = 0.97. The model had strong reliability with a KR-20 coefficient of 0.80. Convergent validity was confirmed by a high and significant correlation with the MINI gold standard ( r = 0.82, p &lt; 0.001), while a low correlation with the HONC gold standard ( r = 0.20, p &lt; 0.001) confirmed the scale’s convergent validity. A cutoff score of 4 or higher on the CRAFFT was identified as optimal for balancing sensitivity (78.35%) and specificity (91.67%), achieving a Youden index of 0.70. Conclusion The psychometric properties of the Moroccan version of the CRAFFT confirm that it is a valid tool for screening the early detection of alcohol and drug use and for assessing the risk of substance use disorders in adolescents and young adults.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Programs that aim to increase access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment in hospital-based settings have proliferated in recent years. These efforts include transitional opioid programs (TOPs), which navigate patients to community-based SUD treatment programs post-discharge. Successful navigation from TOPs to outpatient treatment hinges on effective coordination between hospitals and post-discharge endpoints, yet it is unclear how hospitals can best develop effective partnerships with outpatient treatment organizations. The objective of this study is to synthesize the common themes underpinning the development of partnerships to facilitate care transitions between TOPs and ongoing SUD treatment. Methods Qualitative study with staff and providers from hospitals affiliated with four safety-net health systems ( n = 21) and leaders from community-based organizations (CBOs) and treatment facilities that had established referral partnerships with one of the four health systems in our study ( n = 4). Results Analysis of interview transcripts revealed seven common themes that underpinned the development of care transitions partnerships: (1) Active, intentional outreach; (2) Responding to a community need; (3) External Enabling Factors; (4) Leveraging reputations and community connections; (5) Focusing on operations; (6) Reciprocal relationships; and (7) Building Infrastructure and Processes to Ensure Collaboration. The seven identified themes were categorized into three groups corresponding to different partnership development stages. The first group revolves around the initial stage of meeting and developing a relationship (themes #1–4). The second set focuses on navigating and resolving challenges that arise in the partnership (themes #5–6). Lastly, the third group pertains to sustaining a partnership long-term (theme #7). Conclusions This study identifies seven core themes underlying the development of care transition partnerships for SUD patients within four safety net health systems and their CBO partners. These themes demonstrate how partner organizations can establish the trust, reciprocity, and commitment necessary to support patients through the critical transition period.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Every year about three million people die globally due to harmful alcohol use. The treatment gap remains high: only about 14% of individuals with problematic alcohol use access treatment. The implementation of digital interventions, addressing problematic alcohol use, into healthcare can be one way of reducing the treatment gap. However, little is known about how healthcare staff perceive the integration of digital interventions in routine addiction care. The aim of the study was to identify and describe healthcare staff’s experiences of perceived benefits of digital interventions for patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD), introduced in recent years within routine specialized addiction care in Sweden. The aim was further to explore how the use of such interventions in this setting could be further developed. Methods This study was conducted as an exploratory qualitative interview study with 16 informants from addiction care staff in Stockholm, Sweden. The informants came from three different groups: clinical managers, staff referring outpatients to digital interventions from within addiction care, and therapists from an e-support unit. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with thematic analysis. Results Three themes illustrated the benefits of digital interventions in routine addiction care, and future development areas. The theme An easy way in reflected the importance of easy access to addiction care where care would be flexible and available to everyone. Meeting individual patient needs raised the question of how to adapt treatment formats to the patients’ individual needs. Smoothly interlocking organizational gears highlighted the need for structure and cooperation between digital care and in-person care. Each theme included three additional subthemes. Conclusions The study identifies key factors for successfully integrating digital interventions in addiction care, highlighting the importance of staff engagement, structured workflows, training, and ongoing evaluation using a sociological framework.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The treatment of choice for substance use disorder (SUD) caused by sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics (SHA) is to slowly taper the dose of the implicated substance to the point of abstinence, thereby minimizing withdrawal symptoms. Concomitant pharmacotherapy may be indicated to manage excessive withdrawal or rebound symptoms. This study investigated the use of psychotropic drugs for the treatment of SHA-dependent SUD patients in Germany. Methods Data were obtained from the German Drug Safety Program in Psychiatry (“Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie”; AMSP) from 2000 to 2017. SHA SUD was classified using the 10th Edition of the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10). Results The present study included 1,015 patients with a primary diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorders due to use of sedatives or hypnotics (F13.1-F13.9). The most common comorbid psychiatric diagnoses were additional SUDs (F1, n = 279), especially alcohol use disorder (F10; n = 124), and mood disorders (F3; n = 201). A total of 95.6% of patients received one or more psychotropic drugs, most commonly antidepressant drugs (63.1% of patients), tranquillizing drugs (55.5%), and antipsychotic drugs (46.7%). The most common combination was an antidepressant drug and a tranquillizing drug (33.0%). Overall, psychotropic drugs with sedating properties (e.g., mirtazapine, quetiapine, doxepin, and trimipramine) were preferred. An increase in use over the 17-year observation period was observed for tranquillizing drugs and, most pronounced, for antipsychotic drugs. Conclusion We found high rates of non-SHA drugs among patients treated for SHA-SUD. The prevalent use of psychotropic drugs with strong sedating properties indicates a symptom-oriented treatment approach, which is often “off-label” but may be clinically necessary. Main limitation is the cross-sectional design of the AMSP databank. Therefore, we cannot provide any follow up data on the patient collective especially regarding outcome.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) are frequently hospitalized for injection-related medical complications, yet they often receive inadequate treatment for the OUD itself. We previously conducted a qualitative study to adapt an existing remotely delivered intensive outpatient program (IOP) specifically for hospitalized patients with OUD. We then conducted a pilot feasibility and acceptability study to assess the program. The 4-week IOP consisted of asynchronous video content and in-person peer support. The primary outcomes were the feasibility of recruitment, acceptability of the treatment as assessed by the completion of videos, and engagement with the peer recovery coach. Secondary outcomes included OUD treatment retention. Of the 12 participants, the mean age was 40.9 years, 58.3% were female, and 58.3% had an injection-related serious infection. Results demonstrated potentially acceptable recruitment feasibility (70.6%, 95% CI [48.9-92.3]), but the median percentage of video completion was only 2% (range: 0-16%) and the median percentage of engagement with recovery coach was 31.8% (range: 16.7-66.7%). All participants received medications for OUD (MOUD) during the hospital stay (methadone 83%, buprenorphine 17%), and 33.3% remained retained in MOUD treatment at 28 days. Hospitalized patients with OUD desired additional support through an IOP along with MOUD. While recruitment feasibility was acceptable, the overall program was not. Future research should explore IOP content that is more personalized and engaging while also including peer support.",

Outpatient veterans of OEF/OIF who drank ≥3 days in the past week were recruited from a US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Deployment Health Clinic waiting room. Veterans privately pretested the anonymous e-SBI then completed individual semistructured audio-recorded interviews. Their responses were analyzed using template analysis to explore domains identified a priori as well as emergent domains. During interviews, all nine OEF/OIF veterans (1 woman and 8 men) indicated they had received feedback for risky alcohol consumption. Participants generally liked the standard-drinks image, alcohol-related caloric and monetary feedback, and the website's brevity and anonymity (a priori domains). They also experienced challenges with portions of the e-SBI assessment and viewed feedback regarding alcohol risk and normative drinking as problematic, but described potential benefits derived from the e-SBI (emergent domains). The most appealing e-SBIs would ensure anonymity and provide personalized transparent feedback about alcohol-related risk, consideration of the context for drinking, strategies to reduce drinking, and additional resources for veterans with more severe alcohol misuse. Results of this qualitative exploratory study suggest e-SBI may be an acceptable strategy for increasing OEF/OIF veteran access to evidenced-based alcohol SBI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Patients with untreated substance use disorders (SUDs) are at risk for frequent emergency department visits and repeated hospitalizations. Project Engage, a US pilot program at Wilmington Hospital in Delaware, was conducted to facilitate entry of these patients to SUD treatment after discharge. Patients identified as having hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption based on results of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Primary Care (AUDIT-PC), administered to all patients at admission, received bedside assessment with motivational interviewing and facilitated referral to treatment by a patient engagement specialist (PES). This program evaluation provides descriptive information on self-reported rates of SUD treatment initiation of all patients and health-care utilization and costs for a subset of patients. Methods Program-level data on treatment entry after discharge were examined retrospectively. Insurance claims data for two small cohorts who entered treatment after discharge (2009, n = 18, and 2010, n = 25) were reviewed over a six-month period in 2009 (three months pre- and post-Project Engage), or over a 12-month period in 2010 (six months pre- and post-Project Engage). These data provided descriptive information on health-care utilization and costs. (Data on those who participated in Project Engage but did not enter treatment were unavailable). Results Between September 1, 2008, and December 30, 2010, 415 patients participated in Project Engage, and 180 (43%) were admitted for SUD treatment. For a small cohort who participated between June 1, 2009, and November 30, 2009 (n = 18), insurance claims demonstrated a 33% ($35,938) decrease in inpatient medical admissions, a 38% ($4,248) decrease in emergency department visits, a 42% ($1,579) increase in behavioral health/substance abuse (BH/SA) inpatient admissions, and a 33% ($847) increase in outpatient BH/SA admissions, for an overall decrease of $37,760. For a small cohort who participated between June 1, 2010, and November 30, 2010 (n = 25), claims demonstrated a 58% ($68,422) decrease in inpatient medical admissions; a 13% ($3,308) decrease in emergency department visits; a 32% ($18,119) decrease in BH/SA inpatient admissions, and a 32% ($963) increase in outpatient BH/SA admissions, for an overall decrease of $88,886. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that a large percentage of patients entered SUD treatment after participating in Project Engage, a novel intervention with facilitated referral to treatment. Although the findings are limited by the retrospective nature of the data and the small sample sizes, they do suggest a potentially cost-effective addition to existing hospital services if replicated in prospective studies with larger samples and controls.",

    "abstract": "The study objective was to assess the feasibility of a computerized alcohol-screening interview (CASI) program to identify at-risk alcohol users among adult emergency department (ED) patients. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a computerized screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) program within a busy urban ED setting, to report on accurate deployment of alcohol screening results, and to assess comprehension and satisfaction with CASI from both patient and research staff perspectives. Research assistants (RAs) screened a convenience sample of medically stable ED patients. The RAs brought CASI to patients' bedsides, and patients entered their own alcohol consumption data. The CASI intervention consisted of an alcohol use screening identification test, a personalized normative feedback profile, NIAAA low-risk drinking educational materials, and treatment referrals (when indicated). Five hundred seventeen patients were enrolled. The median age of participants was 37 years (range, 21-85 years); 37% were men, 62% were Hispanic, 7% were Caucasian, 30% were African American, and 2% were multiracial. Eighty percent reported regular use of computers at home. Eighty percent of patients approached consented to participate, and 99% of those who started CASI were able to complete it. Two percent of interviews were interrupted for medical tests and procedures, however, no patients required breaks from using CASI for not feeling well. The CASI program accurately provided alcohol risk education to patients 100% of the time. Thirty-two percent of patients in the sample screened positive for at-risk drinking. Sixty percent of patients reported that CASI increased their knowledge of safe drinking limits, 39% reported some likeliness to change their alcohol use, and 28% reported some intention to consult a health care professional about their alcohol use as a result of their screening results. Ninety-three percent reported CASI was easy to use, 93% felt comfortable receiving alcohol education via computer, and 89% liked using CASI. Ninety percent of patients correctly identified their alcohol risk level after participating in CASI. With regard to research staff experience, RAs needed to provide standby assistance to patients during <1% of CASI administrations and needed to troubleshoot computer issues in 4% of interviews. The RAs distributed the correct alcohol risk normative profiles to patients 97% of the time and provided patients with treatment referrals when indicated 81% of the time. The RAs rated patients as \"not bothered at all\" by using CASI 94% of the time. This study demonstrates that an ED-based computerized alcohol screening program is both acceptable to patients and effective in educating patients about their alcohol risk level. Additionally, this study demonstrates that few logistical problems related to using computers for these interventions were experienced by research staff: in most cases, staff accurately deployed alcohol risk education to patients, and in all cases, the computer provided accurate education to patients. Computer-assisted SBIRT may represent a significant time-saving measure, allowing EDs to reach larger numbers of patients for alcohol intervention without causing undue clinical burden or interruptions to clinical care. Future studies with follow-up are needed to replicate these results and assess drinking reductions post-intervention.",

    "abstract": "One of the pressing concerns in health care today is the slow rate at which promising interventions, supported by research evidence, move into clinical practice. One potential way to speed this process is to conduct hybrid studies that simultaneously combine the collection of effectiveness and implementation relevant data. This paper presents implementation relevant data collected during a randomized effectiveness trial of an abstinence incentive intervention conducted in substance use disorders treatment clinics at two Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical centers. Participants included patients entering substance use disorders treatment with diagnoses of alcohol dependence and/or stimulant dependence that enrolled in the randomized trial, were assigned to the intervention arm, and completed a post intervention survey (n = 147). All staff and leadership from the participating clinics were eligible to participate. A descriptive process evaluation was used, focused on participant perceptions and contextual/feasibility issues. Data collection was guided by the RE-AIM and PARIHS implementation frameworks. Data collection methods included chart review, intervention cost tracking, patient and staff surveys, and qualitative interviews with staff and administrators. Results indicated that patients, staff and administrators held generally positive attitudes toward the incentive intervention. However, staff and administrators identified substantial barriers to routine implementation. Despite the documented low cost and modest staff time required for implementation of the intervention, securing funding for the incentives and freeing up any staff time for intervention administration were identified as primary barriers. Recommendations to facilitate implementation are presented. Recommendations include: 1) solicit explicit support from the highest levels of the organization through, for example, performance measures or clinical practice guideline recommendations; 2) adopt the intervention incrementally starting within a specific treatment track or clinic to reduce staff and funding burden until local evidence of effectiveness and feasibility is available to support spread; and 3) educate staff about the process, goals, and value/effectiveness of the intervention and engage them in implementation planning from the start to enhance investment in the intervention.",

    "abstract": "The extent of damage in New York City following Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 was unprecedented. Bellevue Hospital Center (BHC), a tertiary public hospital, was evacuated and temporarily closed as a result of hurricane-related damages. BHC's large primary care office-based buprenorphine clinic was relocated to an affiliate public hospital for three weeks. The extent of environmental damage and ensuing service disruption effects on rates of illicit drug, tobacco, and alcohol misuse, buprenorphine medication supply disruptions, or direct resource losses among office-based buprenorphine patients is to date unknown.A quantitative and qualitative semi-structured survey was administered to patients in BHC's primary care buprenorphine program starting one month after the hurricane. Survey domains included: housing and employment disruptions; social and economic support; treatment outcomes (buprenorphine adherence and ability to get care), and tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. Open-ended questions probed general patient experiences related to the storm, coping strategies, and associated disruptions.There were 132 patients enrolled in the clinic at the time of the storm; of those, 91 patients were recruited to the survey, and 89 completed (98% of those invited). Illicit opioid misuse was rare, with 7 respondents reporting increased heroin or illicit prescription opioid use following Sandy. Roughly half of respondents reported disruption of their buprenorphine-naloxone medication supply post-event, and self-lowering of daily doses to prolong supply was common. Additional buprenorphine was obtained through unscheduled telephone or written refills from relocated Bellevue providers, informally from friends and family, and, more rarely, from drug dealers.The findings highlight the relative adaptability of public sector office-based buprenorphine treatment during and after a significant natural disaster. Only minimal increases in self-reported substance use were reported despite many disruptions to regular buprenorphine supplies and previous daily doses. Informal supplies of substitute buprenorphine from family and friends was common. Remote telephone refill support and a temporary back-up location that provided written prescription refills and medication dispensing for uninsured patients enabled some patients to maintain an adequate medication supply. Such adaptive strategies to ensure medication maintenance continuity pre/post natural disasters likely minimize poor treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In order to monitor and ultimately improve the quality of addiction treatment, professional societies, health care systems, and addiction treatment programs must establish clinical practice standards and then operationalize these standards into reliable, valid, and feasible quality measures. Before being implemented, quality measures should undergo tests of validity, including predictive validity. Predictive validity refers to the association between process-of-care quality measures and subsequent patient outcomes. This study evaluated the predictive validity of two process quality measures of residential substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Washington Circle (WC) Continuity of Care quality measure is the proportion of patients having an outpatient SUD treatment encounter within 14 days after discharge from residential SUD treatment. The Early Discharge measure is the proportion of patients admitted to residential SUD treatment who discharged within 1 week of admission. The predictive validity of these process measures was evaluated in US Veterans Health Administration patients for whom utilization-based outcome and 2-year mortality data were available. Propensity score-weighted, mixed effects regression adjusted for pre-index imbalances between patients who did and did not meet the measures' criteria and clustering of patients within facilities. For the WC Continuity of Care measure, 76 % of 10,064 patients had a follow-up visit within 14 days of discharge. In propensity score-weighted models, patients who had a follow-up visit had a lower 2-year mortality rate [odds ratio (OR) = 0.77, p = 0.008], but no difference in subsequent detoxification episodes relative to patients without a follow-up visit. For the Early Discharge measure, 9.6 % of 10,176 discharged early and had significantly higher 2-year mortality (OR = 1.49, p < 0.001) and more subsequent detoxification episodes. These two measures of residential SUD treatment quality have strong associations with 2-year mortality and the Early Discharge measure is also associated with more subsequent detoxification episodes. These results provide initial support for the predictive validity of residential SUD treatment quality measures and represent the first time that any SUD quality measure has been shown to predict subsequent mortality.",

Women's Initiative Supporting Health Transitions Clinic (WISH-TC) is a primary care program that facilitates treatment access for re-entering women. Strategies include support and navigation assistance from peer community health workers. Thirteen participants, of whom 11 had a substance use disorder, completed semi-structured interviews about their experiences in WISH-TC as part of a process evaluation. We conducted a qualitative framework analysis informed by self-determination theory. WISH-TC supported autonomy as staff helped motivate women to work toward personal health goals. Women were empowered to have their health needs met, and consequently, prioritized attending clinic. Regarding competence, WISH-TC built upon women's existing knowledge to increase their health literacy and better understand their individual health needs. Relatedness support, both prior to re-entry and ongoing with clinic staff, was key in women's satisfaction with their care. The clinic made procedural changes in response to the interviews, including providing orientation for the patients and training the clinic in trauma-informed practices. Our findings highlight the potential of a program for re-entering women, including those with substance use disorders to strengthen their abilities to navigate complex healthcare and societal systems.

The aim of this study is to investigate the help-seeking motives among users of an internet-based service for problematic alcohol use, as well as the users' experiences of the support available through the service.The study consists of a thematic analysis of interviews with 38 former users of the internet-based intervention Alkoholhjälpen.The analysis shows that health and relationship factors, as well as feelings of shame, were important motives for the users' decisions to reduce their drinking. Availability and anonymity seem to have been important reasons for choosing internet-based support. The different treatment components, i.e. ICBT program, therapist support and discussion forum, were each perceived as helpful by some users but not by others. Treatment components were described as more useful when users were able to personally identify with the content, and when it helped them reflect on their own alcohol consumption.There are several aspects that are relevant, beyond the comparison between components, if we want to understand what works and for whom in internet-based treatment. Internet-based treatment services should be generous in terms of options for the users.",

Methods A double blinded randomized controlled trial with a parallel group design was conducted (intervention group n = 151, wait-list control group n = 152). Follow-up 12 weeks from treatment commencement of a 13-module intervention. The primary outcome was frequency of cannabis use. Time by group interaction effects were modeled using generalized estimated equations and the instrumental variable approach was used to estimate the effect of intervention adherence. Results At follow-up, the intention to treat (ITT) analyses did not show any significant time by group effects. A significant association between intervention adherence and scores on the cannabis abuse screening test (CAST) was found. Secondary analysis excluding participants who had received other professional help revealed time by group effects for secondary outcomes gram cannabis consumed past week, number of dependency criteria and CAST score.

Objectives To evaluate the frequency of CIWA-Ar monitoring among ICU patients with AWS and variation in CIWA-Ar monitoring across patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods The study included all adults admitted to an ICU in 2017 after treatment for AWS in the Emergency Department of an academic hospital that standardly uses the CIWA-Ar to assess AWS severity and response to treatment. Demographic and clinical data, including Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) assessments (an alternative measure of agitation/sedation), were obtained via chart review. Associations between patient characteristics and CIWA-Ar monitoring were tested using logistic regression. Results After treatment for AWS, only 56% (n = 54/97) of ICU patients were evaluated using the CIWA-Ar; 94% of patients had a documented RASS assessment (n = 91/97). Patients were significantly less likely to receive CIWA-Ar monitoring if they were intubated or identified as Black. Conclusions CIWA-Ar monitoring was used inconsistently in ICU patients with AWS and completed less often in those who were intubated or identified as Black. These hypothesis-generating findings raise questions about the utility of the CIWA-Ar in ICU settings. Future studies should assess alternative measures for titrating AWS medications in the ICU that do not require verbal responses from patients and further explore the association of race with AWS monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Opioid use disorder continues to be a significant problem in the United States and worldwide. Three medications—methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release injectable naltrexone,— are efficacious for treating opioid use disorder (OUD). However, the utility of these medications is limited, in part due to poor rates of retention in treatment. In addition, minimum recovery milestones and other factors that influence when and whether individuals can safely discontinue medications are unknown. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) study “Optimizing Retention, Duration, and Discontinuation Strategies for Opioid Use Disorder Pharmacotherapy” (RDD; CTN-0100) will be among the largest clinical trials on treatment of OUD yet conducted, consisting of two phases, the Retention phase, and the Duration-Discontinuation phase. The Retention phase, open to patients initiating treatment, will test different doses and formulations of buprenorphine (standard dose sublingual, high dose sublingual, or extended-release injection), and a digital therapeutic app delivering contingency management and cognitive behavioral counseling on the primary outcome of retention in treatment. The Discontinuation phase, open to patients in stable remission from OUD and choosing to discontinue medication (including participants from the Retention phase or from the population of patients treated at the clinical site, referred by an outside prescriber or self-referred) will study different tapering strategies for buprenorphine (sublingual taper vs taper with injection buprenorphine), and a digital therapeutic app which provides resources to promote recovery, on the primary outcome of relapse-free discontinuation of medication. This paper describes how the RDD trial derives from two decades of research in the CTN. Initial trials (CTN-0001; CTN-0002; CTN-0003) focused on opioid detoxification, showing buprenorphine-naloxone was effective for detoxification, but that acute detoxification did not appear to be an effective treatment strategy. Trials on comparative effectiveness of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (CTN-0027; CTN-0030; and CTN-0051) highlighted the problem of dropout from treatment and few trials defined retention on MOUD as the primary outcome. Long-term follow-up studies on those patient samples demonstrated the importance of long-term continuation of medication for many patients to sustain remission. Overall, these trials highlight the potential of a stable research infrastructure such as CTN to advance treatment effectiveness through a programmatic succession of large clinical trials.",

However, marijuana co-exposure in polysubstance-using women is not well described. Methods The well-characterized ENRICH-1 cohort (n = 251), which focused on the effects of two primary exposures of interest—opioids and alcohol, was used to (1) estimate the prevalence/frequency of marijuana use in those with OUD and/or alcohol use, and (2) examined correlates of marijuana use. Participants were classified into an OUD group (n = 125), Alcohol group (n = 69), and concurrent OUD and Alcohol (OUD + Alcohol) group (n = 57). Self-report and biomarkers ascertained substance use. Multivariable logistic regression identified correlates of marijuana use. Results The prevalence of any marijuana use in pregnancy was 43.2%, 52.6%, and 46.4% in the OUD, OUD + Alcohol, and Alcohol groups, respectively. Correspondingly, weekly or daily use was reported by 19.4%, 21.0%, and 24.6% of participants. In the OUD and OUD + Alcohol groups, the proportion of women using marijuana was significantly higher in those taking buprenorphine (45.8% and 58.3%, respectively) compared to women using methadone (37.5% and 42.9%, respectively). Mean maternal age was lower in women who used marijuana in all three groups compared to non-marijuana users. Independent correlates of marijuana use (controlling for group, race/ethnicity, education, and smoking) were maternal age (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) per 5-year increment 0.61; (95% CI 0.47, 0.79)), and polysubstance use (aOR 2.02; 95% CI 1.11, 3.67). There was a significant interaction between partnership status and group: among women who were not in a partnership, those in the OUD and OUD + Alcohol groups had lower odds of marijuana use relative to the Alcohol group. For women in the Alcohol group, partnered women had lower odds of marijuana use than un-partnered women (aOR 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.68). Conclusions Results indicate a relatively high prevalence and frequency of marijuana use in pregnant women being treated for OUD and/or women consuming alcohol while pregnant. These results highlight the need for ongoing risk reduction strategies addressing marijuana use for pregnant women receiving OUD treatment and those with alcohol exposure.",

Barriers to accessing OAT such as lack of transportation, in-person induction requirements, employment demands and limited childcare options reduce treatment opportunities for clients. A completely virtual model of care has been developed in Alberta, Canada. This paper introduces the unique virtual clinic model and describes outcomes from that model. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted using datasets within existing electronic health records and databases from Alberta’s Virtual Opioid Dependency Program (VODP). Outcome data were extracted at admission to ongoing care by Case Management within the VODP and at 3, 6 and 12 months for the duration of treatment. Utilization trends over three years were analyzed, including admissions, discharges and active client information. Data regarding clinical outcomes for clients engaged in ongoing care with the VODP were aggregated for analysis over four time periods, including treatment retention rates at 6 and 12 months. Results A total of 440 client records were included in the study sample. Descriptive analysis showed rapid growth in utilization over three fiscal years. Despite rapid growth in utilization, median wait days for treatment decreased from 6 to 0 days with the initiation of a Same Day Start service to support low barrier immediate access to treatment. Treatment retention rates for clients in ongoing care were comparable to published reports, with 90% of the study sample remaining in treatment over 6 months, and 58% showing retention over 12 months. Clients reported high levels of satisfaction (90%) and outcomes reflected reductions in drug use and overdose as well as improved social functioning. Conclusions The VODP model demonstrated high levels of client satisfaction, rapid growth in utilization and positive preliminary clinical outcomes. Entirely virtual delivery of opioid agonist therapy is a promising option to facilitate access to evidence based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) in the context of a fentanyl overdose crisis, particularly for individuals living in rural or underserved areas.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to address the current opioid epidemic, a number of hospitals across the United States have implemented emergency department-based interventions for engaging patients presenting with opioid use disorder. The current study seeks to address gaps in knowledge regarding implementation of a sub-type of such interventions, emergency department-based peer support services, in rural areas by comparing implementation of rural and urban programs that participated in Indiana's Recovery Coach and Peer Support Initiative (RCPSI).We conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative semi-structured implementation interviews collected as part of an evaluation of 10 programs (4 rural and 6 urban) participating in the RCPSI. We conducted interviews with representatives from each program at 3 time points over the course of the first year of implementation. Our deductive coding process was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and an external context taxonomy.We identified key differences for rural programs corresponding to each of the 5 primary constructs in the coding scheme. (1) Intervention characteristics: rural sites questioned intervention fit with their context, required more adaptations, and encountered unexpected costs. (2) External context: rural sites were not appropriately staffed to meet patient needs, encountered logistical and legal barriers regarding patient privacy, and had limited patient transportation options. (3) Inner setting: rural sites lacked strong mechanisms for internal communication and difficulties integrating with pre-existing culture and climate. (4) Characteristics of individuals: some rural providers resisted working with peers due to pre-existing attitudes and beliefs. (5) Implementation process: rural sites spent more time identifying external partners and abandoned more components of their initial implementation plans.Findings demonstrate how rural programs faced greater challenges implementing emergency department-based peer services over time. These challenges required flexible adaptations to originally intended plans. Rural programs likely require flexibility to adapt interventions that were developed in urban settings to ensure success considering local contextual constraints that were identified by our analysis.",

    "abstract": "Youth, 18 to 24 years, experiencing homelessness (YEH) are recognized as having developmental challenges dissimilar to older adults. Yet, research on efforts to end homelessness and prevent or intervene in drug use and mental health problems among youth have lagged behind that of adults. The Housing First (HF) Model which underlies Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) and Rapid Re-Housing (RRH) has become preferred over treatment-first models.We provide an overview of PSH and RRH studies to date and summarize our current understanding of their utility for use with YEH. Finally, we review our team's current and past randomized trials testing RRH with YEH, providing lessons learned and recommendations.Current research efforts to guide best practices are hampered by a lack of fidelity to HF principles, lack of randomized design, and lack of focus on youth. Lessons learned and recommendations from our work are offered to facilitate the future work of those who seek to end homelessness and address drug use and mental health problems among youth.",

    "abstract": "Tent encampments in the neighborhood surrounding Boston Medical Center (BMC) grew to include 336 individuals at points between 2019 and 21, prompting public health concerns. BMC, the City of Boston, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts partnered in 2/2022 to offer low-barrier transitional housing to encampment residents and provide co-located clinical stabilization services for community members with substance use disorders (SUDs) experiencing homelessness.To meet the needs of some of the people who had been living in encampments, BMC established in a former hotel: 60 beds of transitional housing, not contingent upon sobriety; and a low-barrier SUD-focused clinic for both housing residents and community members, offering walk-in urgent care, SUD medications, and infection screening/prevention; and a 24/7 short-stay stabilization unit to manage over-intoxication, withdrawal, and complications of substance use (e.g., abscesses, HIV risk, psychosis). A secure medication-dispensing cabinet allows methadone administration for withdrawal management. Housing program key metrics include retention in housing, transition to permanent housing, and engagement in SUD treatment and case management. Clinical program key metrics include patient volume, and rates of initiation of medication for opioid use disorder.Housing: Between 2/1/22-1/31/2023, 100 people entered the low-barrier transitional housing (new residents admitted as people transitioned out); 50 former encampment residents and 50 unhoused people referred by Boston Public Health Commission. Twenty-five residents transferred to permanent housing, eight administratively discharged, four incarcerated, and four died (two overdoses, two other substance-related). The remaining 59 residents remain housed; none voluntarily returned to homelessness. One hundred residents (100%) engaged with case management, and 49 engaged with SUD treatment.In the first 12 months, 1722 patients (drawn from both the housing program and community) had 7468 clinical visits. The most common SUDs were opioid (84%), cocaine (54%) and alcohol (47%) and 61% of patients had a co-occurring mental health diagnosis in the preceding 24-months. 566 (33%) patients were started on methadone and accepted at an Opioid Treatment Program (OTP).During the 1st year of operation, low-barrier transitional housing plus clinical stabilization care was a feasible and acceptable model for former encampment residents, 49% of whom engaged with SUD treatment, and 25% of whom transitioned to permanent housing.",

The availability of low-cost, sustainable interventions that maximize medication adherence would likely lead to improved treatment outcomes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are increasingly being adopted as a method of delivering behavioral health interventions and represent a promising tool for adherence interventions. We are evaluating a cell-phone–based intervention called AGATE that seeks to enhance adherence with regular text-messaging. A randomized controlled effectiveness trial in the context of an eight-week open label naltrexone efficacy trial delivered in a naturalistic clinical setting. Treatment-seeking heavy drinkers (N = 105) are currently being recruited and randomly assigned to the AGATE intervention or a control condition. Daily measures of alcohol use and medication side effects are being recorded via cell phone in both conditions. Additionally, participants randomized to the AGATE condition receive medication reminders via SMS text message according to a schedule that adjusts according to their level of adherence. Results from this trial will provide initial information about the feasibility and efficacy of mHealth interventions for improving adherence to alcohol pharmacotherapies. NCT01349985.",

We developed a quality-improvement tracking system at an urban methadone clinic to monitor patients along the HIV care continuum and identify patients needing intervention.To evaluate patient outcomes along the HIV Care Continuum at an urban methadone clinic and explore the relationship of HIV primary care site and patient demographic characteristics with retention in HIV treatment and viral suppression.We reviewed electronic medical record data from 2015 for all methadone clinic patients with known HIV disease, including age, gender, race, HIV care sites, HIV care visit dates and HIV viral load. Patients received either HIV primary care at the methadone clinic, an HIV specialty clinic located in the adjacent building, or a community clinic. Retention was defined as an HIV primary care visit in both halves of the year. Viral suppression was defined as an HIV viral load <40 copies/ml at the last lab draw.The population (n = 65) was 63% male, 82% age 45 or older and 60% non-Caucasian. Of these 65 patients 77% (n = 50) were retained in care and 80% (n = 52) were virologically suppressed. Viral suppression was significantly higher for women (p = .022) and patients 45 years or older (p = .034). There was a trend towards greater retention in care and viral suppression among patients receiving HIV care at the methadone clinic (93, 93%) compared to the HIV clinic (74, 79%) or community clinics (62, 62%).Retention in HIV care and viral suppression are high in an urban methadone clinic providing integrated HIV services. This quality improvement analysis supports integrating HIV primary care with methadone treatment services for this at-risk population.",

    "abstract": "Patient-centered models of assessment have shown considerable promise for increasing patients' readiness for mental health treatment in general, but have not been used to facilitate patients' engagement in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. We developed a brief patient-centered intervention using assessment and feedback of personality data and examined its acceptability and efficacy to increase early engagement in residential SUD treatment.Thirty patients entering a 90-day residential SUD treatment program were randomly assigned to a feedback (n = 17) or control (n = 13; assessment-only) condition. Normal-range personality was assessed with the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R). Patients were re-interviewed one month after treatment entry to obtain information on their satisfaction with the intervention, as well as their adjustment to the residential milieu. Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain information on patients' length of stay in the program and discharge status. Univariate ANOVAs and chi-square tests were conducted to examine group differences on outcomes.Patients' ratings indicated strong satisfaction with the feedback intervention and expectations that it would have a positive impact on their treatment experiences. Among patients who had not previously been treated in the residential program, the feedback intervention was associated with more positive relationships with other residents in treatment and a stronger alliance with the treatment program one month after treatment entry. The feedback intervention was also associated with a longer length of stay in treatment, although this effect did not reach statistical significance.The findings highlight the clinical utility of providing SUD patients with patient-centered feedback based on the results of personality testing, and provide preliminary support for the acceptability and efficacy of this intervention to facilitate early engagement in residential SUD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Although opioid-agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone is currently the mainstay of medical treatment for opioid use disorder, these medications often are not well accepted or tolerated by patients. Recently, extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist, has been advanced as an alternative treatment. The willingness of opioid-addicted patients to take XR-NTX has not been well described. Opioid-using persons enrolled in a community-recruited cohort in Vancouver, Canada, were asked whether or not they would be willing to take XR-NTX. Logistic regression was used to independently identify factors associated with willingness to take the medication. Among the 657 participants surveyed between June 1, 2013, and November 30, 2013, 342 (52.1%) were willing to take XR-NTX. One factor positively associated with willingness was daily heroin injection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–2.31), whereas Caucasian ethnicity was negatively associated (AOR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.43–0.82). Satisfaction with agonist therapy (13.4%) and unwillingness to stop opioids being used for pain (26.9%) were the most common reasons for being unwilling to take XR-NTX. A high level of willingness to take XR-NTX was observed in this setting. Interestingly, daily injection heroin use was positively associated with willingness, whereas Caucasian participants were less willing to take XR-NTX. Although explanations for unwillingness were described in this study, further research is needed to investigate real-world acceptability of XR-NTX as an additional option for the treatment of opioid use disorder.",

    "abstract": "Homelessness, substance use, and mental disorders each have been associated with higher rates of emergency department (ED) use and hospitalization. We sought to understand the correlation between ED use, hospital admission, and substance dependence among homeless individuals with concurrent mental illness who participated in a 'Housing First' (HF) intervention trial. The Vancouver At Home study consisted of two randomized controlled trials addressing homeless individuals with mental disorders who have \"high\" or \"moderate\" levels of need. Substance dependence was determined at baseline prior to randomization, using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview diagnostic tool, version 6.0. To assess health service use, we reviewed the number of ED visits and the number of hospital admissions based on administrative data for six urban hospitals. Negative binomial regression modeling was used to test the independent association between substance dependence and health service use (ED use and hospitalization), adjusting for HF intervention, age, gender, ethnicity, education, duration of lifetime homelessness, mental disorders, chronic health conditions, and other variables that were selected a priori to be potentially associated with use of ED services and hospital admission. Of the 497 homeless adults with mental disorders who were recruited, we included 381 participants in our analyses who had at least 1 year of follow-up and had a personal health number that could be linked to administrative health data. Of this group, 59% (n = 223) met criteria for substance dependence. We found no independent association between substance dependence and ED visits or hospital admissions [rate ratio (RR) = 0.85; 95% CI 0.62–1.17 and RR = 1.21; 95% CI 0.83–1.77, respectively]. The most responsible diagnoses (defined as the diagnosis that accounts for the length of stay) for hospital admissions were schizo-affective disorder, schizophrenia-related disorder, or bipolar affective disorder; collectively reported in 48% (n = 263) of admissions. Fifteen percent (n = 84) of hospital admissions listed substance dependence as the most responsible diagnosis. Substance dependence was not independently associated with ED use or hospital admission among homeless adults with mental disorders participating in an HF trial. Hospital admissions among this cohort were primarily associated with severe mental disorders. Trial registration: ISRCTN57595077 and ISRCTN66721740",

    "abstract": "Although progress in science has driven advances in addiction medicine, this subject has not been adequately taught to medical trainees and physicians. As a result, there has been poor integration of evidence-based practices in addiction medicine into physician training which has impeded addiction treatment and care. Recently, a number of training initiatives have emerged internationally, including the addiction medicine fellowships in Vancouver, Canada. This study was undertaken to examine barriers and facilitators of implementing addiction medicine fellowships. We interviewed trainees and faculty from clinical and research training programmes in addiction medicine at St Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, Canada (N = 26) about barriers and facilitators to implementation of physician training in addiction medicine. We included medical students, residents, fellows and supervising physicians from a variety of specialities. We analysed interview transcripts thematically by using NVivo software. We identified six domains relating to training implementation: (1) organisational, (2) structural, (3) teacher, (4) learner, (5) patient and (6) community related variables either hindered or fostered addiction medicine education, depending on context. Human resources, variety of rotations, peer support and mentoring fostered implementation of addiction training. Money, time and space limitations hindered implementation. Participant accounts underscored how faculty and staff facilitated the implementation of both the clinical and the research training. Implementation of addiction medicine fellowships appears feasible, although a number of barriers exist. Research into factors within the local/practice environment that shape delivery of education to ensure consistent and quality education scale-up is a priority.",

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine (MA) is a highly addictive psychostimulant used by approximately 52 million people worldwide. Chronic MA abuse leads to detrimental physiological and neurological changes, as well as increases in anxiety and depression, and decreases in overall fitness and quality of life. Exercise has been reported to possibly reverse physiological and neurological damage caused by previous MA use, and to reduce anxiety and depression in this population. The aim of this systematic review was to identify, clinically appraise and synthesise the available evidence for the effectiveness of exercise, compared to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), standard care or no intervention, on decreasing anxiety and depression and improving fitness and quality of life in previous MA users. Seven computerised databases were searched from inception to May 2017, namely Scopus, Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE, PEDro, CINAHL, and ScienceDirect. Search terms included exercise, methamphetamine, fitness measures, depression, anxiety and quality of life. Randomised and non-randomised controlled- or clinical trials and pilot studies, published in English, were considered for inclusion. Methodological quality was critically appraised according to the PEDro scale. Heterogeneity across studies regarding control groups and assessment intervals rendered meta analyses inappropriate for this review and results were thus described narratively using text and tables. Two hundred and fifty-one titles were identified following the initial search, and 14 potentially-relevant titles were selected and the abstracts reviewed. Three studies (two randomised controlled trials and one quasi-experimental pilot) were included, with an average PEDro score of 6.66. Exercise resulted in significantly lower depression and anxiety scores versus CBT (p = 0.001). Balance also significantly improved following exercise versus standard care (p < 0.001); as did vital capacity, hand-grip and one-leg stand with eyes closed. There were significant changes in all subdivisions of the Quality of Life Scale Questionnaire (p < 0.05), except psychology (p = 0.227). Level II evidence suggests that exercise is effective in reducing anxiety and depression and improving fitness in previous MA users, and Level III-2 evidence suggests that exercise is beneficial for improving quality of life in this population. Overall recovery in previous MA dependents might be significantly enhanced by including exercise in the rehabilitation process. Further research is required to strengthen these conclusions and to inform policy and health systems effectively.",

    "abstract": "The heritability of opioid use disorder has been widely investigated; however, the influence of specific genes on methadone treatment outcomes is not well understood. The association between response to methadone treatment and genes that are involved in substance use behaviors and reward mechanisms is poorly understood, despite evidence suggesting their contribution to opioid use disorder. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) polymorphisms on continued opioid use among patients on methadone treatment for opioid use disorder. BDNF 196G>A (rs6265) and DRD2-241A>G (rs1799978) genetic variants were examined in patients with opioid use disorder who were recruited from methadone treatment clinics across Southern Ontario, Canada. We collected demographic information, substance use history, blood for genetic analysis, and urine to measure opioid use. We used regression analysis to examine the association between continued opioid use and genetic variants, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, methadone dose, duration in treatment, and number of urine screens. Among 240 patients treated with methadone for opioid use disorder, 36.3 percent (n = 87) and 11.3 percent (n = 27) had at least one risk allele for rs6265 and rs1799978, respectively. These genetic variants were not significantly associated with continued opioid use while on methadone maintenance treatment [rs6265: odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.792, 2.371, p = 0.264; rs1799978: OR 1.27, 95 % CI 0.511, 3.182, p = 0.603]. Despite an association of BDNF rs6265 and DRD2 rs1799978 with addictive behaviors, these variants were not associated with continued illicit opioid use in patients treated with methadone. Problematic use of opioids throughout treatment with methadone may be attributed to nongenetic factors or a polygenic effect requiring further exploration. Additional research should focus on investigating these findings in larger samples and different populations.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary studies about HIV care continuum (HCC) outcomes within substance using populations primarily focus on individual risk factors rather than provider- or systems-level influences. Over 25% of people living with HIV (PLWH) have substance use disorders that can alter their path through the HCC. As part of a study of HCC outcomes in nine small cities in Southern New England (population 100,000–200,000 and relatively high HIV prevalence particularly among substance users), this qualitative analysis sought to understand public health staff and HIV service providers' perspectives on how substance use may influence HCC outcomes. Interviews with 49 participants, collected between November 2015 and June 2016, were analyzed thematically using a modified social ecological model as the conceptual framework and codes for substance use, HCC barriers and facilitators, successes and failures of initiatives targeting the HCC, and criminal justice issues. Eight themes were identified concerning the impact of substance use on HCC outcomes. At the individual level, these included coping and satisfying basic needs and could influence all HCC steps (i.e., testing, treatment linkage, adherence, and retention, and viral load suppression). The interpersonal level themes included stigma issues and providers' cultural competence and treatment attitudes and primarily influenced treatment linkage, retention, and viral load suppression. These same HCC steps were influenced at the health care systems level by organizations' physical environment and resources as well as intra-/inter-agency communication. Testing and retention were the most likely steps to affect at the policy/society level, and the themes included opposition within an organization or community, and activities with unintended consequences. The most substantial HCC challenges for PLWH with substance use problems included linking and retaining in treatment those with multiple co-morbidities and meeting their basic living needs. Recommendations to improve HCC outcomes for PLWH with substance use problems include increasing easy access to effective drug and mental health treatment, expanding case management and peer navigation services, training staff about harm reduction, de-stigmatizing, and culturally competent approaches to interacting with patients, and increasing information-sharing and service coordination among service providers and the social service and criminal justice systems.",

Although take-home naloxone and other measures have been an effective strategy to reduce overdoses, many events are unwitnessed and mortality remains high amongst those using drugs alone. While wearable devices that can detect and alert others of an overdose are being developed, willingness of people who use drugs to wear such a device has not been described. Drug using persons enrolled in a community-recruited cohort in Vancouver, Canada, were asked whether or not they would be willing to wear a device against their skin that would alert others in the event of an overdose. Logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with willingness to wear such a device. Among the 1061 participants surveyed between December 2017 and May 2018, 576 (54.3%) were willing to wear an overdose detection device. Factors independently associated with willingness included ever having overdosed (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–1.83), current methadone treatment (AOR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.45–2.40), female gender AOR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.09–1.84) and a history of chronic pain (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.19–1.96). Whereas homelessness (AOR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.50–0.91) was negatively associated with willingness. A high level of willingness to wear an overdose detection device was observed in this setting and a range of factors associated with overdose were positively associated with willingness. Since some factors, such as homelessness may be a barrier, further research is needed to investigate explanations for unwillingness and to evaluate real world acceptability of a wearable overdose detection devices as this technology becomes available.",

Cost-effective strategies are needed to inform and engage this group into effective cessation treatments. We developed a novel, web-based, motivational, decision-support system that was designed to engage disadvantaged smokers into tobacco cessation treatment. We piloted the system among smokers in a primary care safety net clinic.Thirty-nine eligible subjects were assessed at baseline and used the decision-support system; 38 were assessed 2 months later. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to assess whether participants who used the program were more likely to use cessation treatment than a randomly selected group of 60 clinic patients.Thirty-nine percent of smokers initiated cessation treatment after using the decision-support system, compared to 3 percent of the comparison group (Fisher's exact = 21.2; p = 0.000). Over 10 percent achieved continuous abstinence over the 2-month follow-up. Users were satisfied with the program - 100 percent stated they would recommend it to a friend.Our data indicate that this web-based, motivational, decision-support system is feasible, satisfactory, and promising in its ability to engage smokers into cessation treatment in a primary care safety net clinic.

We developed an interdisciplinary clinic embedded within primary care (the Opioid Reassessment Clinic—ORC) with the goal of improving the quality of care of patients with co-occurring chronic pain and issues related to opioid safety, efficacy and/or misuse. We present three cases referred to the ORC that highlight complex clinical scenarios related to assessment and treatment of patients with chronic pain and issues related to opioid safety, efficacy and misuse. In the context of the three cases, with respect to assessment, we discuss: making the diagnosis of opioid use disorder; allowing the patient space to endorse lack of efficacy; identification of co-occurring hazardous alcohol use; and recognizing barriers to multimodal pain care. With respect to treatment, we discuss: making a change in treatment with which the patient may not agree; effectiveness of buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of chronic pain; responding to low efficacy; and making continued opioid therapy contingent on engagement with substance abuse treatment. The core components of our approach—biopsychosocial assessment and multimodal treatment planning with an emphasis on promoting functional goals and safety using clear communication and a patient-centered stance—should guide providers in the management of similar clinical scenarios. More evidence is needed to definitively guide specific interventions and points of clinical equipoise.",

This association varies by race/ethnicity among general outpatients, but racial/ethnic variation has not been investigated among PLWH, among whom racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented. VA electronic health record data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (2008–2012) were used to describe and compare mortality rates across race/ethnicity and levels of alcohol use defined by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) questionnaire. Within each racial/ethnic group, Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, disease severity, and comorbidities, compared mortality risk for moderate-risk (AUDIT-C = 4–7) and high-risk (AUDIT-C ≥ 8) relative to lower-risk (AUDIT-C = 1–3) alcohol use. Mean follow-up time among black (n = 8518), Hispanic (n = 1353), and white (n = 7368) male PLWH with documented AUDIT-C screening (n = 17,239) was 4.3 years. Black PLWH had the highest mortality rate among patients reporting lower-risk alcohol use (2.9/100 person-years) relative to Hispanic and white PLWH (1.8 and 2.3, respectively) (p value for overall comparison = 0.011). Mortality risk was increased for patients reporting high-risk relative to lower-risk alcohol use in all racial/ethnic groups [black adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12–1.66; Hispanic AHR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.30–3.64; and white AHR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.61–2.58].

Among all PLWH, mortality risk was increased among patients reporting high-risk alcohol use across all racial/ethnic groups, but mortality risk was only increased among patients reporting moderate-risk relative to lower-risk alcohol use among white PLWH, and black patients appeared to have higher mortality risk relative to white patients at lower-risk levels of alcohol use. Findings of the present study further underscore the need to address unhealthy alcohol use among PLWH, and future research is needed to understand mechanisms underlying observed differences.",

Accordingly, screening with the 3-item AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test—Consumption) tool has become a national key performance indicator. Here we provide an overview of suitability of AUDIT-C and other brief alcohol screening tools for use in ACCHSs. All peer-reviewed literature providing original data on validity, acceptability or feasibility of alcohol screening tools among Indigenous Australians was reviewed. Narrative synthesis was used to identify themes and integrate results. Three screening tools—full AUDIT, AUDIT-3 (third question of AUDIT) and CAGE (Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilty and Eye-opener) have been validated against other consumption measures, and found to correspond well. Short forms of AUDIT have also been found to compare well with full AUDIT, and were preferred by primary care staff. Help was often required with converting consumption into standard drinks. Researchers commented that AUDIT and its short forms prompted reflection on drinking. Another tool, the Indigenous Risk Impact Screen (IRIS), jointly screens for alcohol, drug and mental health risk, but is relatively long (13 items). IRIS has been validated against dependence scales. AUDIT, IRIS and CAGE have a greater focus on dependence than on hazardous or harmful consumption. Detection of unhealthy drinking before harms occur is a goal of screening, so AUDIT-C offers advantages over tools like IRIS or CAGE which focus on dependence. AUDIT-C's brevity suits integration with general health screening. Further research is needed on facilitating implementation of systematic alcohol screening into Indigenous primary healthcare.",

Despite this, access to methadone maintenance therapy and other evidence-based treatment options remains negligible. We aimed to assess retention, changes in substance use and quality of life after 6 months on methadone maintenance therapy provided through a low-threshold service in Durban, South Africa. Methods We enrolled a cohort of 54 people with an opioid use disorder into the study. We reviewed and described baseline socio-demographic characteristics. Baseline and 6-month substance use was assessed using the World Health Organization’s Alcohol Smoking and Substance Use Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) and quality of life, using the SF-12. We compared changes at 6 months on methadone to baseline using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and paired-tests for the ASSIST and SF-12 scores, respectively. McNemar’s test was used for comparisons between paired results of categorical variables relating to injecting frequency. Results The majority of the participants were young, Black African males, with a history of drug use spanning over 10 years. Retention after 6 months was 81%. After 6 months, the median heroin ASSIST score decreased from 37 to 9 (p &lt; 0.0001) and the cannabis ASSIST score increased from 12.5 to 21 (p = 0.0003). The median mental health composite score of the SF-12 increased from 41.4 to 48.7 (p = 0.0254). Conclusions Interim findings suggest high retention, significant reductions in heroin use and improvements in mental health among participants retained on methadone maintenance therapy for 6 months. Further research into longer term outcomes and the reasons contributing to these changes would strengthen recommendations for the scale-up of methadone maintenance therapy in South Africa.",

However, tobacco use among individuals with a history of criminal justice involvement has been understudied in the United States, and data are needed to inform policy and practice. We used data from the 2008–2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (unweighted N = 330,130) to examine trends in tobacco use, categories of tobacco use, characteristics of cigarette use, and health care utilization and tobacco use screening among individuals (aged 18–64) with and without a history of criminal justice involvement in the past year. We used multiple logistic and Poisson regression models with predictive margins to provide adjusted prevalence estimates. The weighted sample in each year was, on average, representative of 8,693,171 individuals with a history of criminal justice involvement in the past year and 182,817,228 individuals with no history of criminal justice involvement in the past year. Tobacco use was significantly more common among individuals with a history of criminal justice involvement compared with individuals with no criminal justice involvement, and disparities increased over time (Difference in adjusted relative differences: − 10.2% [95% CI − 17.7 to − 2.7]). In 2016, tobacco use prevalence was more than two times higher among individuals with a history of criminal justice involvement (62.9% [95% CI 59.9–66.0] vs. 27.6% [95% CI 26.9–28.3]). Individuals with a history of criminal justice involvement who smoked reported a significantly earlier age of cigarette initiation, more cigarettes used per day, and higher levels of nicotine dependence and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Individuals with a history of criminal justice involvement were less likely to report an outpatient medical visit in the past year and, among those reporting an outpatient medical visit, were less likely to be asked about tobacco use, but paradoxically, more likely to report being advised to quit. Novel programs and tobacco control policies are needed to address persistently high rates of tobacco use and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among individuals with a history of criminal justice involvement.",

    "abstract": "Treating severe emotional dysregulation and co-occurring substance misuse is challenging. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a comprehensive and evidence-based treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD). It has been hypothesised that the skills training, which is a facet of the full DBT programme, might be effective for people with severe emotional dysregulation and other co-occurring conditions, but who do not meet the criteria for BPD. However, there is limited research on standalone DBT skills training for people with substance misuse and emotional dysregulation.A mixed methods study employing an explanatory sequential design was conducted where participants with a dual diagnosis (n = 64) were recruited from a community-based public addiction treatment service in Ireland between March 2015 and January 2018. DBT therapists screened potential participants against the study eligibility criteria. Quantitative self-report measures examining emotion regulation, mindfulness, adaptive and maladaptive coping responses including substance misuse, and qualitative feedback from participants were collected. Quantitative data were summarised by their mean and standard deviation and multilevel linear mixed effects models were used to estimate the mean change from baseline to post-intervention and the 6-month follow-up period. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data.Quantitative results indicated reductions in binge drinking and use of Class A, B and C drug use from pre-intervention (T1) to the 6-month follow-up (T3). Additionally, significant improvements were noted for mindfulness practice and DBT skills use from T1 to T3 (p < 0.001). There were also significant reductions in dysfunctional coping and emotional dysregulation from T1 to T3 (p < 0.001). Significant differences were identified from pre to post intervention in reported substance use, p = 0.002. However, there were no significant differences between pre-intervention and 6-month follow up reports of substance use or at post-intervention to 6 month follow up. Qualitative findings indicated three superordinate themes in relation to participants' experiences of a DBT skills training programme, adapted from standard DBT: (1) new lease of life; (2) need for continued formal aftercare and (3) programme improvements. Participants described reductions in substance misuse, while having increased confidence to use the DBT skills they had learned in the programme to deal with difficult emotions and life stressors.This DBT skills training programme, adapted from standard DBT, showed positive results for participants and appears effective in treating people with co-occurring disorders. Qualitative results of this mixed methods study corroborate the quantitative results indicating that the experiences of participants have been positive. The study indicates that a DBT skills programme may provide a useful therapeutic approach to managing co-occurring symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background There is no longer support for the idea that brief intervention programmes alone can contribute meaningfully to the improvement of population health relating to alcohol. As a result, calls for major innovations and paradigm shifts grow, notably among research leaders. Main text This paper briefly examines the history of the development of the evidence-base from the landmark World Health Organisation projects on Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) in the 1980s onwards. Particular attention is given to weaknesses in the theorisation of social influence and interventions design, and declining effect sizes over time. Although the old SBI paradigm may be exhausted where it has been applied, it has not been replaced by a new paradigm. Alcohol marketing encourages heavy drinking and today may have more powerful effects on thinking about alcohol, and about alcohol problems, than previously. The nature of the societal challenge being faced in an alcogenic environment in which alcohol is widely promoted and weakly regulated underpins consideration of the possibilities for contemporary evidence-informed public health responses. Evidence-informed perspectives in discourses on alcohol problems need to be strengthened in redeveloping rationales for brief interventions. This process needs to move away from sole reliance on a model based on a two-person discussion of alcohol, which is divorced from wider concerns the person may have. Reimagining the nature of brief interventions involves incorporating digital content, emphasising meso-level social processes based on material that people want to share, and seeking synergies with macro-level population and media issues, including alcohol policy measures. Conclusions Current versions of brief interventions may be simply too weak to contend with the pressures of an alcogenic environment. A new generation of brief interventions could have a key role to play in developing multi-level responses to the problems caused by alcohol.",

The aim of the study was to examine perception of family and social support and quality of life (QoL) in patients undergoing treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs). We compared them with patients in treatment for mental disorders (MDs) and physical disorders (PDs). Methods We used data from a national multicenter study that recruited patients (N = 518) from three treatment domains; SUD treatment units, MD treatment units, and PD treatment units (severe neurological conditions or cancer). Data on family cohesion, social support, and QoL were compared across patient groups. In addition, data on health variables was collected. We used a multiple linear regression procedure to examine how health and support variables were associated with QoL. Results Family cohesion and social support in the SUD and MD groups were rated at similarly low levels, substantially lower than in the PD group. The SUD group exhibited a somewhat lower QoL than did the PD group, but their QoL was still in the near-to-normal range. In contrast, the MD group had markedly low QoL. When examining factors associated with QoL, we found that greater family cohesion and social support were positively associated with QoL. Mental distress was the strongest factor, and was negatively associated with QoL (beta − 0.15, 95% CI = − 0.17/− 0.14, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Service providers need to be aware of the weaker networks and less regulatory family and/or social support available to patients with SUDs. Providers should focus consistently on the social networks of patients and include patients’ families in treatment processes.",

    "abstract": "Improving access to medication treatment of opioid use disorder (MOUD) is a national priority, yet common modifiable barriers (e.g., limited provider knowledge, negative beliefs about MOUD) often challenge implementation of MOUD delivery. To address these barriers, the VA launched a multifaceted implementation intervention focused on planning and educational strategies to increase MOUD delivery in 18 medical facilities. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a multifaceted intervention approach to increase MOUD delivery changed providers' perceptions about MOUD over the first year of implementation.Cross-disciplinary teams of clinic providers and leadership from primary care, pain, and mental health clinics at 18 VA medical facilities received invitations to complete an anonymous, electronic survey prior to intervention launch (baseline) and at 12- month follow-up. Responses were summarized using descriptive statistics, and changes over time were compared using regression models adjusted for gender and prescriber status, and clustered on facility. Responses to open-ended questions were thematically analyzed using a template analysis approach.Survey response rates at baseline and follow-up were 57.1% (56/98) and 50.4% (61/121), respectively. At both time points, most respondents agreed that MOUD delivery is important (94.7 vs. 86.9%), lifesaving (92.8 vs. 88.5%) and evidence-based (85.2 vs. 89.5%). Over one-third (37.5%) viewed MOUD delivery as time-consuming, and only 53.7% affirmed that clinic providers wanted to prescribe MOUD at baseline; similar responses were seen at follow-up (34.5 and 52.4%, respectively). Respondents rated their knowledge about OUD, comfort discussing opioid use with patients, job satisfaction, ability to help patients with OUD, and support from colleagues favorably at both time points. Respondents' ratings of MOUD delivery filling a gap in care were high but declined significantly from baseline to follow-up (85.7 vs. 73.7%, p < 0.04). Open-ended responses identified implementation barriers including lack of support to diagnose and treat OUD and lack of time.Although perceptions about MOUD generally were positive, targeted education and planning strategies did not improve providers' and clinical leaders' perceptions of MOUD over time. Strategies that improve leaders' prioritization and support of MOUD and address time constraints related to delivering MOUD may increase access to MOUD in non-substance use treatment clinics.",

This study aimed to identify factors associated with patient-reported suboptimal access, quality, and outcomes of SUD treatment to guide the design of targeted quality improvement initiatives. Method We analysed clinical record and patient survey data routinely collected by SUD services in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. The sample included 1097 treatment episodes, representing 32% of all episodes in 2019. Using multivariate logistic regression, we modelled socio-demographic, substance use and treatment correlates of patient-reported suboptimal access to, quality and outcomes of SUD treatment. Results Overall, 37.9% of patients reported substantial difficulties in accessing treatment, 28.8% reported suboptimal quality treatment, and 31.1% reported suboptimal SUD outcomes. The odds of reporting poor access were elevated for patients identifying as Black/African, in residential treatment, with comorbid mental health problems, and longer histories of substance use. Length of substance use, comorbid mental health problems, and prior SUD treatment were associated with greater likelihood of reporting suboptimal quality treatment. Patients with comorbid mental health problems, polysubstance use, who did not complete treatment, and who perceived treatment to be of poor quality were more likely to report suboptimal outcomes. Conclusion This study is among the first to use patient-reported experiences and outcome measures to identify targets for SUD treatment improvement. Findings suggest substantial room to improve South African SUD treatment services, with targeted efforts needed to reduce disparities in outcomes for patients of Black/African descent, for those with comorbid mental health problems, and for patients who have chronic substance use difficulties. Interventions to enhance the relevance, appropriateness, and acceptability of SUD services for these patient sub-groups are needed to improve system performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite demonstrated efficacy, medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) remain inaccessible to many patients, with barriers identified at the individual, clinic and system level. A wide array of implementation strategies have guided efforts to expand access to MOUD, with most centered around externally-facilitated approaches to practice change. While effective, such approaches may be inaccessible to those clinics and systems that lack the resources necessary to partner with an external team, suggesting a need to identify and describe change-processes that are internally developed and promoted. Methods Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we utilized qualitative interviews and ethnographic observation to investigate the planning, design and implementation of a locally-initiated process to expand access to MOUD within one health care system. All study documents were coded by a primary coder and secondary reviewer using a codebook designed for use with the CFIR. To analyze data, we reviewed text tagged by key codes, compared these textual excerpts both across and within documents, and organized findings into themes. Processes identified were mapped to established implementation science constructs and strategies. Results Interviews with clinicians and administrators (n = 9) and ethnographic observation of planning meetings (n = 3) revealed how a self-appointed local team developed, established broad support for, and successfully implemented a Primary Care-based Buprenorphine Clinic and E-Consult Service to expand access to MOUD to patients across the health care system. First, national and local policy changes—including altered clinical practice guidelines, performance pay incentives regarding opioid prescribing, and a directive from VA Central Office increased individual staff and administrators’ perception of the need for change and willingness to invest time and resources. Then, a self-appointed interdisciplinary team utilized cross-clinic meetings and information gathering to identify appropriate, and widely supported, models of care delivery and care consultation. Finally, the team increased staff investment in these change efforts by bringing them into the planning process and encouraging collaborative problem solving. Conclusions This study reveals how a local team developed and built widespread support for new processes of care that were tailored to local needs and well-positioned for sustainability over time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hospitalizations for severe injection drug use-related infections (SIRIs) are characterized by high costs, frequent patient-directed discharge, and high readmission rates. Beyond the health system impacts, these admissions can be traumatizing to people who inject drugs (PWID), who often receive inadequate treatment for their substance use disorders (SUD). The Jackson SIRI team was developed as an integrated infectious disease/SUD treatment intervention for patients hospitalized at a public safety-net hospital in Miami, Florida in 2020. We conducted a qualitative study to identify patient- and clinician-level perceived implementation barriers and facilitators to the SIRI team intervention. Methods Participants were patients with history of SIRIs (n = 7) and healthcare clinicians (n = 8) at one implementing hospital (Jackson Memorial Hospital). Semi-structured qualitative interviews were performed with a guide created using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Interviews were transcribed, double coded, and categorized by study team members using CFIR constructs. Results Implementation barriers to the SIRI team intervention identified by participants included: (1) complexity of the SIRI team intervention; (2) lack of resources for PWID experiencing homelessness, financial insecurity, and uninsured status; (3) clinician-level stigma and lack of knowledge around addiction and medications for opioid use disorder (OUD); and (4) concerns about underinvestment in the intervention. Implementation facilitators of the intervention included: (1) a non-judgmental, harm reduction-oriented approach; (2) the team’s advocacy for PWID as a means of institutional culture change; (3) provision of close post-hospital follow-up that is often inaccessible for PWID; (4) strong communication with patients and their hospital physicians; and (5) addressing diverse needs such as housing, insurance, and psychological wellbeing. Conclusion Integration of infectious disease and SUD treatment is a promising approach to managing patients with SIRIs. Implementation success depends on institutional buy-in, holistic care beyond the medical domain, and an ethos rooted in harm reduction across multilevel (inner and outer) implementation contexts.",

The aim of this review is to examine what is known about systematic screening for substance use in outpatient behavioral health clinics. Methods We conducted a PRISMA-based systematic literature search assessing substance use screening in outpatient adult and pediatric behavioral health settings in PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO. Quantitative studies published in English before May 22, 2020 that reported the percentage of patients who completed screening were included. Results Only eight articles met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reported prevalence of screening ranged from 48 to 100%, with half of the studies successfully screening more than 75% of their patient population. There were limited data on patient demographics for individuals who were and were not screened (e.g., gender, race) and screening practices (e.g., electronic versus paper/pencil administration). Conclusions The results of this systematic review suggest that successful screening for substance use in behavioral health settings is possible, yet it remains unclear how frequently screening occurs. Given the high rates of comorbid SUD and psychopathology, future research is necessary regarding patient and clinic-level variables that may impact the successful implementation of substance use screening.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background An emerging public health threat of methamphetamine/opioid co-use is occurring in North America, including increases in overdoses related to concomitant methamphetamine/opioid use. This presents a potential risk to established treatments for opioid use disorder (i.e., medications for opioid use disorder [MOUD]). To date, few studies have examined the impact of methamphetamine use on MOUD-related outcomes, and no studies have synthesized data on MOUD retention. Methods A scoping review was undertaken to examine the impact of methamphetamine use on MOUD retention. All original published research articles were searched in Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Protocols, and Google scholar databases. Data were extracted into a standardized data extraction chart. Findings were presented narratively. Results All eight included studies demonstrated an increased likelihood of treatment discontinuation or dropout among patients enrolled in MOUD who used methamphetamine. The frequency of methamphetamine use was also associated with MOUD dropout, in that those who used methamphetamine more often were more likely to discontinue MOUD. The definitions and measurements of MOUD retention varied considerably, as did the magnitude of effect size. Conclusions Results indicate that methamphetamine use has an undesirable impact on MOUD retention and results in an increased risk of treatment discontinuation or dropout. Strategies to identify concurrent methamphetamine use among individuals engaging in MOUD and educate them on the increased risk for dropout should be undertaken. Further research is needed to understand how MOUD retention among patients with concomitant opioid and methamphetamine use can be improved.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Screening for substance use in rural primary care clinics faces unique challenges due to limited resources, high patient volumes, and multiple demands on providers. To explore the potential for electronic health record (EHR)-integrated screening in this context, we conducted an implementation feasibility study with a rural federally-qualified health center (FQHC) in Maine. This was an ancillary study to a NIDA Clinical Trials Network study of screening in urban primary care clinics (CTN-0062). Methods Researchers worked with stakeholders from three FQHC clinics to define and implement their optimal screening approach. Clinics used the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medication, and Other Substance (TAPS) Tool, completed on tablet computers in the waiting room, and results were immediately recorded in the EHR. Adult patients presenting for annual preventive care visits, but not those with other visit types, were eligible for screening. Data were analyzed for the first 12 months following implementation at each clinic to assess screening rates and prevalence of reported unhealthy substance use, and documentation of counseling using an EHR-integrated clinical decision support tool, for patients screening positive for moderate-high risk alcohol or drug use. Results Screening was completed by 3749 patients, representing 93.4% of those with screening-eligible annual preventive care visits, and 18.5% of adult patients presenting for any type of primary care visit. Screening was self-administered in 92.9% of cases. The prevalence of moderate-high risk substance use detected on screening was 14.6% for tobacco, 30.4% for alcohol, 10.8% for cannabis, 0.3% for illicit drugs, and 0.6% for non-medical use of prescription drugs. Brief substance use counseling was documented for 17.4% of patients with any moderate-high risk alcohol or drug use. Conclusions Self-administered EHR-integrated screening was feasible to implement, and detected substantial alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco use in rural FQHC clinics. Counseling was documented for a minority of patients with moderate-high risk use, possibly indicating a need for better support of primary care providers in addressing substance use. There is potential to broaden the reach of screening by offering it at routine medical visits rather than restricting to annual preventive care visits, within these and other rural primary care clinics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background People who use drugs (PWUD) face disproportionately high rates of hospitalizations and patient-initiated discharge (leaving against medical advice), explained by a combination of stigma, withdrawal, judgment, blame, and improper pain management. In addition, evidence has shown that despite abstinence-based policies within healthcare settings, PWUD continue to use their substances in healthcare environments often hidden away from hospital staff, resulting in fatalities. Various novel overdose detection technologies (ODTs) have been developed with early adoption in a few settings to reduce the morbidity and mortality from risky substance use patterns within healthcare environments. Our study aimed to gain the perspectives of healthcare workers across Canada on implementing ODTs within these settings. Method We used purposive and snowball sampling to recruit 16 healthcare professionals to participate in semi-structured interviews completed by two evaluators. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify key themes and subthemes. Results Participants recognized ODTs as a potentially feasible solution for increasing the safety of PWUD in healthcare settings. Our results suggest the mixed ability of these services to decrease stigma and build rapport with PWUD. Participants further highlighted barriers to implementing these services, including pre-established policies, legal recourse, and coordination of emergency responses to suspected overdoses. Lastly, participants highlight that ODTs should only be one part of a multifaceted approach to reducing harm in healthcare settings and could currently be integrated into discharge planning. Conclusion Healthcare professionals from across Canada found ODTs to be an acceptable intervention, but only as part of a larger suite of harm reduction interventions to reduce the harms associated with illicit drug use in healthcare settings. In contrast, participants noted institutional policies, stigma on behalf of healthcare workers and leadership would present significant challenges to their uptake and dissemination.",

The aim of the study was to investigate one-year outcomes of an RCT, investigating Behavioral Self-Control Training (BSCT) and Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) and predictors of positive outcome for weekly alcohol consumption, CD and symptom reduction in AUD. Methods This study is based on secondary analyses from a randomized controlled trial including 250 individuals with AUD (52% men) recruited from three specialized addiction clinics in Stockholm, Sweden. Linear and logistic mixed regression models were used for outcomes at 52 weeks, and linear and logistic regression models for the predictor analyses. Results BSCT was superior to MET for the change between baseline to 52 weeks for the outcome of CD, defined as low-risk drinking below ten standard drinks per week for both genders ( p = 0.048). A total of 57% of individuals in BSCT attained a level of CD, as opposed to 43% in MET. Females were significantly better in attaining low-risk drinking levels compared to men. The predictor for obtaining CD and reducing weekly alcohol consumption, was a lower baseline alcohol consumption.

    "abstract": "Amidst increasing opioid-related fatalities in adolescents and young adults (AYA), there is an urgent need to enhance the quality and availability of developmentally appropriate, evidence-based treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) and improve youth engagement in treatment. Involving families in treatment planning and therapy augments medication-based OUD treatment for AYA by increasing treatment engagement and retention. Yet, uptake of family-involved treatment for OUD remains low. This study examined systems-level barriers and facilitators to integrating families in AYA OUD treatment in Rhode Island. An online survey was administered to clinic leaders and direct care providers who work with AYA in programs that provide medication and psychosocial treatments for OUD. The survey assessed attitudes towards and experiences with family-based treatment, barriers and facilitators to family-based treatment utilization, as well as other available treatment services for AYA and family members. Findings were summarized using descriptive statistics. A total of 104 respondents from 14 distinct treatment programs completed the survey. Most identified as White (72.5%), female (72.7%), and between 25 and 44 years of age (59.4%). Over half (54.1%) of respondents reported no experience with family based treatment and limited current opportunities to involve families. Barriers perceived as most impactful to adopting family-based treatment were related to limited available resources (i.e. for staff training, program expansion) and lack of prioritization of family-based treatment in staff productivity requirements. Barriers perceived as least impactful were respondent beliefs and attitudes about family-based treatment (e.g., perception of the evidence strength and quality of family-based treatment, interest in implementing family-based treatment) as well as leadership support of family-based treatment approaches. Respondents identified several other gaps in availability of comprehensive treatment services, especially for adolescents (e.g. services that increase social recovery capital). Family-based treatment opportunities for AYA with OUD in Rhode Island are limited. Affordable and accessible training programs are needed to increase provider familiarity and competency with family-based treatment. Implementation of programming to increase family involvement in treatment (i.e. psychoeducational and skills-based groups for family members) rather than adopting a family-based treatment model may be a more feasible step to better meet the needs of AYA with OUD. not applicable.",

Several studies have analyzed patient experiences of LAIB but the perspective of OAT staff is unknown. This study aimed to explore how healthcare staff working in OAT clinics in Sweden perceive and manage treatment with LAIB. Methods Individual qualitative interviews were conducted with OAT physicians (n = 10) in tandem with nine focus group sessions with OAT nurses and other staff categories (n = 41). The data was analyzed with thematic text analysis. Results Five central themes were identified in the data: (1) advantages and disadvantages of LAIB, (2) patient categories that may or may not need LAIB, (3) patients’ degrees of medication choice, (4) keeping tabs, control and treatment alliance, and (5) LAIB’s impact on risk and enabling environments in OAT. Overall staff found more advantages than disadvantages with LAIB and considered that patients with ongoing substance use and low adherence were most likely to benefit from LAIB. However, less frequent visits were viewed as problematic in terms of developing a treatment alliance and being able to keep tabs on patients’ clinical status. Clinics differed regarding patients' degrees of choice in medication, which varied from limited to extensive. LAIB affected both risk and enabling environments in OAT. Conclusions LAIB may strengthen the enabling environment in OAT for some patients by reducing clinic visits, exposure to risk environments, and the pressure to divert medication. A continued discussion about the prerequisites and rationale for LAIB implementation is needed in policy and practice.",

Therefore, we conducted a scoping review of implementation determinants (i.e., barriers and facilitators), as well as the change methods (implementation strategies and adjunctive interventions) that have been evaluated to increase PrEP implementation and use among PWUD. We identified 32 peer-reviewed articles assessing determinants and five that evaluated change methods. Determinants were coded using the updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), which is an established framework to understand the multilevel barriers and facilitators associated with implementation. Findings indicate that most research was conducted among PrEP recipients (i.e., patients), focusing on awareness and willingness to use PrEP, with less focus on factors impacting clinicians and service delivery systems. Moreover, very few change methods have been evaluated to improve clinician adoption and adherence to CDC guidelines for PrEP provision and/or recipient uptake and adherence to PrEP. Future research is needed that focuses on factors impacting implementation from a clinician standpoint as well as innovative change methods to increase PrEP awareness, reach, adoption, and sustained adherence to guidelines.

The present article describes the design of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network protocol, Screening, Motivational Assessment, Referral, and Treatment in Emergency Departments (SMART-ED), which addresses the potential bias of assessment reactivity.The protocol employs a 3-arm design. Following an initial brief screening, individuals identified as positive cases are consented, asked to provide demographic and locator information, and randomly assigned to one of the three conditions: minimal screening only, screening + assessment, or screening + assessment + brief intervention. In a two-stage process, the randomization procedure first reveals whether or not the participant will be in the minimal-screening-only condition. Participants in the other two groups receive a more extensive baseline assessment before it is revealed whether they have been randomized to also receive a brief intervention. Comparing the screening only and screening + assessment conditions will allow determination of the incremental effect of assessment reactivity.Assessment reactivity is a potential source of bias that may reduce and/or lead to an underestimation of the purported effectiveness of brief interventions. From a methodological perspective, it needs to be accounted for in research designs. The SMART-ED design offers an approach to minimize assessment reactivity as a potential source of bias. Elucidating the role of assessment reactivity may offer insights into the mechanisms underlying SBIRT as well as suggest clinical options incorporating assessment reactivity as a treatment adjunct.

Youth in New Mexico are at particular risk: they report higher rates of nonmedical prescription opioid use than those over age 25, are more likely than their national counterparts to have tried heroin, and represent an increasing proportion of heroin overdoses.Commissioned by the City of Albuquerque, semistructured interviews were conducted from April to June of 2011 with 24 substance use treatment agencies and eight key stakeholders in Albuquerque to identify recent changes in the treatment-seeking population and gaps in treatment availability. Themes were derived using template analysis and data were analyzed using NVivo 9 software.Respondents reported a noticeable increase in youth seeking treatment for opioid use and a general increase in nonmedical prescription opioid use. Most noted difficulties with finding buprenorphine providers and a lack of youth services. Additionally, stigma, limited interagency communication and referral, barriers to prescribing buprenorphine, and a lack of funding were noted as preventing opioid users from quickly accessing effective treatment.Recommendations for addressing these issues include developing youth-specific treatment programs, raising awareness about opioid use among youth, increasing the availability of buprenorphine through provider incentives and education, developing a resource guide for individuals seeking treatment in Albuquerque, and prioritizing interagency communication and referrals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The AUDIT-C is an extensively validated screen for unhealthy alcohol use (i.e. drinking above recommended limits or alcohol use disorder), which consists of three questions about alcohol consumption. AUDIT-C scores ≥4 points for men and ≥3 for women are considered positive screens based on US validation studies that compared the AUDIT-C to “gold standard” measures of unhealthy alcohol use from independent, detailed interviews. However, results of screening— positive or negative based on AUDIT-C scores —can be inconsistent with reported drinking on the AUDIT-C questions. For example, individuals can screen positive based on the AUDIT-C score while reporting drinking below US recommended limits on the same AUDIT-C. Alternatively, they can screen negative based on the AUDIT-C score while reporting drinking above US recommended limits. Such inconsistencies could complicate interpretation of screening results, but it is unclear how often they occur in practice. Methods This study used AUDIT-C data from respondents who reported past-year drinking on one of two national US surveys: a general population survey (N = 26,610) and a Veterans Health Administration (VA) outpatient survey (N = 467,416). Gender-stratified analyses estimated the prevalence of AUDIT-C screen results— positive or negative screens based on the AUDIT-C score —that were inconsistent with reported drinking (above or below US recommended limits) on the same AUDIT-C. Results Among men who reported drinking, 13.8% and 21.1% of US general population and VA samples, respectively, had screening results based on AUDIT-C scores (positive or negative) that were inconsistent with reported drinking on the AUDIT-C questions (above or below US recommended limits). Among women who reported drinking, 18.3% and 20.7% of US general population and VA samples, respectively, had screening results that were inconsistent with reported drinking. Limitations This study did not include an independent interview gold standard for unhealthy alcohol use and therefore cannot address how often observed inconsistencies represent false positive or negative screens. Conclusions Up to 21% of people who drink alcohol had alcohol screening results based on the AUDIT-C score that were inconsistent with reported drinking on the same AUDIT-C. This needs to be addressed when training clinicians to use the AUDIT-C.",

The prevalence of injection equipment sharing (sharing) and its association with age was examined in a cohort of out-of-treatment Massachusetts substance users. This analysis included baseline data from a behavioral intervention with substance users. Younger and older (<25 versus ≥25 years) injection drug users were compared on demographic characteristics, substance use practices, including factors present during the most recent sharing event (\"event-level factors\"), and HCV testing history. Sharing was reported by 41% of the 484 individuals who reported injection drug use in the past 30 days. Prevalence of sharing varied by age (50% <25 years old versus 38% ≥25 years, p = 0.02). In a multivariable logistic regression model younger versus older individuals had twice the odds of sharing (95% CI = 1.26, 3.19). During their most recent sharing event, fewer younger individuals than older had their own drugs available (50% versus 75%, p < 0.001); other injection event-level factors did not vary by age. In the presence of PTSD, history of exchanging sex for money, or not being US born, prevalence of sharing by older users was higher and was similar to that of younger users, such that there was no association between age and sharing. In this cohort of injection drug users, younger age was associated with higher prevalence of sharing, but only in the absence of certain stressors. Harm reduction efforts might benefit from intervening on mental health and other stressors in addition to substance use. Study findings suggest a particular need to address the dangers of sharing with young individuals initiating injection drug use.",

Trends in patient volume, characteristics and outcomes by calendar year were assessed using the Cochran-Armitage test and linear regression.There was an almost two-fold increase in the volume of pregnant women treated annually from 2006 through 2010. Most women were treated with methadone (74%), with buprenorphine becoming more common over calendar time: 3.0% in 2006 to 41% in 2010. The mean dose of buprenorphine at delivery was: 11.4 mg in 2007, 14.1 mg in 2008, 14.1 mg in 2009, and 16.8 mg in 2010; an average increase of 2.1 mg year. There were no differences in mean methadone dose over time. From 2006 to 2010 there were increases in the prevalence of prescribed concomitant psychotropic medications and vaginal deliveries, and in the proportion of neonates treated pharmacologically for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS pharmacologic management also varied by calendar year with more use of neonatal morphine and clonidine in later years.The number of mother-infant pairs increased significantly from 2006 to 2010 and the clinical characteristics of these patients changed over time. Our experience reflects the rising increase in opioid use disorders in pregnancy and NAS, mandating the need for expansion of comprehensive prenatal care options for these women and their children.",

    "abstract": "Women in South Africa who use alcohol and other drugs face multiple barriers to HIV care. These barriers make it difficult for women to progress through each step in the HIV treatment cascade from diagnosis to treatment initiation and adherence. This paper examines correlates of HIV status, newly diagnosed HIV status, and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Outreach workers recruited sexually active Black African women who used substances in Pretoria as part of a U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded geographically clustered randomized trial examining the effect of an intervention to reduce alcohol and drug use as well as sexual risk behaviors. To address the question of interest in the current investigation, cross-sectional baseline data were used. At study enrollment, all participants (N = 641) completed an interview, and underwent rapid HIV testing and biological drug screening. Those who tested positive for HIV and were eligible for ART were asked about their barriers to initiating or adhering to ART. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine correlates of HIV status, newly diagnosed HIV, and ART use. At enrollment, 55% of participants tested positive for HIV, and 36% of these women were newly diagnosed. In multivariable analyses of the entire sample, women who had completed 10th grade were less likely to be living with HIV (OR 0.69; CI 0.48, 0.99) and those from the inner city were more likely to be living with HIV (OR 1.83; CI 1.26, 2.67). Among HIV-positive participants, women were less likely to be newly diagnosed if they had ever been in substance abuse treatment (OR 0.15; CI 0.03, 0.69) or used a condom at last sex (OR 0.58; CI 0.34, 0.98) and more likely to be newly diagnosed if they were physically assaulted in the past year (OR 1.97; CI 1.01, 3.84). Among women eligible for ART, fewer were likely to be on treatment (by self-report) if they had a positive urine test for opiates or cocaine (OR 0.27; CI 0.09, 0.80). These results, although cross-sectional, provide some guidance for provincial authorities to address barriers to HIV care for sexually active, substance-using vulnerable women in Pretoria. Targeting the inner city with prevention campaigns, expanding and improving substance abuse treatment programs, linking clients with simultaneous HIV testing and treatment, and targeting women who have experienced sexual assault and violence may help the government achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment target.

    "abstract": "Interventions are needed to improve viral suppression rates among persons with HIV and substance use. A 3-arm randomized multi-site study (Metsch et al. in JAMA 316:156–70, 2016) was conducted to evaluate the effect on HIV outcomes of usual care referral to HIV and substance use services (N = 253) versus patient navigation delivered alone (PN: N = 266) or together with contingency management (PN + CM; N = 271) that provided financial incentives targeting potential behavioral mediators of viral load suppression. This secondary analysis evaluates the effects of financial incentives on attendance at PN sessions and the relationship between session attendance and viral load suppression at end of the intervention. Frequency of sessions attended was analyzed over time and by distribution of individual session attendance frequency (PN vs PN + CM). Percent virally suppressed (≤200 copies/mL) at 6 months was compared for low, medium and high rate attenders. In PN + CM a total of $220 could be earned for attendance at 11 PN sessions over the 6-month intervention with payments ranging from $10 to $30 under an escalating schedule. The majority (74%) of PN-only participants attended 6 or more sessions but only 28% attended 10 or more and 16% attended all eleven sessions. In contrast, 90% of PN + CM attended 6 or more visits, 69% attended 10 or more and 57% attended all eleven sessions (attendance distribution χ2[11] = 105.81; p < .0001). Overall (PN and PN + CM participants combined) percent with viral load suppression at 6-months was 15, 38 and 54% among those who attended 0–5, 6–9 and 10–11 visits, respectively (χ2(2) = 39.07, p < .001). In this secondary post hoc analysis, contact with patient navigators was increased by attendance incentives. Higher rates of attendance at patient navigation sessions was associated with viral suppression at the 6-month follow-up assessment. Study results support use of attendance incentives to improve rates of contact between service providers and patients, particularly patients who are difficult to engage in care.

    "abstract": "Improving the extent to which evidence-based practices (EBPs)-treatments that have been empirically shown to be efficacious or effective-are integrated within routine practice is a well-documented challenge across numerous areas of health. In 2014, the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded a type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial titled the substance abuse treatment to HIV Care (SAT2HIV) Project. Aim 1 of the SAT2HIV Project tests the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing-based brief intervention (MIBI) for substance use as an adjunct to usual care within AIDS service organizations (ASOs) as part of its MIBI Experiment. Aim 2 of the SAT2HIV Project tests the effectiveness of implementation and sustainment facilitation (ISF) as an adjunct to the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) model for training staff in motivational interviewing as part of its ISF Experiment. The current paper describes the study protocol for the ISF Experiment. Using a cluster randomized design, case management and leadership staff from 39 ASOs across the United States were randomized to receive either the ATTC strategy (control condition) or the ATTC + ISF strategy (experimental condition). The ATTC strategy is staff-focused and includes 10 discrete strategies (e.g., provide centralized technical assistance, conduct educational meetings, provide ongoing consultation). The ISF strategy is organization-focused and includes seven discrete strategies (e.g., use an implementation advisor, organize implementation team meetings, conduct cyclical small tests of change). Building upon the exploration-preparation-implementation-sustainment (EPIS) framework, the effectiveness of the ISF strategy is examined via three staff-level measures: (1) time-to-proficiency (i.e., preparation phase outcome), (2) implementation effectiveness (i.e., implementation phase outcome), and (3) level of sustainment (i.e., sustainment phase outcome). Although not without limitations, the ISF experiment has several strengths: a highly rigorous design (randomized, hypothesis-driven), high-need setting (ASOs), large sample size (39 ASOs), large geographic representation (23 states and the District of Columbia), and testing along multiple phases of the EPIS continuum (preparation, implementation, and sustainment). Thus, study findings will significantly improve generalizable knowledge regarding the best preparation, implementation, and sustainment strategies for advancing EBPs along the EPIS continuum. Moreover, increasing ASO's capacity to address substance use may improve the HIV Care Continuum. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03120598.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol use in HIV infected patients is associated with risky sexual behaviour, poor adherence to Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy, treatment failure and increased physiologic harm. The objectives of the study were to pilot the outcome assessments to be used in the trial proper, assess the feasibility of delivery of a brief MI/CBT intervention compared to an WHO mhGAP intervention for problematic alcohol use in PLWH in Zimbabwe, and pilot the effectiveness (on alcohol use, functionality and CD4 count) of these interventions at 3 months in a randomised controlled trial design. Methods An intervention for HIV infected patients with problematic alcohol use, developed through adaptation of existing evidence based psychological treatments, was assessed for its feasibility at a tertiary HIV care clinic in Zimbabwe. Registered general nurses, using a manualised protocol, delivered the intervention. Forty patients were recruited and randomised to receive either an MI/CBT intervention or the WHO mhGAP Intervention Guide for AUDs (n = 20 patients per group). Results Out of 40 participants enrolled, 31 were successfully followed up for 3 months with a loss to follow-up rate of 23%. There was a statistically significant decrease in AUDIT score over time in both groups ( p &lt; 0.001), however no statistically significant group difference with a mean difference of 0.80, standard error of 2.07 and p = 0.70. For the CD4 count, the median and interquartile ranges at baseline for MI/CBT and WHO mhGAP IG groups were 218 (274) and 484 (211.50), respectively. At follow-up, median and interquartile ranges for the CD4 count for MI/CBT and WHO mhGAP IG groups were 390 (280) and 567 (378), respectively, indicative of improvement in immunological parameters in both arms. Conclusion The findings from this pilot study suggests that a brief MI/CBT delivered by Registered General Nurses for problematic alcohol use is feasible in this population but will require the implementation of additional measures to improve retention. However, mechanisms to improve retention need special attention. Trial registration Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, current PACTR201509001211149",

This retrospective study analyzed patients between 18 and 55 years old presenting to a single trauma center in San Bernardino County, CA who sustained traumatic injury during the 10-year study period (January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2015). Routine serum ethanol levels and urine drug screens (UDS) were completed on all trauma patients. Exclusion criteria included patients with an elevated serum ethanol level (> 0 mg/dL). Those who screened positive on UDS for only methamphetamine and negative for cocaine and cannabis (MA(+)) were compared to those with a triple negative UDS for methamphetamine, cocaine, and cannabis (MA(−)). The primary outcome studied was the impact of a methamphetamine positive drug screen on hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS), heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), and total amount of blood products utilized during hospitalization. To analyze the effect of methamphetamine, age, gender, injury severity score, and mechanism of injury (blunt vs. penetrating) were matched between MA(−) and MA(+) through a propensity matching algorithm. After exclusion, 2538 patients were included in the final analysis; 449 were patients in the MA(+) group and 2089 patients in the MA(−) group. A selection of 449 MA(−) patients were matched with the MA(+) group based on age, gender, injury severity score, and mechanism of injury. This led to a final sample size of 898 patients with 449 patients in each group. No statistically significant change was observed in hospital mortality. Notably, a methamphetamine positive drug screen was associated with a longer LOS (median of 4 vs. 3 days in MA(+) and MA(−), respectively, p < 0.0001), an increased heart rate at the scene (103 vs. 94 bpm for MA(+) and MA(−), respectively, p = 0.0016), and an increased heart rate upon arrival to the trauma center (100 vs. 94 bpm for MA(+) and MA(−), respectively, p < 0.0001). Moreover, the MA(+) group had decreased SBP at the scene compared to the MA(−) group (127 vs. 132 bpm for MA(+) and MA(−), respectively, p = 0.0149), but SBP was no longer statistically different when patients arrived at the trauma center (p = 0.3823). There was no significant difference in DBP or in blood products used. Methamphetamine positive drug screens in trauma patients were not associated with an increase in hospital mortality; however, a methamphetamine positive drug screen was associated with a longer LOS and an increased heart rate.",

To inform the intervention, focus groups were held with 25 young adults age 18 to 25 (12% female; Mean age = 20.4) who smoked cigarettes and reported at least one HED episode in the past month. Facebook intervention posts (N = 180) were tailored to readiness to quit smoking, and tested in two private Facebook behavioral change groups (Ready, Not Ready) with N = 29 young adults (10% female; Mean age = 20.8). Participants flagged posts in need of change, and we assessed engagement (comment frequency). Focus groups revealed preference for changing one substance at a time and greater receptivity to quitting smoking than reducing drinking. Mean comments per post were 5.3 (SD = 1.1) in Ready groups and 11.7 (SD = 5.1) in Not Ready groups; 94/180 (52.2%) posts were flagged for change. The level of engagement and the flagging of posts for change did not differ by group or by whether the post targeted tobacco, alcohol, or both substances combined (all p > .10). Overall, STAND was rated as easy to understand, providing sound advice, worthy of recommendation, and helpful (all agreement 100% among Ready; 50-70% among Not Ready). The current findings informed development of a social media-based intervention targeting tobacco and alcohol use in young adults. Although there was greater interest in making changes in smoking than drinking behavior, receptivity and acceptability of the Facebook post messages in the STAND intervention was high overall. The intervention is being further refined for evaluation in a larger trial.

    "abstract": "The study examined the association of the Affordable Care Act's 2014 Medicaid expansion on the use of psychosocial services and pharmacotherapies for opioid use disorders among Oregon Medicaid recipients. Logistic regression analysis examined utilization of care before (January 1, 2010–December 31, 2013) and after Medicaid expansion in Oregon (January 1, 2014–December 31, 2016). Adult membership in the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid) increased 180% following Medicaid expansion (2013 = 172,539; 2014 = 482,081) and the number with a diagnosis of OUD nearly doubled (2013 = 6808; 2014 = 13,418). More individuals received psychosocial services (2013 = 4714; 2014 = 8781) and medications (2013 = 3464; 2014 = 6093) for opioid use disorder. The percent of patients receiving psychosocial services (69% to 65%) and the percent of individuals receiving pharmacotherapy (57% to 45%) declined primarily because of a decline in the proportion receiving care in an opioid treatment program (2013 = 41%; 2014 = 33%). Odds of accessing any psychosocial service increased by 8% per year from 2010 to 2013 (AOR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.06–1.11) with an 18% immediate decline associated with Medicaid expansion in 2014 (AOR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.76–0.87). Following Medicaid expansion, the odds of accessing psychosocial services increased 8% per year (2014 through 2016) (AOR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.06–1.11). Use of medications for opioid use disorder found no change in the odds of use in the years prior to Medicaid expansion, an immediate 36% (AOR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.60–0.68) decline in 2014, and a 13% increase per year in 2015 and 2016 (AOR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.09–1.16). The number of Medicaid recipients with an opioid use disorder who received psychosocial and pharmacological services increased substantially following Oregon's Medicaid expansion in 2014. There was a decline, however, in the proportion of individuals with an opioid use disorder receiving care in opioid treatment programs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background First Nations peoples of Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America (USA) and Canada are more likely to be non-drinkers than other people in these countries. However, those who do drink may be at greater risk of alcohol-related harms (at a population level) due to the ongoing impacts from colonisation and associated oppression. Addressing unhealthy drinking (drinking above recommended limits including alcohol use disorders) in primary care settings is one important way to increase accessibility of treatment. Methods This systematic review identifies peer-reviewed studies of alcohol treatments delivered in primary care or other non-residential settings for First Nations peoples of Australia, New Zealand, USA and Canada. Literature searches were conducted in seven academic databases from their inception until March, 2020. We assessed evidence of treatment or implementation effectiveness, perceived acceptability or accessibility, and the study quality as assessed by the AXIS tool and by a measure of community participation in the research process. Results Twenty-eight studies were included, published between 1968 and 2018. Studies reported on a range of alcohol treatments, from brief intervention to ambulatory withdrawal management, relapse prevention medicines, and cultural therapies. Brief intervention was the most studied approach. Cultural healing practices and bicultural approaches were a key theme amongst several studies. Four studies measured treatment effectiveness, including one randomised controlled trial (naltrexone vs naltrexone plus sertraline vs placebo) and two uncontrolled trials of disulfiram. Of the six implementation studies, three were (hybrid) effectiveness-implementation designs. Most of the remaining studies (n = 21) focused on treatment accessibility or acceptability. Community participation in the research process was poorly reported in most studies. Conclusions Research evidence on how best to care for First Nations peoples with unhealthy alcohol use is limited. Trials of naltrexone and disulfiram presented promising results. Cultural and bicultural care were perceived as highly important to clinical staff and clients in several studies. More effectiveness studies on the full scope of alcohol treatments are needed. Greater community participation in research and more transparent reporting of this in study methods will be key to producing quality research that combines scientific rigour with cultural appropriateness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background While patient-reported treatment dissatisfaction is considered an important factor in determining the success of substance use disorder treatment, the levels of dissatisfaction with opioid agonist therapies (OAT) and its relationship with the risk of fentanyl exposure have not been characterized in the context of the ongoing opioid overdose crisis in the US and Canada. Our primary hypothesis was that OAT dissatisfaction was associated with an increased odds of fentanyl exposure. Methods Our objective was to examine self-reported treatment satisfaction among OAT patients in Vancouver, Canada and the association with fentanyl exposure. Longitudinal data were derived from 804 participants on OAT enrolled in two community-recruited harmonized prospective cohort studies of people who use drugs in Vancouver between 2016 and 2018 via semi-annual interviews and urine drug screens (UDS). We employed multivariable generalized estimating equations to examine the relationship between OAT dissatisfaction and fentanyl exposure. Results Out of 804 participants (57.0% male), 222 (27.6%) reported being dissatisfied with OAT at baseline and 1070 out of 1930 observations (55.4%) had fentanyl exposure. The distribution of OAT reported in the sample was methadone (n = 692, 77.7%), buprenorphine-naloxone (n = 82, 9.2%), injectable OAT (i.e., diacetylmorphine or hydromorphone; (n = 65, 7.3%), slow-release oral morphine (n = 44, 4.9%) and other/study medication (n = 8, 1.0%). In the multivariable analysis, OAT dissatisfaction was positively associated with fentanyl exposure (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.08–1.66). Conclusions A substantial proportion of OAT patients in our sample reported dissatisfaction with their OAT, and more than half were exposed to fentanyl. We also found that those who were dissatisfied with their OAT were more likely to be exposed to fentanyl. These findings demonstrate the importance of optimizing OAT satisfaction in the context of the ongoing opioid overdose crisis.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is offered in integrated treatment models addressing both substance use and other health conditions within the same system. This often includes offering medications for OUD in general medical settings. It remains uncertain whether integrated OUD treatment models are preferred to non-integrated models, where treatment is provided within a distinct treatment system. This study aimed to explore preferences for integrated versus non-integrated treatment models among people with OUD and examine what factors may influence preferences. This qualitative study recruited participants (n = 40) through Craigslist advertisements and flyers posted in treatment programs across the United States. Participants were 18 years of age or older and scored a two or higher on the heroin or opioid pain reliever sections of the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medications, and Other Substances (TAPS) Tool. Each participant completed a demographic survey and a telephone interview. The interviews were coded and content analyzed. While some participants preferred receiving OUD treatment from an integrated model in a general medical setting, the majority preferred non-integrated models. Some participants preferred integrated models in theory but expressed concerns about stigma and a lack of psychosocial services. Tradeoffs between integrated and non-integrated models were centered around patient values (desire for anonymity and personalization, fear of consequences), the characteristics of the provider and setting (convenience, perceived treatment effectiveness, access to services), and the patient-provider relationship (disclosure, trust, comfort, stigma). Among this sample of primarily White adults, preferences for non-integrated versus integrated OUD treatment were mixed. Perceived benefits of integrated models included convenience, potential for treatment personalization, and opportunity to extend established relationships with medical providers. Recommendations to make integrated treatment more patient-centered include facilitating access to psychosocial services, educating patients on privacy, individualizing treatment, and prioritizing the patient-provider relationship. This sample included very few minorities and thus findings may not be fully generalizable to the larger population of persons with OUD. Nonetheless, results suggest a need for expansion of both OUD treatment in specialty and general medical settings to ensure access to preferred treatment for all.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) often have complex health care needs. Methadone is one of the medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) used in the management of OUDs. Highly restrictive methadone treatment—which requires patient compliance with many rules of care—often results in low retention, especially if there is inadequate support from healthcare providers (HCPs). Nevertheless, HCPs should strive to offer patient-centred care (PCC) as it is deemed the gold standard to care. Such an approach can encourage patients to be actively involved in their care, ultimately increasing retention and yielding positive treatment outcomes. Methods In this secondary analysis, we aimed to explore how HCPs were applying the principles of PCC when caring for patients with OUD in a highly restrictive, biomedical and paternalistic setting. We applied Mead and Bower’s PCC framework in the secondary analysis of 40 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with both HCPs and patients. Results We present how PCC's concepts of; (a) biopsychosocial perspective ; (b) patient as a person ; (c) sharing power and responsibility ; (d) therapeutic alliance and (e) doctor as a person —are applied in a methadone treatment program. We identified both opportunities and barriers to providing PCC in these settings. Conclusion In a highly restrictive methadone treatment program, full implementation of PCC is not possible. However, implementation of some aspects of PCC are possible to improve patient empowerment and engagement with care, possibly leading to increase in retention and better treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are associated with positive health outcomes. People remaining on MOUD have a reduced likelihood of drug overdose and mortality. Tanzania supports a national opioid treatment program (OTP) offering MOUD, but retention is a continual challenge. To date, most research on MOUD retention in Tanzania and other Sub-Saharan Africa settings has been focused on the individual-level, with little attention to economic, social, and clinic-level factors. Methods We qualitatively examined economic, social, and clinic factors that affect retention on MOUD, specifically methadone maintenance therapy, among former and current clients attending an OTP clinic Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We conducted in-depth interviews with a total of 40 current and former clients receiving MOUD and four focus groups with an additional 35 current clients on MOUD between January and April 2020. We utilized a thematic analysis approach. Results Daily OTP clinic attendance posed a financial burden to current and former clients and was a barrier to remaining on MOUD. Though treatment is free, clients described struggles to attend clinic, including being able to afford transportation. Female clients were differentially impacted, as sex work was the most common income-generating activity that they participated in, which presented its own set of unique challenges, including barriers to attending during set clinic hours. Drug use stigma acted as a barrier to MOUD and prevented clients from securing a job, rebuilding trust within the community, and accessing transportation to attend the clinic. Being able to rebuild trust with family facilitated remaining on MOUD, as family provided social and financial support. Caretaking responsibilities and familial expectations among female clients conflicted with MOUD adherence. Finally, clinic level factors, such as clinic dispensing hours and punitive consequences for breaking rules, posed barriers to clients on MOUD. Conclusion Social and structural factors, both within (e.g., clinic policies) and outside of (e.g., transportation) the clinic impact MOUD retention. Our findings can inform interventions and policies to address economic and social barriers to MOUD, that can contribute to sustained recovery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Buprenorphine is a highly effective medication for opioid use disorder that is underused by health care professionals (HCPs). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) misinformation may be an important barrier to buprenorphine access, but most implementation strategies have aimed to reduce negative attitudes towards patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) rather than misinformation specific to buprenorphine use. In this study, we assessed the degree to which HCPs endorsed misinformation related to buprenorphine, and whether this is associated with willingness to provide care to patients with OUD. Methods In September-December of 2022, we surveyed HCPs practicing in Ohio (n = 409). Our primary outcomes included a previously validated 5-item measure of HCP willingness to treat patients with OUD, and three other measures of willingness. Our key independent variable was a study-developed 5-item measure of endorsement of misinformation related to buprenorphine, which assessed beliefs in buprenorphine’s efficacy in managing withdrawal symptoms and reducing overdose deaths as well as beliefs about the role of buprenorphine in achieving remission. We computed descriptive and bivariable statistics and fit regression models predicting each outcome of interest. Results On average, HCPs scored 2.34 out of 5.00 (SD = 0.80) on the composite measure of buprenorphine misinformation. 48.41% of participants endorsed at least one piece of misinformation. The most endorsed items were that buprenorphine is ineffective at reducing overdose deaths (M = 2.75, SD =0 .98), and that its use substitutes one drug for another (M = 2.41, SD = 1.25). HCP endorsement of buprenorphine misinformation significantly and negatively predicted willingness to work with patients with OUD (b = − 0.34; 95% CI − 0.46, − 0.21); intentions to increase time spent with this patient population (b = − 0.36; 95% CI − 5.86, − 1.28); receipt of an X-waiver (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.38, 0.77); and intention to get an X-waiver (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33−0.94). Conclusions Misinformation is common among HCPs and associated with lower willingness to treat patients with OUD. Implementation strategies to increase MOUD use among HCPs should specifically counter misinformation related to buprenorphine. Clinical Trial Registration : Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT05505227.

    "abstract": "People who inject drugs (PWID) are at increased risk of HIV acquisition and often encounter barriers to accessing healthcare services. Uganda has high HIV prevalence among PWID and lacks integrated pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and harm reduction services. Understanding PWID experiences accessing and using harm reduction services and PrEP will inform strategies to optimize integration that align with PWID needs and priorities. Between May 2021 and March 2023, we conducted semi-structured interviews with PWID in Kampala, Uganda. We recruited participants with and without previous experience accessing harm reduction services and/or PrEP using purposive and snowball sampling. Interviews were audio recorded, translated, and transcribed. We used thematic analysis to characterize motivations for uptake of harm reduction and HIV prevention services, and strategies to optimize delivery of needle and syringe programs (NSP), medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and PrEP. We conducted interviews with 41 PWID. Most participants were relatively aware of their personal HIV risk and accurately identified situations that increased risk, including sharing needles and engaging in transactional sex. Despite risk awareness, participants described engaging in known HIV risk behaviors to satisfy immediate drug use needs. All reported knowledge of harm reduction services, especially distribution of sterile needles and syringes, and many reported having experience with MOUD. Participants who had accessed MOUD followed two primary trajectories; limited resources and relationships with other PWID caused them to discontinue treatment while desire to regain something they believed was lost to their drug use motivated them to continue. Overall, PrEP knowledge among participants was limited and few reported ever taking PrEP. However, participants supported integrating PrEP into harm reduction service delivery and advocated for changes in how these services are accessed. Stigma experienced in healthcare facilities and challenges acquiring money for transportation presented barriers to accessing current facility-based harm reduction and HIV prevention services. Meeting the HIV prevention needs of PWID in Uganda will require lowering barriers to access, including integrated delivery of PrEP and harm reduction services and bringing services directly to communities. Additional training in providing patient-centered care for healthcare providers may improve uptake of facility-based services.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The prevalence and associated overdose death rates from opioid use disorder (OUD) have dramatically increased in the last decade. Despite more available treatments than 20 years ago, treatment access and high discontinuation rates are challenges, as are personalized medication dosing and making timely treatment changes when treatments fail. In other fields such as depression, brief measures to address these tasks combined with an action plan—so-called measurement-based care (MBC)—have been associated with better outcomes. This workgroup aimed to determine whether brief measures can be identified for using MBC for optimizing dosing or informing treatment decisions in OUD. Methods The National Institute on Drug Abuse Center for the Clinical Trials Network (NIDA CCTN) in 2022 convened a small workgroup to develop consensus about clinically usable measures to improve the quality of treatment delivery with MBC methods for OUD. Two clinical tasks were addressed: (1) to identify the optimal dose of medications for OUD for each patient and (2) to estimate the effectiveness of a treatment for a particular patient once implemented, in a more granular fashion than the binary categories of early or sustained remission or no remission found in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5). Discussion Five parameters were recommended to personalize medication dose adjustment: withdrawal symptoms, opioid use, magnitude (severity and duration) of the subjective effects when opioids are used, craving, and side effects. A brief rating of each OUD-specific parameter to adjust dosing and a global assessment or verbal question for side-effects was viewed as sufficient. Whether these ratings produce better outcomes (e.g., treatment engagement and retention) in practice deserves study. There was consensus that core signs and symptoms of OUD based on some of the 5 DSM-5 domains (e.g., craving, withdrawal) should be the basis for assessing treatment outcome. No existing brief measure was found to meet all the consensus recommendations. Next steps would be to select, adapt or develop de novo items/brief scales to inform clinical decision-making about dose and treatment effectiveness. Psychometric testing, assessment of acceptability and whether the use of such scales produces better symptom control, quality of life (QoL), daily function or better prognosis as compared to treatment as usual deserves investigation.",

We investigated whether those who chose therapist- versus self-guided ICBT differed in their (a) drinking outcomes—as measured by Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) and heavy drinking days (HDD) at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up—and (b) post-treatment ICBT engagement and satisfaction. Results The majority (81.1%) of eligible patients chose therapist-guided ICBT. These patients reported higher psychotropic medication use, drinking difficulties, and anxiety symptoms. For both the therapist- and self-guided patients, a modified intention-to-treat analysis revealed large within-group treatment effects for TLFB (β = − 2.64, SE 0.66; p &lt; 0.001) and HDD (β = − 0.34, SE 0.07; p &lt; 0.001), with large pre-to-post-treatment Cohen’s effect sizes of d = 0.97 (95% CI [0.49, 1.45]) for TLFB and d = 1.19 (95% CI [0.69, 1.68]) for HDD. The interaction comparing the effects of therapist- to self-guided ICBT over time was not significant for TLFB (p = 0.34) or HDD (p = 0.06). With treatment, for both therapist- and self-guided patients, there was a significant improvement in drinking difficulties, cravings, and confidence with controlling cravings, as well as in anxiety, depression, and functional impairment. Further, the majority (75.7%) of patients completed five or more lessons, as well as reported overall satisfaction with the treatment (88.9%) and increased confidence in managing their symptoms (86.7%); these outcomes also did not differ between therapist- and self-guided patients. Conclusions The current study shows that ICBT for alcohol misuse is associated with reduced drinking and comorbid mental health difficulties over time, irrespective of whether patients chose to complete the course on their own or with therapist guidance.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hospitalization presents an opportunity to begin people with opioid use disorder (OUD) on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and link them to care after discharge; regrettably, people admitted to the hospital with an underlying OUD typically do not receive MOUD and are not connected with subsequent treatment for their condition. To address this gap, we launched a multi-site randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a hospital-based addiction consultation team (the Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team (START)) consisting of an addiction medicine specialist and care manager team that provide collaborative care and a specified intervention to people with OUD during the inpatient stay. Successful implementation of new practices can be impacted by organizational context, though no previous studies have examined context prior to implementation of addiction consultation services (ACS). This study assessed pre-implementation context for implementing a specialized ACS and tailoring it accordingly. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with hospital administrators, physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and social workers at the three study sites between April and August 2021 before the launch of the pragmatic trial. Using an analytical framework based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we completed a thematic analysis of interview data to understand potential barriers or enablers and perceptions about acceptability and feasibility. Results We interviewed 28 participants across three sites. The following themes emerged across sites: (1) START is an urgently needed model for people with OUD; (2) Intervention adaptations are recommended to meet local and cultural needs; (3) Linking people with OUD to community clinicians is a highly needed component of START; (4) It is important to engage stakeholders across departments and roles throughout implementation. Across sites, participants generally saw a need for change from usual care to support people with OUD, and thought the START was acceptable and feasible to implement. Differences among sites included tailoring the START to support the needs of varying patient populations and different perceptions of the prevalence of OUD. Conclusions Hospitals planning to implement an ACS in the inpatient setting may wish to engage in a systematic pre-implementation contextual assessment using a similar framework to understand and address potential barriers and contextual factors that may impact implementation. Pre-implementation work can help ensure the ACS and other new practices fit within each unique hospital context.",

    "abstract": "Children at risk of substance use disorders (SUD) should be detected using brief structured tools for early intervention. This study sought to translate and adapt the Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Family/Friends, Trouble (CRAFFT) tool to determine its diagnostic accuracy, and the optimum cut-point to identify substance use disorders (SUD) risk in Ugandan children aged 6 to 13 years. This was a sequential mixed-methods study conducted in two phases. In the first qualitative phase, in Kampala and Mbale, the clinician-administered CRAFFT tool version 2.1 was translated into the local Lumasaaba dialect and culturally adapted through focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews, in collaboration with the tool's authors. Expert reviews and translations by bilingual experts provided insights on linguistic comprehensibility and cultural appropriateness, while pilot testing with the target population evaluated the tool's preliminary effectiveness. In the second phase, the CRAFFT tool, adapted to Lumasaaba, was quantitatively validated against the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID) for diagnosing SUD in Mbale district, through a survey. Participants, chosen randomly from schools stratified according to ownership, location, and school size, were assessed for the tool's reliability and validity, including comparisons to the MINI KID as the Gold Standard for diagnosing SUD. Data were analyzed using STATA-15. Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and criterion validity of the CRAFFT with the MINI-KID. Of the 470 children enrolled, 2.1% (n = 10) had missing data on key variables, leaving 460 for analysis. The median age and interquartile range (IQR) was 11 (9-12) years and 56.6% were girls. A total of 116 (25.2%) children had consumed alcohol in the last twelve-month period and 7 (1.5%) had used other substances. The mean CRAFFT score for all the children (n = 460) was 0.32 (SD 0.95). The prevalence of any alcohol use disorder (2 or more positive answers on the MINI KID) in the last 12 months was 7.2% (n = 32). The Lumasaaba version of the CRAFFT tool demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.86) and inter-item correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.84 (p < 0.001). At a cut-off score of 1.00, the CRAFFT had optimal sensitivity (91%) and specificity (92%) (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.91; 95% CI 0.86-0.97) to screen for SUD. A total of 62 (13.5%) had CRAFFT scores of > 1. The Lumasaaba version of the CRAFFT tool has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to identify school-age children at risk of SUD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Injection Drug use is associated with increased HIV risk behaviour that may result in the transmission of HIV and poor access to HIV prevention and treatment. In 2020, Uganda introduced the ‘medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment’ for People who inject drugs (PWID). We analysed the 12-month retention and associated factors among PWID enrolled on MOUD treatment in Kampala, Uganda. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 343 PWID with OUD who completed 14 days of methadone induction from September 2020 to July 2022. Retention was defined as the number of individuals still in the programme divided by the total number enrolled, computed at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12 months using lifetable and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Cox proportional regression analyses were conducted to assess factors associated with retention in the programme in the first 12 months. Results Overall, 243 (71%) of 343 participants stabilized at a methadone dose of 60 mg or more. The majority of participants were males ( n = 284, 82.8%), and the median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 31 (26–38) years. Most participants ( n = 276, 80.5%) lived 5 km or more away from the MOUD clinic. Thirty (8.8%) were HIV-positive, 52 (15.7%) had a major mental illness and 96 (27.9%) had a history of taking alcohol three months before enrollment. The cumulative retention significantly declined from 83.4% (95%CI = 79.0–87.0) at 3months to 71.9% (95%CI = 67.2–76.6) at 6months, 64% 95%CI = 58.7–68.9) at 9months, and 55.2%; 95% CI (49.8–60.3% at 12months. The 12-month retention was significantly higher for participants on methadone doses of 60 mg or more (adj.HR = 2.1, 95%CI = 1.41–3.22), while participants resident within 5 km of the MOUD clinic were 4.9 times more likely to be retained at 12 months, compared to those residing 5 km or more, (adj. HR = 4.81, 95%CI = 1.54-15). Other factors, including predisposing, need, and enabling factors, were not associated with retention. Conclusion Our study demonstrates acceptable 12-month retention rates for people who inject drugs, comparable to previous studies done in both developing and developed countries. Sustaining and improving retention may require enhanced scaling up of MOUD dose to an optimal level in the first 14 days and reducing the distance between participant locale and MOUD clinics.",

    "abstract": "Within the last 30 years, a substantial number of interventions for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) have received empirical support. Nevertheless, fewer than 25% of individuals with alcohol-related problems access these interventions. If several intensive psychosocial treatments are relatively effective, but most individuals in need do not access them, it seems logical to place a priority on developing more engaging interventions. Accordingly, after briefly describing findings about barriers to help-seeking, we focus on identifying an array of innovative and effective low-intensity intervention strategies, including telephone, computer-based, and Internet-based interventions, that surmount these barriers and are suitable for use within a stepped-care model. We conclude that these interventions attract individuals who would otherwise not seek help, that they can benefit individuals who misuse alcohol and those with more severe AUDs, and that they can facilitate subsequent help-seeking when needed. We note that these types of low-intensity interventions are flexible and can be tailored to address many of the perceived barriers that hinder individuals with alcohol misuse or AUDs from obtaining timely help. We also describe key areas of further research, such as identifying the mechanisms that underlie stepped-care interventions and finding out how to structure these interventions to best initiate a program of stepped care.",

    "abstract": "Substance use is common among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and is associated with worse outcomes along the HIV care continuum. One potentially effective clinic-based approach to addressing unhealthy substance use is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT). We conducted a two-arm randomized trial to examine the effects of a self-administered, computerized SBIRT intervention compared to a clinician-administered SBIRT intervention in an HIV primary clinic. Patients were surveyed before receiving the intervention and again at 1, 3, and 6 months. We administered the WHO Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test to determine Specific Substance Involvement Scores (SSIS) and to assign participants to categories of lower, moderate, or high risk to health and other problems for each substance. We collapsed moderate or severe risk responses into a single moderate–high risk category. Based on low rates of participation in the computerized arm, we conducted an \"as treated\" analysis to examine 6-month changes in mean SSIS among SBIRT intervention participants. For the overall sample (n = 208), baseline mean SSIS were in the moderate risk category for alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, sedatives and opioids. Of those enrolled, 134 (64.4%) received the intervention, and 109 (52.4%) completed the 6-month follow up. There was a statistically significant decline in mean SSIS for all substances except tobacco and cannabis among participants who were at moderate–high risk at baseline. We also observed a statistically significant increase in mean SSIS for all substances except amphetamines and sedatives among participants who were at lower risk at baseline. Substance use among patients in this urban, safety-net, HIV primary care clinic was near universal, and moderate risk substance use was common. Among participants who received the SBIRT intervention, mean SSISs decreased among those at moderate–high risk at baseline, but increased among those at lower risk at baseline over the 6-month study period. Additional research should examine the clinical significance of SSIS changes for PLHIV, which SBIRT components drive changes in substance use scores, and what other interventions might support those patients at lower risk to maintain health and engagement along the HIV care continuum.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV prevalence remains high in Cambodia among female entertainment and sex workers (FESW), and amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use significantly increases risk of infection. A successful continuum of care (CoC) is key to effective clinical care and prevention. This study aimed to describe the HIV CoC in HIV-positive FESW. We examined CoC outcomes among HIV-positive FESW participating in the Cambodia Integrated HIV and Drug Prevention Implementation (CIPI) study, being implemented in ten provinces. CIPI is a trial aimed at reducing ATS use concomitant with the SMARTgirl HIV prevention program. Methods From 2013 to 2016, 1198 FESW ≥ 18 years old who reported multiple sex partners and/or transactional sex were recruited. We identified 88 HIV-positive women at baseline. We described linkage to care as 12-month retention and viral suppression (&lt;1000 copies/mL). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine correlates of retention in care at 12 months, and viral suppression. Results Median age of the 88 HIV-positive women was 32 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28, 35]; 50% were working in entertainment venues and 50% as freelance sex workers; 70% reported SMARTgirl membership. In the past 3 months, women reported a median of 15 sex partners, 38% reported unprotected sex, and 55% reported using ATS. Overall, 88% were receiving HIV care, 83% were on antiretroviral therapy, 39% were retained in care at 12 months, and 23% were virally suppressed. SMARTgirl membership was independently associated with fourfold greater odds of 12-month retention in care (AOR = 4.16, 95% CI 1.38, 12.56). Those at high risk for an ATS use disorder had 91% lower odds of 12-month retention in care (AOR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01, 0.72). Viral suppression was independently associated with SMARTgirl membership, older age, reporting of STI symptoms, worse symptoms of psychological distress, and greater numbers of sex partners. Conclusions This is the first study to characterize the HIV CoC in Cambodian FESW. While most women were successfully linked to HIV care, retention and viral suppression were low. Tailored programs like SMARTgirl, targeting the broader population of HIV-positive FESW as well as interventions to reduce ATS use could optimize the clinical and population health benefits of HIV treatment.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Women experiencing incarceration (WEI) engage in high rates of sex- and drug-related behavior that places them at risk for HIV. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an efficacious means of reducing HIV acquisition. There is a general lack of knowledge regarding PrEP among women at elevated risk, and only a small percentage of at-risk women are currently engaged in PrEP care. The period of incarceration represents an opportunity to identify at-risk women, initiate PrEP during incarceration, and establish linkage to community-based PrEP care upon release from incarceration. Further, post-release is a time period that is particularly risky, and there are numerous barriers, including substance use, that may impede linkage to community-based care in the absence of intervention. The current protocol describes plans for the development and pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to promote PrEP uptake during incarceration and facilitate linkage to community-based PrEP care post-release. Methods/design The motivational interviewing-navigation (MI-NAV) study intervention is being developed, refined, and tested over three phases within the framework of the social ecological model. All phases of the study are being conducted at a women’s correctional facility and community-based PrEP provider located in the Northeastern region of the United States. Phase 1 consists of individual qualitative interviews to be conducted with key stakeholders (n = 6–10) from the community-based PrEP care site and (n = 6–10) from the women’s correctional facility, as well as with (n = 18–30) WEI. Recruitment for Phase 1 was initiated in November 2017. In Phase 2, MI-NAV will be piloted with a small cohort (n = 8–12) of WEI and will be refined based upon participant feedback. During Phase 3, a pilot RCT of MI-NAV and a standard of care condition will be conducted with 80 WEI. RCT participants will complete baseline and follow-up assessments 1, 3, and 6 months post-release. The primary study outcome is linkage to community-based PrEP care, verified via medical records. Discussion This study will develop and evaluate a psychosocial intervention (MI-NAV) to promote PrEP uptake and facilitate linkage to community-based PrEP care among women at-risk for HIV. It is expected that, as a result of this project, the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of MI-NAV will be determined. If found to be efficacious, this intervention has the potential to reduce HIV acquisition in a high-need, underserved community. Clinical trial registration NCT03281343",

    "abstract": "In Dar es Salaam Tanzania, the first opioid treatment program (OTP) in Sub-Saharan Africa, had very high rates of enrollment of people who use drugs (PWUD) but low rates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation among HIV-positive patients. The integrated methadone and anti-retroviral therapy (IMAT) intervention was developed to integrate HIV services into the OTP clinic. The objective of this paper is to better understand the contextual factors that influence the effectiveness of IMAT implementation using the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR). Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 35 HIV-positive OTP patients and 8 OTP providers at the Muhimbili National Hospital OTP clinic 6-months after IMAT implementation. Providers were asked about their reactions to and opinions of the IMAT intervention including its implementation, their role in patient education, intervention procedures, and ART dispensing. Interviews with patients focused on their experiences with the IMAT intervention and adapting to the new protocol. Analysis of interview data was guided by the CFIR. The CFIR constructs found to be driving forces behind facilitating or impeding IMAT implementation were: intervention characteristics (e.g. complexity, adaptability and evidence related to IMAT), outer setting (e.g. patient needs and resources), and inner setting (e.g. compatibility of IMAT and available resources for IMAT). The most significant barrier to implementation identified in interviews was availability of resources, including workforce limitations and lack of space given patient load. OTP providers and patients felt the design of the IMAT intervention allowed for adaptability to meet the needs of providers and patients. Understanding the contextual factors that influence implementation is critical to the success of interventions that seek to integrate HIV services into existing programs for key populations such as PWUD. Approximately 4 months after IMAT implementation, the OTP clinic adopted a 'test-and-treat' model for HIV-positive PWUD, which significantly impacted clinic workload as well as the care context. In this study we highlight the importance of intervention characteristics and resources, as key facilitators and barriers to implementation, that should be actively integrated into intervention protocols to increase implementation success. Similar interventions in other low-resource settings should address the ways intervention characteristics and contextual factors, such as adaptability, complexity and available resources impact implementation in specific care contexts.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption among Indigenous Australians can involve a stop-start pattern of drinking, with consumption well above recommended guidelines on each occasion. Such intermittent drinking patterns can make screening for risky drinking difficult. This study evaluates the ability of several short alcohol screening tools, contained in the Grog Survey Application, to detect short- or long-term risky drinking as defined by Australian guidelines. Tested tools include a modification of Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-Cm). Alcohol consumption was assessed in current drinkers in the past year (n = 184) using AUDIT-Cm and using the last four drinking occasions (Finnish method). Sensitivity and specificity were assessed relative to the Finnish method, for how AUDIT-Cm score (3 + for women, 4 + for men), and how subsets of AUDIT-Cm questions (AUDIT-1m and AUDIT-2m; and AUDIT-3mV alone) were able to determine short- or long-term risk from drinking. Responses to AUDIT-Cm were used to calculate the average standard drinks consumed per day, and the frequency at which more than four standard drinks were consumed on single occasions. Finally, shorter versions of the Finnish method (1, 2, or 3 occasions of drinking) were compared to the full Finnish method, by examining the percentage of variance retained by shorter versions. AUDIT-Cm has a high sensitivity in detecting at-risk drinking compared with the Finnish method (sensitivity = 99%, specificity = 67%). The combination of AUDIT-1m and AUDIT-2m was able to classify the drinking risk status for all but four individuals in the same way as the Finnish method did. For the Finnish method, two drinking sessions to calculate drinks per drinking occasion, and four to calculate frequency resulted in nearly identical estimates to data on all four of the most recent drinking occasions (r2 = 0.997). The combination of AUDIT-1m and AUDIT-2m may offer advantages as a short screening tool, over AUDIT-3mV, in groups where intermittent and high per occasion drinking is common. As an alternative to the full Finnish method, the quantity consumed on the last two occasions and timing of the last four occasions may provide a practical short screening tool.",

    "abstract": "Tobacco use is a chronic relapsing disease, and remains the leading cause of preventable death in much of the world. Increasingly, tobacco use, chiefly cigarette smoking, is being framed as a chronic disease, with periods of use and periods of abstinence. An implicit component of this conceptualization is that treatment—both counseling and pharmacotherapy—may be needed at various intervals for extended periods of time, perhaps over an individual's lifetime. This would mirror the treatment of other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Yet, clinical trials of tobacco dependence treatment still generally model outcome measures in terms of cessation, abstinence, or quitting, measured at discrete time points. This reinforces the notion that smoking, or tobacco dependence, is a dichotomous condition, and that one is either \"cured,\" or not. Although the goal of treating tobacco dependence is to ensure long-term abstinence (i.e. \"quitting\"), this model is discordant with clinical reality, in which of periods of tobacco use are interspersed with periods of abstinence. Hence, the goal of treatment is to lengthen the duration of the latter, while shortening the duration of the former. In the clinical arena, this dichotomous model of tobacco use is reflected in electronic health records, where smoking is generally categorized as current, former, or never. We propose that clinicians move away from the dichotomous categorization of tobacco use, and adopt methods used to categorize the status of other chronic conditions. Specifically, biomarkers such as carbon monoxide, cotinine, and anabasine, measured at regular intervals, can provide clinicians with much clearer, clinically relevant and actionable assessments of current tobacco use by their patients. This can be done without making reference to dichotomous states such as current or former use of tobacco. In psychological terms, one can frame tobacco use in terms of states, attributes in specific situations at discrete moments in time, rather than the more durable traits.",

    "abstract": "Khat, a plant native to East Africa, has psychoactive constituents similar to amphetamine. Chronic khat use can lead to psychological dependence with multiple physical and mental health harms, complicating clinical management of people living with HIV. In two Ethiopian cities where khat is common, we evaluated prevalence and correlates of khat use among patients new to HIV care. During 2013–2014, we surveyed 322 patients recently enrolled in HIV clinics in Dire Dawa and Harar about khat use, demographics, smoking and alcohol use, clinical illness, food insecurity, and social support. We analyzed factors associated with khat use in the past year, as well as heaviest use of khat (based on greatest number of hours used in a typical month). 242 (75%) respondents reported lifetime khat use; 209 (65%) reported khat use during the previous year. 54% of khat users started before age 19 years. Although 84% believed that using khat every day is dangerous for health if you have HIV, khat was used in the previous year a median of 5 h/days and 30 days/month; 21% said they felt a need to cut down or control their khat use but had difficulty doing so. Those using khat were more likely to report smoking (46%) and alcohol use (49%) compared to non-khat users (1 and 31% respectively). Those reporting heaviest khat use (≥180 h/typical month) were more likely to rate their health status as poor, have an underweight BMI (≤18.5 kg/m2), report more symptoms of chronic illness, and agree with more statements indicating a negative physical quality of life. In multivariate analysis, heavy users were more likely to be male, Muslim, and non-married. Khat use was common among HIV patients entering care, and associated with symptoms of poorer physical health. Over half started khat use when they were young. Although most believed khat is harmful for HIV patients, a number of respondents reported some difficulty controlling their drug use. In settings where khat is legal and widely utilized, developing interventions for responsible use represent an important health priority as part of comprehensive care for people living with HIV.",

    "abstract": "Youth involved in the juvenile justice system (YIJJ) have high rates of substance use problems; however, rates of YIJJ engagement in substance use services is low. Barriers to service engagement include lack of appropriate screening and connection to services by the juvenile justice system, as well as lack of resources for delivering evidence-based treatment in community-based settings. To address these barriers, this paper describes a protocol for a type 1 hybrid design to (1) implement universal substance use screening for YIJJ; (2) implement and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a brief, three-session substance use interventions based in motivational interviewing for youth with mild/moderate substance use: Teen Intervene (an individual-based intervention); (3) implement ENCOMPASS, an evidence-based substance use intervention based in motivational enhancement and cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with severe substance use; and (4) evaluate facilitators and barriers to implementing these interventions for mild to severe substance use among YIJJ in community mental health centers (CMHC). Using a hybrid type 1 clinical effectiveness-implementation design, we will collaborate with CMHCs and juvenile justice in two rural Indiana counties. Guided by the EPIS (exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainability) framework, we will measure factors that affect implementation of substance use screening in juvenile justice and implementation of substance use interventions in CMHCs utilizing self-reports and qualitative interviews with juvenile justice and CMHC staff pre- and post-implementation. YIJJ with mild/moderate substance use will receive a brief interventions and YIJJ with severe substance use will receive ENCOMPASS. We will measure the effectiveness of a brief and comprehensive intervention by assessing changes in substance use across treatment. We anticipate recruiting 160 YIJJ and their caregivers into the study. We will assess intervention outcomes utilizing baseline, 3-, and 6-month assessments. Findings have the potential to improve screening and intervention services for YIJJ.",

They also completed baseline questionnaires assessing alcohol consumption and hazardous drinking behaviors.Participants completed an average of 22 of 28 breathalyzer readings and 17 of 28 mobile surveys, and were more likely to complete daytime (vs. evening) monitoring tasks. Results suggested that self-reported frequency of binge drinking at baseline was related to an increased number of days with alcohol consumption according to breathalyzer and mobile surveys, as well as a higher average blood alcohol content. Qualitative interviews found generally positive attitudes toward the technologies, but some participants reported experiencing technical difficulties.Overall, this preliminary research suggests that smartphone monitoring of alcohol consumption among PLWHA may reflect cross-sectional self-reported alcohol consumption behaviors, but could use improvements to increase adherence to monitoring tasks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Young people experiencing homelessness have alarmingly high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, which is associated with sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, trading sex, and sex with multiple casual partners. Few risk reduction programs for this population have been developed and rigorously evaluated, particularly those that address both of these interrelated behaviors, use a collaborative and non-judgmental approach, and are feasible to deliver in settings where homeless young people seek services. This paper describes the protocol of a study evaluating a four-session Motivational Interviewing (MI)-based group risk reduction intervention for this population. The protocol has been shown to be efficacious in pilot work over 3 months with 200 homeless young adults [1]. The current study seeks to refine the intervention protocol and evaluate the program on a larger scale. Methods/design In a cluster-cross-over randomized controlled trial, 18–25 year olds will receive the AWARE risk reduction program (n = 200) or standard care (n = 200) at one of three drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. We will evaluate intervention effects on primary outcomes of AOD use and sexual risk behavior, as well as secondary outcomes of health-related quality of life and social stability, over a 12-month period. Discussion This project has the potential to fill a significant gap in prevention services by demonstrating that a brief intervention, feasible to deliver within settings where young people experiencing homelessness typically seeks services, can significantly reduce the interrelated problems of AOD use and sexual risk behavior.

    "abstract": "Young adult veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan represent a population at-risk for heavy and problematic alcohol use. Unfortunately, few seek treatment for alcohol concerns and those that do seek care may drop out from lengthy multicomponent treatments. Additionally, veterans who live in rural areas and those who are not engaged in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System are often overlooked, difficult to engage in treatment, and may not be actively seeking treatment for heavy patterns of use that may develop into an alcohol use disorder. The objective of this proposed randomized controlled trial is to develop and pilot test a brief, stand-alone Internet-based alcohol intervention with young adult veterans to help them reduce their drinking and prevent the development of problematic alcohol use. Recruitment and intervention is delivered entirely over the Internet to address barriers to seeking care among this at-risk group. The online intervention consists of an assessment followed by a single module of personalized normative feedback (PNF), which provides individuals with accurate information to reduce misperceptions regarding the frequency and acceptability of risky peer behavior. PNF has established efficacy as included within multicomponent interventions targeting military populations or as a stand-alone intervention with young adult college students, but has not yet been empirically supported for the at-risk veteran population. This paper describes the development of the PNF intervention content and details the protocol for the intervention study, which will utilize a sample of 600 young adult veterans to examine the efficacy of the brief PNF intervention targeted toward reducing perceived norms, intentions to drink, actual drinking behavior, and consequences. Specific subpopulations of this veteran population, including those with mental health concerns and those differentiated by level of drinking problems, reasons for drinking, and connection to peers, will be examined to support generalizability of the intervention. This intervention has the potential to improve veteran health care by utilizing a novel approach to increase access to care, assist with drinking reductions, and prevent alcohol-related problems.

    "abstract": "Abstract There is an urgent need for strategies to address the US epidemic of prescription opioid, heroin and fentanyl-related overdoses, misuse, addiction, and diversion. Evidence-based treatment such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are available but lack numbers of providers offering these services to meet the demands. Availability of electronic health record (EHR) systems has greatly increased and led to innovative quality improvement initiatives but this has not yet been optimized to address the opioid epidemic or to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). This report from a clinical decision support (CDS) working group convened by the NIDA Center for the Clinical Trials Network aims to converge electronic technology in the EHR with the urgent need to improve screening, identification, and treatment of OUD in primary care settings through the development of a CDS algorithm that could be implemented as a tool in the EHR. This aim is consistent with federal, state and local government and private sector efforts to improve access and quality of MOUD treatment for OUD, existing clinical quality and HEDIS measures for OUD or drug and alcohol use disorders, and with a recent draft grade B recommendation from the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) for screening for illicit drug use in adults when appropriate diagnosis, treatment and care services can be offered or referred. Through a face-to-face expert panel meeting and multiple follow-up conference calls, the working group drafted CDS algorithms for clinical care felt to be essential for screening, diagnosis, and management of OUD in primary care. The CDS algorithm was reviewed by addiction specialists and primary care providers and revised based on their input. A clinical decision support tool for OUD screening, assessment, and treatment within primary care systems may help improve healthcare delivery to help address the current epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose that has outpaced the capacity of specialized treatment settings. A semi-structured outline of clinical decision support for OUD was developed to facilitate implementation within the EHR. Further work for adaptation at specific sites and for testing is needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid-related overdoses and harms have been declared a public health emergency in the United States, highlighting an urgent need to implement evidence-based treatments. Contingency management (CM) is one of the most effective behavioral interventions when delivered in combination with medication for opioid use disorder, but its implementation in opioid treatment programs is woefully limited. Project MIMIC (Maximizing Implementation of Motivational Incentives in Clinics) was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to identify effective strategies for helping opioid treatment programs improve CM implementation as an adjunct to medication. Specific aims will test the impact of two different strategies on implementation outcomes (primary aim) and patient outcomes (secondary aims), as well as test putative mediators of implementation effectiveness (exploratory aim). Methods A 3-cohort, cluster-randomized, type 3 hybrid design is used with the opioid treatment programs as the unit of randomization. Thirty programs are randomized to one of two conditions. The control condition is the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network implementation strategy, which consists of three core approaches: didactic training, performance feedback, and on-going consultation. The experimental condition is an enhanced ATTC strategy, with the same core ATTC elements plus two additional theory-driven elements. The two additional elements are Pay-for-Performance, which aims to increase implementing staff’s extrinsic motivations, and Implementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation, which targets staff’s intrinsic motivations. Data will be collected using a novel, CM Tracker tool to document CM session delivery, session audio recordings, provider surveys, and patient surveys. Implementation outcomes include CM Exposure (number of CM sessions delivered per patient), CM Skill (ratings of CM fidelity), and CM Sustainment (number of patients receiving CM after removal of support). Patient outcomes include self-reported opioid abstinence and opioid-related problems (both assessed at 3- and 6-months post-baseline). Discussion There is urgent public health need to improve the implementation of CM as an adjunct to medication for opioid use disorder. Consistent with its hybrid type 3 design, Project MIMIC is advancing implementation science by comparing impacts of these two multifaceted strategies on both implementation and patient outcomes, and by examining the extent to which the impacts of those strategies can be explained by putative mediators.

    "abstract": "Randomized trials of complex interventions are increasingly including qualitative components to further understand factors that contribute to their success. In this paper, we explore the experiences of health care practitioners in a province wide smoking cessation program (the Smoking Treatment for Ontario Patients program) who participated in the COMBAT trial. This trial examined if the addition of an electronic prompt embedded in a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)-designed to prompt practitioners to Screen, provide a Brief intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to patients who drank alcohol above the amounts recommended by the Canadian Cancer Society guidelines-influenced the proportion of practitioners delivering a brief intervention to their eligible patients. We wanted to understand the factors influencing implementation and acceptability of delivering a brief alcohol intervention for treatment-seeking smokers for health care providers who had access to the CDSS (intervention arm) and those who did not (control arm). Twenty-three health care practitioners were selected for a qualitative interview using stratified purposeful sampling (12 from the control arm and 11 from the intervention arm). Interviews were 45 to 90 min in length and conducted by phone using an interview guide that was informed by the National Implementation Research Network's Hexagon tool. Interview recordings were transcribed and coded iteratively between three researchers to achieve consensus on emerging themes. The preliminary coding structure was developed using the National Implementation Research Network's Hexagon Tool framework and data was analyzed using the framework analysis approach. Seventy eight percent (18/23) of the health care practitioners interviewed recognized the need to simultaneously address alcohol and tobacco use. Seventy four percent (17/23), were knowledgeable about the evidence of health risks associated with dual alcohol and tobacco use but 57% (13/23) expressed concerns with using the Canadian Cancer Society guidelines to screen for alcohol use. Practitioners acknowledged the value of adding a validated screening tool to the STOP program's baseline questionnaire (19/23); however, following through with a brief intervention and referral to treatment proved challenging due to lack of training, limited time, and fear of stigmatizing patients. Practitioners in the intervention arm (5/11; 45%) might not follow the recommendations from CDSS if these recommendations are not perceived as beneficial to the patients. The results of the study show that practitioners' beliefs were reflective of the current social norms around alcohol use and this influenced their decision to offer a brief alcohol intervention. Future interventions need to emphasize both organizational and sociocultural factors as part of the design. The results of this study point to the need to change social norms regarding alcohol in order to effectively implement interventions that target both alcohol and tobacco use in primary care clinics.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) often co-occur in adolescent patients. Previous research has shown that these patients differ from SUD patients without PTSD in terms of their substance use patterns. In this study, we aimed to test whether substance use in this population is related to an attempt to self-medicate PTSD-related symptoms. Methods German adolescent patients (aged 13–18 years) at an outpatient clinic for SUD treatment, n = 111 (43% female), completed a self-designed questionnaire on use motives, a measure of PTSD-related experiences, and underwent a standardized psychiatric interview including structured substance use questions. Participants were subsequently classified as ‘no traumatic experiences (‘noTEs’ but SUD), ‘traumatic experiences but no current PTSD diagnosis’ (‘TEs’ with SUD), and ‘PTSD’ with SUD. After establishing a self-designed motive measurement through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, we calculated non-parametric group differences and a mediation analysis in a linear regression framework. Results The past-year frequency of MDMA use was highest in the PTSD group and lowest in the noTE group ( H (2) = 7.2, p = .027, η 2 = .058), but no differences were found for frequencies of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, or stimulant use (all H ≤ 4.9, p ≥ .085, η 2 ≤ .033). While controlling for sex, the three groups showed a similar pattern (highest in the PTSD group and lowest in the noTE group) for coping scores ( F (103) = 5.77, p = .004, η 2 = .101). Finally, mediation analyses revealed an indirect effect of coping score ( b = 0.61, 95% CI [0.29, 1.58], p = .145) on the association between group membership and MDMA use frequency. Conclusions In adolescent SUD patients, we found an association of current PTSD and lifetime traumatic experiences with higher MDMA use that could be partially explained by substance use being motivated by an attempt to cope with mental health symptoms. This indicates a coping process involved specifically in MDMA use compared to the use of other psychoactive substances, possibly due to unique psychoactive effects of MDMA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hospitalizations involving opioid use disorder (OUD) have been increasing among Medicare beneficiaries of all ages. With rising OUD-related acute care use comes the need to understand where post-acute care is provided and the capacities for OUD treatment in those settings. Our objective was to describe hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries with OUD, their post-acute care locations, and all-cause mortality and readmissions stratified by post-acute care location. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of acute hospitalizations using 2016–2018 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) files linked to Medicare enrollment data and the Residential History File (RHF) for 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. The RHF which provides a person-level chronological history of health service utilization and locations of care was used to identify hospital discharge locations. We used ICD-10 codes for opioid dependence or “abuse” to identify OUD diagnoses from the MedPAR file. We conducted logistic regression to identify factors associated with discharge to an institutional setting versus home adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and hospital stay characteristics. Results Our analysis included 459,763 hospitalized patients with OUD. Of these, patients aged &lt; 65 years and those dually enrolled in Medicaid comprised the majority (59.1%). OUD and opioid overdose were primary diagnoses in 14.3% and 6.2% of analyzed hospitalizations, respectively. We found that 70.3% of hospitalized patients with OUD were discharged home, 15.8% to a skilled nursing facility (SNF), 9.6% to a non-SNF institutional facility, 2.5% home with home health services, and 1.8% died in-hospital. Within 30 days of hospital discharge, rates of readmissions and mortality were 29.7% and 3.9%; respectively, with wide variation across post-acute locations. Factors associated with greater odds of discharge to institutional settings were older age, female sex, non-Hispanic White race and ethnicity, dual enrollment, longer hospital stay, more comorbidities, intensive care use, surgery, and primary diagnoses including opioid or other drug overdoses, fractures, and septicemia. Conclusions More than one-quarter (25.8%) of hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries with OUD received post-acute care in a setting other than home. High rates and wide variation in all-cause readmissions and mortality within 30 days post-discharge emphasize the need for improved post-acute care for people with OUD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In 2010, the first comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States was released and included three goals: (1) reducing the number of people who become infected with HIV, (2) increasing access to care and improving health outcomes for people living with HIV, and (3) reducing HIV-related health disparities and health inequities. In 2013, as part of its effort to help address the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) funded a type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial titled the Substance Abuse Treatment to HIV Care (SAT2HIV) Project. Aim 1 of the SAT2HIV Project tests the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing-based brief intervention (MIBI) for substance use as an adjunct to usual care within AIDS Service Organizations (ASOs) as part of its MIBI Experiment. Aim 2 of the SAT2HIV Project tests the effectiveness of implementation and sustainment facilitation (ISF) as an adjunct to the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) model for training staff in motivational interviewing as part of its ISF Experiment. The current paper describes the study protocol for the MIBI Experiment. Methods As part of a multisite randomized controlled trial, individuals with comorbid HIV/AIDS and problematic substance use are randomized to receive either the ASOs’ usual care (control condition) or usual care plus a MIBI for substance use (experimental condition) delivered by trained ASO case-management staff. Primary outcome measures are reductions in days of primary substance use, number of substance-related problems, times engaging in risky behaviors, days of non-adherence to HIV medications, and increases in substance use treatment. As part of this paper, we describe the trial protocol in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials guidelines. Discussion If successfully able to implement MIBI as an effective adjunct to usual care, the current trial may have a significant impact on increasing the capacity of ASOs to address problematic substance use among individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Reducing the prevalence of problematic substance use among individuals living with HIV/AIDS within the United States may lead to significant improvements on key performance measures (i.e., the HIV Care Continuum and the 90-90-90 target).

    "abstract": "Individuals with substance use disorders can receive important abstinence-specific support in 12-step groups (TSGs). However, our understanding of key factors that influence TSG participation remains limited. This study used an extended version of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to enhance the understanding of TSG affiliation. Data were retrieved from a controlled trial of a 12-step facilitation intervention conducted on an inpatient detoxification ward in Norway (N = 140). Surveys at baseline included a TPB questionnaire. The behavioral target was to attend at least two TSG meetings per month in the 6-month follow-up period. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the predictors of behavior at follow-up. We found that attitudes, the moral norm, and perceived behavior control accounted for 81 % of the variance in the intention to participate regularly in TSGs after treatment. Subjective norms did not significantly influence the intention to participate. Moreover, the intention to participate significantly predicted behavior (β = 0.42, p < 0.001). In contrast to theory, there was a substantial, model-independent pathway from past to later behavior (β = 0.22, p = 0.047). The model explained 46 % (p < 0.001) of the variance in behavior. Attending ≥ 12 TSG meetings in the follow-up period was associated with a high percentage of abstinent days at follow-up (β = 0.38, p = 0.023). The present TPB questionnaire worked well for assessing patient intentions to attend a TSG. Treatment providers should encourage patient intentions to participate in TSGs post-detoxification.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes an innovative protocol for a type-II hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial that is evaluating a smoking cessation telephone care coordination program for Veterans Health Administration (VA) mental-health clinic patients. As a hybrid trial, the protocol combines implementation science and clinical trial methods and outcomes that can inform future cessation studies and the implementation of tobacco cessation programs into routine care. The primary objectives of the trial are (1) to evaluate the process of adapting, implementing, and sustaining a smoking cessation telephone care coordination program in VA mental health clinics, (2) to determine the effectiveness of the program in promoting long-term abstinence from smoking among mental health patients, and (3) to compare the effectiveness of telephone counseling delivered by VA staff with that delivered by state quitlines. The care coordination program is being implemented at six VA facilities. VA mental health providers refer patients to the program via an electronic medical record consult. Program staff call referred patients to offer enrollment. All patients who enroll receive a self-help booklet, mailed smoking cessation medications, and proactive multi-call telephone counseling. Participants are randomized to receive this counseling from VA staff or their state’s quitline. Four primary implementation strategies are being used to optimize program implementation and sustainability: blended facilitation, provider training, informatics support, and provider feedback. A three-phase formative evaluation is being conducted to identify barriers to, and facilitators for, program implementation and sustainability. A mixed-methods approach is being used to collect quantitative clinical effectiveness data (e.g., self-reported abstinence at six months) and both quantitative and qualitative implementation data (e.g., provider referral rates, coded interviews with providers). Summative data will be analyzed using the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. This paper describes the rationale and methods of a trial designed to simultaneously study the clinical effectiveness and implementation of a telephone smoking cessation program for smokers using VA mental health clinics. Such hybrid designs are an important methodological design that can shorten the time between the development of an intervention and its translation into routine clinical care.

    "abstract": "Adolescents in residential substance use disorder (SUD) treatment have poor outcomes post-discharge, with follow-up studies suggesting that most adolescents relapse within 90 days. Parenting practices directly influence adolescent SUD outcomes, but parents of adolescents with SUDs are difficult to engage in traditional behavioral treatments. The current study adapts and evaluates a technology-assisted intervention for parents of adolescents in residential SUD treatment. Based on pilot qualitative data with parents, adolescents, and residential staff, we augment an existing computerized intervention (Parenting Wisely; PW) with four in-person coaching sessions, personalized text messages, and an expert-moderated online parent message board. We hypothesize that parents will find enhanced PW (PW+) both feasible and acceptable, and that adolescents whose parents receive PW+ will have better post-discharge outcomes than adolescents who receive standard care (SC) only. A two phase approach is used to adapt and evaluate PW+. Phase 1 consists of an open trial with 10 parents of adolescents (age 12–17) in residential SUD treatment. Post-discharge qualitative and quantitative data from parents and adolescents will support PW+ refinement. Phase 2 is a randomized pilot trial with 60 parents testing the effectiveness of adding PW+ to SC. Adolescents and parents will complete assessments at baseline, 6-, 12-, and 24-weeks post-discharge. Primary outcomes will be measures of feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes will include adolescent substance use, truancy, high-risk sexual behavior, and criminal involvement. Two parenting processes (monitoring and communication) are examined as potential mediators of change. This study will adapt and evaluate a technology-assisted parenting intervention as a means of improving adolescent outcomes following residential SUD treatment. Results have the potential to advance the field by: addressing a high-risk population, improving parental engagement; targeting parenting practices (putative mediators of change) that have been linked to adolescent outcomes; and developing a highly disseminable approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Most patients with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) never receive alcohol treatment, and experts have recommended management of AUDs in primary care. The Choosing Healthier Drinking Options In primary CarE (CHOICE) trial was a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of a novel intervention for primary care patients at high risk for AUDs. This report describes the conceptual and scientific foundation of the CHOICE model of care, critical elements of the CHOICE trial design consistent with the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR), results of recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the enrolled sample. Methods The CHOICE intervention is a multi-contact, extended counseling intervention, based on the Chronic Care Model, shared decision-making, motivational interviewing, and evidence-based options for managing AUDs, designed to be practical in primary care. Outpatients who received care at 3 Veterans Affairs primary care sites in the Pacific Northwest and reported frequent heavy drinking (≥4 drinks/day for women; ≥5 for men) were recruited (2011–2014) into a trial in which half of the participants would be offered additional alcohol-related care from a nurse. CHOICE nurses offered 12 months of patient-centered care, including proactive outreach and engagement, repeated brief motivational interventions, monitoring with and without alcohol biomarkers, medications for AUDs, and/or specialty alcohol treatment as appropriate and per patient preference. A CHOICE nurse practitioner was available to prescribe medications for AUDs. Results A total of 304 patients consented to participate in the CHOICE trial. Among consenting participants, 90% were men, the mean age was 51 (range 22–75), and most met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse (14%) or dependence (59%). Many participants also screened positive for tobacco use (44%), depression (45%), anxiety disorders (30-41%) and non-tobacco drug use disorders (19%). At baseline, participants had a median AUDIT score of 18 [Interquartile range (IQR) 14–24] and a median readiness to change drinking score of 5 (IQR 2.75–6.25) on a 1–10 Likert scale. Conclusion The CHOICE trial tested a patient-centered intervention for AUDs and recruited primary care patients at high risk for AUDs, with a spectrum of severity, co-morbidity, and readiness to change drinking.

    "abstract": "Engaging people who drink alcohol or inject drugs in HIV care can be challenging, particularly in Eastern Europe. Healthcare facilities in Russia are organized by specialty; therefore linking patients from addiction care to HIV hospitals has been difficult. The HIV care cascade outlines stages of HIV care (e.g., linkage to care, prescribed antiretroviral therapy [ART], and achieving HIV viral suppression). We hypothesized that unhealthy alcohol use, injection drug use, and opioid craving are associated with unfavorable HIV care cascade outcomes. We analyzed data from a cohort (n = 249) of HIV-positive Russians who have been in addiction hospital treatment in the past year and had a lifetime history of injection drug use (IDU). We evaluated the association between unhealthy alcohol use (AUDIT score > 7 [both hazardous drinking and dependence]), past-month injection drug use (IDU), and opioid craving (visual analogue scale from 1 to 100) with HIV care cascade outcomes. The primary outcome was linkage to HIV care within 12 months. Other outcomes were prescription of ART (secondary) and achievement of undetectable HIV viral load (HVL < 500 copies/mL) within 12 months (exploratory); the latter was analyzed on a subset in which HVL was measured (n = 48). We assessed outcomes via medical record review (linkage, ART) and serum tests (HVL). To examine the primary outcome, we used multiple logistic regression models controlling for potential confounders. Among 249 study participants, unhealthy alcohol use (n = 148 [59%]) and past-month IDU (n = 130 [52%]) were common. The mean opioid craving score was 49 (SD: 38). We were unable to detect significant associations between the independent variables (i.e., unhealthy alcohol use, IDU and opioid craving) and any HIV care cascade outcomes in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. In this cohort of HIV-positive Russians with a history of IDU, individual substance use factors were not significantly associated with achieving HIV care cascade milestones (i.e., linkage to HIV care; prescription for ART; or suppressed viral load). Given no detection of an association of cascade outcomes with recent unhealthy use of alcohol or injection drugs in this cohort, examining systemic factors to understand determinants of HIV care engagement for people with drug use would be important.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid addiction and overdose are epidemic in the U.S. Victims of traumatic injury are at greater than average risk for opioid misuse and related complications. Potential risk screens and preventive interventions in this clinical population remain under-investigated. The current project seeks to develop and pilot the implementation of a screening tool for opioid risk at American College of Surgeons (ACS) Level I and Level II trauma centers. Methods The project began with an online survey, which was sent to Wisconsin trauma center medical directors and trauma coordinators for the purpose of gathering information on current substance use screening practices. Next, a focus group of trauma center staff was convened to discuss barriers and facilitators to screening, resources available and needed to support trauma patients with opioid use disorders, and measurable clinical observations that could indicate a patient’s potential risk for opioid misuse. Data from the surveys and focus group were combined to inform the data collection instruments that are currently being administered to patients recruited from the University of Wisconsin Hospital Trauma Inpatient and Orthopedic Surgery Services. Eligible and consenting patients complete standardized measures of socio-demographics, substance use history, opioid misuse risk, mental health, medical history, and injury and pain severity. Follow up visits at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after hospital discharge assess hypothesized risk factors for opioid addiction and opioid use disorder diagnosis. At the completion of patient data collection, a forward stepwise regression will identify factors of most significant risk of the development of opioid use disorder after traumatic injury. This modeling will inform the development of a novel opioid risk screening tool, which will undergo pilot implementation at 4 Wisconsin ACS Level I and Level II trauma centers, using an evidence-based implementation strategy with roots in systems engineering. Discussion Positive findings from the proposed work would lead to improved, standardized opioid risk screening practices among victims of traumatic injury. The ultimate goal of this and future work is to reduce the likelihood of opioid misuse, addiction, and related complications, such as overdose and death.

    "abstract": "Screening and brief intervention (SBI) for unhealthy drinking has not been widely implemented in primary care partly due to reliance on physicians to perform it. We implemented a model of nursing staff-delivered SBI for unhealthy drinking for adult patients receiving primary care at an academically-affiliated Federally Qualified Health Center in the Bronx, NY. Our model consisted of nursing staff screening all patients with the alcohol use disorders identification test consumption questions (AUDIT-C) and, if screening positive, providing BI or referral to specialty services. We developed a clinical decision support tool integrated into the electronic health record to guide nursing staff and record SBI provision. To evaluate this model, we determined overall SBI delivery to patients and factors associated with receiving SBI. Between October 2013 and September 2014, 9119 unique adult patients made 24,285 visits. Patients were majority women (67.5%) and Hispanic/Latino (54.5%). Overall, 46.2% were screened, with 19.0–35.8% of eligible patients screened in each month. Increasing age (OR: 0.82 [95% CI 0.80–0.85] for a 10-year increase), female sex (OR: 0.83 [95% CI 0.77–0.91]), and chronic conditions like hypertension (OR: 0.62 [95% CI 0.56–0.70]) and diabetes (OR: 0.66 [95% CI 0.58–0.75]), among others, were associated with a lower odds of being screened. Of all patients screened, 225 (5.3%) screened positive and of those patients, 122 (54.2%) received a BI. Patients with higher AUDIT-C scores were more likely to receive a BI (OR: 1.24 [95% CI 1.04–1.47] for a 1-point increase) and non-English speaking patients were less likely to receive a BI than those who spoke English (OR: 0.42 [95% CI 0.18–0.97]). Our model of SBI resulted in screening of nearly half of all eligible patients and BI provision to over half of those screening positive. Future efforts to improve SBI delivery should focus on groups such as older adults, women, and those with chronic medical conditions.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about tobacco smoking behaviors of healthcare professionals in the Middle East where stress conditions are high and tobacco smoking regulations are either absent or loose. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of and attitudes toward tobacco smoking among healthcare professionals.Trained senior medical students conducted a cross-sectional survey study in all governmental and non-governmental hospitals in Nablus city (Palestine) using a self-administered questionnaire containing both open-and closed-ended questions.In total, 708 healthcare professionals participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 31.4 ± 9.6 years. Forty-five (6.4%) participants were ex-smokers, 419 (59.2%) were never smokers, and 244 (34.5%) were current tobacco smokers. One hundred and forty-two (58.2%) tobacco smokers reported that they smoke inside the hospital and 119 (48.8%) reported that they think of quitting smoking. Univariate analysis indicated that age, gender, marital status, family history of tobacco smoking, country of graduation, and night shifts were significantly associated with tobacco smoking status. No significant difference (p = 0.156) in prevalence of tobacco smoking was found between physicians and other healthcare professionals. Binary logistic regression indicated that older age, male gender, and having a positive family history of smoking were significant predictors of being a current tobacco smoker. Non-smokers had significantly higher frequency of patient counseling than current smokers.Palestinian healthcare professionals have relatively higher prevalence of tobacco smoking compared to the general population. Urgent national intervention and strict implementation of \"No Smoking Law\" in health institutions and in public places are needed to root out this negative behavior.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alarming rates of unhealthy alcohol, non-prescription drug, and tobacco use highlight the preventable health risks of substance abuse and the urgent need to activate clinicians to recognize and treat risky use. Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is an efficacious and effective processes to identify, reduce and prevent risky use of substances. This paper describes a study protocol testing implementation of a toolkit to enhance use of SBIRT in acute care settings to recognize and address patient risky alcohol, drug, and tobacco use. Methods This study uses a phased cluster randomized mixed method design to test nurse-led implementation of an SBIRT toolkit on one medical-surgical unit at 14 acute care hospitals (critical access, community and academic health centers). Medical surgical units will be randomly assigned to implement the SBIRT toolkit (engagement and communication, assessment, planning, training, and evaluation tools) or a wait-list usual care control group that begins implementation 6 months later. Primary endpoints are documentation of SBIRT delivery in randomly selected electronic medical records at baseline, 6 months and 12 months after group 1 implementation (61 records per unit per time period, N = 2562). Two surveys will be administered to unit nurses: smoking cessation activities will be assessed at baseline and SBIRT use will be assessed on randomly-selected days after implementation. In addition, site coordinators will complete a baseline capacity assessment, an implementation fidelity survey post-implementation, and a structured interview at the end of the study. Multilevel mixed-effects effects logistic and linear models will be used to analyze use of SBIRT and cost outcomes. Discussion This study will guide subsequent SBIRT implementation, dissemination, and spread across rural, community and urban healthcare systems throughout the state and beyond. The long-term objective is to activate clinicians to recognize, intervene and refer people with risky substance use to improve health and decrease substance use disorders.

The association between primary care engagement (i.e., longitudinal utilization of primary care services) and prescribing of AUD pharmacotherapy is unknown. We examined a 5-year (2010–2014) retrospective cohort of patients with AUD, 18 years and older, at an urban academic medical center in the Bronx, NY, USA. Our main exposure was level of primary care engagement (no primary care, limited primary care, and engaged with primary care) and our outcome was any AUD pharmacotherapy prescription within 2 years of AUD diagnosis. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined the association between primary care engagement and pharmacotherapy prescribing, accounting for demographic and clinical factors. Of 21,159 adults (28.9% female) with AUD, 2.1% (n = 449) were prescribed pharmacotherapy. After adjusting for confounders, the probability of receiving an AUD pharmacotherapy prescription for patients with no primary care was 1.61% (95% CI 1.39, 1.84). The probability of AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing was 2.56% (95% CI 2.06, 3.06) for patients with limited primary care and 2.89% (95% CI 2.44, 3.34%) for patients engaged with primary care. The percentage of AUD patients prescribed AUD pharmacotherapy was low; however, primary care engagement was associated with a higher, but modest, probability of receiving a prescription. Efforts to increase primary care engagement among patients with AUD may translate into increased AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing; however, strategies to increase prescribing across health care settings are needed.",

    "abstract": "The continued escalation of opioid use disorder (OUD) calls for heightened vigilance to implement evidence-based care across the US. Rural care providers and patients have limited resources, and a number of barriers exist that can impede necessary OUD treatment services. This paper reports the design and protocol of an implementation study seeking to advance availability of medication assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD in rural Pennsylvania counties for patients insured by Medicaid in primary care settings. This project was a hybrid implementation study. Within a chronic care model paradigm, we employed the Framework for Systems Transformation to implement the American Society for Addiction Medicine care model for the use of medications in the treatment of OUD. In partnership with state leadership, Medicaid managed care organizations, local care management professionals, the Universities of Pittsburgh and Utah, primary care providers (PCP), and patients; the project team worked within 23 rural Pennsylvania counties to engage, recruit, train, and collaborate to implement the OUD service model in PCP practices from 2016 to 2019. Formative measures included practice-level metrics to monitor project implementation, and outcome measures involved employing Medicaid claims and encounter data to assess changes in provider/patient-level OUD-related metrics, such as MAT provider supply, prevalence of OUD, and MAT utilization. Descriptive statistics and repeated measures regression analyses were used to assess changes across the study period. There is an urgent need in the US to expand access to high quality, evidence-based OUD treatment—particularly in rural areas where capacity is limited for service delivery in order to improve patient health and protect lives. Importantly, this project leverages multiple partners to implement a theory- and practice-driven model of care for OUD. Results of this study will provide needed evidence in the field for appropriate methods for implementing MAT among a large number of rural primary care providers.",

    "abstract": "Dependence to prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs represents an increasing public health and clinical problem both in England and internationally. However, relatively little is known about those affected, particularly in relation to their management at drug dependence treatment centres. This study aimed to explore the views and experiences of health care professionals (HCPs) working in formal drug treatment services in relation to supporting clients with prescription and OTC drug dependence.An exploratory, qualitative design was used involving semi-structured telephone interviews. 15 staff were recruited using purposive sampling to represent a variety of different professional roles, funding (NHS, charity and local government) and geographical locations across England. Transcribed interviews were analysed using Braun and Clarke's six stage thematic analysis.Current services were considered to be inappropriate for the treatment of OTC and prescription drug dependence, which was perceived to be a significantly under-recognised issue affecting a range of individuals but particularly those taking opioid analgesics. Negativity around current treatment services involved concerns that these were more suited for illicit drug users and this was exacerbated by a lack of specific resources, funding and commissioning. There was a perceived variation in service provision in different areas and a further concern about the lack of formal treatment guidelines and care pathways. Participants felt there to be stigma for affected clients in both the diagnosis of OTC or prescription drug dependence and also attendance at drug treatment centres which adversely impacted service engagement. Suggested service improvements included commissioning new specific services in general practices and pain management clinics, developing national guidelines and care pathways to ensure equal access to treatment and increasing awareness amongst the public and HCPs.This study reveals considerable negativity and concern about current treatment services for prescription and OTC drug dependence in England from the perspective of those working in such services. Policy and practice improvement are suggested to improve outcomes for this neglected group in relation to increasing funding, guidelines and awareness.",

Few people with substance use disorders receive treatment and many drug users say that they would prefer getting help from online tools. Internet interventions are effective for reducing alcohol and cannabis use. The aim of the current study is to understand differences between internet-based and face-to-face treatment of problematic substance use. The concept of alliance will be used as a theoretical frame for understanding differences between internet-based treatment and face-to-face treatment, as perceived by therapists. The study has a qualitative design and is based on 3 focus group interviews with 12 therapists working with internet-based treatment for alcohol or cannabis use problems within five different programs. The analysis revealed five themes in the differences between internet-based and face-to-face treatment: communication, anonymity, time, presence and focus. Treatment online in written and asynchronous form creates something qualitatively different from regular face-to-face meetings between patients and therapists. The written form changes the concept of time in treatment, that is, how time can be used and how it affects the therapist's presence. The asynchronous (i.e. time delayed) form of communication and the lack of facial expressions and body language require special skills. There are important differences between internet-based treatment and face-to-face treatment. Different aspects of the alliance seem to be important in internet-based treatment compared to face-to-face.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Persons with an opioid use disorder (OUD) who were incarcerated face many challenges to remaining abstinent; concomitantly, opioid-overdose is the leading cause of death among this population, with the initial weeks following release proving especially fatal. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is the most widely-accepted, evidence-based OUD pharmacotherapy in criminal justice settings, and ensures approximately 30 days of protection from opioid overdose. The high cost of XR-NTX serves as a barrier to uptake by many prison/jail systems; however, the cost of the medication should not be viewed in isolation. Prison/jail healthcare budgets are ultimately determined by policymakers, and the benefits/cost-offsets associated with effective OUD treatment will directly and indirectly affect their overall budgets, and society as a whole. Methods This protocol describes a study funded by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to: evaluate changes in healthcare utilization, health-related quality-of-life, and other resources associated with different strategies of XR-NTX delivery to persons with OUD being released from incarceration; and estimate the relative “value” of each strategy. Data from two ongoing, publicly-funded, randomized-controlled trials will be used to evaluate these questions. In Study A, (XR-NTX Before vs. After Reentry), participants are randomized to receive their first XR-NTX dose before release, or at a nearby program post-release. In Study B, (enhanced XR-NTX vs. XR-NTX), both arms receive XR-NTX prior to release; the enhanced arm receives mobile medical (place of residence) XR-NTX treatment post-release, and the XR-NTX arm receives referral to a community treatment program post-release. The economic data collection instruments required to evaluate outcomes of interest were incorporated into both studies from baseline. Moreover, because the same instruments are being used in both trials on comparable populations, we have the opportunity to not only assess differences in outcomes between study arms within each trial, but also to merge the data sets and test for differences across trials. Discussion Initiating XR-NTX for OUD prior to release from incarceration may improve patient health and well-being, while also producing downstream cost-offsets. This study offers the unique opportunity to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multiple strategies, according to different stakeholder perspectives.",

Video DOT technologies may safeguard against this issue and thus enhance likelihood of treatment success. We describe the rationale and protocol for the Trial of Adherence Application for Buprenorphine treatment (TAAB) study, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effects of video DOT delivered via a smartphone app on office-based buprenorphine treatment outcomes, namely illicit opioid use and retention. Methods Participants will be recruited from office-based opioid addiction treatment programs in outpatient clinics at two urban medical centers and randomized to either video DOT (intervention) delivered via a HIPAA-compliant, asynchronous, mobile health (mHealth) technology platform, or treatment-as-usual (control). Eligibility criteria are: 18 years or older, prescribed sublingual buprenorphine for a cumulative total of 28 days or less from the office-based opioid treatment program, and able to read and understand English. Patients will be considered ineligible if they are unable or unwilling to use the intervention, provide consent, or complete weekly study visits. All participants will complete 13 in-person weekly visits and be followed via electronic health record data capture at 12- and 24-weeks post-randomization. Data gathered include the following: demographics; current and previous treatment for OUD; self-reported diversion of prescribed buprenorphine; status of their mental and physical health; and self-reported lifetime and past 30-day illicit substance use. Participants provide urine samples at each weekly visit to test for illicit drugs and buprenorphine. The primary outcome is percentage of weekly urines that are negative for opioids over the 12-weeks. The secondary outcome is engagement in treatment at week 12. Discussion Video DOT delivered through mHealth technology platform offers possibility of improving patients’ buprenorphine adherence by providing additional structure and accountability. The TAAB study will provide important preliminary estimates of the impact of this mHealth technology for patients initiating buprenorphine, as well as the feasibility of study procedures, thus paving the way for further research to assess feasibility and generate preliminary data for design of a future Phase III trial.

They have been particularly affected by the opioid crisis. However, no study to date has used a randomized controlled design to test preventive interventions of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population. Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and supportive services including prevention services, often referred to as “Housing First,” has great potential to reduce the likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors associated with living on the streets. Housing First has been tested through randomized trials among homeless adults with mental health and substance use disorders, but has not been empirically tested for opioid prevention among homeless youth. Methods Homeless youth will be recruited from a drop-in shelter site frequented by disconnected youth; they will be screened for eligibility, including current homelessness, age 18–24 years, and not currently meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). In a controlled trial, 240 youth will then be randomized to one of two conditions, (1) housing + opioid and related risk prevention services, or (2) opioid and related risk prevention services alone. This project utilizes existing efficacious models of prevention to address opioid-related risks, including motivational interviewing, strengths-based outreach and advocacy, and an HIV risk preventive intervention. Follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. The economic cost of each intervention will be determined to support implementation decisions with other providers and their funders. Discussion This study will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing + opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT for effects on opioid use and mechanisms underlying change.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Among people who inject drugs (PWID), obtaining syringes via syringe services programs (SSPs) and pharmacies reduces injection sharing practices associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Whether indirect use of SSPs via secondary exchange confers a similar benefit remains unknown, particularly in rural settings. We compared HCV serostatus and injection sharing practices by primary syringe source among a sample of rural PWID. Methods Data are from a cross-sectional study of adults who use drugs recruited from eleven rural counties in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts using respondent-driven sampling (2018–2019). Study staff performed HCV antibody testing. An audio computer-assisted self-interview assessed sociodemographic characteristics, past 30-day injection practices, and past 30-day primary syringe source. Primary syringe source was classified as direct SSP, pharmacy, indirect SSP (secondary exchange), or “other” (friend/acquaintance, street seller, partner/relative, found them). Mixed effects modified Poisson models assessed the association of primary syringe source with HCV seroprevalence and injection sharing practices. Results Among 397 PWID, the most common primary syringe source was “other” (33%), then pharmacies (27%), SSPs (22%), and secondary exchange (18%). In multivariable models, compared with those obtaining most syringes from “other” sources, those obtaining most syringes from pharmacies had a lower HCV seroprevalence [adjusted prevalence ratio (APR):0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–0.9985]; however, the upper bound of the 95% CI was close to 1.0. Compared with those obtaining most syringes from other sources, PWID obtaining most syringes directly from SSPs or pharmacies were less likely to report borrowing used syringes [APR(SSP):0.60, 95% CI 0.43–0.85 and APR(Pharmacies):0.70, 95% CI 0.52–0.93], borrowing used injection equipment [APR(SSP):0.59, 95% CI 0.50–0.69 and APR (Pharmacies):0.81, 95% CI 0.68–0.98], and backloading [APR(SSP):0.65, 95% CI 0.48–0.88 and APR(Pharmacies):0.78, 95% CI 0.67–0.91]. Potential inverse associations between obtaining most syringes via secondary exchange and injection sharing practices did not reach the threshold for statistical significance. Conclusions PWID in rural New England largely relied on informal syringe sources (i.e., secondary exchange or sources besides SSPs/pharmacies). Those obtaining most syringes from an SSP or pharmacy were less likely to share injection equipment/syringes and had a lower HCV seroprevalence, which suggests using these sources reduces the risk of new HCV infections or serves as proxy for past injection behavior.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Attempts to routinely embed brief interventions in health systems have long been challenging, with healthcare professionals concerned about role adequacy, legitimacy, and support. This is the first study to explore clinical pharmacists’ experiences of discussing alcohol with patients in their new role in UK primary care, in developing a novel approach to brief intervention. It investigates their confidence with the subject of alcohol in routine practice and explores views on a new approach, integrating alcohol into the medication review as another drug directly linked to the patient’s health conditions and medicines, rather than a separated ‘healthy living’ issue. The study forms part of wider efforts to repurpose and reimagine the potential application of brief interventions and to rework their contents. Methods Longitudinal qualitative study of 10 recruits to the new clinical pharmacist role in English primary care, involving three semi-structured interviews over approximately 16 months, supplemented by 10 one-off interviews with pharmacists already established in general practice. Results When raised at all, enquiring about alcohol in medication reviews was described in terms of calculating dose and level of consumption, leading to crude advice to reduce drinking. The idea was that those who appeared dependent should be referred to specialist services, though few such referrals were recalled. Pharmacists acknowledged that they were not currently considering alcohol as a drug in their practice and were interested in learning more about this concept and the approach it entailed, particularly in relation to polypharmacy. Some recognised a linked need to enhance consultation skills. Conclusions Alcohol complicates routine clinical care and adversely impacts patient outcomes, even for those drinking at seemingly unremarkable levels. Changing clinical practice on alcohol requires engaging with, and supportively challenging, routine practices and entrenched ideas of different kinds. Framing alcohol as a drug may help shift the focus from patients with alcohol problems to problems caused for patients by alcohol. This is less stigmatising and provides role legitimacy for pharmacists to address alcohol clinically in medication reviews, thus providing one element in the formation of a new prevention paradigm.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Federal and state regulations require frequent direct observation of methadone ingestion at an Opioid Treatment Program (OTP)—a requirement that creates barriers to patient access. Video observed therapy (VOT) may help to address public health and safety concerns of providing take-home medications while simultaneously reducing barriers to treatment access and long-term retention. Evaluating user experiences with VOT is important for understanding the acceptability of this strategy. Methods We conducted a qualitative evaluation of a clinical pilot program of VOT via smartphone that was rapidly implemented between April and August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic within three opioid treatment programs. In the program, selected patients submitted video recordings of themselves ingesting methadone take-home doses, which were asynchronously reviewed by their counselor. We recruited participating patients and counselors for semi-structured, individual interviews to explore their VOT experiences after program completion. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify key factors influencing acceptability and the effect of VOT on the treatment experience. Results We interviewed 12 of the 60 patients who participated in the clinical pilot and 3 of the 5 counselors. Overall, patients were enthusiastic about VOT, noting multiple benefits over traditional treatment experiences, including avoiding frequent travel to the clinic. Some noted how this allowed them to better meet recovery goals by avoiding a potentially triggering environment. Most appreciated having increased time to devote to other life priorities, including maintaining consistent employment. Participants described how VOT increased their autonomy, allowed them to keep treatment private, and normalized treatment to align with other medications that do not require in-person dosing. Participants did not describe major usability issues or privacy concerns with submitting videos. Some participants reported feeling disconnected from counselors while others felt more connected. Counselors felt some discomfort in their new role confirming medication ingestion but saw VOT as a useful tool for select patients. Conclusions VOT may be an acceptable tool to achieve equipoise between lowering barriers to treatment with methadone and protecting the health and safety of patients and their communities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Most people with opioid use disorder (OUD) have co-occurring substance use, which is associated with lower receipt of OUD medications (MOUD). Expanding MOUD provision and care linkage outside of substance use disorder (SUD) specialty settings is a key strategy to increase access. Therefore, it is important to understand how MOUD providers in these settings approach care for patients with co-occurring substance use. This qualitative study of Veterans Health Administration (VA) clinicians providing buprenorphine care in primary care, mental health, and pain settings aimed to understand (1) their approach to addressing OUD in patients with co-occurring substance use, (2) perspectives on barriers/facilitators to MOUD receipt for this population, and (3) support needed to increase MOUD receipt for this population. Methods We interviewed a purposive sample of 27 clinicians (12 primary care, 7 mental health, 4 pain, 4 pharmacists) in the VA northwest network. The interview guide assessed domains of the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases Checklist. Interviews were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results Participants reported varied approaches to identifying co-occurring substance use and addressing OUD in this patient population. Although they reported that this topic was not clearly addressed in clinical guidelines or training, participants generally felt that patients with co-occurring substance use should receive MOUD. Some viewed their primary role as providing this care, others as facilitating linkage to OUD care in SUD specialty settings. Participants reported multiple barriers and facilitators to providing buprenorphine care to patients with co-occurring substance use and linking them to SUD specialty care, including provider, patient, organizational, and external factors. Conclusions Efforts are needed to support clinicians outside of SUD specialty settings in providing buprenorphine care to patients with co-occurring substance use. These could include clearer guidelines and policies, more specific training, and increased care integration or cross-disciplinary collaboration. Simultaneously, efforts are needed to improve linkage to specialty SUD care for patients who would benefit from and are willing to receive this care, which could include increased service availability and improved referral/hand-off processes. These efforts may increase MOUD receipt and improve OUD care quality for patients with co-occurring substance use.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Music therapy has been shown to be effective for multiple clinical endpoints associated with substance use disorder such as craving reduction, emotion regulation, depression, and anxiety, but there are a lack of studies investigating those effects in UK Community Substance Misuse Treatment Services (CSMTSs). Furthermore, there is a demand for identifying music therapy mechanisms of change and related brain processes for substance use disorder treatment. The present study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of music therapy and a pre-test, post-test, and in-session measurement battery in a CSMTS. Methods Fifteen participants, from a community service based in London, will take part in a mixed-methods non-blind randomized-controlled trial. Ten participants will receive six-weekly sessions of music therapy in addition to the standard treatment offered by the CSMTS—five of them will receive individual music therapy and five of them will receive group music therapy—while a further five participants will act as a control group receiving standard treatment only. Satisfaction and acceptability will be evaluated in focus groups with service users and staff members following the final treatment session. Moreover, attendance and completion rates will be monitored throughout the intervention. Subjective and behavioral indexes will be assessed before and after the interventions to explore the effects of music therapy on craving, substance use, symptoms of depression and anxiety, inhibitory control, and will be correlated with associated neurophysiological signatures. In-session analysis of two individual music therapy sessions will serve to explore how music and emotion are processed in the brain within the therapy. The data collected at each step will be included in an intention-to-treat analysis basis. Discussion This study will provide a first report on the feasibility of music therapy as an intervention for participants with substance use disorder engaged within a community service. It will also provide valuable information regarding the implementation of a multifaceted methodology that includes neurophysiological, questionnaire-based, and behavioral assessments in this cohort. Notwithstanding the limitation of a small sample size, the present study will provide novel preliminary data regarding neurophysiological outcomes in participants with substance use disorder that received music therapy.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol use disorder (AUD) commonly causes hospitalization, particularly for individuals disproportionately impacted by structural racism and other forms of marginalization. The optimal approach for engaging hospitalized patients with AUD in treatment post-hospital discharge is unknown. We describe the rationale, aims, and protocol for Project ENHANCE (ENhancing Hospital-initiated Alcohol TreatmeNt to InCrease Engagement), a clinical trial testing increasingly intensive approaches using a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation approach. Methods We are randomizing English and/or Spanish-speaking individuals with untreated AUD (n = 450) from a large, urban, academic hospital in New Haven, CT to: (1) Brief Negotiation Interview (with referral and telephone booster) alone (BNI), (2) BNI plus facilitated initiation of medications for alcohol use disorder (BNI + MAUD), or (3) BNI + MAUD + initiation of computer-based training for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT4CBT, BNI + MAUD + CBT4CBT). Interventions are delivered by Health Promotion Advocates. The primary outcome is AUD treatment engagement 34 days post-hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes include AUD treatment engagement 90 days post-discharge and changes in self-reported alcohol use and phosphatidylethanol. Exploratory outcomes include health care utilization. We will explore whether the effectiveness of the interventions on AUD treatment engagement and alcohol use outcomes differ across and within racialized and ethnic groups, consistent with disproportionate impacts of AUD. Lastly, we will conduct an implementation-focused process evaluation, including individual-level collection and statistical comparisons between the three conditions of costs to providers and to patients, cost-effectiveness indices (effectiveness/cost ratios), and cost–benefit indices (benefit/cost ratios, net benefit [benefits minus costs). Graphs of individual- and group-level effectiveness x cost, and benefits x costs, will portray relationships between costs and effectiveness and between costs and benefits for the three conditions, in a manner that community representatives also should be able to understand and use. Conclusions Project ENHANCE is expected to generate novel findings to inform future hospital-based efforts to promote AUD treatment engagement among diverse patient populations, including those most impacted by AUD.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Scaling up overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND), an evidence-based practice for reducing opioid overdose mortality, in communities remains a challenge. Novel models and intentional implementation strategies are needed. Drawing upon the EPIS model’s phases of Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (Aarons et al. in Adm Policy Ment Health 38:4–23, 2011), this paper describes the development of the University of Kentucky’s unique centralized “Naloxone Hub with Many Spokes” approach to implementing OEND as part of the HEALing Communities Study (HCS-KY). Methods To scale up OEND in eight Kentucky counties, implementation strategies were utilized at two levels: a centralized university-based naloxone dispensing unit (“Naloxone Hub”) and adopting organizations (“Many Spokes”). Implementation strategies varied across the EPIS phases, but heavily emphasized implementation facilitation. The Naloxone Hub provided technical assistance, overdose education resources, and no-cost naloxone to partner organizations. Implementation outcomes across the EPIS phases were measured using data from internal study management trackers and naloxone distribution data submitted by partner organizations. Results Of 209 organizations identified as potential partners, 84.7% (n = 177) engaged in the Exploration/Preparation phase by participating in an initial meeting with an Implementation Facilitator about the HCS-KY OEND program. Adoption of the HCS-KY OEND program, defined as receipt of at least one shipment of naloxone, was achieved with 69.4% (n = 145) of all organizations contacted. During the Implementation phase, partner organizations distributed 40,822 units of naloxone, with partner organizations distributing a mean of 281.5 units of naloxone (SD = 806.2). The mean number of units distributed per county was 5102.8 (SD = 3653.3; range = 1057 − 11,053) and the mean county level distribution rate was 8396.5 units per 100,000 residents (SD = 8103.1; range = 1709.5–25,296.3). Of the partner organizations that adopted the HCS-KY OEND program, 87.6% (n = 127) attended a sustainability meeting with an Implementation Facilitator and agreed to transition to the state-funded naloxone program. Conclusions These data demonstrate the feasibility of this “Hub with Many Spokes” model for scaling up OEND in communities highly affected by the opioid epidemic.

    "abstract": "A major barrier to successful treatment in alcohol dependence is psychiatric comorbidity. During treatment, the time to relapse is shorter, the drop-out rate is increased, and long-term alcohol consumption is greater for those with comorbid major depression or anxiety disorder than those with an alcohol use disorder with no comorbid mental disorder. The treatment of alcohol dependence and psychological disorders is often the responsibility of different services, and this can hinder the treatment process. Accordingly, there is a need for an effective integrated treatment for alcohol dependence and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. We aim to assess the effectiveness of a specialized, integrated intervention for alcohol dependence with comorbid anxiety and/or mood disorder using a randomized design in an outpatient hospital setting. Following a three-week stabilization period (abstinence or significantly reduced consumption), participants will undergo complete formal assessment for anxiety and depression. Those patients with a diagnosis of an anxiety and/or depressive disorder will be randomized to either 1) integrated intervention (cognitive behavioral therapy) for alcohol, anxiety, and/or depression; or 2) usual counseling care for alcohol problems. Patients will then be followed up at weeks 12, 16, and 24. The primary outcome measure is alcohol consumption (total abstinence, time to lapse, and time to relapse). Secondary outcome measures include changes in alcohol dependence severity, depression, or anxiety symptoms and changes in clinician-rated severity of anxiety and depression. The study findings will have potential implications for clinical practice by evaluating the implementation of specialized integrated treatment for comorbid anxiety and/or depression in an alcohol outpatient service.

    "abstract": "Although screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is an evidence-based technique that, in some health-care settings, has been shown to cost-effectively reduce alcohol and drug use, research on the efficacy of SBIRT among criminal offender populations is limited. Such populations have a high prevalence of drug and alcohol use but limited access to intervention, and many are at risk for post-release relapse and recidivism. Thus, there exists a need for treatment options for drug-involved offenders of varying risk levels to reduce risky behaviors or enter treatment. This protocol describes an assessment of SBIRT feasibility and effectiveness in a criminal justice environment. Eight-hundred persons will be recruited from a large metropolitan jail, with the experimental group receiving an intervention depending on risk level and the control group receiving minimal intervention. The intervention will assess the risk level for drug and alcohol misuse by inmates, providing those at low or medium risk a brief intervention in the jail and referring those at high risk to community treatment following release. In addition, a brief treatment (eight-session) option will be available. Using data from a 12-month follow-up interview, the primary study outcomes are a reduction in drug and alcohol use, while secondary outcomes include participation in treatment, rearrest, quality of life, reduction in HIV risk behaviors, and costs of SBIRT. Individual reductions in alcohol and drug use can have significant effects on public health and safety when observed over a large population at risk for substance-use problems. With wider dissemination statewide or nationwide, a relatively low-cost intervention such as SBIRT could offer demonstrated benefits in this population.

Screening and brief intervention (SBI) for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use has the potential to reach a broad population of hazardous drug users but has not yet been widely adopted in Brazil's health care system. We surveyed 149 primary health care professionals in 30 clinics in Brazil who were trained to conduct SBI among their patients. We prospectively measured how often they delivered SBI to evaluate the association between organizational climate and adoption/performance of SBI.Organizational climate was measured by the 2009 Organizational Climate Scale for Health Organizations, a scale validated in Brazil that assesses leadership, professional development, team spirit, relationship with the community, safety, strategy, and remuneration. Performance of SBI was measured prospectively by weekly assessments during the three months following training. We also assessed self-reported SBI and self-efficacy for performing SBI at three months post-training. We used inferential statistics to depict and test for the significance of associations.Teams with better organizational climates implemented SBI more frequently. Organizational climate factors most closely associated with SBI implementation included professional development and relationship with the community. The dimensions of leadership and remuneration were also significantly associated with SBI.Organizational climate may influence implementation of SBI and ultimately may affect the ability of organizations to identify and address drug use.",

    "abstract": "Opioid dependence is a chronic condition with substantial health, economic and social costs. The study objective was to conduct a systematic review of published health-economic models of opioid agonist therapy for non-prescription opioid dependence, to review the different modelling approaches identified, and to inform future modelling studies. Literature searches were conducted in March 2015 in eight electronic databases, supplemented by hand-searching reference lists and searches on six National Health Technology Assessment Agency websites. Studies were included if they: investigated populations that were dependent on non-prescription opioids and were receiving opioid agonist or maintenance therapy; compared any pharmacological maintenance intervention with any other maintenance regimen (including placebo or no treatment); and were health-economic models of any type. A total of 18 unique models were included. These used a range of modelling approaches, including Markov models (n = 4), decision tree with Monte Carlo simulations (n = 3), decision analysis (n = 3), dynamic transmission models (n = 3), decision tree (n = 1), cohort simulation (n = 1), Bayesian (n = 1), and Monte Carlo simulations (n = 2). Time horizons ranged from 6 months to lifetime. The most common evaluation was cost-utility analysis reporting cost per quality-adjusted life-year (n = 11), followed by cost-effectiveness analysis (n = 4), budget-impact analysis/cost comparison (n = 2) and cost-benefit analysis (n = 1). Most studies took the healthcare provider’s perspective. Only a few models included some wider societal costs, such as productivity loss or costs of drug-related crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour. Costs to individuals and impacts on family and social networks were not included in any model. A relatively small number of studies of varying quality were found. Strengths and weaknesses relating to model structure, inputs and approach were identified across all the studies. There was no indication of a single standard emerging as a preferred approach. Most studies omitted societal costs, an important issue since the implications of drug abuse extend widely beyond healthcare services. Nevertheless, elements from previous models could together form a framework for future economic evaluations in opioid agonist therapy including all relevant costs and outcomes. This could more adequately support decision-making and policy development for treatment of non-prescription opioid dependence.",

    "abstract": "Patients with alcohol misuse are less likely to receive preventive health services but more likely to utilize emergency health services. However, the association between alcohol misuse and outpatient follow-up after hospitalization is unknown and may depend on whether a patient experiences a critical illness. We sought to determine whether alcohol misuse was associated with lower rates of outpatient follow-up after hospital discharge and whether the magnitude of this association differed in patients who experienced a critical illness. This was a retrospective cohort study using administrative data from an urban safety net hospital. Patients were included if they were admitted between 2011 and 2015, were between the ages of 18 and 89, resided within the safety net county, were discharged home, and were at moderate to high risk for hospital readmission within the subsequent 30 days. Alcohol misuse was identified using a combination of ICD-9 codes and response to a single screening question. The primary outcome was a combined measure of follow-up with a primary care physician or specialist provider in the 30 days following hospital discharge. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for factors known to be associated with healthcare utilization. Overall, 17,575 patients were included in the analysis; 4984 (28%) had alcohol misuse. In the 30 days following hospital discharge, 46% of patients saw any outpatient provider. In an unadjusted analysis, the association between alcohol misuse and attending any outpatient follow-up was dependent on whether patients had a critical illness (p value < 0.0001) with the highest rates of follow-up in survivors of critical illness without alcohol misuse (53%, 95% CI 51%, 55%) followed by patients without alcohol misuse or critical illness (49%; 95% CI 48%, 50%), patients with alcohol misuse without critical illness (38%; 95% CI 36%, 39%), and patients with alcohol misuse and a critical illness (37%; 95% CI 35%, 40%). Adjusting for factors associated with healthcare utilization, these findings were modestly attenuated but unchanged. Patients with alcohol misuse who are at moderate to high risk for hospital readmission may benefit from targeted interventions to increase rates of outpatient follow-up after hospital discharge.",

    "abstract": "Brief interventions such as Screening, a single session of Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) have shown mixed effectiveness in primary care. However, there are indications that multi-session brief interventions may demonstrate more consistently positive outcomes, and perhaps a more intensive approach would be of benefit in addressing substance use in primary care. This study compared the effectiveness of SBIRT with a single BI session (BI/RT) to a multi-session brief-treatment intervention (BI/RT+) in primary care. We also developed easy-to-use, evidence-based materials to assist clinicians in delivering these interventions. This study was conducted in three Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHCs). A total of 10,935 patients were screened, and 600 individuals were recruited. The sample was primarily Black/African American (82 %) with a mean age of 40. Patients who attended a healthcare appointment were screened for substance use via the AUDIT and DAST. Patients were eligible for the study if they scored 8 or higher on the AUDIT, were using only marijuana and scored 2 or higher on the DAST, or were using other illicit drugs and scored 1 or higher on the DAST. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one-session BI/RT, or two to six sessions of brief intervention that incorporated elements of motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (BI/RT+). Both interventions were delivered by behavioral health consultants at the FQHCs. Participants completed follow-up assessments every 3 months for 1 year. Primary outcome variables included substance use treatment sessions attended and days of substance use. Secondary outcomes included measures of health, employment, legal, and psychiatric functioning and HIV risk behaviors. Additionally, we will conduct an economic evaluation examining cost-effectiveness and will analyze outcomes from a process evaluation examining patient and provider experiences. The ability of brief interventions to impact substance use has great potential, but research findings have been mixed. By conducting a large-scale randomized controlled trial in real-world health centers, this study will answer important questions about the effectiveness of expanded BIs for patients who screen positive for risky substance use in primary care.

    "abstract": "Social networks play positive and negative roles in the lives of homeless people influencing their alcohol and/or other drug (AOD) and HIV risk behaviors. We developed a four-session computer-assisted social network motivational interviewing intervention for homeless adults transitioning into housing. We examined the acceptability of the intervention among staff and residents at an organization that provides permanent supportive housing through iterative rounds of beta testing. Staff were 3 men and 3 women who were residential support staff (i.e., case managers and administrators). Residents were 8 men (7 African American, 1 Hispanic) and 3 women (2 African American, 1 Hispanic) who had histories of AOD and HIV risk behaviors. We conducted a focus group with staff who gave input on how to improve the delivery of the intervention to enhance understanding and receptivity among new residents. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews and collected self-report satisfaction data from residents. Three themes emerged over the course of the resident interviews. Residents reported that the intervention was helpful in discussing their social network, that seeing the visualizations was more impactful than just talking about their network, and that the intervention prompted thoughts about changing their AOD use and HIV risk networks. This study is the first of its kind that has developed, with input from Housing First staff and residents, a motivational interviewing intervention that targets both the structure and composition of one's social network. These results suggest that providing visual network feedback with a guided motivational interviewing discussion is a promising approach to supporting network change.

    "abstract": "People living with HIV (PLWH) with a substance use disorder (SUD) tend to receive inadequate medical care in part because of a siloed healthcare system in which HIV and substance use services are delivered separately. Ideal treatment requires an interdisciplinary, team-based coordinated care approach, but many structural and systemic barriers impede the integration of HIV and SUD services. The current protocol describes the development and preliminary evaluation of a care coordination intervention (CCI), consisting of a tablet-based mobile platform for HIV and SUD treatment providers, an interagency communication protocol, and a training protocol. We hypothesize that HIV and SUD treatment providers will find the CCI to be acceptable, and that after receipt of the CCI, providers will: exhibit higher retention in dual care among patients, report increased frequency and quality of communication, and report increased rates of relational coordination. A three phase approach is used to refine and evaluate the CCI. Phase 1 consists of in-depth qualitative interviews with 8 key stakeholders as well as clinical audits of participating HIV and SUD treatment agencies. Phase 2 contains functionality testing of the mobile platform with frontline HIV and SUD treatment providers, followed by refinement of the CCI. Phase 3 consists of a pre-, post-test trial with 30 SUD and 30 HIV treatment providers. Data will be collected at the provider, organization, and patient levels. Providers will complete assessments at baseline, immediately post-training, and at 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-training. Organizational data will be collected at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-months post training, while patient data will be collected at baseline and 6-months post training. This study will develop and evaluate a CCI consisting of a tablet-based mobile platform for treatment providers, an interagency communication protocol, and a training protocol as a means of improving the integration of care for PLWH who have a SUD. Results have the potential to advance the field by bridging gaps in a fragmented healthcare system, and improving treatment efficiency, work flow, and communication among interdisciplinary providers from different treatment settings.

    "abstract": "A greater understanding of the factors that influence long-term sustainment of quality improvement (QI) initiatives is needed to promote organizational ability to sustain QI practices over time, help improve future interventions, and increase the value of QI investments. We approached 83 of 201 executive sponsors or change leaders at addiction treatment organizations that participated in the 2007–2009 NIATx200 QI intervention. We completed semi-structured interviews with 33 individuals between November 2015 and April 2016. NIATx200 goals were to decrease wait time, increase admissions and improve retention in treatment. Interviews sought to understand factors that either facilitated or impeded long-term sustainment of organizational QI practices made during the intervention. We used thematic analysis to organize the data and group patterns of responses. We assessed available quantitative outcome data and intervention engagement data to corroborate qualitative results. We used narrative analysis to group four important themes related to long-term sustainment of QI practices: (1) finding alignment between business- and client-centered practices; (2) staff engagement early in QI process added legitimacy which facilitated sustainment; (3) commitment to integrating data into monitoring practices and the identification of a data champion; and (4) adequate organizational human resources devoted to sustainment. We found four corollary factors among agencies which did not sustain practices: (1) lack of evidence of impact on business practices led to discontinuation; (2) disengaged staff and lack of organizational capacity during implementation period led to lack of sustainment; (3) no data integration into overall business practices and no identified data champion; and (4) high staff turnover. In addition, we found that many agencies' current use of NIATx methods and tools suggested a legacy effect that might improve quality elsewhere, even absent overall sustainment of original study outcome goals. Available quantitative data on wait-time reduction demonstrated general concordance between agency perceptions of, and evidence for, sustainment 2 years following the end of the intervention. Additional quantitative data suggested that greater engagement during the intervention period showed some association with sustainment. Factors identified in QI frameworks as important for short-term sustainment—organizational capacity (e.g. staffing and leadership) and intervention characteristics (e.g. flexibility and fit)—are also important to long-term sustainment.",

    "abstract": "Few studies describe medical complaints and substance use patterns related to attending music concerts. As such, the objective of this study is to describe patient demographics, substance use and intoxication patterns, and medical interventions provided to adolescents and young adults assessed in an emergency department (ED) for complaints directly related to concert attendance.A retrospective chart review of patients 13-30 years old who were transported to the ED directly from music concerts between January 2011 and December 2015 was conducted. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze patient demographic, intervention, and substance use data.There were 115 concerts identified, of which 48 (42%) were linked to 142 relevant ED visits; the total number of attendees at each concert is unknown. The mean age of the 142 described patients was 19.5 years (SD 3.3) with 72% < 21 and 33% < 18; 71% of patients were female and 96% of visits were substance-use related. Mean blood alcohol level was 242 mg/dL (range 104-412, SD 70). Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores ranged from 3 to 15, with a mean of 14. Two patients required intubation and 61% of patients received interventions, including medications (47%), intravenous fluids (46%), specialty consultation (20%), restraints (14%), imaging (6%), and laceration repair (3%). Attendance at pop and electronic dance music concerts was associated with the widest ranges of GCS scores (8-15 and 6-14 respectively), mass casualty incident declarations, and among the highest mean blood alcohol levels (246 and 244 mg/dL, respectively).Substance use is the predominant reason for music concert related ED visits and patients may have serious levels of intoxication, receiving multiple medical interventions. These data demonstrate the need for additional large-scale studies to confirm trends and increase awareness of this important public health problem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Treatment completion is the greatest challenge for the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs). A previous investigation showed that complementary horse-assisted therapy (cHAT) was associated with higher retention in treatment and completion than standard treatment alone. This randomized controlled trial further explored the benefits of cHAT for patients with SUDs. Methods Fifty patients in residential SUD treatment at the Department of Addiction Treatment, Oslo University Hospital, were randomly allocated to either cHAT (cHAT group) or treatment as usual alone (TAU-only group). The primary end-point was treatment completion. Secondary end-points were dropout, transfer to another treatment, and time in treatment. Results The multinomial logistic regression analysis found no statistically significant association between intervention (cHAT) and treatment outcome (completion, dropout, transferred) among the 37 participants who were ultimately recruited to the study. Some unforeseen challenges were encountered in the study: a high number of subjects transferred to another treatment, variable attendance at cHAT sessions, and long temporary exits. Nevertheless, 44% of participants in the cHAT group completed their treatment, compared with 32% in the TAU-only group; this observation encourages further investigation in a larger sample. Conclusions Though no association was identified between cHAT and treatment retention or completion, our study may have been underpowered. Further work in a larger clinical population is needed; observational studies with repeated measures may also be useful for investigating whether cHAT increases retention in treatment or rates of completion, two important factors for successful SUD treatment.

    "abstract": "Opioid use disorders (OUDs) have devastating effects on individuals, families, and communities. While medication treatments for OUD save lives and are increasingly utilized, rates of treatment dropout are very high. In addition, most existing medication treatments for OUD may often neglect the impact of untreated OUD on relationships and ignore the potential role support persons (SPs) could have on encouraging long-term recovery, which can also impact patient treatment retention.The current study adapts Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) for use with SPs (family member, spouse or friend) of patients using buprenorphine/naloxone (buprenorphine) in an outpatient community clinic setting. The study will evaluate whether the adapted intervention, also known as integrating support persons into recovery (INSPIRE), is effective in increasing patient retention on buprenorphine when compared to usual care. We will utilize a two-group randomized design where patients starting or restarting buprenorphine will be screened for support person status and recruited with their support person if eligible. Support persons will be randomly assigned to the INSPIRE intervention, which will consist of 10 rolling group sessions led by two facilitators. Patients and SPs will each be assessed at baseline, 3 months post-baseline, and 12 months post-baseline. Patient electronic medical record data will be collected at six and 12 months post-baseline. We will examine mechanisms of intervention effectiveness and also conduct pre/post-implementation surveys with clinic staff to assess issues that would affect sustainability.Incorporating the patient's support system may be an important way to improve treatment retention in medication treatments for OUD. If SPs can serve to support patient retention, this study would significantly advance work to help support the delivery of effective treatments that prevent the devastating consequences associated with OUD.

The aim of this program evaluation was to determine the feasibility and usability of implementing a computer-assisted screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) program for DWI offenders to enable the identification of those in need of treatment services soon after arrest. Our treatment program consisted of a web-based, self-guided screening tool for assessing alcohol use patterns and generating a personalized feedback report that is then used to deliver a brief motivational intervention and if needed, a referral to treatment. Between August and November 2014, all DWI offenders attending orientation for pre-trial supervision were assessed for eligibility. Of the 129 eligible offenders, 53.5 percent enrolled and the first 50 were asked to complete a usability and satisfaction questionnaire. The results demonstrated that the majority of those screened reported at-risk alcohol use patterns requiring referral to treatment. Clients reported high ratings of usability and satisfaction with the screening tool and personalized feedback report, which did not significantly differ depending on alcohol use patterns. There were relatively few technical difficulties, and the majority of clients reported high levels of satisfaction with the overall SBIRT program. Results of this program evaluation suggest that computer-assisted SBIRT may be successfully implemented within the criminal justice system to DWI offenders soon after arrest; however, further research is required to examine its effects on treatment utilization and recidivism.",

At baseline, all 13 clinicians were assessed for their computer anxiety and openness to innovation. Clinicians referred current clients to the study, with consenting and eligible clients (N = 35) completing a baseline and 15-week follow-up clinical assessment. The assessment comprised a range of mental health and AOD measures administered by an independent research assistant. Over the course of the study, clinicians submitted session checklists detailing information about session content, including the context and extent to which SHADE was used for each client.Descriptive statistics showed that clinicians employed the SHADE program in a variety of ways. When SHADE modules were used, they were generally introduced in the early phase of treatment, on average, around session 4 (M = 3.77, SD = 5.26, range 1-36). However, only 12 of the 35 clients whose session checklists were available were exposed to the SHADE modules; this, despite 28/35 clients indicating that they would be willing to use CBPT during their current treatment program.Treatment seekers in the AOD service of the current trial were generally open to receiving CBPT like SHADE; however, clinicians tended to use SHADE with only 34 percent of clients. This indicates the importance of providing ongoing support and encouragement to clinicians, in addition to an initial training session, to encourage the adoption of innovative technologies into clinical practice, and perhaps to engage clients in a discussion about CBPT more routinely.Australian Clinical Trial Registration Number ACTRN12611000382976.",

We identified existing CDEs and evaluated their validity and usability, which is required prior to infrastructure implementation within EHRs. Methods We conducted (a) a systematic literature review of publications in Medline, Embase and the Web of Science using a combination of at least one term related to OUD and EHR and (b) an environmental scan of publicly available data systems and dictionaries used in national informatics and quality measurement of policy initiatives. Opioid-related data elements identified within the environmental scan were compared with related data elements contained within nine common health data code systems and each element was graded for alignment with match results categorized as “exact”, “partial”, or “none.” Results The literature review identified 5186 articles for title search, of which 75 abstracts were included for review and 38 articles were selected for full-text review. Full-text articles yielded 237 CDEs, only 12 (5.06%) of which were opioid-specific. The environmental scan identified 379 potential data elements and value sets across 9 data systems and libraries, among which only 84 (22%) were opioid-specific. We found substantial variability in the types of clinical data elements with limited overlap and no single data system included CDEs across all major data element types such as substance use disorder, OUD, medication and mental health. Relative to common health data code systems, few data elements had an exact match (&lt; 1%), while 61% had a partial match and 38% had no matches. Conclusions Despite the increasing ubiquity of EHR data standards and national attention placed on the opioid epidemic, we found substantial fragmentation in the design and construction of OUD related CDEs and little OUD specific CDEs in existing data dictionaries, systems and literature. Given the significant gaps in data collection and reporting, future work should leverage existing structured data elements to create standard workflow processes to improve OUD data capture in EHR systems.",

Shifting patterns of polysubstance use have led to rising psychostimulant-involved deaths. While it is known that individuals who use methamphetamine require greater access to treatment, there is still little known about methamphetamine use and treatment among individuals who are already engaged in outpatient substance use treatment. Objectives To characterize care-engaged individuals who use methamphetamine to guide harm reduction and treatment strategies. Methods Retrospective cohort study of individuals at a large academic medical center in Massachusetts with ≥ 2 positive methamphetamine oral fluid toxicology tests between August 2019 and January 2020. We performed descriptive analysis of sociodemographic, medical, and drug use characteristics and a comparative analysis of injection methamphetamine use versus other routes of use. Results Included were 71 individuals [56 male (80%), 66 non-Hispanic white (94%), median age 36 (IQR 30–42)]. Nearly all had opioid (94%) and stimulant use disorder (92%). Most had (93%) or were (83%) being treated with medications for opioid use disorder, but few received pharmacologic treatment for methamphetamine use disorder (24%). None received contingency management treatment. People who inject methamphetamine (68%) were more likely to have a history of overdose (91% vs. 70%; p = 0.02), have HCV (94% vs. 52%; p &lt; 0.01), use fentanyl (93% vs. 65%; p = 0.02), and engage in sex work (19% vs. 0%; p = 0.03) compared to those who used via other routes. Both groups had prevalent homelessness (88% vs. 73%; p = 0.15), incarceration (81% vs. 64%; p = 0.11), depression (94% vs. 87%; p = 0.34), and bacteremia (27% vs. 22%; p = 0.63). Conclusions Individuals in our study had high prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly concomitant methamphetamine and opioid use. Individuals who were well connected to substance use treatment for their opioid use were still likely to be undertreated for their methamphetamine use disorder and would benefit from greater access to contingency management treatment, harm reduction resources, and resources to address adverse social determinants of health.",

However, little is known about the cultural utility of these programmes for Indigenous peoples. A three-round Delphi study, utilising Indigenous research yarning methods was conducted to: (1) Obtain expert opinion regarding the cultural utility of an Indigenous SMART Recovery handbook; (2) Gain consensus on areas within the SMART Recovery programme that require cultural modification and; (3) Seek advice on how modifications could be implemented in future programme design and delivery. The panellists were 11 culturally, geographically, and professionally diverse Indigenous Australian health and wellbeing experts. A group consensus level of 80% was set prior to each survey round. There was 100% participant retention across all three Delphi rounds. The panel reached consensus on five key programme modifications (composition of a separate facilitator and group member handbook; culturally appropriate language, terminology, and literacy level; culturally meaningful programme activities; supplementary storytelling resources; and customisation for diverse community contexts). The panel also developed a series of practical implementation strategies to guide SMART Recovery through a modification process. The findings highlight the importance of involving Indigenous peoples in the design, delivery and validation of mainstream mutual support programmes. Indigenous-led programme modifications could help improve accessibility and usefulness of mutual support groups for Indigenous peoples worldwide.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Pregaming is a high-drink context popular among college students that often leads to elevated blood alcohol levels and negative consequences. Over 15 years of research studies have demonstrated that pregaming represents one of the riskiest known behaviors among college students, yet no pregaming-specific interventions have been developed to help prevent this behavior. General brief interventions for students do not reduce pregaming behavior and may not be appropriate, as they do not help students develop skills unique to the pregaming context that could help them drink less. We developed a brief, mobile-based intervention that is proposed to prevent heavy drinking during pregaming for college students, with the ultimate goal that behavioral reductions in this risky practice will ultimately affect global drinking and prevent consequences. Methods/Design The intervention, Pregaming Awareness in College Environments (PACE), was developed by combining two innovations to facilitate behavior change: (1) a mobile-based application that increases accessibility, is easy and engaging to use, and broadens the reach of the intervention content and (2) personalized pregaming-specific intervention content with harm reduction and cognitive behavioral skills proven to be mechanisms preventing and reducing heavy drinking among college students. After a develop and beta-test phase, we propose to test the efficacy of PACE in a preliminary randomized controlled trial with 500 college students who pregame at least once per week. Pregaming, general drinking, and alcohol-related consequences outcomes will be examined in the immediate (2 weeks post-intervention) and short-terms (six and 14-week post-intervention). We will also evaluate moderator effects for age, sex, and heaviness of drinking to allow for more refined information for a planned larger test of the intervention to follow this initial trial of PACE. Discussion This pregaming intervention clinical trial, if found to be efficacious, will culminate with an easily-disseminated mobile-based intervention for college student drinkers. It has the potential to reach millions of college students, perhaps as a clinical tool used by college counseling centers as an adjunct to formal care or as a preventive tool for first-year students or other high-risk groups on campus.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Residential treatment is a common approach for treating opioid use disorder (OUD), however, few studies have directly compared it to outpatient treatment. The objective of this study was to compare OUD outcomes among individuals receiving residential and outpatient treatment. Methods A retrospective cohort study used linked data from a state Medicaid program, vital statistics, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Treatment Episodes Dataset (TEDS) to compare OUD-related health outcomes among individuals treated in a residential or outpatient setting between 2014 and 2017. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models examined the association between treatment setting and outcomes (i.e., opioid overdose, non-overdose opioid-related and all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, and treatment retention) controlling for patient characteristics, co-morbidities, and use of medications for opioid use disorders (MOUD). Interaction models evaluated how MOUD use modified associations between treatment setting and outcomes. Results Of 3293 individuals treated for OUD, 957 (29%) received treatment in a residential facility. MOUD use was higher among those treated as an outpatient (43%) compared to residential (19%). The risk of opioid overdose (aHR 1.39; 95% CI 0.73–2.64) or an opioid-related emergency department encounter or admission (aHR 1.02; 95% CI 0.80–1.29) did not differ between treatment settings. Independent of setting, MOUD use was associated with a significant reduction in overdose risk (aHR 0.45; 95% CI 0.23–0.89). Residential care was associated with greater odds of retention at 6-months (aOR 1.71; 95% CI 1.32–2.21) but not 1-year. Residential treatment was only associated with improved retention for individuals not receiving MOUD (6-month aOR 2.05; 95% CI 1.56–2.71) with no benefit observed in those who received MOUD (aOR 0.75; 95% CI 0.46–1.29; interaction p = 0.001). Conclusions Relative to outpatient treatment, residential treatment was not associated with reductions in opioid overdose or opioid-related ED encounters/hospitalizations. Regardless of setting, MOUD use was associated with a significant reduction in opioid overdose risk.",

Telehealth and related technology can reduce barriers to entering and staying in care. Patient feedback is critical to the development of these newer treatment approaches to ensure they are usable and do not inadvertently recreate treatment barriers. Purpose Evaluate the perceived usability of existing and planned features of a mobile application (app) that facilitates delivery of OUD treatment via telehealth. Methods People with current or prior experience with OUD treatment were eligible for the study. Participants ( n = 31; 55% women) provided feedback on an interactive prototype demonstration via individual qualitative interviews and completed a quantitative survey on the app’s perceived usability. Descriptive statistics summarized the usability survey. We analyzed qualitative interview transcripts to elicit common themes. Results Participants were primarily white (77%) with a mean age of 42.2 years (range 22–69). Participants rated the six major features of the current app as helpful (median response 5 out of 5) and appreciated the flexibility of conducting a visit from a place of their choosing. Participants regarded the five proposed components of the app, such as daily affirmations and medication treatment-related reminders (e.g., pick up medication at pharmacy, medication schedule), as useful features with medians 5 out of 5, and reported they would recommend the app to others for OUD care. Participant qualitative interviews provided additional information on perceived usability of existing and proposed app features. Conclusion Our study suggests that an appealing, easy-to-use app—with tools and features that effectively support care—could circumvent existing barriers and foster sustained recovery.",

We aimed to examine pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physicians’ knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs on caring for adolescents with substance use. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of PEM physicians through the American Academy of Pediatrics Pediatric Emergency Medicine Collaborative Research Committee (PEM-CRC) listserv. The 41-item survey contained the following domains: demographics, current protocols and education for managing adolescent substance use, and attitudes about treatment of substance use. We calculated descriptive statistics for each variable within the domains. Results Of 177 respondents (38.2% response rate), 55.4% were female, 45.2% aged ≥ 50 years, 78% worked in a children’s hospital, and 50.8% had &gt; 15 years clinical practice. Overall, 77.8% reported caring for adolescents with a chief complaint related to non-opioid substance use and 26.0% opioid use at least once a month. Most (80.9%) reported feeling comfortable treating major medical complications of substance use, while less than half were comfortable treating withdrawal symptoms. 73% said that they were not interested in prescribing buprenorphine. Conclusions Among this national sample of PEM physicians, 3 of 4 physicians managed substance-related visits monthly, but 52% lacked comfort in managing withdrawal symptoms and 73.1% were not interested in prescribing buprenorphine. Almost all PEM physician identified substance use-related education is important but lacked access to faculty expertise or educational content. Expanded access to education and training for PEM physicians related to substance use is needed.",

Lacking from the extant literature are longitudinal investigations of treatment related outcomes during and after incarceration. Such studies could provide rich contextual data about treatment delivery and effectiveness across the CJ continuum, and would provide important insight into individual characteristics (e.g., motivation, treatment modality preferences, treatment completion rates, etc.) as well as institutional and environmental factors (e.g., appropriate staffing, space limitations for individual treatment sessions, distribution of medications, etc.). We also identified the importance of reproducibility within CJ research, and the unfortunate reality of too many single studies conducted in single (or relatively few) correctional facilities. Some of this has been because the studies designed to produce that evidence are not prioritized for funding, which has continually placed researchers in a position where we cannot make firm conclusions or recommendations based on available evidence. The importance of replicating the foundational studies in this field cannot be overstated. We hope this article spurs other researchers to join in the healthy process of questioning the existing state of the CJ-based SUD treatment research, what should be re-examined, and how we can lay a stronger foundation for the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Problematic substance use and Substance Use Disorders (SUD) are common in all layers of the population. Several studies suggest higher prevalence rates of problematic substance use among physicians compared to the general population, which is harmful for themselves and potentially impairs quality of care. However, nationwide comparison with a highly educated reference group is lacking. Using nationwide register data, this study compared the prevalence of clinical SUD diagnoses and alcohol consumption patterns between physicians and a highly educated reference population. Methods A retrospective study was performed using registry data from 2011 up to and including 2019, provided by Statistics Netherlands. From the data, a highly educated reference group was selected and those with an active medical doctor registration were identified as “physicians”. Clinical SUD diagnoses were identified by DSM-IV codes in mental healthcare registries. Benchmark analyses were performed, without statistical testing, to compare the prevalence of SUD diagnoses and alcohol consumption patterns between physicians and the reference population. Results Clinical SUD diagnoses were found among 0.3% of the physicians and 0.5% of the reference population, with higher proportions of sedative use disorder among physician patients. Among drinkers, the prevalence rates of heavy and excessive drinking were respectively 4.0% and 4.3% for physicians and 7.7% and 6.4% for the reference population. Conclusion Prevalence rates of SUD diagnoses were fairly comparable between physicians and the highly educated reference population, but physicians displayed more favorable alcohol consumption patterns. The use of sedatives by physicians might deserve attention, given the relatively higher prevalence of sedative use disorder among physicians. Overall, we observed relatively low prevalence rates of SUD diagnoses and problematic alcohol use, which may reflect a treatment gap and social desirable answers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are prevalent and often go untreated. Patients are commonly screened for AUD in primary care, but existing treatment programs are failing to meet demand. Digital therapeutics include novel mobile app-based treatment approaches which may be cost-effective treatment options to help fill treatment gaps. The goal of this study was to identify implementation needs and workflow design considerations for integrating digital therapeutics for AUD into primary care. Methods We conducted qualitative interviews with clinicians, care delivery leaders, and implementation staff (n = 16) in an integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States. All participants had experience implementing digital therapeutics for depression or substance use disorders in primary care. Interviews were designed to gain insights into adaptations needed to optimize existing clinical processes, workflows, and implementation strategies for use with alcohol-focused digital therapeutics. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and then analyzed using a rapid analysis process and affinity diagramming. Results Qualitative themes were well represented across health system staff roles. Participants were enthusiastic about digital therapeutics for AUD, anticipated high patient demand for such a resource, and made suggestions for successful implementation. Key insights regarding the implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD and unhealthy alcohol use from our data include: (1) implementation strategy selection must be driven by digital therapeutic design and target population characteristics, (2) implementation strategies should seek to minimize burden on clinicians given the large numbers of patients with AUD who are likely to be interested in and eligible for digital therapeutics, and (3) digital therapeutics should be offered alongside many other treatment options to accommodate individual patients’ AUD severity and treatment goals. Participants also expressed confidence that previous implementation strategies used with other digital therapeutics such as clinician training, electronic health record supports, health coaching, and practice facilitation would be effective for the implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD. Conclusions The implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD would benefit from careful consideration of the target population. Optimal integration requires tailoring workflows to meet anticipated patient volume and designing workflow and implementation strategies to meet the unique needs of patients with varying AUD severity.",

SMART Recovery has not been adapted to target young people with addictive behaviours despite the potential to overcome important barriers affecting youth engagement in other addiction programs. This study aimed to engage young people and SMART Recovery facilitators in qualitative interviews and focus groups to explore the potential of such a program and gain specific insights for its development. Methods We conducted qualitative interviews and a focus group with five young people (aged between 14 and 24 years) and eight key stakeholders (including seven SMART Recovery facilitators) to obtain recommendations on how best to reach, engage, and support young people with addictive behaviours in a tailored SMART Recovery program. Qualitative data was transcribed and analysed using iterative categorization. Results Five key themes were identified when developing and delivering youth-targeted SMART Recovery. [1] ‘Discussing personal experiences to promote a shared identity’ refers to the benefits of creating a forum where personal stories are used to connect with others and validate one’s experiences. [2] ‘Flexible and patient approach’ emphasises a preference for facilitators to take a more gentle, less direct approach that allows for discussion beyond addictive behaviours. [3] ‘Balancing information and skills with the space for discussion’ acknowledges that youth want to connect in a variety of ways, beyond discussion of addictive behaviours, and that they wish to lead skill sharing and development. [4] ‘Conveying a community for youth through language’ highlighted the need to focus on connecting youth and to avoid the use of generic language to engage young people. [5] ‘Group logistics and competing demands’ refers to the logistical considerations of implementing a group program for youth that takes into account their competing demands and group accessibility. Conclusion The findings point to considerations for developing youth specific mutual-aid groups, in particular a youth-targeted SMART Recovery program, such as by ensuring the conversation is youth-led and with an informal and flexible approach to guide group discussion.",

The aim of this study was to explore how people living with SUD experience and describe their everyday life when owning a dog.Eight semi-structured in-depth individual interviews were conducted with people having personal experience of living with SUD and owning a dog. Data were gathered and analysed using qualitative content analysis.The analysis yielded four categories, reflecting different aspects of dog ownership. Living with SUD and owning a dog was primarily something positive in their life. People increased their social connections personally and within society. They felt a belonging which gave a sense of agency and purpose, and they developed structure in their day and boundaries to their environment. Dog ownership, however, could hinder access to services which was found to be challenging for some participants.The owning of a dog can lead to changes that parallel those of a recovery process. This finding adds to the research on the connection that dogs can provide and shows how pertinent this can be particularly for vulnerable persons such as those with SUD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) is particularly dangerous for people with chronic liver disease. Liver clinics may be an important setting in which to provide effective alcohol-related care by integrating evidence-based strategies, such as brief intervention and medications for alcohol use disorder. We conducted qualitative interviews with clinical stakeholders and patients at liver clinics in four Veterans Health Administration (VA) medical centers to understand barriers and facilitators of integrating alcohol-related care and to support tailoring of a practice facilitation implementation intervention. Methods Data collection and analysis were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Interviews were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed using a Rapid Assessment Process (RAP) guided by the CFIR. Results We interviewed 46 clinical stakeholders and 41 patient participants and analyzed findings based on the CFIR. Clinical stakeholders described barriers and facilitators that ranged from operations/clinic resource-based (e.g., time and capacity, desire for additional provider types, referral processes) to individual perspective and preference-based (e.g., supportiveness of leadership, individual experiences/beliefs). Patient participants shared barriers and facilitators that ranged from relationship-based (e.g., trusting the provider and feeling judged) to resource and education-based (e.g., connection to a range of treatment options, education about impact of alcohol). Many barriers and facilitators to integrating alcohol-related care in liver clinics were similar to those identified in other clinical settings (e.g., time, resources, role clarity, stigmatizing beliefs). However, some barriers (e.g., fellow-led care and lack of integration of liver clinics with addictions specialists) and facilitators (e.g., presence of quality improvement staff in clinics and integrated pharmacists and behavioral health specialists) were more unique to liver clinics. Conclusions These findings support the possibility of integrating alcohol-related care into liver clinics but highlight the importance of tailoring efforts to account for variation in provider beliefs and experiences and clinic resources. The barriers and facilitators identified in these interviews were used to tailor a practice facilitation implementation intervention in each clinic setting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Implementation of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in jails varies by facility and across states. Organizational climate, including staff attitudes toward change and exposure to education, can influence perceptions of innovations like MOUD in jails. Using a mixed methods design, we aimed to understand the association between organizational climate and jail staff perceptions of MOUD. Methods Jail staff (n = 111) who operate MOUD programs in 6 Massachusetts jails completed surveys that included the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) survey. Random effects logistic regression models assessed associations between organizational climate and several outcomes of perceived MOUD efficacy, acceptability, and knowledge, while controlling for covariates. Jail staff (N = 61) participated in qualitative interviews and focus groups focused on organizational climate and knowledge diffusion, which we analyzed using inductive and deductive methods. Results The results indicate that organizational change readiness on the ORIC was associated with positive perceptions of MOUD, and educational resources facilitated MOUD implementation. Greater ORIC was associated with higher perception of methadone as highly acceptable for jail populations (Odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.2 to 4.4), and high knowledge of methadone (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.9), with similar magnitude of effects for buprenorphine. High levels of training for jail staff on methadone and buprenorphine were also associated with higher knowledge of these medications (Methadone: OR 7.2, 95% CI 2.2 to 23.2; Buprenorphine: OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 9.5). Qualitative results point towards the importance of organizational climate and elucidate educational strategies to improve staff perceptions of MOUD. Conclusion Results underscore the importance of organizational climate for successful implementation of jail MOUD programs and provide support for medication-specific educational resources as a facilitator of successful MOUD implementation in jail settings. Findings highlight implementation strategies that may improve jail staff perceptions of MOUD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background People with substance use disorders (SUDs) have restricted engagement with health-care facilities and describe repeated experiences of stigma, discrimination, and mistreatment when receiving care at health-care and public addiction treatment centers (PATCs). The purpose of the current study is to design practical cultural-based strategies to reduce addiction-related stigma and discrimination at PATCs. Methods/design The present study will use a mixed-methods design with an explanatory sequential approach. Phase 1 of the study will combine a cluster sampling technique combined with a cross-sectional survey of Patients with Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) in Mazandaran, Iran. A total of three hundred and sixty individuals with SUDs will be selected to assess their experiences of stigma and factors predicting stigma. Phase 2 will involve qualitative study aimed at exploring participants’ perceptions regarding the aspects and determinants of their stigma experience. The participants will include two groups: people with SUDs and staff/health-care providers at PATCs. Participants for Phase 2 will be purposively sampled from those involved in Phase 1.Qualitative data will be collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions and analyzed using content analysis with a conventional approach. Phase 3 will focus on the development of new strategies to reduce the experiences of stigma among people with SUDs at PATCs. These strategies will be formulated based on the findings derived from the qualitative and quantitative data obtained in Phases 1 and 2, a comprehensive review of the literature, and expert opinions gathered using the nominal group technique. Discussion This is one of the few studies conducted within the domain of stigma pertaining to individuals who use drugs within the context of Iranian culture employing a mixed-methods approach, this study aims to develop culturally sensitive strategies to reduce such problems from the perspective of Iranian people who use drugs. It is anticipated that the study will yield evidence-based insights and provide practical strategies to reduce the stigma and discrimination experienced by people who use drugs at PATCs. Such outcomes are important for informing policymaking and designing healthcare interventions tailored to the needs of individuals grappling with substance dependency.",

    "abstract": "Regulations put in place to protect the privacy of individuals receiving substance use disorder (SUD) treatment have resulted in an unintended consequence of siloed SUD treatment and referral information outside of the integrated electronic health record (EHR). Recent revisions to these regulations have opened the door to data integration, which creates opportunities for enhanced patient care and more efficient workflows. We report on the experience of one safety-net hospital system integrating SUD treatment data into the EHR. SUD treatment and referral information was integrated from siloed systems into the EHR through the implementation of a referral order, treatment episode definition, and referral and episode-related tools for addiction therapists and other clinicians. Integration was evaluated by monitoring SUD treatment episode characteristics, patient characteristics, referral linkage, and treatment episode retention before and after integration. Satisfaction of end-users with the new tools was evaluated through a survey of addiction therapists. After integration, three more SUD treatment programs were represented in the EHR. This increased the number of patients that could be tracked as initiating SUD treatment by 250%, from 562 before to 1,411 after integration. After integration, overall referral linkage declined (74% vs. 48%) and treatment episode retention at 90-days was higher (45% vs. 74%). Addiction therapists appreciated the efficiency of having all SUD treatment information in the EHR but did not find that the tools provided a large time savings shortly after integration. Integration of SUD treatment program data into the EHR facilitated both care coordination in patient treatment and quality improvement initiatives for treatment programs. Referral linkage and retention rates were likely modified by a broader capture of patients and changed outcome definition criteria. Greater preparatory workflow analysis may decrease initial end-user burden. Integration of siloed data, made possible given revised regulations, is essential to an efficient hub-and-spoke model of care, which must standardize and coordinate patient care across multiple clinics and departments.",

    "abstract": "Despite continuing advancements in treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD), continued high rates of relapse indicate the need for more effective approaches, including novel pharmacological interventions. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) provide a promising avenue as a non-opioid medication for the treatment of OUD. Whereas GLP-1RAs have shown promise as a treatment for alcohol and nicotine use disorders, to date, no controlled clinical trials have been conducted to determine if a GLP-1RA can reduce craving in individuals with OUD. The purpose of the current protocol was to evaluate the potential for a GLP-1RA, liraglutide, to safely and effectively reduce craving in an OUD population in residential treatment. This preliminary study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to test the safety and efficacy of the GLP-1RA, liraglutide, in 40 participants in residential treatment for OUD. Along with taking a range of safety measures, efficacy for cue-induced craving was evaluated prior to (Day 1) and following (Day 19) treatment using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in response to a cue reactivity task during functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and for craving. Efficacy of treatment for ambient craving was assessed using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) prior to (Study Day 1), across (Study Days 2-19), and following (Study Days 20-21) residential treatment. This manuscript describes a protocol to collect clinical data on the safety and efficacy of a GLP-1RA, liraglutide, during residential treatment of persons with OUD, laying the groundwork for further evaluation in a larger, outpatient OUD population. Improved understanding of innovative, non-opioid based treatments for OUD will have the potential to inform community-based interventions and health policy, assist physicians and health care professionals in the treatment of persons with OUD, and to support individuals with OUD in their effort to live a healthy life.

We aimed to explore Turkish FPs knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids. Methods Eleven in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with FPs in Istanbul, Türkiye. Participants were recruited through purposeful sampling from respondents to a previous survey study completed with 243 participants in 2022. The survey explored the knowledge, attitudes and recommendations of FPs in Istanbul about e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids. Participants indicated availability for a follow up qualitative interview. FPs were interviewed and audio files were transcribed verbatim. QSR NVivo was used to aid coding, thematic analysis and retrieval of quotes. Results FPs expressed they had little knowledge about e-cigarettes and this impacted their confidence to discuss these with their patients. They held a range of views on the harms of e-cigarettes and the potential for a gateway effect and dual use with tobacco cigarettes. FPs stated they would not recommend e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids and half were not keen on a prescription model for e-cigarettes. FPs did not feel comfortable or have the confidence to answer patient questions about e-cigarettes if asked. They were keen to learn more about e-cigarettes and receive training and education to be able to better inform their patients about e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids. Conclusion FPs in Türkiye require more understanding of e-cigarettes if they are to answer patient questions about using e-cigarettes to support smoking cessation. They perceived to be lack of evidence and research on the harms of vaping and as such were not currently willing to recommend them to patients. FPs desired more information and resources from trusted sources to support them to learn about e-cigarettes in order to discuss them with patients. Providing evidence-based information and upskilling FPs on e-cigarettes may increase their knowledge and confidence to have discussions about e-cigarettes for smoking cessation.",

    "abstract": "Research indicates that brief motivational interventions are efficacious treatments for hazardous drinking. Little is known, however, about the psychological processes that may moderate intervention success. Based on growing evidence that drinking behavior may be influenced by automatic (nonvolitional) mental processes, the current study examined whether automatic alcohol-approach associations moderated the effect of a brief motivational intervention. Specifically, we examined whether the efficacy of a single-session intervention designed to increase motivation to reduce alcohol consumption would be moderated by the strength of participants' automatic alcohol-approach associations. Eighty-seven undergraduate hazardous drinkers participated for course credit. Participants completed an Implicit Association Test to measure automatic alcohol-approach associations, a baseline measure of readiness to change drinking behavior, and measures of alcohol involvement. Participants were then randomly assigned to either a brief (15-minute) motivational intervention or a control condition. Participants completed a measure of readiness to change drinking at the end of the first session and returned for a follow-up session six weeks later in which they reported on their drinking over the previous month. Compared with the control group, those in the intervention condition showed higher readiness to change drinking at the end of the baseline session but did not show decreased drinking quantity at follow-up. Automatic alcohol-approach associations moderated the effects of the intervention on change in drinking quantity. Among participants in the intervention group, those with weak automatic alcohol-approach associations showed greater reductions in the amount of alcohol consumed per occasion at follow-up compared with those with strong automatic alcohol-approach associations. Automatic appetitive associations with alcohol were not related with change in amount of alcohol consumed per occasion in control participants. Furthermore, among participants who showed higher readiness to change, those who exhibited weaker alcohol-approach associations showed greater reductions in drinking quantity compared with those who exhibited stronger alcohol-approach associations. The results support the idea that automatic mental processes may moderate the influence of brief motivational interventions on quantity of alcohol consumed per drinking occasion. The findings suggest that intervention efficacy may be improved by utilizing implicit measures to identify those who may be responsive to brief interventions and by developing intervention elements to address the influence of automatic processes on drinking behavior.",

Upon further interview, he confided that he had a past history of recurrent 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT or “Foxy”) abuse, as well as a recent history of recurrent ingestion of a legal aromatic liquid used as a recreational drug. After this episode, his condition improved and he did not follow up at subsequent appointments. However, 6 months later, he suffered a relapse of prolonged delusions after again ingesting a recreational aromatic liquid. An evaluation of the chronological sequence of the patient’s condition revealed that ingestion of these aromatic liquids, which can be purchased easily on the Internet, likely triggered the patient’s delusional episodes. We speculate that the patient’s recurrent abuse of 5-MeO-DIPT caused sensitization (or reverse tolerance), thus prolonging his delusions. Sensitization is the amplification of a response following repeated administrations of a stimulus. 5-MeO-DIPT is a popular drug of abuse, and it is highly probable that a large number of past 5-MeO-DIPT users are currently sensitized. This is an important latent factor underlying subsequent episode of drug-induced psychosis. Psychiatrists should consider the possibility of 5-MeO-DIPT sensitization when evaluating patients with acute psychoses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV-infected people who use drugs (PWUD) exhibit the highest rates of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people living with HIV. This contributes to poor treatment outcomes, increased morbidity and mortality, and HIV transmission. However, current interventions fail to address the unique barriers to adherence faced by this population. Life Steps is a brief, single session intervention that demonstrated increased ART adherence among HIV-infected individuals. This study protocol seeks to improve clinical practice by adapting Life Steps for HIV-infected PWUD and adding a brief motivational intervention addressing drug use. This intervention will incorporate educational, motivational, and behavioral skills components specifically aimed at improving adherence and linkage to substance use treatment among HIV-infected PWUD. Methods This project will consist of three phases using a mixed-methods approach. In Phase 1 , qualitative interviews with HIV-infected PWUD and community providers, coupled with feedback from an expert review panel, will be used to enhance the existing Life Steps manual and interventionist training protocol. In Phase 2 , the prototype will be pilot tested and qualitative exit interviews with HPWUD will identify the strengths and limitations of the intervention. Data regarding feasibility, acceptability, and barriers to delivery will guide modifications to finalize a modified Life Steps-Drug Use (LS-DU) protocol. In Phase 3 , a pilot type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial will examine the effectiveness of LS-DU relative to a health education intervention control condition on ART adherence and viral load data at 1-, 3-, and 6-months. Data regarding clinic readiness for implementation and intervention sustainability potential will be collected. Discussion This protocol will adapt and evaluate an intervention to improve adherence among HIV-infected PWUD. Results of this study will provide significant data on the acceptability, initial effectiveness, and sustainability potential of an adherence intervention for a high risk and underserved population.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background This study protocol describes a proposed randomized controlled trial that builds upon a successful pilot intervention study to address problematic and dangerous drinking among young adult college students studying abroad in foreign environments. Despite universities and colleges citing alcohol misuse as the most concerning issue for their students abroad, most institutions offer no empirically-based prevention efforts tailored to this at-risk population. The proposed intervention attempts to fill a major gap for the nearly 333,000 students completing study abroad programs each year by using empirically-based and theoretically-informed risk and protective factors to correct misperceived peer drinking norms and promote cultural engagement abroad. In addition to preventing heavy and problematic drinking, the intervention seeks to prevent risky sexual behaviors (e.g., sex without a condom) and experience of sexual violence victimization, which are strikingly common among study abroad students and have the potential for lasting physical and psychological effects upon return home. Methods/design We will conduct a randomized controlled trial of an intervention with a sample of 1200 college students studying abroad from approximately 50 US universities and colleges. The brief, online intervention is text and video based and contains evidence-based components of personalized normative feedback to correct students’ misperceived drinking norms, content to promote engagement with the cultural experience abroad and address difficulties adjusting to life in the foreign environment, and tips and strategies to prevent risky sexual behaviors and sexual violence victimization abroad. Participants will complete online surveys at five time points (predeparture, first month abroad, last month abroad, 1-month post-return, and 3-months post-return) to assess for intervention effects on drinking behavior, drinking consequences, risky sex, and sexual violence outcomes. We will examine whether the mechanisms targeted by the intervention (changes in perceived norms, engagement in the cultural experience abroad) serve as mediators of intervention efficacy. Discussion The proposed study has the potential to fill an important gap in the research literature and provide empirical support for an online accessible, brief, and targeted approach that can easily be distributed to study abroad students to help prevent heavy alcohol use and sexual risk abroad.

    "abstract": "Chronic pain and heavy drinking commonly co-occur and can influence the course of HIV. There have been no interventions designed to address both of these conditions among people living with HIV (PLWH), and none that have used telehealth methods. The purpose of this study was to better understand pain symptoms, patterns of alcohol use, treatment experiences, and technology use among PLWH in order to tailor a telehealth intervention that addresses these conditions. Ten participants with moderate or greater chronic pain and heavy drinking were recruited from a cohort of patients engaged in HIV-care (Boston Alcohol Research Collaborative on HIV/AIDS Cohort) and from an integrated HIV/primary care clinic at a large urban hospital. One-on-one interviews were conducted with participants to understand experiences and treatment of HIV, chronic pain, and alcohol use. Participants' perceptions of the influence of alcohol on HIV and chronic pain were explored as was motivation to change drinking. Technology use and treatment preferences were examined in the final section of the interview. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and uploaded into NVivo® v12 software for analysis. A codebook was developed based on interviews followed by thematic analysis in which specific meanings were assigned to codes. Interviews were supplemented with Likert-response items to evaluate components of the proposed intervention. A number of themes were identified that had implications for intervention tailoring including: resilience in coping with HIV; autonomy in health care decision-making; coping with pain, stress, and emotion; understanding treatment rationale; depression and social withdrawal; motives to drink and refrain from drinking; technology use and capacity; and preference for intervention structure and style. Ratings of intervention components indicated that participants viewed each of the proposed intervention content areas as \"helpful\" to \"very helpful\". Videoconferencing was viewed as an acceptable modality for intervention delivery. Results helped specify treatment targets and provided information about how to enhance intervention delivery. The interviews supported the view that videoconferencing is an acceptable telehealth method of addressing chronic pain and heavy drinking among PLWH.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Risky drinking among Russian women constitutes a significant risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP). Russian women report that obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physicians are the most important source of information about alcohol consumption during pregnancy and developing effective prevention interventions by OB/GYNs is indicated. This is the first study focused on implementation of an AEP prevention intervention at women’s clinics in Russia. The paper describes the intervention protocol and addresses questions about the feasibility of a brief FASD prevention intervention delivered by OB/GYNs at women’s clinics in Russia. Brief physician intervention guidelines and two evidence-based FASD prevention interventions were utilized to design a brief dual-focused physician intervention (DFBPI) appropriate to Russian OB/GYN care. The questions answered were whether trained OB/GYN physicians could deliver DFBPI during women’s routine clinic visits, whether they maintained skills over time in clinical settings, and which specific intervention components were better maintained. Data were collected as part of a larger study aimed at evaluating effectiveness of DFBPI in reducing AEP risk in non-pregnant women. Methods of monitoring the intervention delivery included fidelity check lists (FCL) with the key components of the intervention completed by physicians and patients and live and audio taped observations of intervention sessions. Physicians (N = 23) and women (N = 372) independently completed FCL, and 78 audiotapes were coded. The differences between women’s and physicians’ reports on individual items were not significant. Although the majority of physician and patient reports were consistent (N = 305), a discrepancy existed between the reports in 57 cases. Women reported more intervention components missing compared to physicians (p < 0.001). Discussing barriers was the most difficult component for physicians to implement, and OB/GYN demonstrated difficulties in discussing contraception methods. The results supported the feasibility of the DFBPI in Russia. OB/GYN physicians trained in the DFBPI, monitored, and supported were able to implement and maintain skills during the study. In addition to the alcohol focus, DFBPI training needs to have a sufficient component to improve physicians’ skills in discussing contraception use.",

This paper describes the protocol of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of the LINC intervention in St. Petersburg, Russia. Participants (n = 349) were recruited from the inpatient wards at the City Addiction Hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. After completing a baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to receive either the LINC intervention or standard of care. Participants returned for research assessments 6 and 12 months post-baseline. Primary outcomes were assessed via chart review at HIV treatment locations. LINC holds the potential to offer an effective approach to coordinating HIV care for people who inject drugs in Russia. The LINC intervention utilizes existing systems of care in Russia, minimizing adoption of substantial infrastructure for implementation. Trial Registration NCT01612455",

    "abstract": "People who smoke crack cocaine and people who inject drugs are at-risk for criminal justice involvement as well as HIV and HCV infection. Compared to criminal justice involvement, substance use treatment (SUT) can be cost-effective in reducing drug use and its associated health and social costs. We conducted a cross-sectional study of people who smoke crack cocaine and people who inject drugs to examine the association between incarceration, community supervision and substance use treatment with HIV/HCV testing, components of the HIV treatment cascade, social and physical vulnerability and risk behavior. Targeted sampling methods were used to recruit people who smoke crack cocaine and people who inject drugs (N = 2072) in Oakland, California from 2011 to 2013. Poisson regression models were used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios between study exposures and outcomes. The overall HIV prevalence was 3.3% (95% CI 2.6–4.1). People previously experiencing incarceration were 21% (p < 0.001) and 32% (p = 0.001), respectively, more likely to report HIV and HCV testing; and were not more likely to report receiving HIV care or initiating ART. People previously experiencing community supervision were 17% (p = 0.001) and 15% (p = 0.009), respectively, more likely to report HIV and HCV testing; and were not more likely to report receiving HIV care or initiating ART. People with a history of SUT were 15% (p < 0.001) and 23% (p < 0.001), respectively, more likely to report receiving HIV and HCV testing, 67% (p = 0.016) more likely to report HIV care, and 92% (p = 0.012) more likely to report HIV treatment initiation. People previously experiencing incarceration or community supervision were also more likely to report homelessness, trouble meeting basic needs and risk behavior. People with a history of substance use treatment reported higher levels of HCV and HIV testing and greater access to HIV care and treatment among HIV-positive individuals. People with a history of incarceration or community supervision reported higher levels of HCV and HIV testing, but not greater access to HIV care or treatment among HIV-positive individuals., Substance use treatment programs that are integrated with other services for HIV and HCV will be critical to simultaneously address the underlying reasons drug-involved people engage in drug-related offenses and improve access to essential medical services.",

    "abstract": "Though timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a vital component of effective HIV prevention, care and treatment, people who inject drugs are less likely to receive ART than their non-drug using counterparts. In an effort to increase access to ART for people who inject drugs, we examined perceived benefits, challenges, and recommendations for implementing an integrated methadone and ART service delivery model at an opioid treatment program (OTP) clinic in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We conducted in-depth interviews with 12 providers and 20 HIV-positive patients at the Muhimbili National Hospital OTP clinic in early 2015. We used thematic content analysis to examine patient and provider perspectives of an integrated model. Respondents perceived that offering on-site CD4 testing and HIV clinical management at the OTP clinic would improve the timeliness and efficiency of the ART eligibility process, make HIV clinical care more convenient, mitigate stigma and discrimination in HIV care and treatment settings, and improve patient monitoring and ART adherence. However, perceived challenges included overburdened OTP clinic staff and limited space at the clinic to accommodate additional services. Limited privacy at the OTP clinic and its contribution to fear among HIV-positive patients of being stigmatized by their peers at the clinic was a common theme expressed particularly by patients, and often corroborated by providers. Co-dispensing ART and methadone at the clinic's pharmacy window was viewed as a potential deterrent for patients. Providers felt that an electronic health information system would help them better monitor patients' progress, but that this system would need to be integrated into existing health information systems. To address these potential barriers to implementing an integrated model, respondents recommended increasing OTP provider and clinic capacity, offering flexible ART dispensing options, ensuring privacy with ART dispensing, and harmonizing any new electronic health information systems with existing systems. An integrated methadone and ART service delivery model at the MNH OTP clinic could improve access to HIV care and treatment for OTP patients. However, specific implementation strategies must ensure that OTP providers are not overburdened and confidentiality of patients is maintained.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background For persons with substance use disorders (SUDs), 12-step groups (TSGs) are the most available and used peer-based recovery resource, worldwide. However, disengagement is common, and attrition may partly be due to practices and procedures within these groups that are unacceptable to a portion of the population with SUDs. Our overall aim was to identify problematic issues related to Narcotics Anonymous (NA) participation in Norway, to inform addiction professionals’ strategies when referring persons to addiction-related self-help groups (SHGs). Methods In this qualitative study, we interviewed ten individuals who had previously participated regularly in NA for at least 6 months, to examine their reasons for disengagement. We interpreted the interviews using thematic analysis. Results We identified three themes: (1) ‘ The model did not fit’, either the strategies utilized in NA (e.g., meeting format and step working) or NA’s explanatory model of addiction, (2) ‘Negative experiences spurred frustration’, and (3) ‘The safe place can become a cage’. The respondents believed that a main aim of recovery was reintegration into society, such that SHG participation should not be an end goal, but rather a platform for normalization back into society. Despite their negative experiences and strong critique, respondents still regarded NA as a valuable recovery resource, but pointed out that one size does not fit all. Conclusion Addiction professionals should recognize possible problems related to TSG participation, to help prevent negative experiences and possible harms to individuals. Professionals should also inform individuals about alternative support groups, to help them find the recovery resource best suited to them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Aboriginal alcohol and other drug residential rehabilitation (residential rehabilitation) services have been providing treatment in Australia of over 50 years. However, there are no studies in Australia or internationally that document characteristics of clients attending Indigenous residential rehabilitation services worldwide. This is the first multi-site paper to describe key client characteristics of six Indigenous (hereafter Aboriginal Australians as the term recommended by the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of New South Wales) residential rehabilitation services in Australia. Methods All recorded client admissions between 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2016 were considered from six operating services in the Australian state of New South Wales. Data collected were classified into categories based on demographics, treatment utilisation, substance use, mental health and quality of life characteristics. Means, median and percentages were calculated (where appropriate). Results There were 2645 admissions across the six services in the study period, with an average of 440 admissions per year across all services. Participants were aged between 26 to 35 years, with fewest participants aged 46 +. Program length ranged from 12 to 52 weeks (mean of 12 weeks). The completion rates and length of stay for each service ranged from less than two to more than 12 weeks. The principal drug of choice was alcohol and amphetamines in half of the services. Not all services used them, but a range of tools were used to measure treatment, substance use and mental health or quality of life outcomes. Conclusion This study is the first internationally to describe the key features of multiple Aboriginal residential rehabilitation services. The variation in tools used to collect client data made it difficult to compare client characteristics across services. Future research could explore predictors of treatment completion, identify opportunities for standardisation in client assessments and validate cultural approaches of care. These efforts would need to be guided by Aboriginal leadership in each service.",

We examined the effectiveness of integrated stepped alcohol treatment (ISAT) on alcohol use and HIV outcomes among PWH and at-risk alcohol use. Methods In this multi-site, randomized trial conducted between January 28, 2013 through July 14, 2017, we enrolled PWH and at-risk alcohol use [defined as alcohol consumption of ≥ 14 drinks per week or ≥ 4 drinks per occasion in men ≤ 65 years old or ≥ 7 drinks per week or ≥ 3 drinks per occasion in women or men &gt; 65 years old]. ISAT (n = 46) involved: Step 1- Brief Negotiated Interview with telephone booster, Step 2- Motivational Enhancement Therapy, and Step 3- Addiction Physician Management. Treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 47) involved receipt of a health handout plus routine care. Analyses were conducted based on intention to treat principles. Results Despite a multi-pronged approach, we only recruited 37% of the target population (n = 93/254). Among ISAT participants, 50% advanced to Step 2, among whom 57% advanced to Step 3. Participants randomized to ISAT and TAU had no observed difference in drinks per week over the past 30 days at week 24 (primary outcome) [least square means (Ls mean) (95% CI) = 8.8 vs. 10.6; adjusted mean difference (AMD) (95% CI) = − 0.4 (− 3.9, 3.0)]. Conclusion An insufficient number of patients were interested in participating in the trial. Efforts to enhance motivation of PWH with at-risk alcohol use to engage in alcohol-related research and build upon ISAT are needed.

Participants (N = 159) were 65 percent male, 40 percent Hispanic, and an average age of 30 (SD = 9.8).

Participants were assessed at intake and program completion. We examined intervention acceptance and preliminary efficacy of the interventions on alcohol consumption, DUI, and alcohol-related consequences.Web-MI and in-person MI participants rated the quality of and satisfaction with their sessions significantly higher than participants in the UC-only condition. However, there were no significant group differences between the MI conditions and the UC-only condition in alcohol consumption, DUI, and alcohol-related consequences. Further, 67 percent of our sample met criteria for alcohol dependence, and the majority of participants in all three study conditions continued to report alcohol-related consequences at follow-up.Participants receiving MI plus UC and UC-only had similar improvements, and a large proportion had symptoms of alcohol dependence. Receiving a DUI and having to deal with the numerous consequences related to this type of event may be significant enough to reduce short-term behaviors, but future research should explore whether more intensive interventions are needed to sustain long-term changes.",

Drug-positive versus -negative patients did not differ on demographics or rates of substance abuse/dependence diagnoses.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In the United States, methadone for opioid use disorder (OUD) is limited to highly regulated opioid treatment programs (OTPs), rendering it inaccessible to many patients. The “72-hour rule” allows non-OTP providers to administer methadone for emergency opioid withdrawal management while arranging ongoing care. Low-barrier substance use disorder (SUD) bridge clinics provide rapid access to buprenorphine but offer an opportunity to treat acute opioid withdrawal while facilitating OTP linkage. We describe the case of a patient with OUD who received methadone for opioid withdrawal in a bridge clinic and linked to an OTP within 72 h. Case presentation A 54-year-old woman with severe OUD was seen in a SUD bridge clinic requesting OTP linkage and assessed with a clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) score of 12. She reported daily nasal use of 1 g heroin/fentanyl. Prior OUD treatment included buprenorphine-naloxone, which was only partially effective. Her acute opioid withdrawal was treated with a single observed oral dose of methadone 20 mg. She returned the following day with persistent opioid withdrawal (COWS score 11) and was treated with methadone 40 mg. On day 3, the patient was successfully admitted to a local OTP, where she remained engaged 3 months later. Conclusions While patients continue to face substantial access barriers, bridge clinics can play an important role in treating opioid withdrawal, building partnerships with OTPs to initiate methadone on demand, and preventing life-threatening delays to methadone treatment. Federal policy reform is urgently needed to make methadone more accessible to people with OUD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background An increasing number of individuals who use drugs in North America are preferentially consuming fentanyl over other opioids. This has significant consequences on the treatment and management of opioid use disorder (OUD) and its concurrent disorders, especially in acute care if opioid requirements are not met. Case presentation We present a patient with severe OUD and daily injection of fentanyl, admitted to hospital for management of acute physical health issues. Due to high opioid requirements and history of patient-initiated discharge, intravenous fentanyl was administered for treatment of opioid withdrawal, and management of pain, which supported continued hospitalization for acute care treatment and aligned with substance use treatment goals. Conclusion This case demonstrates that intravenous fentanyl for management of OUD in hospital can be a feasible approach to meet opioid requirements and avoid fentanyl withdrawal among patients with severe OUD and daily fentanyl use, thereby promoting adherence to medical treatment and reducing the risk of patient-initiated discharge. There is an urgent need to tailor current treatment strategies for individuals who primarily use fentanyl. Carefully designed research is needed to further explore the use of IV fentanyl for acute care management of severe opioid withdrawal in a hospital setting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for alcohol misuse has potential to radically improve access to evidence-based care, and there is a need to investigate ways to optimize its delivery in clinical settings. Guidance from a clinician has previously been shown to improve drinking outcomes in ICBT, and some studies suggest that pre-treatment assessments may contribute in initiating early change. The objective of this study was to investigate the added and combined effects of a pre-treatment assessment interview and guidance on the outcomes of ICBT for alcohol misuse delivered in an online therapy clinic. Methods A 2X2 factorial randomized controlled trial was conducted where participants received access to an 8-week ICBT program, and either a pre-treatment assessment interview (Factor 1), guidance (Factor 2), a combination of these, or neither of these. Participants were 270 individuals (66.8% female, mean age = 46.5) scoring 8 or more on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and consuming 14 standard drinks or more in the preceding week. Primary outcomes were number of drinks consumed and number of heavy drinking days during the preceding week, 3 months post-treatment. Results Large within-group effects were found in terms of alcohol reductions (d w ≥ 0.82, p &lt; 0.001), but neither of the factors significantly improved drinking outcomes. Guidance was associated with greater adherence (i.e. completed modules). Conclusions Neither a pre-treatment assessment interview nor guidance from a clinician appears to improve drinking outcomes resulting from internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for alcohol misuse when delivered in a routine online therapy clinic.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Coupling social network visualizations with Motivational Interviewing in substance use interventions has been shown to be acceptable and feasible in several pilot tests, and has been associated with changes in participants’ substance use and social networks. The objective of this study was to assess acceptability and feasibility of an adaptation of this behavior change approach into a culturally centered behavior change intervention for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) emerging adults living in urban areas. AI/AN populations experience high rates of health disparities and substance use. Although 70% of AI/AN people live outside of tribal lands, there are few culturally tailored health interventions for these AI/AN populations. Social networks can both increase and discourage substance use. Leveraging healthy social networks and increasing protective factors among urban AI/AN emerging adults may help increase resilience. Methods We conducted thirteen focus groups with 91 male and female participants (32 urban AI/AN emerging adults ages 18–25, 26 parents, and 33 providers) and one pilot test of the three workshop sessions with 15 AI/AN emerging adults. Focus group participants provided feedback on a proposed workshop-based intervention curriculum that combined group Motivational Interviewing (MI) and social network visualizations. Pilot workshop participants viewed their own social networks during group MI sessions focused on substance use and traditional practices and discussed their reactions to viewing and discussing their networks during these sessions. We used a combination of open coding of focus group and workshop session transcripts to identify themes across the group sessions and content analysis of comments entered into an online social network interview platform to assess the extent that participants had an intuitive understanding of the information conveyed through network diagrams. Results Focus group and pilot test participants reacted positively to the intervention content and approach and provided constructive feedback on components that should be changed. Themes that emerged included feasibility, acceptability, relevance, understandability, and usefulness of viewing personal network visualizations and discussing social networks during group MI workshops. Workshop participants demonstrated an intuitive understanding of network concepts (network composition and structure) when viewing their diagrams for the first time. Conclusions Social network visualizations are a promising tool for increasing awareness of social challenges and sources of resilience for urban AI/AN emerging adults. Coupled with Motivational Interviewing in a group context, social network visualizations may enhance discussions of network influences on substance use and engagement in traditional practices.

There are significant social and structural barriers to integrated delivery of PrEP and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), limiting women's ability to access these life-saving interventions. In a two parallel-arm randomized controlled trial, we are assessing an innovative eHealth delivery model that integrates PrEP with MOUD and is tailored to meet the specific needs of women involved in the criminal legal system. We will recruit and enroll 250 women involved in the criminal legal system with opioid use disorder across two diverse settings (New Haven, CT and Birmingham, AL). Participants will be randomized to (a) the \"Athena strategy,\" which includes a PrEP decision aid and integrated PrEP/MOUD delivery via eHealth; or (b) enhanced standard of care (SOC) that includes a decision aid-only.

Results could help determine if reducing the social and structural barriers to PrEP and MOUD for women involved in the criminal legal system will facilitate engagement in treatment and prevention services, thus alleviating health disparities.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Unhealthy alcohol use is an independent, modifiable risk factor for HIV, but limited research addresses alcohol use and HIV prevention synergistically. Groups that experience chronic stigma, discrimination, and/or other marginalization, such as sexual and gender minoritized groups, may have enhanced HIV risk related to unhealthy alcohol use. We described awareness of and experiences with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among a community sample of Veterans reporting unhealthy alcohol use (relative to those without), overall and across self-reported sexual orientation and gender identity. Methods Using data collected from a national online survey of Veterans recruited via Facebook ads, community organizations, and listservs, we assessed variation in four PrEP outcomes (knowledge, experience, willingness, and conversations with doctors) across patterns of unhealthy alcohol use among all respondents reporting any lifetime drinking ( n = 1,041) and then within sexual orientation and gender identity groups using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. Results Among 1,041 eligible Veterans, 440 (42%) screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use. Veterans with unhealthy alcohol use were not more likely to have heard of PrEP (58.2% vs. 55.4%, p = 0.37), but trended toward more likely to have taken PrEP (7.5% vs. 5.0%, p = 0.09), to be willing to take PrEP (30.5% vs. 27.6%, p = 0.06), and to have spoken with a doctor about PrEP (11.4% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.04). Those with heavy episodic drinking also trended toward higher prevalence of PrEP awareness (60.0% vs. 54.6%, p = 0.09), and were more likely to have taken PrEP (8.3% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.02), to be willing to use PrEP (34.6% vs. 25.5%, p &lt; 0.01), and to have had conversations with doctors about PrEP (12.7% vs. 7.2%, p &lt; 0.01). Similar patterns were observed for severe unhealthy alcohol use and past-year frequent heavy episodic drinking. Generally, sexual/gender minoritized Veterans with unhealthy alcohol use reported more PrEP-affirming responses than those without but associations with unhealthy alcohol use were similar. Conclusions Unhealthy alcohol use was prevalent, particularly among Veterans with minoritized sexual orientation/gender identity, but not clearly linked to increased PrEP-literacy and use despite its known status as an HIV risk factor. Across groups, &gt; 25% of individuals were willing to take PrEP. Interventions targeting both alcohol use and HIV prevention should capitalize on this.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Initiation of buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) in acute care settings improves access and outcomes, however patients who use methamphetamine are less likely to link to ongoing treatment. We describe the intervention and design from a pilot randomized controlled trial of an intervention to increase linkage to and retention in outpatient buprenorphine services for patients with OUD and methamphetamine use who initiate buprenorphine in the hospital. Methods The study is a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 40) comparing the mHealth Incentivized Adherence Plus Patient Navigation (MIAPP) intervention to treatment as usual. Development of the MIAPP intervention was guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills model and combines financial rewards via mobile health-based adherence monitoring with the “human touch” of a patient navigator. Participants receive financial incentives for submitting videos of themselves taking buprenorphine via smartphone. The Patient Navigator reviews videos and provides treatment adherence coaching, care coordination and motivational enhancement. The intervention is introduced prior to hospital discharge and is offered for 30 days. The primary outcome is linkage to outpatient buprenorphine care within 30 days of hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes include retention on buprenorphine 90 days post discharge, hospital readmissions, and past 30-day methamphetamine use. Discussion Interventions are needed to increase linkage and retention to outpatient buprenorphine among hospitalized patients with OUD, especially for people who co-use methamphetamine. We will examine the MIAPP intervention to improve buprenorphine adherence and linkage to outpatient treatment in a pilot randomized controlled trial which will provide valuable insights about research approaches for hospitalized patients with substance use disorder.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Unhealthy alcohol use, a spectrum of use inclusive of risky consumption and alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Most people with unhealthy alcohol use do not receive evidence-based treatment. This four-arm factorial design randomized trial will assess whether population health management (PHM) and clinical care management (CCM) support for primary care providers (PCPs) are associated with improved AUD treatment engagement among their patients, beyond electronic health record (EHR) prompting and decision support alone. Methods PCPs from an urban safety-net hospital-based primary care clinic are randomized to one of four groups (1) EHR best practice advisory (BPA) and clinical decision support tools for unhealthy alcohol use (BPA), (2) BPA plus population health manager support, (3) BPA plus clinical care manager support, and (4) all three. All PCPs will have access to the EHR BPA and decision support tools which provide chart-based advisories and order set navigation. PCPs assigned to receive PHM support will receive quarterly panel-level feedback on AUD treatment metrics for their patients. PCPs assigned to receive CCM support will receive CCM facilitation of AUD treatment processes including medication counseling, referrals, and support through direct patient interactions. The primary outcome will be the percent of patients engaged in AUD treatment among those with a new AUD diagnosis on a PCP’s panel. Secondary outcomes include the percent of patients with a new diagnosis of AUD who (1) initiated AUD treatment, (2) were prescribed AUD medications within 90 days, and (3) numerical counts of a range of AUD health services (outpatient encounters, specialty AUD care encounters, referrals, and acute healthcare utilization) in this sample. We will assess the primary outcome and the acute healthcare utilization secondary outcomes using Medicaid claims; the remaining secondary outcomes will be assessed using EHR data. Discussion The study will evaluate how a targeted EHR innovation alone, compared with population health and care management enhancements alone or in combination, impact engagement in AUD treatment, a national quality of care measure. Findings will advance understanding of supports needed to improve systems of care for AUD in general settings.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The availability of the fellowships of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous in community settings is extensive and patients admitted to treatment programs for substance use disorder may therefore have previously attended meetings of these two Twelve Step (TS) programs. Data on such prior attendance and related clinical findings, however, are not typically available. They can, however, be relevant to how ensuing treatment is planned. We therefore undertook this study to ascertain the feasibility of evaluating how the level of TS attendance prior to treatment entry can be evaluated, and to determine clinically relevant findings that are associated with such attendance. Methods Over the course of 2022, 3,125 patients were admitted to a large urban multimodal United States-based treatment center. All patients were administered the structured interview-based Global Appraisal of Individual Needs upon admission. This instrument is employed to evaluate substance use, demographics, and related psychosocial variables. Clinically related variables were analyzed relative to whether given respondents have a history of any TS group attendance prior to admission. Results Distinctions were found between the 57.3% of respondents who had previously attended any TS meetings and the 42.6% who had not attended any meetings. Compared to respondents who had never attended TS meetings, those who had ever attended scored higher on emotional problems ( p &lt;.001, d = -0.58), and had more likely undergone previous SUD treatment ( p &lt;.001, d = 0.80). They were less likely to use substances in unsafe situations ( p &lt;.001, d = -0.55) and were less likely to express reluctance to remain abstinent ( p &lt;.001, d = -0.50). The 11% of respondents who considered themselves regular TS members reported a lower frequency of recent substance use ( p &lt;.001, d = -0.80) and were more likely to have attended intensive outpatient ( p &lt;.001, 0.46) and residential ( p &lt;.001, 0.44) treatment than patients who did not consider themselves regular attenders. Conclusions Examination of TS attendance prior to treatment admission is feasible. Findings can be clinically relevant for differential treatment planning and can also serve as a basis for further research into the role of TS participation in community settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Little is known regarding predictors of outcome in treatment of alcohol dependence via the internet and in primary care. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of socio-demographic and clinical factors for outcomes in internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment (ICBT) added to treatment as usual (TAU) for alcohol dependence in primary care. Design Secondary analyses based on data from a randomized controlled trial in which participants were randomized to ICBT + TAU or to TAU only. Setting The study was conducted in collaboration with 14 primary care centers in Stockholm, Sweden. Participants The randomized trial included 264 adult primary care patients with alcohol dependence enrolled between September 2017 and November 2019. Interventions Patients in the parent trial were randomized to ICBT that was added to TAU (n = 132) or to TAU only (n = 132). ICBT was a 12-week intervention based on motivational interviewing, relapse prevention and behavioral self-control training. Measures Primary outcome was number of standard drinks last 30 days. Sociodemographic and clinical predictors were tested in separate models using linear mixed effects models. Findings Severity of dependence, assessed by ICD-10 criteria for alcohol dependence, was the only predictor for changes in alcohol consumption and the only moderator of the effect of treatment. Participants with severe dependence showed a larger reduction in alcohol consumption between baseline and 3-months follow-up compared to participants with moderate dependence. The patients with moderate dependence continued to reduce their alcohol consumption between 3- and 12-months follow-up, while patients with severe dependence did not. Conclusions Dependence severity predicted changes in alcohol consumption following treatment of alcohol dependence in primary care, with or without added ICBT. Dependence severity was also found to moderate the effect of treatment. The results suggest that treatment for both moderate and severe alcohol dependence is viable in primary care.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Public health experts currently agree that heated tobacco products (HTPs) pose a significant health risk for their consumers. The same concentrations and speed of delivery of nicotine found for HTPs and conventional combustion cigarettes make it necessary to consider the addictiveness of HTPs, and provide precise diagnostic instruments to serve as the basis for effective treatment plans. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to design a questionnaire for HTPs addiction called “ Hea ted T obacco P roducts A ddiction Q uestionnaire (HeaTPAQ)” and to examine its psychometric properties. Methods Adults from the general population of Lebanon ( n = 754) were administered the HeatPAQ, along with the Fagerström test for nicotine dependence (FTND), the Caffeine Use Disorder Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. We split the main sample into two subsamples; subsample 1 consisting of 33% of the participants used for the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) ( n = 246; mean age 27.82 ± 9.38 years) and subsample 2 consisting of 67% of the participants used for the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) ( n = 508; mean age 27.81 ± 8.80 years). Results EFA then CFA analyses revealed a one-factor model consisting of 13 items with acceptable fit to the data. The HeaTPAQ reached excellent internal consistency coefficients, with both Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω values of 0.96. The one-dimensional structure of the HeaTPAQ was found to be invariant across sex groups. Convergent validity was demonstrated through significant positive correlation with FTND scores. Furthermore, HeaTPAQ scores correlated positively with measures of caffeine addiction, anxiety and depression, which suggests the adequate concurrent validity of the scale. Conclusion Findings suggest that the HeatPAQ is a specific, short and simple-to-use self-report questionnaire to assess HTPs addiction reliably and validly. Pending future studies confirming our results, we hope that the HeatPAQ will facilitate routine screening for HTPs addiction, which is an essential step towards appropriate prevention and intervention efforts and to inform policy makers.",

The aim of this analysis is to describe the qualitative perspectives of partner organizations regarding the impacts of implementing OEND in a state that used a naloxone “hub with many spokes” model for scaling up this strategy. Methods Small group ( n = 20) and individual ( n = 24) qualitative interviews were conducted with staff from 44 agencies in eight Kentucky counties that implemented OEND from April 2020 to June 2022. Interviews were conducted between 6 and 8 months after the end of the intervention. Initial deductive coding used the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, and then additional inductive sub-coding focused on passages within the OEND Effectiveness code. Thematic analysis was then utilized to identify themes regarding the impacts of implementing OEND. Results Participants identified multi-level impacts of implementing OEND. At the individual-level, participants described lives being saved, greater access to naloxone for individuals served by the agency, reduced stigma toward OEND by clients, and greater client-level self-efficacy to respond to overdoses. Organizational impacts included improved staff readiness for overdose response, enhanced clinical relationships between staff and clients, and reduced staff stigma. Participants described positive impacts on their organizational networks and clients’ social networks. Community-level impacts included greater overall access and reduced stigma toward OEND. Conclusions These qualitative data revealed that staff from agencies involved in a community-wide effort to scale up OEND perceived multi-level benefits, including saving lives, reducing stigma, improving naloxone access, and enhancing staff and client readiness, while strengthening organizational and community networks.

Objective The relationship between program participation and smoking cessation among adults who smoke and are motivated to quit was investigated, as well as program acceptability, changes in smoking-related outcomes, including cigarettes per day (CPD), urges to smoke and psychophysiological health variables (perceived stress, mindfulness, cessation-related self-efficacy, life satisfaction, subjective psychophysiological health) and their associations with smoking cessation. Methods A prospective 6-month single-arm pilot study was conducted; 71 adults who smoked and were motivated to quit received a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app, a closed-system EC, and pods containing decreasing nicotine concentrations. Online surveys were issued at baseline, and at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks post-baseline. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and complete-case analyses were conducted to assess self-reported 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence (PPA; primary outcome), 30-day PPA, and repeated PPA. T-tests and logistic regressions were used to assess changes in secondary outcomes CPD, urges to smoke, and psychophysiological health variables by smoking status at 12 and 24 weeks, and their relationship with cessation. Results Per ITT, self-reported abstinence rates were high at 12 weeks (39.4%), and 24 weeks (32.4%), as was 30-day PPA of 32.4% at both 12 and 24 weeks. Repeated PPA per ITT was 22.5% at both 12 and 24 weeks. Non-abstinent participants significantly reduced their CPD at 12 weeks ( t (34) = 6.12, p &lt; 0.001), and at 24 weeks ( t (30) = 6.38, p &lt; 0.001). Urges to smoke and perceived stress decreased, and mindfulness, cessation-related self-efficacy, life satisfaction and subjective psychophysiological health increased significantly (all p s &lt; 0.05), predominantly in individuals who reported abstinence. Lower urges to smoke, lower perceived stress, and higher self-efficacy and subjective mental health were related to greater odds of cessation at 24 weeks (all p s &lt; 0.05). Most participants rated the program as highly (43%) or moderately (54%) acceptable. Discussion Program participation seems to support cessation and improvements in smoking-related outcomes, but adjustments to the program may be needed to improve engagement and acceptability. Findings may inform the development of future trials and cessation programs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Palliative care focuses on controlling symptoms and improving the patient’s quality of life. To achieve this, medications with addictive potential are often used. There have been various case reports of substance misuse in palliative care. This study aims to explore how practitioners perceive the issue and management of substance misuse in palliative care patients. Materials and methods Following an extensive literature review, a 23-question questionnaire was developed to assess attitudes and practices related to substance misuse in palliative care and distributed to all German palliative care units (PCUs) listed on the website of the German Society for Palliative Medicine ( n = 334). Results A total of 116 responses from PCUs (34.7%) were included in the analysis. Of these, 49.1% estimated that approximately 1–5% of their patients suffer from medication-related substance misuse. Most respondents (72.4%) assumed that 1–5% of their patients use illicit substances. In addition, 62.9% of the PCUs do not screen their patients for substance use disorders, while only 0.9% report doing so regularly. In the case of addiction problems, 55.2% of the PCUs do not implement any specific measures. Most respondents described their approach to prescribing medications with potential for substance misuse as liberal (71.6%) or very liberal (12.9%). Furthermore, 78.4% reported that the addictive potential of a medication has little or no influence on their prescribing decisions. Finally, 67.2% of participants expressed a desire for more education about addiction in palliative care. Discussion The data collected in our study indicate that, from the perspective of palliative care professionals, substance use disorders are not perceived as a significant problem for patients receiving inpatient palliative care. However, we found that most PCUs do not screen their patients for substance misuse, suggesting that most practitioners may not have a comprehensive view of the actual number of dependent patients. Further research is therefore needed to obtain reliable data on the number of patients with substance use disorders in palliative care and to determine the point at which substance misuse is caused by medical prescription.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In response to greater illicit fentanyl use, buprenorphine daily doses exceeding the FDA’s recommended target daily dose (16 mg) and maximum suggested daily dose (24 mg) may provide better outcomes, but little is known about higher dosage prescribing patterns. To better understand buprenorphine prescribing patterns, this manuscript examines the frequency and characteristics of dispensed buprenorphine of ≤ 16mg, &gt; 16-24 mg, and &gt; 24 mg daily dose. Methods We used IQVIA data to conduct a cross-sectional study of opioid use disorder-indicated buprenorphine prescriptions dispensed at retail pharmacies January 2019 - December 2020; categorized prescriptions as ≤ 16mg, &gt; 16 to 24 mg, and &gt; 24 mg daily dose; and examined overall rates and rates by patient, insurer and county characteristics, and prescriber specialty. We categorized buprenorphine prescriptions by patient sex, age cohort, primary payment source, and prescriber specialty and state and conducted univariate and bivariate analyses of buprenorphine daily dose categories overall and among clinicians frequently prescribing buprenorphine at the highest doses, &gt; 24 mg. Results Approximately 19.5% ( n = 5,568,964) of the 28 million buprenorphine prescriptions from 68,898 clinicians were &gt; 16-24 mg; 2% ( n = 641,390) were &gt; 24 mg. Approximately 26% ( n = 17,939) of clinicians wrote at least one prescription &gt; 24 mg; 2,780 clinicians (4% of buprenorphine prescribers) were responsible for 82.2% ( n = 527,597) of dispensed prescriptions &gt; 24 mg. 28% of prescriptions &gt; 24 mg written by these prescribers were cash-pay, 12.5% covered by Medicaid, and 6.7% covered by Medicare. There was no correlation between state fentanyl overdose rate and buprenorphine prescriptions &gt; 24 mg per 1,000,000 residents. Conclusions In 2019–2020, fewer than 3% of dispensed buprenorphine prescriptions exceeded the FDA suggested maximum of 24 mg daily dose; 80% of the prescriptions for a &gt; 24 mg daily dose were written by 4% of buprenorphine prescribers. As clinicians and policymakers pay greater attention to ensuring individuals are receiving buprenorphine dosages adequate to effectively treat their opioid use disorder, the recently revised FDA recommendations may encourage such behavior. Additionally, disproportionate reliance on cash payment for higher daily doses suggests public and private insurers could facilitate access to such treatment when appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Cue exposure (CE) is used for relapse prevention as part of smoking cessation therapy to reduce the automatized response to smoking-related cues. Using CET in virtual reality (VR) is an approach to increase its efficacy by creating cost-efficient high-risk situations. The efficacy of VR-based CETs was compared to that of an unspecific relaxation intervention as an add-on to an established cognitive-behaviorally oriented smoking cessation group therapy (G-CBT). Methods N = 246 abstinence-motivated smokers were included in a two-armed randomized controlled trial (G-CBT with VR-CET vs. G-CBT with progressive muscle relaxation/PMR) with 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups (measurements in 2018–2020). All smokers joined a well-established G-CBT smoking cessation program with six sessions with four additional sessions of either VR-based smoking cue exposure therapy (VR-CET) or four sessions of group-based PMR. The primary outcome was abstinence after 6 months according to the Russell Standard; secondary outcomes included changes in the number of smoked cigarettes, craving (assessed by the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges/QSU), and self-efficacy (assessed by the Smoking Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale/SES) over time. Results Primary outcome: Six months after G-CBT, 24% of the participants were abstinent, and there was no significant difference between the PMR ( n = 34/124) and VR-CET ( n = 24/122) groups (odds ratio PMR/VR = 0.64). Secondary measures: SES increased, and QSU and the number of smoked cigarettes decreased over time. Baseline craving ratings predicted abstinence only in the VR-CET group. Conclusion This randomized controlled trial did not show increased abstinence rates related to smoking cue exposure in virtual reality. Secondary measures demonstrated significant reductions in craving and cigarette consumption as well as increases in self-efficacy over time, regardless of the intervention. However, high baseline craving was negatively related to abstinence in the VR-CET group, suggesting that intense craving was insufficiently addressed. This may indicate that the amount of training was insufficient and should be intensified. Individualization, e.g., adaptive, individualized approaches, is required to improve the effects of the VR-CET on smoking cessation in future studies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background E-cigarette use (i.e., vaping) is prevalent among young adults in the U.S. Studies show that young adults who vape are more likely to initiate cigarette smoking than young adults who do not vape. Despite this, little research on vaping interventions and prevention of smoking for young adults who vape exist. Methods A 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted by recruiting young adults ages 18–24 who reported vaping at least once per week in the past 30 days and having never smoked cigarettes at baseline. Participants will be recruited via social media ads and be randomly assigned to an intervention arm, which will be the Live Free From E-cigarettes (LIFFE) mobile-based program ( n = 50), or a waitlist control arm ( n = 50). The primary outcomes are biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence for nicotine vaping, vaping reduction, and smoking susceptibility. Outcomes are measured at 2-, 4-, and 8-weeks after randomization. Discussion This is the first RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile-based intervention that targets smoking susceptibility while also supporting vaping cessation or vaping reduction in young adults. Findings may inform future efforts to prevent transition to cigarette smoking and vaping cessation and reduction in young adults.

    "abstract": "Medications for opioid use disorder are evidence-based, guideline-recommended treatments. While buprenorphine can be prescribed in nonspecialized office-based settings, it is underutilized. Using a multifaceted implementation initiative, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) sought to expand access to buprenorphine in nonspecialized office-based settings, including primary care clinics. The purpose of this qualitative evaluation was to assess and describe primary care clinicians' perspectives on delivering buprenorphine care during the first year of the initiative. Using a snowball sampling approach, individualized emails were sent to primary care clinicians participating in a VHA initiative (n = 43) inviting them to be interviewed. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted September 2019 through January 2020, and were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), a meta-theoretical framework of five domains associated with successful adoption of interventions, was used to organize findings. Of 43 clinicians invited, 19 responded and were interviewed (44.2%). Findings represented two CFIR domains: Inner Setting and Characteristics of Individuals. For Inner Setting, three themes were identified as influencing implementation during the first year of the initiative. Clinicians reported a shared receptivity to implement buprenorphine, organizational support from pharmacy services and leadership, as well as cohesive relationships among implementation team members and collaboration with outside clinics. Noted barriers included fit within primary care workflows and lack of staff, time and access to onsite laboratory services and buprenorphine. For Characteristics of Individuals, two themes were identified that may facilitate clinicians' willingness to provide buprenorphine care. Namely, clinicians reported positive attitudes about and experiences delivering opioid use disorder care and a willingness to learn/do something new. While implementation strategies should be tailored to individual clinic needs, prioritizing factors identified in this evaluation may support successful implementation of buprenorphine delivery in primary care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders (CcUD/MtUD) have serious public health, medical, and psychiatric consequences. Yet, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments available. The STIMULUS study is a multi-site trial, sponsored by the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), that aims to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a potential treatment for moderate to severe CcUD/MtUD. Methods The study is a double-blind, sham-controlled trial seeking to recruit 160 participants with a current moderate to severe CcUD or MtUD diagnosis, randomized to receive active rTMS (10-Hz stimulation at 120% motor threshold over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) or sham. Feasibility is assessed by a target of at least 20 treatment sessions administered within an 8-week period. Additionally, the study aims to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in reducing stimulant use and craving, the impact of rTMS on mood, anxiety, sleep, and other measures, and the utility of electroencephalography as a treatment response biomarker. Discussion Studies exploring rTMS for stimulant use disorders remain limited by small sample sizes, as well as great heterogeneity in defined study population, treatment parameters, retention in treatment, and number of sessions. In this paper, we highlight key study design decisions, such as safety, sham procedure, and schedule flexibility. Conclusion We hope that the data collected will lay the groundwork for a robust randomized controlled trial of rTMS as a therapeutic intervention for individuals with CcUD/MtUD.

Methods During their anesthesiological pre-clinic visit 1084 patients older than 59 years were asked whether they consume alcohol daily and 668 of them additionally answered the AUDIT-C questionnaire. Results According to the SSQ 11.72% of the patients consumed alcohol daily. In the AUDIT-C sub-group 25.90% reported moderate to high alcohol consumption while infrequent or very low alcohol intake was reported by 41.92%. In the subgroup 31.89% of the patients stated alcohol abstinence. About one quarter (25.13%) of patients who denied daily alcohol intake but scored positive on the AUDIT-C displayed levels of alcohol consumption ranging from moderate (11.20%) to high (13.87%) according to the AUDIT-C. Conclusion Reliable information about alcohol consumption is related to the method of questioning. The AUDIT-C evaluates the patient´s alcohol intake precisely and identifies more older patients with possibly health- and surgery-relevant alcohol consumption levels. The validated AUDIT-C provides an objective assessment to the physician during the pre-clinic anesthesiologic consultation. Additionally, handing out a questionnaire to the patient encourages initiative and self-assessment and could also relieve both, the physician and the patient from sensing a moral evaluation of alcohol consumption.",

The aim of the study was to investigate predictors of positive outcomes among young adults in the areas of: treatment seeking, decreased substance use, and improved parent-young adult relationships. Outcomes were assessed at 24-weeks following a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) and manualized counselling for parents of young adults (18-24 years) with hazardous substance use. A secondary analysis from an RCT including 113 parents (92% female) of young adults (87% male) recruited from two outpatient clinics for young adults in Stockholm, Sweden, subsequently nationwide. Clinical and sociodemographic predictors of treatment entry, substance use, and relationship happiness at 24 weeks follow-up were assessed using linear and logistic mixed-effects models. Previous young adult treatment engagement and higher parental self-efficacy were significant predictors of treatment entry, explaining 16% of the variance. Baseline alcohol and substance use consistently predicted higher use over time across measures. Parental stress showed complex associations: higher stress predicted reduced substance use in some models but increased use in others. For the measure of relationship happiness, baseline scores were the strongest predictor. Taken together, the findings suggest promising targets for tailored support programs for parents of young adults with SUD, such as components designed to enhance parental self-efficacy.

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of spatial accessibility of SUD treatment (outpatient, opioid treatment program, and residential) in New York State (NYS). We estimated two measures of spatial accessibility: one-way travel time (i.e., drive time for NYS outside of New York City [NYC] and public transit time for NYC) and robustness (i.e., the difference in travel time between the closest and fifth closest facility). Comparison facilities included Federally Qualified Health Centers, dialysis facilities, and hospitals. We compared travel time and robustness by urbanicity (NYC, urban non-NYC, rural) and NYS economic development region using population-weighted paired t-tests. Results The percentage of NYS residents within 30 min travel time was 97.2% for outpatient SUD treatment programs and 82.3% for opioid treatment programs. Mean statewide travel time to outpatient SUD treatment programs was comparable to travel time to Federally Qualified Health Centers (difference: 1.0 min [95%CI 0.9 to 1.1; P &lt; 0.001]) and dialysis facilities (difference: 0.1 min [95%CI 0.03 to 0.2; P = 0.01]), and significantly shorter than to hospitals (difference: 5.6 min [95%CI 5.4 to 5.7; P &lt; 0.001]). Travel time to opioid treatment programs was significantly longer than to Federally Qualified Health Centers (difference: -7.4 min [95%CI − 7.6 to − 7.2; P &lt; 0.001]), dialysis facilities (difference: -8.2 min [95%CI − 8.4 to − 8.1; P &lt; 0.001]), and hospitals (difference: − 2.8 min [95%CI − 3.0 to − 2.6; P &lt; 0.001]). Compared with NYC, mean travel time to each type of SUD treatment program was significantly shorter in urban non-NYC areas and longer in rural areas. For robustness, compared with NYC, there was no significant difference in urban non-NYC areas for outpatient and residential SUD treatment programs, but more limited robustness for opioid treatment programs in urban non-NYC areas and all types of SUD treatment programs in rural areas. Conclusion We identified widespread spatial accessibility of SUD treatment facilities across NYS. Recent opportunities such as revised federal regulations on opioid treatment program mobile medication units, increased flexibility in using telehealth in opioid treatment programs and other settings, and opioid settlement funding can be leveraged to increase access in rural areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Most opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment guidelines target community medical settings, and the subsequent recommendations were established to prioritize safety and reduce diversion prior to the fentanyl era. For people with OUD who use unregulated fentanyl, slow induction onto opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with gradual dose titration is often ineffective or insufficient for reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings, thereby hampering engagement and retention in treatment. Given the severe risks associated with continued use of the increasingly toxic unregulated drug supply, new and innovative approaches to the management of OUD are urgently needed. We have developed an alternative induction protocol, using a rapid intravenous symptom-inhibiting fentanyl induction (SIFI) to optimize rotation onto oral OAT. Methods An open-label, single arm, prospective pilot clinical trial is being conducted in an outpatient setting to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a rapid symptom-inhibiting intravenous fentanyl induction protocol to establish starting doses of methadone or sustained-release oral morphine (SROM) based on individual opioid requirements, as a treatment strategy for individuals with OUD who use unregulated fentanyl. The primary outcome is safety, as defined by occurrence of study drug-related adverse events (including but not limited to opioid toxicity and QT interval prolongation) that require intervention during induction and the first 7 days on OAT. Secondary objectives are to determine whether the SIFI protocol will result in use of higher-than-standard starting doses of methadone and SROM, and to determine whether implementation of this protocol will be acceptable to participants and will result in reduced withdrawal symptoms, improved retention, and better long-term outcomes on OAT. Discussion This is the first study to rapidly and objectively estimate opioid tolerance and use it to calculate individualized starting doses of oral OAT in an outpatient setting among people who use unregulated fentanyl. We predict that starting methadone or SROM with individually-tailored doses will lead to therapeutic target concentrations being achieved quickly, safely, and with good patient satisfaction. This approach has the potential to more effectively and safely initiate OAT, to minimize opioid withdrawal and cravings, and in turn to decrease unregulated fentanyl use and increase retention on life-saving OAT.

Objectives This scoping review aims to provide an overview of existing studies with a focus on their objectives, methodology, treatment paradigms, and VR design characteristics. Methods A systematic literature research was conducted in the electronic databases MEDLINE (PubMed), APA PsychInfo, APA PsychArticles, PSYINDEX (EBSCOhost), Scopus, Web of Science and by search in the reference list of included publication to identify relevant publications. Clinical studies and study protocols using VR for the assessment or treatment of patients with AUD were included. Results The literature search yielded 1.197 studies, of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. Completed trials ( n = 16) and study protocols ( n = 6) were included. The majority of the studies ( n = 19) used a VR cue exposure paradigm to induce craving. The studies can be classified either as assessment ( n = 9) or treatment studies ( n = 13). The duration (7–60 min) and number of applied sessions (1–13) varied significantly depending on the type of study. Craving outcomes were based on subjective and physiological measurements. All studies used alcoholic beverages and VR scenarios such as bars, pubs, parties and restaurants, with additional scenarios varying, except for one study using a hospital and subway scenario as aversive scenarios. Moreover, synchronized olfactory stimuli were frequently used. Conclusions Despite the heterogeneity of VR software features and VR interventions, it was possible to identify a similarity within the main VR scenarios employed, as well as consistent positive results concerning the induction of subjective craving by alcohol-associated VR cues. While VR interventions for AUD show methodological progress, future research should adopt standardized protocols, include objective psychophysiological outcomes, and evaluate long-term efficacy and feasibility in clinical settings. Integration of emerging VR paradigms and technologies may further enhance the therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Substance use often begins in adolescence, making early identification and prevention essential to avert downstream harms, including substance use disorders. This study evaluated the impact of a peer-led, school-based storytelling program on participating middle- and high school students. Methods A cross-sectional, anonymous, online survey was distributed from 2014 to 2020 to Midwestern middle and high-schoolers who had attended a school-based event, “Ignite &amp; Engage,” led by a recovery community organization (RCO). Descriptive statistics summarized quantitative and an inductive thematic analysis summarized qualitative survey results. Results Of 10,438 surveyed students, 2,853 (27.3%) reported ever using substances The majority (55.2%) reported initiating substance use between the ages of 14 and 16 years, and 29.2% initiated it at an earlier age. The program impact was rated by 996 respondents, with 71.3% of them viewing it favorably and 76.3% noting presenters’ personal recovery stories as the most valuable elements, and 51.2% feeling less likely to use alcohol or drugs afterwards, an effect stronger in middle- than high school youth (60.3% vs. 49.5%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Qualitative feedback ( N = 2,884) echoed the quantitative findings, emphasizing students’ greater intent to avoid substance use, seek help, support peers, and reflect on recovery. Conclusion This school-based storytelling program, delivered by presenters with lived experience of addiction recovery, represents a promising, novel approach to substance use prevention and harm reduction among middle- and high school students.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating clinicians' perspectives is essential for the successful implementation of novel interventions in health care. This study aimed to explore clinicians' experiences of using smartphone-derived data in alcohol dependency treatment, and factors affecting implementation into routine care. Two focus group discussions were conducted in April 2023, including 10 clinicians working at a specialist addiction clinic in Stockholm, Sweden. The clinicians had various levels of experience using smartphone-based data, which was available through two online portals, as part of a randomised controlled trial evaluating two smartphone-based interventions. Data were analysed using Thematic Framework Analysis, guided by Normalisation Process Theory. Two main themes were identified: The patient as the driving force and Cultivating commitment, competence and credibility. The first theme highlighted a person-centred approach that permeated the practice and how the patients' engagement with the app-based interventions guided the clinicians' own involvement. Benefits of the interventions for both patients (i.e., increased awareness and control) and clinicians (i.e. supportive during treatment sessions) were also acknowledged. Clinicians believed that the interventions offered an opportunity for patients to become more actively involved in treatment and noted that clinician access to the app-derived data was less important. The second theme covered clinician discussions on the need for support and guidance to make better use of the interventions, continuity in the work, and additional work time. Moreover, the use of external portals made the intervention less accessible. Potential risks and concerns with the interventions were raised, including technical instability and data security. The results of this study indicate that a breathalyser-coupled and a drink-counting smartphone application have potential to be supportive complements to alcohol dependency treatment. According to the clinicians, the app-based interventions enhanced patient accountability in the change process and supported treatment delivery. To be effectively implemented into routine care, using a person-centred approach is key, as well as ensuring optimal conditions for clinicians to effectively use the systems. Technical issues constitute a barrier to acceptance, why technical robustness must be ensured.",

    "abstract": "Amphetamine-type stimulant use and overdoses have increased sharply across the US in recent years, largely driven by methamphetamine. Increased access to treatments for amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder (AT-StUD), including in primary care settings, is needed to mitigate these problems, yet effective behavioral treatments are often inaccessible and there are no FDA-approved medications for AT-StUD. In the current study, we characterize how often patients with clinically documented AT-StUD in predominantly rural-serving Pacific Northwest primary care clinics received medications that have been conditionally recommended in practice guidelines for treatment of AT-StUD. Electronic health record data from 23 primary care clinics in the Pacific Northwest US were obtained through the Data QUEST network. Adult patients with clinically documented \"other stimulant abuse\" or \"other stimulant dependence\" diagnoses typically reflecting AT-StUD between 01/2017 and 12/2021 were included. Prescription records were used to identify orders for bupropion, mirtazapine, topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion combination, methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and modafinil. Statistical analyses quantified the percentage of patients with medication orders placed within one year after any documented AT-StUD diagnosis. Patients (N = 963) were predominantly female (53.3%), White (81.7%), and non-Hispanic (70.5%). In total, 14.3% of patients received orders for a non-stimulant medication conditionally recommended in practice guidelines; 2.7% received orders for a stimulant medication. Consistent with clinical guidelines, medications were more often prescribed when patients had documented co-occurring disorders for which the medications could also be effective. In this sample of rural-serving primary care clinics, approximately 1 in 7 primary care patients with AT-StUD received orders for medications with preliminary evidence of effectiveness. Efforts are needed to increase access to AT-StUD treatments within primary care. These efforts could include training health professionals to consider judicious use of pharmacotherapy consistent with clinical guidelines, increasing capacity for behavioral health services including contingency management, and continuing research on pharmacologic agents.",

Limited research has investigated service user experience of these services. We undertook a qualitative sub-study, embedded within a pilot feasibility study of remote symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal management, to better understand the experiences of participants. Our aim was to determine the acceptability of the intervention and refine intervention procedures. Eligible participants were enrolled in the parent study and completed at least one day of telemedicine-delivered symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal management. Individuals were adults with alcohol use disorder recruited using intensity sampling. Participants completed an audio-recorded, semi-structured interview. Thematic analysis was conducted using Braun and Clarke interpretive methodology. Fourteen individuals were enrolled in the study. Six themes were identified: benefits of being in the home environment, technological tensions, intervention-specific feedback, personal motivations for participation, post-program achievements and changes and navigating the 'system'. Participants identified numerous benefits of being in the home environment including: increased comfort, privacy and security, normalizing abstinence in the home, flexibility to engage in other tasks, and the convenience of not travelling. Intervention-specific feedback included positive aspects of the intervention (interactions with staff, accountability, counselling, use of medication), areas for improvement (preparation, scheduling, medication logistics, and aftercare), and the meaning and role of having a support person available during treatment. Participants found remote alcohol withdrawal management to be satisfactory and associated with several benefits including increased comfort, privacy, normalizing abstinence in the home, flexibility and convenience. They also provided important feedback for refinement of the intervention. Findings suggest that remote alcohol withdrawal management could play an important role in improving access to medical management of alcohol withdrawal, particularly in rural, remote or underserved areas.",

    "abstract": "People with opioid use disorders (OUD) living in the South and Midwest are under-prescribed pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) despite an increasing number of providers writing PrEP prescriptions in other regions of the United States. Greater research is needed into attitudes toward integrating harm reduction strategies into primary care and PrEP prescribing among prescribers working in rural primary care settings. The objective of this paper was to examine relationships between providers' attitudes toward buprenorphine and methadone, comprehensive harm reduction (e.g., fentanyl test strips) and self-reported PrEP prescribing in the past year. Relationships were examined between attitudes toward buprenorphine and harm reduction services, and PrEP prescribing among 409 rural primary health care providers (PCPs) treating at least one person with OUD or HIV in several EHE priority states. A Qualtrics panel survey was administered to primary care providers residing in the U.S. South and Midwest and worked in a Federally Qualified Health Center, Rural Health Clinic or other HRSA-eligible health center. Chi-square tests were used to explore significant differences between PrEP prescribers and non-Prescribers on attitudes toward integrating MOUD, drug-related harm reduction into primary care. Overall, 62.1% (n = 254) of the sample of providers reported writing at least one prescription for PrEP in the past year. Providers who believed that reforming buprenorphine waiver laws made their jobs easier or who expressed interest in integrating naloxone distribution and syringe exchange into primary care were more likely to write prescriptions for PrEP compared to providers who did not have these beliefs. Providers who were from larger facilities and who had specialty training in infectious diseases were more likely to write prescriptions for PrEP. Findings from this study suggest that providers who are more open to integrating harm reduction services into primary care are more likely to prescribe PrEP in the past year. PCPs with more positive attitudes toward naloxone, syringe exchange, and buprenorphine were more likely to prescribe PrEP in the past year. Combination interventions may be a promising avenue of reducing the harms of drug use including overdose and HIV infection among populations of people who use drugs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Accessing opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment is difficult for individuals with unstable housing. This population often uses public libraries for computer and internet access, which could provide telehealth access to OUD treatment. Therefore, we developed a novel 12-week library-facilitated telehealth intervention study called “Bupe by the Book” (BBB) that uses library resources to facilitate initiation and retention in OUD treatment with buprenorphine. Methods The study is a partnership between the San Diego Public Library and a federally qualified healthcare center attached to a homeless shelter (Father Joe’s Villages (FJV) Village Health Center). We co-designed a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a library-facilitated telehealth intervention in San Diego, California. The intervention is being evaluated for its feasibility and acceptability (library tele-buprenorphine uptake) by obtaining an estimate of the effect of the library telehealth arm of the intervention on buprenorphine treatment outcomes (primary outcome: buprenorphine uptake, i.e., a pharmacy pickup and taking the prescription 1 + times) and adherence (i.e., &gt; 1 buprenorphine positive screens, ideally for 8 + weeks), compared to the control (standard care at the clinic) intervention. Individuals reporting homelessness and OUD (with or without other substance use) are eligible. Forty library patrons will be recruited via flyers, screened for eligibility, and referred to FJV Health Center for in-person initial buprenorphine treatment intake visits. Participants who complete intake are enrolled and randomized to the library-facilitated telehealth condition, which involves using library internet and computer resources for follow-up buprenorphine treatment appointments with the medical provider via library telehealth. In the control condition, participants do not use library telehealth for their buprenorphine care follow up appointments, but rather they go in-person to the clinic or per usual standard care protocols. Feasibility and acceptability of the library telehealth intervention and conduct of the randomized controlled trial are determined by the participants’ use of the library telehealth intervention for buprenorphine treatment, and quantitative and qualitative measures assessing their perceptions of the library telehealth intervention, collected over a 12-week period. Discussion The design of this pilot study may support the adoption of library-facilitated telehealth treatment as a feasible and acceptable strategy to engage and retain people experiencing homelessness with OUD in buprenorphine treatment.

We compared HCV screening and treatment among PCPs who do and do not prescribe buprenorphine in Washington (WA) State. Methods This study utilized a cross-sectional survey of PCPs in WA State, designed to characterize HCV care delivery practices and experiences/attitudes toward HCV. In this study, the independent variable was self-reported buprenorphine prescribing, and the main outcomes were (1) guideline-concordant HCV screening and (2) directly providing treatment for HCV. We used descriptive statistics to describe respondent characteristics. We used logistic regression to assess the association between buprenorphine prescribing status and HCV screening and treatment outcomes. Results Our sample included 73 PCPs, of whom 55% prescribe buprenorphine. We found that 25% of buprenorphine prescribers directly treated HCV. There was over a 2x greater relative odds that buprenorphine prescribers would correctly screen for HCV relative to non-prescribers (OR = 2.24; 95% CI: 0.67–8.18, p = .20) and a nearly 2.5x greater relative odds that they would treat HCV relative to non-prescribers (OR = 2.42; 0.72–9.61; p = .17), although both findings were not statistically significant. Conclusion In a sample of PCPs in WA state, buprenorphine prescribers compared to non-prescribers appear more likely to screen for and directly treat HCV, yet only a minority treat HCV. Interventions are needed to enhance HCV guideline-concordant care among these and all PCPs on the frontlines of caring for persons with OUD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The HEALing Communities Study was a multi-site cluster randomized waitlist-controlled trial evaluating a community-engaged, data-driven intervention to select and deploy evidence-based practices (EBPs) including overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND), medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and safer opioid prescribing. The trial was conducted in 67 highly impacted communities in 4 states, including 8 Rural and 8 urban communities in New York State (NYS). To inform future community-level decision making, we estimated the implementation costs of the EBPs selected by NYS communities. Methods The study was implemented between January 2020-June 2022 (Wave 1, 30 months duration including the peak COVID-19 emergency period) and July 2022-December 2023 (Wave 2, 18 months); each wave included 4 Rural and 4 urban NYS communities. We collected cost data prospectively using invoices, administrative records, and interviews with program staff and stakeholders. We then conducted a micro-costing analysis from the community perspective and compared costs from Waves 1 and 2. Results In both Waves, each community deployed on average 15 EBPs (range 8–25). EBP costs averaged $705,000 (range $320,000-$1.3 million) and $312,000 (range $39,200-$686,300) in Waves 1 and 2, respectively. In Wave 1, 25% of costs were allocated for OEND, 71% for MOUD, and 4% for safer prescribing, compared to 38% for OEND, 60% for MOUD, and 2% for safer prescribing in Wave 2. Average EBP costs per community were $147,600 (range $20,900-$374,000) for those in the OEND category, $345,400 (range $4,100-$1.1 million) for MOUD, and $16,400 (range $360-$105,500) for safer prescribing. Total EBP cost per capita in urban communities was $0.32 compared to $2.65 in Rural communities in Wave 1, and $0.41 urban communities compared to $0.65 in Rural communities in Wave 2. Conclusions The lower EBP costs in Wave 2 resulted from differences in EBP categories and specific EBPs selected and may also reflect differences in the duration of the intervention and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic over time. Higher per capita costs in rural communities indicate that many costs were not directly related to the number of individuals served.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Mobile health interventions, particularly dynamic Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), can overcome barriers to gambling treatment by offering timely, accessible support in people’s everyday lives. GamblingLess: In-The-Moment is a theoretically-informed and evidence-based app-delivered JITAI to people who want to quit or reduce their gambling. The JITAI aims to reduce gambling symptom severity through short-term reductions in the likelihood of gambling episodes by improving cognitive vulnerability (craving intensity, self-efficacy, or positive outcome expectancies). It administers three daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) to deliver tailored interventions in moments of cognitive vulnerability. Given that intervention acceptability and engagement are likely to improve clinical outcomes, this study aimed to comprehensively examine these constructs for GamblingLess: In-The-Moment . Methods A 28-day micro-randomised trial (MRT) was conducted, with a supplementary six-month within-group follow-up evaluation and a mixed-methods acceptability/engagement evaluation. The acceptability/engagement evaluation included: (1) app use and engagement indices across the MRT ( n = 192; 66% male; age median =35 years); (2) app acceptability measures administered at post-intervention ( n = 161; 84% completion rate), and (3) semi-structured interviews ( n = 11). Results App use and engagement indices indicated that the JITAI was an attractive option for gambling support. Participants completed 5,116 EMAs (compliance rate = 32%, averaging 27 EMAs), spent an average of 30 min in the app, and completed an average of nine intervention activities from a pool of 53 activities they could repeatedly access. Subjective quality and perceived impact scores well exceeded minimally acceptable standards but 77% of participants preferred a hybrid push-pull approach and many endorsed less frequent EMAs (52%) but a longer program (58%). Participants also endorsed additional features, such as in-person support, motivational messages, gambling feedback, saving favourite activities, online discussion boards, virtual computer coaches, and in-app rewards. Interviews revealed two distinct themes: (1) facilitation of gambling reductions through check-ins/availability, personal tailoring, seamless and holistic support, and treatment experience suitability; and (2) promoting behaviour change through enhanced awareness, goal-setting, skill-building, and positive habit formation. Conclusions GamblingLess: In-The-Moment was highly accepted and was generally perceived as effective in supporting reductions in gambling behaviour. The findings underscore the iterative process for JITAI development and highlight several avenues for its optimisation, particularly in relation to enhancing user engagement and reducing user fatigue. Trial registration The evaluation was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12622000490774) in March, 2022.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction American Indian and Alaska Native individuals are disproportionately impacted by the opioid epidemic, partially due to structural racism. Tribal nations and communities are finding innovative ways to provide opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, but barriers to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) remain. This study surveyed Indigenous clients at a Syringe Services Program about barriers and facilitators to OUD treatment. Methods Interviews were conducted with 27 Indigenous individuals who had used opioids in the past month and were receiving opioid harm reduction services from a tribally-run Anishinaabe Syringe Services Program (rural Minnesota). Participants were asked five questions in interview style format about their experiences with opioid use disorder care with a focus on barriers and facilitators. The coding team analyzed interviews utilizing the Collaborative Story Analysis method to highlight overall impressions of participants’ narratives. Results There were 27 participants: 48% male and 52% female. The main themes of barriers and facilitators were connection to others, flexibility of treatment services, and ensuring individual needs were met. Having a positive relationship with providers (e.g. non-judgmental), access to MOUD and Harm Reduction services, and minimizing assessment requirements prior to starting treatment were some of the most frequently identified facilitators to care. Lack of transportation, prioritizing care for others, and turbulent relationships with providers and certain aspects of care services were identified as barriers. Conclusions Study participants cited clear barriers and facilitators to accessing OUD treatment in a rural Anishinaabe Tribal Nation in Minnesota. The Tribal Nation has already implemented several strategies to improve access to MOUD care (e.g., hiring additional drivers to help with transportation, facilitating immediate MOUD care prior to an intake, if needed, and giving take home MOUD doses). Tailoring services to address identified barriers and leverage facilitators of connection and flexibility will enhance care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Rural states have experienced increasing injection drug use (IDU)-associated infective endocarditis (IE). Inpatient addiction consult services can reduce morbidity associated with substance use and other infectious complications, such as IDU-IE. However data on the impact of such services on healthcare utilization are limited, particularly in rural communities. Methods This retrospective study assesses clinical and health service utilization data from index hospitalizations for IDU-IE before and after the implementation of the Integrated Medication for Addiction Treatment (IMAT) program at a tertiary care center in a rural state. We summarized data descriptively, stratified by both pre- and post-IMAT program implementation and IDU-IE and non-IDU IE. We also performed exploratory multivariable analyses assessing the association between IMAT program implementation and various outcomes. The primary outcomes were: 1) 90-day emergency department (ED) visits and 2) 30-day hospital readmissions post-discharge. Secondary outcomes included prescriptions at time of discharge for medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), naloxone and key vaccinations. Results We identified n = 99 patients with IDU-IE. Comparing pre- and post-IMAT implementation, 30-day readmissions trended lower post-IMAT (18%) versus pre-IMAT (22%), although the difference was not significant ( p = 0.7). 90-day ED visits remained stable (37%, p &gt; 0.9). The proportion of MOUD prescribing (24% versus 80%), hepatitis B vaccination (29% versus 51%), and Tdap vaccination (7.3% versus 41%) increased significantly following IMAT implementation ( p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.037 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). In a regression analysis controlling for age, housing status, primary care provider, age, hepatitis C, cardiac device, Duke’s criteria, valve affected, alcohol use disorder, payer, and vascular or infectious complications, the IMAT program was not significantly associated with the primary outcomes or with hepatitis B vaccination. However, the IMAT program was associated with increased MOUD prescribing (aOR: 110; CI:16–1500), naloxone prescribing (aOR 18; CI: 1.1–1600) hepatitis A vaccination (aOR: 5.3; CI: 1.2–32), and Tdap vaccination (aOR: 9.2; CI: 2.0–59). Conclusions Inpatient addiction services were associated with increased prescribing of MOUD, naloxone and key vaccinations, though the incidence of acute healthcare utilization did not change. These results highlight hospitalization as an opportunity to connect patients with IDU-IE to MOUD and preventative care, particularly in rural areas where access to such services may be limited.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two variants of BI in psychiatric outpatients. By using clinical psychiatric staff to perform the interventions, we sought to collect information of the usefulness of BI in the clinical setting. Psychiatric outpatients with Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores indicating hazardous or harmful drinking were invited to participate in the study. The outpatients were randomized to minimal (assessment, feedback, and an informational leaflet) or BI (personalized advice added). Measurements were performed at baseline and at six and 12 months after the intervention. The primary outcome was change in AUDIT score at the 12-month follow-up. In all, 150 patients were enrolled and received either a minimal intervention (n = 68) or BI (n = 82). At 12 months, there was a small reduction in AUDIT score in both groups, with no significant differences in outcome between groups. At 12-month follow-up, 21% of participants had improved from a hazardous AUDIT score level to a nonhazardous level, and 8% had improved from a harmful level to a hazardous level (8%). Brief alcohol interventions may result in a reduction of AUDIT score to a small extent in psychiatric patients with hazardous or harmful alcohol use. Results suggest that BI may be of some value in the psychiatric outpatient setting. Still, more profound forms of alcohol interventions with risky-drinking psychiatric patients need elaboration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Medically complex urban patients experiencing homelessness comprise a disproportionate number of high-cost, high-need patients. There are few studies of interventions to improve care for these populations; their social complexity makes them difficult to study and requires clinical and research collaboration. We present a protocol for a trial of the streamlined unified meaningfully managed interdisciplinary team (SUMMIT) team, an ambulatory ICU (A-ICU) intervention to improve utilization and patient experience that uses control populations to address limitations of prior research. Methods/design Participants are patients at a Federally Qualified Health Center in Portland, Oregon that serves patients experiencing homelessness or who have substance use disorders. Participants meet at least one of the following criteria: &gt; 1 hospitalization over past 6 months; at least one medical co-morbidity including uncontrolled diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, soft-tissue infection; and 1 mental health diagnosis or substance use disorder. We exclude patients if they have &lt; 6 months to live, have cognitive impairment preventing consent, or are non-English speaking. Following consent and baseline assessment, we randomize participants to immediate SUMMIT intervention or wait-list control group. Participants receiving the SUMMIT intervention transfer care to a clinic-based team of physician, complex care nurse, care coordinator, social worker, and pharmacist with reduced panel size and flexible scheduling with emphasis on motivational interviewing, patient goal setting and advanced care planning. Wait-listed participants continue usual care plus engagement with community health worker intervention for 6 months prior to joining SUMMIT. The primary outcome is hospital utilization at 6 months; secondary outcomes include emergency department utilization, patient activation, and patient experience measures. We follow participants for 12 months after intervention initiation. Discussion The SUMMIT A-ICU is an intensive primary care intervention for high-utilizers impacted by homelessness. Use of a wait-list control design balances community and staff stakeholder needs, who felt all participants should have access to the intervention, while addressing research needs to include control populations. Design limitations include prolonged follow-up period that increases risk for attrition, and conflict between practice and research; including partner stakeholders and embedded researchers familiar with the population in study planning can mitigate these barriers.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background There is growing public health concern around the potential impact of the opioid crisis on efforts to eradicate HIV. This secondary analysis seeks to determine if those who report opioids as their primary problem drug compared to those who report other drugs and/or alcohol differ in engagement in HIV primary care among a sample of hospitalized people with HIV (PWH) who use drugs and/or alcohol, a traditionally marginalized and difficult to engage population key to ending the HIV epidemic. Setting and participants A total of 801 participants (67% male; 75% Black, non-Hispanic; mean age 44.2) with uncontrolled HIV and reported drug and/or alcohol use were recruited from 11 hospitals around the U.S. in cities with high HIV prevalence from 2012 to 2014 for a multisite clinical trial to improve HIV viral suppression. Methods A generalized linear model compared those who reported opioids as their primary problem drug to those who reported other problem drugs and/or alcohol on their previous engagement in HIV primary care, controlling for age, sex, race, education, income, any previous drug and/or alcohol treatment, length of time since diagnosis, and study site. Results A total of 95 (11.9%) participants reported opioids as their primary problem drug. In adjusted models, those who reported opioids were significantly less likely to have ever engaged in HIV primary care than those who reported no problem drug use (adjusted risk ratio, ARR = 0.84, 95% Confidence Interval, CI 0.73, 0.98), stimulants ( ARR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.74, 0.95), and polydrug use but no alcohol ( ARR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.68, 0.93). While not statistically significant, the trend in the estimates of the remaining drug and/or alcohol categories (alcohol, cannabis, polydrug use with alcohol, and [but excluding the estimate for] other), point to a similar phenomena—those who identify opioids as their primary problem drug are engaging in HIV primary care less. Conclusions These findings suggest that for hospitalized PWH who use drugs and/or alcohol, tailored and expanded efforts are especially needed to link those who report problem opioid use to HIV primary care. Trial registration This study was funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant: U10-DA01372011 ( Project HOPE — Hospital Visit as Opportunity for Prevention and Engagement for HIV - Infected Drug Users ; Metsch); which is also a registered clinical trial under the Clinical Trials Network (CTN-0049).

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is much more prevalent among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population of adolescents and young adults. Although many young homeless smokers are motivated to quit, there are no empirically-evaluated smoking cessation programs for this population. It is important that any such program address the factors known to be associated with quitting-related outcomes among homeless young people, to provide ongoing support in a way that accommodates the mobility of this population, and does not rely on scarce service provider resources for its delivery. The objective of this project is to develop and pilot test a text messaging-based intervention (TMI), as an adjunct to brief cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches, to help homeless young people who want to quit smoking. This pilot study will utilize a cluster cross-over randomized controlled design with up to 80 current smokers who desire to quit and are recruited from three drop-in centers serving young people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area. All participants will be provided with a minimum standard of care: a 30-min group-based smoking cessation counseling session and free nicotine replacement. Half of these smokers will then also receive the TMI, as an adjunct to this standard care, which will provide 6 weeks of ongoing support for quitting. This support includes continued and more intensive education regarding nicotine dependence, quitting smoking, and relapse; does not require additional agency resources; can be available \"on demand\" to users; and includes features to personalize the quitting experience. This study will investigate whether receiving the TMI adjunct to standard smoking cessation care results in greater reductions in cigarette smoking compared to standard care alone over a 3-month period. This study has the potential to address an important gap in the clinical research literature on cigarette smoking cessation and provide empirical support for using a TMI to provide ongoing assistance and support for quitting among young smokers experiencing homelessness.

    "abstract": "Buprenorphine-naloxone is an evidence-based treatment for Opioid Use Disorder. However, despite its efficacy, nearly half of participants are unsuccessful in achieving stabilization (i.e., period of time following medication induction in which medication dose is adjusted to be effective in reducing cravings/withdrawal, minimize potential side effects, and eliminate illicit substance use). This paper presents the study design and protocol for a digital health intervention designed to promote engagement in and adherence to buprenorphine treatment, offered through an outpatient addiction treatment center, through motivational enhancement and distress tolerance skills training. Personalized feedback interventions represent a promising method to effectively motivate engagement in and adherence to buprenorphine treatment. These interventions are generally brief, individually tailored, and have the potential to be delivered via mobile platforms. Distress tolerance, a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor, has been implicated in the development and maintenance of substance use. Targeting distress tolerance may improve substance use treatment outcomes by promoting the ability to persist in goal-directed activity even when experiencing physical or emotional distress. The study aims are to: (1) develop and refine an interactive computer- and text message-delivered personalized feedback intervention that incorporates distress tolerance skills training for persons who have elected to initiate outpatient buprenorphine treatment (iCOPE); (2) examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of iCOPE for increasing abstinence, adherence, and retention in treatment compared to a treatment as usual comparison condition; and, (3) examine potential mechanisms that may underlie the efficacy of iCOPE in improving outcomes, including motivation, distress tolerance, self-regulation, and negative affect. Results of this study will be used to determine whether to proceed with further testing through a large-scale trial. This work has the potential to improve treatment outcomes by reducing illicit opioid use, increasing adherence/retention, and preventing future overdose and other complications of illicit opioid use.

    "abstract": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) among women delivering at a hospital has increased 400% from 1999-2014 in the United States. From the years 2007 to 2016, opioid-related mortality during pregnancy increased over 200%, and drug-overdose deaths made up nearly 10% of all pregnancy-associated mortality in 2016 in the US. Disproportionately higher rates of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) have been reported in rural areas of the country, suggesting that perinatal OUD is a pressing issue among these communities. There is an urgent need for comprehensive, evidence-based treatment services for pregnant women experiencing OUD. The purpose of this article is to describe a study protocol aimed at developing and evaluating a perinatal OUD curriculum, enhancing evidence-based perinatal OUD treatment in a rural setting, and evaluating the implementation of such collaborative care for perinatal OUD.This two-year study employed a one group, repeated measures, hybrid type-1 effectiveness-implementation design. This study delivered interventions at 2 levels, both targeting improvement of care for pregnant women with OUD. The first area of focus was at the community healthcare provider-level, which aimed to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of perinatal OUD education across time and to improve provider education by increasing knowledge specific to: MOUD provision; screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) utilization; and NOWS treatment. The second area of intervention focus was at the patient-level, which assessed the preliminary effect of perinatal OUD provider education in promoting illicit opioid abstinence and treatment engagement among pregnant women with OUD. We adopted constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to assess contextual factors that may influence implementation, and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) model to comprehensively evaluate implementation outcomes.This article presents the protocol of an implementation study that is employing the CFIR and RE-AIM frameworks to implement and evaluate a perinatal OUD education and service coordination program in two rural counties. This protocol could serve as a model for clinicians and researchers seeking to implement improvements in perinatal care for women with OUD in other rural communities.

However, there is a shortage of physicians who are willing to work with these patients. We investigated novel predictors of what might be contributing to physicians’ unwillingness to engage with this patient population to better identify and direct interventions to improve physician attitudes. Methods 333 physicians who were board certified in the state of Ohio completed a survey about their willingness to work with patients who misuse opioids. The hypothesized relationships between the proposed predictors and willingness to work with this patient population were tested using multivariate regression, supplemented with qualitative analysis of open-text responses to questions about the causes of addiction. Results Perceptions of personal invulnerability to opioid misuse and addiction, opioid misuse and addiction controllability, and health care provider blame for the opioid crisis were negatively associated with physician willingness to work with patients who misuse opioids after controlling for known predictors of physician bias toward patients with substance use disorders. Physicians working in family and internal medicine, addiction medicine, and emergency medicine were also more willing to work with this patient population. Conclusions Distancing oneself and health care professionals from opioid misuse and placing blame on those who misuse are negatively associated with treatment willingness. Interventions to improve physician willingness to work with patients who misuse opioids can target these beliefs as a way to improve physician attitudes and provide patients with needed health care resources.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Most Americans with opioid use disorder (OUD) do not receive indicated medical care. A clinical decision support (CDS) tool for primary care providers (PCPs) could address this treatment gap. Our primary objective was to build OUD-CDS tool and demonstrate its functionality and accuracy. Secondary objectives were to achieve high use and approval rates and improve PCP confidence in diagnosing and treating OUD. Methods A convenience sample of 55 PCPs participated. Buprenorphine-waivered PCPs (n = 8) were assigned to the intervention. Non-waivered PCPs (n = 47) were randomized to intervention (n = 24) or control (n = 23). Intervention PCPs received access to the OUD-CDS, which alerted them to patients at potentially increased risk for OUD or overdose and guided diagnosis and treatment. Control PCPs provided care as usual. Results The OUD-CDS was functional and accurate following extensive multi-phased testing. PCPs used the OUD-CDS in 5% of encounters with at-risk patients, far less than the goal of 60%. OUD screening confidence increased for all intervention PCPs and OUD diagnosis increased for non-waivered intervention PCPs. Most PCPs (65%) would recommend the OUD-CDS and found it helpful with screening for OUD and discussing and prescribing OUD medications. Discussion PCPs generally liked the OUD-CDS, but use rates were low, suggesting the need to modify CDS design, implementation strategies and integration with existing primary care workflows. Conclusion The OUD-CDS tool was functional and accurate, but PCP use rates were low. Despite low use, the OUD-CDS improved confidence in OUD screening, diagnosis and use of buprenorphine.

    "abstract": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ('Indigenous') Australians experience a greater burden of disease from alcohol consumption than non-Indigenous peoples. Brief interventions can help people reduce their consumption, but people drinking at risky levels must first be detected. Valid screening tools (e.g., AUDIT-C) can help clinicians identify at-risk individuals, but clinicians also make unstructured assessments. We aimed to determine how frequently clinicians make unstructured risk assessments and use AUDIT-C with Indigenous Australian clients. We also aimed to determine the accuracy of unstructured drinking risk assessments relative to AUDIT-C screening. Finally, we aimed to explore whether client demographics influence unstructured drinking risk assessments. We performed cross-sectional analysis of a large clinical dataset provided by 22 Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services in Australia. We examined instances where clients were screened with unstructured assessments and with AUDIT-C within the same two-monthly period. This aggregated data included 9884 observations. We compared the accuracy of unstructured risk assessments against AUDIT-C using multi-level sensitivity and specificity analysis. We used multi-level logistic regression to identify demographic factors that predict risk status in unstructured assessments while controlling for AUDIT-C score. The primary variables were AUDIT-C score and unstructured drinking risk assessment; demographic covariates were client age and gender, and service remoteness. Clinicians made unstructured drinking risk assessments more frequently than they used AUDIT-C (17.11% and 10.85% of clinical sessions respectively). Where both measures were recorded within the same two-month period, AUDIT-C classified more clients as at risk from alcohol consumption than unstructured assessments. When using unstructured assessments, clinicians only identified approximately one third of clients drinking at risky levels based on their AUDIT-C score (sensitivity = 33.59% [95% CI 22.03, 47.52], specificity = 99.35% [95% CI 98.74, 99.67]). Controlling for AUDIT-C results and demographics (gender and service remoteness), clinicians using unstructured drinking risk assessments were more likely to classify older clients as being at risk from alcohol consumption than younger clients. Evidence-based screening tools like AUDIT-C can help clinicians ensure that Indigenous Australian clients (and their families and communities) who are at risk from alcohol consumption are better detected and supported.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Social networks may play positive and negative roles in the lives of young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH) who are transitioning into housing. Social networks can influence their alcohol and/or other drug (AOD) use, as well as provide immediate and long-term support necessary for a successful transition. Methods We adapted a four-session computer-assisted motivational interviewing social network intervention (MI-SNI) for YEH transitioning into housing. We iteratively adapted and beta tested the intervention for delivery by case managers at an organization that provides supportive housing to YEH. We conducted a focus group with agency staff (n = 6), role-play exercises with case managers (n = 3), and semi-structured interviews with residents (n = 6). Interview data were thematically analyzed with open coding. This study presents the first adaptation of an innovative social network-based motivational intervention to reduce AOD use and increase stable, prosocial supportive connections via visualizations of the structure and composition of the individual’s social network. Results Participants rated sessions as “moderately” to “very” helpful and “good” quality on average. Participants agreed that the sessions were helpful, understandable, and satisfying and would work for new residents. Themes emerged in four broad categories: (1) Acceptability, (2) Positive benefits, (3) Visualization reactions, and (4) MI-SNI interface reactions. For the acceptability category, three sub-themes emerged: (1) understandability , (2) enjoyability and ease of use , (3) and barriers to acceptability . Five sub-themes emerged about the intervention’s likelihood to trigger positive benefits: (1) learning/new insights , (2) enhancement to motivation to change , (3) making AOD changes , (4) building social support , and (5) the intervention’s usefulness to some but not others . Five sub-themes also emerged from comments about the social network visualizations: (1) general positive comments , (2) understandability , (3) new insights , (4) triggering changes in social support , and (5) triggering changes in AOD use . When discussing the MI-SNI intervention interface beyond the visualizations, discussions emerged in three thematic categories: (1) discussion of name listing , (2) discussion of screen wording , and (3) the use of a computer interface to deliver the intervention. Conclusions Results suggest that the MI-SNI is acceptable to YEH and can be feasibly delivered by case managers during case management sessions.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The opioid antagonist extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) is effective in terms of safety, abstinence from opioid use and retention in treatment. However, it is unclear how patients experience and adjust to losing the possibility of achieving an opioid effect. This qualitative study is the first to explore how people with opioid dependence experience XR-NTX treatment, focusing on the process of treatment over time. Methods Using a purposive sampling strategy, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 19 persons with opioid use disorder (15 men, four women, 22–55 years of age) participating in a clinical trial of XR-NTX in Norway. The interviewees had received at least three XR-NTX injections. Qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach was used. Findings Participants described that XR-NTX treatment had many advantages. However they still faced multiple challenges, some of which they were not prepared for. Having to find a new foothold and adapt to no longer gaining an effect from opioids due to the antagonist medication was challenging. This was especially true for those struggling emotionally and transitioning into the harmful use of non-opioid substances. Additional support was considered crucial. Even so, the treatment led to an opportunity to participate in society and reclaim identity. Participants had strong goals for the future and described that XR-NTX enabled a more meaningful life. Expectations of a better life could however turn into broken hopes. Although participants were largely optimistic about the future, thinking about the end of treatment could cause apprehension. Conclusions XR-NTX treatment offers freedom from opioids and can facilitate the recovery process for people with OUD. However, our findings also highlight several challenges associated with XR-NTX treatment, emphasizing the importance of monitoring emotional difficulties and increase of non-opioid substances during treatment. As opioid abstinence in itself does not necessarily equal recovery, our findings underscore the importance of seeing XR-NTX as part of a comprehensive, individualized treatment approach.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background There is an urgent need for interventions helping children affected by parental problematic alcohol consumption (PAC). Such interventions could target partners to individuals with PAC, partners who often themselves show impaired quality of life and mental health. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an online self-directed intervention combining components from Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training (CRAFT) with a parenting training program for concerned significant others (CSOs) sharing a child with a co-parent with PAC. Methods A randomized controlled parallel-group superiority trial compared the efficacy of the online intervention for CSOs sharing a child (3–11 y/o) with a co-parent with PAC (N = 37), to an active control group (N = 39) receiving written psychoeducational material. Assessment of outcomes was conducted at baseline, 3 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Primary outcome was children’s mental health, while secondary outcomes included parental self-efficacy, CSO mental health and co-parent alcohol consumption and level of dependence. Linear mixed effect models with a factorial time variable were used to model time by group interaction effects. Results Recruitment rate was slow and a vast majority of interested CSOs were excluded at baseline assessment, mainly due experience of co-parent violence. The target sample size was not met. The intention to treat analysis did not show any significant time by group effects on either the primary or secondary outcomes during the follow-up period: the CSOs reported a significant reduction in co-parent alcohol consumption and severity of alcohol dependence and showed significant improvements in parental self-efficacy for how to handle effects of co-parent alcohol consumption, but no differences were found between the two conditions. Conclusions The current study found no evidence supporting efficacy of a novel, online self-directed intervention on children’s mental health, CSO mental health and co-parent alcohol related outcomes. Engaging in a support program or receiving information appears to initiate behavior change in the CSOs which affects the alcohol consumption and severity of dependence for co-parents with PAC. It is suggested that future studies may preferably focus on CSOs in more severely affected contexts.

One treatment strategy in patients with OUD is rotating from a short-acting opioid to a long-acting opioid (buprenorphine/naloxone (BuNa) or methadone). Both BuNa and methadone have been shown to be effective strategies in patients with OUD reducing opioid misuse, however data on head-to-head comparison in patients with chronic non-malignant pain and prescription OUD are limited.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Novel buprenorphine dosing strategies have emerged with an aim to transition patients from opioid agonists to buprenorphine without prerequisite opioid withdrawal. We applied a configurational approach to a subset of data from our earlier systematic review to answer the following question: when patients received a buprenorphine initiation strategy aimed to eliminate prerequisite withdrawal, what factors consistently distinguished patients that experienced withdrawal during the initiation process from patients that did not? Methods From the 24 cases identified by our systematic review, we included cases that were treated using buprenorphine microdosing strategies (oral or transdermal), cases with opioid use disorder, and cases that fully transitioned to buprenorphine without continuing the full opioid agonist. Configurational analysis was used to identify combinations of patient and regimen level factors that uniquely distinguished cases experiencing withdrawal during induction. Result Fourteen cases were included in our analysis, of which 9 experienced opioid withdrawal symptoms. Three factors were involved in explaining both the presence and absence of withdrawal symptoms: history of heroin use, history of methadone use, and duration of overlap between buprenorphine and the full opioid agonist during induction. For the presence of withdrawal symptoms, the addition of a fourth factor “buprenorphine starting dose” resulted in a model with perfect consistency and coverage; for the absence of withdrawal symptoms, the addition of a fourth factor “induction duration” similarly resulted in a model with perfect consistency and 80% coverage.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) reduces mortality, but few patients access MOUD. At a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), we implemented a low barrier model of MOUD, including same-day MOUD initiation and a harm reduction philosophy. Objective To investigate whether low barrier MOUD improved retention in care compared to traditional treatment. Design and participants Retrospective cohort study of patients with at least one visit seeking MOUD at the FQHC during a historical control period (3/1/2018—3/31/2019) and a low barrier intervention period (11/1/2019—7/31/2020). Main measures Primary outcomes were any MOUD prescription within 6 months of the index visit and 3- and 6-month retention in treatment without care gap, with care gap defined as 60 consecutive days without a visit or prescription. Secondary outcomes were all-cause hospitalization and emergency department visit within 6 months of the index visit. Key results Baseline characteristics were similar between the intervention (n = 113) and control (n = 90) groups, except the intervention group had higher rates of uninsured, public insurance and diabetes. Any MOUD prescription within 6 months of index visit was higher in the intervention group (97.3% vs 70%), with higher adjusted odds of MOUD prescription (OR = 4.01, 95% CI 2.08–7.71). Retention in care was similar between groups at 3 months (61.9% vs 60%, aOR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.78–1.44). At 6 months, a higher proportion of the intervention group was retained in care, but the difference was not statistically significant (53.1% vs 45.6%, aOR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93–1.73). There was no significant difference in adjusted odds of 6-month hospitalization or ED visit between groups. Conclusions Low barrier MOUD engaged a higher risk population and did not result in any statistically significant difference in retention in care compared with a historical control. Future research should determine what interventions improve retention of patients engaged through low barrier care. Primary care clinics can implement low barrier treatment to make MOUD accessible to a broader population.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the risk of COVID-19 and the associated hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality in patients with OUD.A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science to find studies which compared the infection rate and outcomes of COVID-19 in OUD patients in comparison with the normal population. A random effects meta-analysis model was developed to estimate odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the outcomes of COVID-19 and OUD.Out of 2647 articles identified through the systematic search, eight were included in the systematic review and five in the meta-analysis.

This study aimed to explore the experiences of patients receiving methadone treatment at a clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. Method This study employed an exploratory qualitative study design. Through purposive sampling, participants were enrolled from individuals attending a methadone clinic for at least 2 years. Semi-structured individual interviews were used to collect data on substance use and experience before methadone treatment and experiences after starting methadone treatment, including benefits and challenges. Interviews were transcribed, and NVIVO 12 software was used to code the data using the preidentified analytical framework. Thematic analyses were utilized to identify cross-cutting themes between these two data sets. Seventeen participants were enrolled. Results Seventeen participants were enrolled comprising 70% males, with age range from 23 to 49 years and more than half had secondary education. The interview data analysis identified four themes, namely: (a) the impact of opioid use before starting treatment which included adverse effects on health, legal problems and family dysfunction; (b) learning about methadone treatment whereby the majority were referred from community linkage programs, family and friends; (c) experiences with care at the methadone treatment clinic which included benefits such as improved health, family reintegration and stigma reduction; and (d) barriers to optimal methadone treatment such as financial constraints. Conclusion The findings of this study show that clients started methadone treatment due to the devastating impact of opioid use disorder on their lives. Methadone treatment allowed them to regain their lives from the adverse effects of opioid use disorder. Additionally, challenges such as financial constraints while accessing treatment were reported. These findings can help inform policies to improve the impact of methadone treatment.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol and cannabis are the most commonly used substances among adolescents in the U.S. The consequences related to using both substances together are significantly higher relative to use of either substance alone. Teens' propensity to engage in risky driving behaviors (e.g., speeding, rapid lane changes, and texting) and their relative inexperience with the timing and duration of cannabis' effects puts them at heightened risk for experiencing harms related to driving under the influence. Use of alcohol and cannabis peak at age 16, the legal age teens may apply for a provisional driver's license in some states. Targeting novice teen drivers prior to licensure is thus an ideal time for prevention efforts focused on reducing alcohol and/or cannabis initiation, use, and impaired driving.The current study proposes to evaluate the efficacy of webCHAT among 15.5 to 17-year-old adolescents (n = 150) recruited at driver education programs. WebCHAT is a single session online intervention that aims to prevent alcohol and cannabis use and risky driving behaviors. We will recruit adolescents enrolled in driver education programs, and stratify based on whether they used cannabis and/or alcohol in the past 3 months (60% screening negative and 40% screening positive). All participants will receive usual driver education and half will also receive webCHAT. We will test whether webCHAT in addition to usual driver education reduces alcohol and/or cannabis initiation or use and reduces risky driving attitudes and behaviors (intent to drive after drinking/using, riding as a passenger with someone who drank/used) compared to teens in usual driver education over a 6-month period. We will also explore whether variables such as beliefs and perceived norms serve as explanatory mechanisms for our outcomes.The study has the potential to promote public welfare by decreasing adolescent initiation and use of cannabis and alcohol and reducing risky driving behaviors that can have substantial monetary, personal, and social costs. The study recruits adolescents who are at risk for substance use as well as those who are not and it is delivered remotely during a teachable moment when adolescents receive driver education.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hospitalizations are a vital opportunity for the initiation of life-saving opioid agonist therapy (OAT) for patients with opioid use disorder. A novel approach to OAT initiation is the use of IV buprenorphine for low dose induction, which allows patients to immediately start buprenorphine at any point in a hospitalization without stopping full agonist opioids or experiencing significant withdrawal. Methods This is a retrospective case series of 33 patients with opioid use disorder concurrently treated with full agonist opioids for pain who voluntarily underwent low dose induction at a tertiary academic medical center. Low dose induction is the process of initiating very low doses of buprenorphine at fixed intervals with gradual dose increases in patients who recently received or are simultaneously treated with full opioid agonists. Our study reports one primary outcome: successful completion of the low dose induction (i.e. transitioned from low dose IV buprenorphine to sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone) and three secondary outcomes: discharge from the hospital with buprenorphine-naloxone prescription, self-reported pain scores, and nursing-assessed clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) scores over a 6-day period, using descriptive statistics. COWS and pain scores were obtained from day 0 (prior to starting the low dose induction) to day 5 to assess the effect on withdrawal symptoms and pain control. Results Thirty patients completed the low dose induction (30/33, 90.9%). Thirty patients (30/33, 90.9%) were discharged with a buprenorphine prescription. Pain and COWS scores remained stable over the course of the study period. Mean COWS scores for all patients were 2.6 (SD 2.8) on day 0 and 1.6 (SD 2.6) on day 5. Mean pain scores for all patients were 4.4 (SD 2.1) on day 0 and 3.5 on day 5 (SD 2.1). Conclusions This study found that an IV buprenorphine low dose induction protocol was well-tolerated by a group of 33 hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder with co-occurring pain requiring full agonist opioid therapy. COWS and pain scores improved for the majority of patients. This is the first case series to report mean daily COWS and pain scores over an extended period throughout a low dose induction process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Use of benzodiazepines (BZD) in patients receiving opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is common and associated with a variety of negative health and social outcomes. This cross-sectional study investigates the impact of BZD use in OAT patients on their quality of life (QoL). Methods A convenience sample of patients receiving oral OAT or heroin-assisted treatment in two outpatient centres in Basel, Switzerland was investigated. Participants (n = 141) completed self-report questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms and psychological distress (The Symptom Checklist 27, SCL-27), depressive state (German version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), quality of life (Lancashire Quality of Life Profile, LQOLP) and use of BZD and other drugs (self-report questionnaire). Substance use was assessed by urine toxicology testing. Results In bivariate analysis, total QoL scores were significantly lower for lifetime, current, and prolonged BZD users compared to participants without the respective use patterns. There was no significant relationship between BZD dose and QoL. In multivariable linear regression models controlling for psychiatric symptom load and depressive state, only lifetime use predicted lower QoL, whereas other BZD use patterns were not significantly associated. Conclusions The association of lower QoL and BZD use in OAT patients is strongly confounded by co-occurring depressive state and psychiatric symptoms. Careful diagnosis and treatment of co-occurring mental disorders in OAT is paramount to improve QoL in this patient population and may also help reduce BZD use.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Client discontinuation from outpatient addiction treatment programs is common, and the initial intake is the service delivery point with the highest attrition rate. Replacing the comprehensive intake assessment with a person-centered Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention is a potential solution to address provider and client concerns about the disengaging, time-intensive nature of the typical initial intake. It remains unclear whether the use of an alternative to the standard intake at the initial visit can fit within typical organizational reporting requirements, whether it decreases attrition, and whether implementation of person-centered intake procedures within outpatient addiction treatment programs is feasible, acceptable, and can be sustained. Purpose To describe the methods and design of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 trial of a Motivational Interviewing at Intake (MII) intervention using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Methods The study will determine the effectiveness of two intake conditions: (1) standard comprehensive intake assessment (intake-as-usual [IAU]), and (2) MII consisting of a person-centered discussion between provider and client about the client’s desire and intent to enter treatment. Although both interventions are focused on understanding client presenting complaints and needs for treatment, the delivery differs as the IAU uses a semi-structured assessment guide, while MII applies the theory of MI to have a conversation about treatment engagement. Adults seeking outpatient addiction treatment services will be randomly assigned to the MII condition (n = 75) or the IAU condition (n = 75). Primary outcomes will be client engagement (i.e., treatment entry, attendance, and completion) obtained from the electronic medical record. Secondary outcomes (client motivation and therapeutic alliance) will be putative mechanisms of client engagement assessed immediately before and after the intake. The trial also will explore determinants of effective, sustainable implementation using assessments of organizational readiness and capacity to change, as well as interviews on MII implementation feasibility. Conclusion This trial of an MII intervention will investigate the feasibility of a motivational intervention as an initial contact with substance use treatment-seeking clients as well as indicators of intervention effectiveness within the systems where it is employed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Translating innovative research advancements into commercially viable medical interventions presents well-known challenges. However, there is limited understanding of how specific patient, clinical, social, and legal complexities have further complicated and delayed the development of new and effective interventions for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). We present the following case studies to provide introductory clinical, social, and business insights for researchers, medical professionals, and entrepreneurs who are considering or are currently developing medical. Methods Four small business recipients of National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) small business grant funding collected a total of 416 customer discovery interviews during the 2021 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Innovation-Corps (I-Corps) program. Each business received funding to advance an OUD-specific innovation: therapeutics (2 companies), medical device (1 company), and Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) (1 company). Interview participants included stakeholders from a variety of disciplines of Substance Use Disorders (SUD) healthcare including clinicians, first responders, policymakers, relevant manufacturers, business partners, advocacy groups, regulatory agencies, and insurance companies. Results Agnostic to the type of product (therapeutic, device, or SaMD), several shared barriers were identified: (1) There is a lack of standardization across medical providers for managing patients with OUD, resulting in diverse implementation practices due to a fragmented healthcare policy; (2) Underlying Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) present unique challenges to medical care and contribute to poor outcomes in OUD; (3) Stigma thwarts adoption, implementation, and the development of innovative solutions; (4) Constantly evolving public health trends and legal policies impact development and access to OUD interventions. Conclusion It is critical for innovators to have early interactions with the full range of OUD stakeholders to identify and quantify true unmet needs and to properly position development programs for commercial success. The NIH I-Corps program provides a framework to educate researchers to support their product design and development plans to increase the probability of a commercially successful outcome to address the ongoing opioid epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid use disorder often co-occurs with other mental health and substance use disorders. Identifying clusters of individuals receiving treatment for opioid use disorder based on co-diagnosed conditions, healthcare plans, and service utilization over a seven-year treatment period provides insight into service needs. Objectives included [1] characterizing the sample [2], examining subtypes of the sample using cluster analysis, and [3] identifying differences in Current Procedural Terminology by subtype to examine service utilization among identified clusters. Methods This study uses secondary data from the electronic medical records of a community health center in a large urban area in the Northeastern United States from 2015 to 2021. The study sample included N = 705 adults who had an opioid use disorder diagnosis as indicated by the community health center’s electronic medical records. Measures include [1] age [2], race and ethnicity [3], sex [4], healthcare plan(s) [5], co-occurring mental health disorder [6], co-occurring substance use disorder [7], co-occurring mental health disorder or substance use disorder, and [8] Current Procedural Terminology codes for behavioral health service utilization. Cluster analysis was used to examine the sample. These clusters were then analyzed for service utilization with a one-way analysis of variance. Results The cluster analysis identified six clusters with an average silhouette of 0.5, indicating good clustering. These six clusters were operationalized as [1] Medicare/Medicaid healthcare plan with substance use disorder needs [2], Private pay and charity care healthcare plan with cocaine use disorder needs [3], Medicare/Medicaid and other publicly-funded healthcare plans with mood disorder needs [4], Private healthcare plan with low co-occurring disorder needs [5], Other publicly-funded healthcare plan with cannabis use disorder needs [6], Medicare/Medicaid healthcare plan with mental health disorder needs. Service utilization differed between these clusters with cluster mean differences for psychotherapy sessions ( F = 8.55, p &lt; 0.001), psychiatric sessions ( F = 22.72, p &lt; 0.001), and group therapy sessions ( F = 10.76, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions This study highlights the importance of comprehensive and integrated treatment for substance use disorders and mental health disorders, particularly for those in underserved communities. Healthcare coverage, a socioeconomic factor that impacts access to care, is critical in distinguishing treatment needs and utilization.",

    "abstract": "Excessive alcohol consumption is a significant global health issue, often unaddressed in primary care. The 15-method, a three-step opportunistic screening and treatment tool premised on Motivational Interviewing and integrated within the Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment framework, offers a structured approach for healthcare professionals to identify and treat alcohol-related problems. The present study aimed to assess healthcare professionals' perceptions of determinants for early-stage implementation of the 15-method in Danish general practice and to classify these determinants using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). This qualitative study involved individual interviews and group interviews with general practitioners and nurses (N = 28) from 12 general practices participating in the Identification and Treatment of Alcohol Problems in Primary Care (iTAPP) study, a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of the 15-method in Danish general practice. Interviews were semi-structured, guided by the CFIR framework, and analyzed using directed content analysis. Determinants were rated for their influence on implementation. Key facilitators included the 15-method's adaptability, strong evidence base, relative advantage, and compatibility with existing practices. Barriers included structural characteristics in the practices and local conditions. A central finding revealed a tension between patients' motivation and healthcare professionals' opportunities and capabilities to deliver the 15-method. Mixed determinants highlighted the complexity of implementing the 15-method across diverse practices. Implementing the 15-method in Danish general practice is feasible but requires addressing specific barriers and leveraging facilitators. A multifaceted implementation strategy tailored to individual practices may be necessary to address the variations in contexts and resources across different practices with an emphasis on increasing healthcare professionals' capabilities and opportunities to deliver the intervention.",

To contribute to continued efforts to understand drug use among first-time arrestees, this study characterizes the nature and extent of urine drug screenings (UDS) positive for fentanyl and/or methamphetamine among first-time arrestees receiving healthcare in 25 jails across the U.S. This study used the same data source, data extraction, sample selection, and UDS variables as those reported by Schumacher et al. (2025) and a similar data analytic strategy which included 81,842 arrestees with a UDS or 28.8% of total arrestees (283,884). Among first-time arrestees with complete results (43,553), 32,561 or 74.8% of arrestees tested positive for any drug and among those, 14,426 (44.3%) were positive for fentanyl and/or methamphetamine. Of those, 59.8% and 11.5% were only positive for methamphetamine or fentanyl, respectively, while 28.7% were positive for both. Demographically, individuals testing positive for both fentanyl and methamphetamine were predominantly white young adults (aged 20–39), with similar co-occurrence patterns in males and females. Fentanyl alone was more common in southern and midwestern jails and mega-sized jails, methamphetamine was more common in medium-large and southern jails, and their co-occurrence was most common in western and large jails. Approximately 97.5% of first-time arrestees tested positive for two or more drugs, with individuals testing positive for five or more drugs significantly more likely to test positive for both fentanyl and methamphetamine. This study highlights the significant prevalence of methamphetamine and/or fentanyl use among first-time arrestees, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions, improved in-jail substance use treatment, and post-release support to mitigate overdose risks and enhance public health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Contingency management (CM) is an effective intervention that provides financial incentives as positive reinforcement for reducing opioid or stimulant use. However, it has not been tested in populations of women who inject drugs (WWID) engaging in polysubstance use. Methods We aimed to compare the feasibility of two CM protocols designed to encourage illicit stimulant and opioid abstinence among WWID participating in an ongoing HIV prevention trial. Participants completed a 3-month CM period during which they submitted thrice weekly urine toxicology screenings (UTOX). In the ‘abstinence from stimulants and opioids’ protocol, participants received a $5 USD incentive when metabolites of stimulants and opioids were not detected in urine. In the ‘partial-abstinence protocol’, they received a $5 USD incentive when metabolites of stimulants or opioids were not detected, thus doubling the potential incentive obtained each visit. Women also received scaling bonuses after three consecutive negative UTOX ($5-$15 USD). We used descriptive statistics to summarize the total number of (1) UTOXs completed and (2) bonuses distributed. Rates of engagement per person per month were calculated (i.e., total number of completed UTOX/3 months*24 participants). Rates of engagement were compared by CM protocol period. Results Participants were primarily White women (67%) with an average age of 47 years. Self-reported polysubstance use was common (96%) with women reporting injecting an average of 5 times daily (Interquartile Range: 2–7). Participants ( N = 24) collectively submitted 177 UTOX during their 3-month CM periods. Rates of non-reactive UTOX results were slightly higher in the partial-abstinence protocol compared to the abstinence from stimulants and opioids protocol (2.9 per month versus 1.0 per month). More bonuses were earned in the partial-abstinence protocol (0.50 bonuses per participant per month) compared to the abstinence from stimulants and opioids protocol (none). There were no study related adverse events in either protocol group during the CM period. Conclusions Findings demonstrate the feasibility of a CM protocol that provided financial incentives for partial abstinence, periods with documented stimulant or opioid abstinence, as well as abstinence to both, without the occurrence of iatrogenic effects. Future research focusing on CM protocols with more flexible incentive structures remains critical. Trial registration NCT05192434.",

    "abstract": "The opioid epidemic has prompted nationwide efforts to expand access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Primary care settings have been identified as a critical access point for patients who may benefit from MOUD treatments. Despite implementation efforts, there is limited understanding of how MOUD practice capability in primary care settings evolves over time or what factors influence clinic-level implementation trajectories. We conducted a longitudinal study of 95 primary care clinics in California from 2019 to 2024. MOUD practice capability was measured using the Integrating Medications for Addiction Treatment in Primary Care (IMAT-PC) index across three timepoints. Using latent class growth analysis, we analyzed implementation growth trajectories and examined their associations with clinic characteristics and MOUD implementation outcomes (e.g., patient reach and provider adoption). Three distinct implementation trajectory classes emerged: elevated improving (41.0%), moderate improving (47.4%), and low improving (11.6%). All clinics demonstrated improvements in MOUD practice capability over time. Elevated improving clinics primarily consisted of smaller clinics (< 15,000 patients) and achieved significantly higher number of patients receiving MOUD compared to moderate (p = 0.03) and low improving clinics (p = 0.04). Clinics serving medically underserved populations disproportionately represented the low improving class (p < 0.01). Increase in the number of providers prescribing MOUD did not differ significantly across trajectory classes. Although all clinics increased MOUD capability, we found significant associations between implementation trajectory classes and changes in patients receiving MOUD over time in primary care-based MOUD programs. Implementation supports may be more effective and efficient if selected and delivered based upon clinic contextual factors, particularly in resource-constrained and underserved settings.",

However, detecting drinking above recommended levels in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australian primary care settings is complex. Inaccuracies in completing a screening tool such as Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption, can lead to errors in estimating drinking in First Nations contexts where group sharing and episodic drinking make it difficult to accurately estimate alcohol consumption with tools that assume regular drinking patterns. This can lead to under-detection of drinking and a mismatch with the subsequent care that is offered. Hence, screening tools that consider these contextual factors are needed to make it easier for First Nations Australian primary care services to screen for alcohol consumption above recommended levels. Electronic screening tools offer the technical flexibility to consider the drinking contexts Furthermore, for sensitive topics such as alcohol and other drugs, computer-based screening in the general population has been shown to provide more accurate and comprehensive responses compared with face-to-face interviews. Aim To facilitate alcohol screening and brief intervention in First Nations Australian primary care settings by adapting the Grog App – a community survey tool validated in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations for use in primary care. Methods The project will use mixed-methods techniques across five study stages: 1 – Interest-holder consultation; 2 – technical development; 3 – re-validation and user interface acceptability; 4 – implementation in an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary care setting; 5 – acceptability study, six months after implementation. Discussion The project will produce a novel, culturally appropriate digital health tool and implementation resources to make it easier to conduct routine alcohol screening in primary care contexts for a priority population, which may lead to increased screening and alcohol care rates. It will also provide first-ever contextual data about implementation of new health service improvement strategy focused on an electronic alcohol consumption screening tool, which is lacking in peer-reviewed literature. This study will also provide an important evidence base for using continuous quality improvement as an implementation approach in primary care settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background There is increasing attention in clinician care to the importance of using person-first language. Clinicians’ words can reinforce clinicians’ pre-existing stigmas and biases. People who use drugs (PWUD) continue to face stigma from clinicians. Person-first language is a way to reduce stigma and perpetuation of bias. Methods Through specific structured in-person interviews, we examined the usage of stigmatizing language in the care of PWUD by surveying key clinicians– such as physicians, nurses, and social workers—and patients who self-identified as PWUD at Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA) between July 2022-September 2022. Interview guides were created using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) 2.0 as a framework. We evaluated perceptions of person-first language and barriers to using person-first language amongst participants. Interviews were coded with Dedoose Software and inductive thematic analysis (ITA) methods were used until all themes were captured; CFIR 2.0 determinants used during interview guide creation were used as preliminary themes and modified as needed. Results We interviewed thirty-four people, including eleven PWUD at time of interview. Most clinicians agreed that language is important and matters when talking to patients and during documentation. Almost all patients agreed that language was important to them and impacted their relationship with their provider. However, there were responders that felt that person-first language was unnecessary, ineffective, and overly verbose in the medical setting. Major barriers to using person-first language were unawareness, lack of formal training, and perceived generational differences in appropriate language. Conclusion Addressing language usage is a critical opportunity to promote inclusion and reduce bias amongst PWUD. As medical charts become increasingly accessible by patients, the use of language by the clinician becomes increasingly important. To create and maintain equitable systems of care, it is important to meet clinicians where they are at and to work with them to address these issues. This can include targeted educational sessions and resources informing clinicians on preferred language use and curriculum for providers-in-training.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Practical and motivational barriers can deter people from engaging in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, even those who seek treatment. Care navigation is a psychosocial intervention that seeks to facilitate patients’ timely access to care by identifying and intervening upon barriers . Few trials have tested the effectiveness of care navigation when embedding in real-world healthcare, and no trials have studied the process of implementing care navigation into clinical practice. This protocol describes a study that will evaluate whether care navigation can increase treatment engagement among patients seeking SUD treatment. Methods The Addressing Barriers to Care for Substance Use Disorder (ABC-SUD) study is a hybrid type I cluster-randomized effectiveness-implementation trial. It is conducted in a mental health access center of an integrated healthcare system in Washington state. Within this center, licensed mental health clinicians assess patient needs and use shared decision-making to establish SUD treatment plans for patients (usual care). This study tests whether an added care navigation intervention can improve patient engagement in SUD treatment. Care navigation begins after a treatment plan is made and provides up to 7 weeks of support focused on enhancing patient motivation to initiate and engage in treatment, problem-solving barriers (e.g., transportation logistics), and accommodating patient preferences (e.g., preferred language of care, cultural preferences). This trial uses a two period, two sequence crossover design. Clinicians are randomized to offer care navigation to patients during the first or second study period (i.e., clinicians are assigned to an initial study condition and switch conditions halfway through the trial). Care navigation is implemented with several strategies: leadership engagement, clinical workflow specifications, electronic health record (EHR) tools, training, performance improvement, and electronic learning collaborative. The primary outcome—obtained from EHRs and insurance claims—is engagement in SUD treatment, defined as ≥3 SUD treatment visits within 48 days of a treatment plan. This study uses standardized measures of implementation climate and outcomes to examine mechanisms with which the intervention strategies exert their impact on implementation and effectiveness outcomes. Discussion The ABC-SUD study will test whether care navigation improves SUD treatment engagement while concurrently generating information about its implementation in healthcare. Trial registration: This study was prospectively registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06729957) on December 9, 2024.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Physical activity (PA) interventions may benefit youth with problematic substance use (SU); however, the acceptability of these interventions in young people is poorly understood. In this mixed-methods study, predictors and correlates of treatment acceptability of PA interventions as part of SU treatment were investigated, and young people’s perspectives on PA intervention (e.g., perceived barriers and service-related needs) were explored. Methods Young people aged 16-25 years (n=145) with problematic SU completed a quantitative online survey on substance use, PA engagement, treatment acceptability, and perceived barriers and benefits of PA. Data were analysed using data mining and modelling approaches. Four participants aged 18-25 years participated in a subsequent, semi-structured focus group; data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Quantitative and qualitative findings were integrated using an established model of behaviour change (COM-B). Results Generalised additive modelling identified perceived PA barriers to be a predictor of treatment acceptability ( p ≤.001). Decision tree analyses confirmed that lower psychological distress (1 st partition, p &lt;.001) and higher PA levels (2 nd partition, p =.03) predicted lower perceived PA barriers. Latent class analysis suggested a 2-class model differentiating young people at moderate substance-related risk, reporting low psychological distress and perceived PA barriers (class 1) from young people at severe substance-related risk, reporting higher psychological distress and perceived barriers. Qualitative findings revealed substantial barriers to PA, including substance-related, mental health, access, and social barriers. Together, findings illustrated complex interactions between different dimensions related to behaviour change and areas where clinical services may increase young people’s capability, opportunity and motivation to prompt behaviour change. Conclusions PA levels and psychological distress predict perceived barriers to PA in young people with problematic SU. PA barriers predict treatment acceptability of PA interventions. Knowledge of such predictors may inform treatment decisions by clinicians. Young people’s insights should be integrated into PA intervention research to inform intervention and understand the unique barriers, preferences and needs of youth affected by problematic SU. Integration of young people’s perspectives may increase behaviour change, as well as motivation, engagement and positive feelings in young people participating in PA interventions within substance use treatment.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have systematically examined the barriers and facilitators to buprenorphine uptake, despite increasing opioid-related harms and guideline recommendations for use. The aim of the study was to use behaviour change frameworks to investigate barriers and facilitators to buprenorphine access and use from diverse perspectives in Ontario, Canada. We conducted semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews with Ontarians including: people with living/lived expertise of opioid use (including family members), healthcare professionals, and organizational and system-level representatives. We used purposive sampling via existing professional networks to recruit participants with diverse experiences. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) guided the data collection tool and analysis. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and underwent thematic analysis involving three study team members. We interviewed 28 participants between September 2019 and January 2020. Three predominant TDF domains were identified across all 4 levels: (1) environmental context/resources; (2) beliefs about consequences; (3) social influences. Key cross-cutting themes included access to comprehensive care, medication and treatment characteristics, confidence and experiences with buprenorphine, as well as supportive relationships and stigma/discrimination. Multi-level barriers to optimal buprenorphine implementation continue in the face of the drug toxicity crisis. To counter the identified barriers and enhance facilitators, there is need for mentorship models of support for prescribing, flexibility in buprenorphine treatment requirements, better recognition of mental health and the social determinants of health in buprenorphine treatment, and comprehensive and integrated systems of care.",

    "abstract": "Given the high prevalence of substance use disorders (SUDs) among people with HIV, integration of evidence-based SUD services within HIV service settings is needed. Federally-funded training and technical assistance centers, such as the Health Resources and Services Administration-funded AIDS Education and Training Center (AETC) network, are part of the support system that deliver strategies to promote the uptake of evidence-based interventions. Previously, our program of research supported (1) the effectiveness of facilitation for improving both the implementation and effectiveness of a motivational interviewing-based brief intervention for SUDs in HIV service organizations (HSOs), (2) motivational interviewing as having the best setting-intervention fit for HSOs, and (3) distributing educational materials as having the best setting-strategy fit for AETCs. Because exploration and adoption/preparation are phases that must occur before implementation and sustainment, we seek to test the effectiveness of facilitation to augment an initial distributing educational materials dissemination strategy. Using a multi-cohort cluster-randomized adaptive parallel-groups superiority experiment design, our aim is to test the effectiveness of augmenting a standard distributing educational materials dissemination strategy with a brief exploration facilitation dissemination strategy to support implementation of a motivational interviewing-based brief intervention. For each rollout, HSOs not responding to the distributing educational materials strategy will be randomized to either (a) receive no further intervention or (b) receive the exploration facilitation strategy. Assessed 4-months post-dissemination, the primary dissemination outcome is organizational-level adoption/preparation of the intervention (i.e., 1 + HSO staff downloads the manual and/or enrolls in the online asynchronous training). The secondary dissemination outcome is organization-level exploration of the intervention (i.e., 1 + HSO staff opens the dissemination email). Before evidence-based interventions are implemented in practice to improve health outcomes, they must first be successfully disseminated and then explored and adopted by service organizations and providers. Because training and technical assistance centers have limited resources for dissemination efforts, effective adaptive dissemination strategies that utilize limited resources are needed. If we find the exploration facilitation strategy to be an effective adjunct to the distributing educational materials strategy, we hope that this adaptive dissemination strategy can be widely adopted and implemented by training and technical assistance centers.

Methods Cross-sectional data from the Young Women’s Health Study-2 (YWHS-2), a prospective study of HIV and ATS use among young (15 to 29 years) FSW in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, was analyzed. The YWHS-2 assessed sociodemographic characteristics, HIV serology, HIV risk, and ATS use by self-report and urine toxicology testing at each quarterly visit, the second of which provided data for this assessment. Outcomes include sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative predictive values (overall and stratified by age), sex-work setting, and HIV status. Results Among 200 women, prevalence of positive toxicology screening for ATS use was 14% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2, 18.9%) and concurrent prevalence of self-reported ATS was 15.5% (95% CI, 10.4, 20.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of self-reported ATS use compared to positive toxicology test results was 89.3% (25/28), and 96.5% (166/172), respectively. The positive predictive value of self-reported ATS use was 80.6% (25/31); the negative predictive value was 98.2% (166/169). Some differences in concordance between self-report and urine toxicology results were noted in analyses stratified by age group and sex-work setting but not by HIV status. Conclusion Results indicate a high prevalence of ATS use among FSW in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and high concordance between self-reported and toxicology-test confirmed ATS use.",

We report insights from individuals who had successfully recovered from cannabis use disorder with a variety of pathways. Recovered individuals describe their perceptions of why they developed the problem, why they were successful in recovering, and the advice they would offer to individuals with similar problems.Media announcements were used to recruit 119 volunteers who met lifetime but not past year criteria for cannabis use disorder. Participants were asked open-ended questions which were content analyzed and compared between individuals who whose recoveries were treatment-assisted (45%) versus natural (55%) and between individuals who were abstinent (57%) versus those who continued non-problematic consumption (43%).Participants most frequently described their problems as having developed due to the use of cannabis to cope, because of environmental and social influences, and enjoyment of the positive effects. Success in recovery was attributed to focusing on reasons for change, goal commitment to change, and conquering denial/self-deception. Treatment-assisted participants were more likely to perceive that they overcame their cannabis problem due to treatment/self-help and conquering underlying issues, whereas naturally recovered participants were more likely to describe focusing on reasons for change, will power, and lost enjoyment/lifestyle change. Treatment-assisted participants were more likely to recommend seeking help/social support and naturally recovered participants were more likely to endorse reflecting on reasons for change, engaging in hobbies/distracting activities, and stimulus control/avoidance/change social environment. The majority recommended professional treatment (79.1%) and self-help materials (76.9%), and a little over half (53.2%) would also recommend natural recovery.These insights from people with lived experience further support previous research that treatment-assisted and natural recoveries are for the most part similar with respect to the recovery process. However, participants, whether or not they had had treatment involvement, recommended the use of treatment and self-help materials to sharpen their focus on the reasons to change and to enhance their commitment to change. At the same time, they saw value in the efforts of individuals to recovery without help.",

When hazardous use is identified, it should immediately be addressed, preferably through brief interventions (BI). It is well known that the prevalence of alcohol use and illicit substance use among psychiatric patients is high, but it is not known to what extent screening and BI are routinely carried out in such clinics. Two online surveys investigating the use of screening and BI for alcohol and illicit substances were constructed; one for psychiatric outpatient clinic directors and one for staff at these clinics. The main analyses were calculated as simple frequencies. In secondary analyses, we investigated the associations between substance abuse training, type of clinic and screening/BI delivery. For these analyses, the Chi square test was used. Most clinic directors reported that they have guidelines to screen for alcohol (93.1%) and illicit substance use (78.9%) at initial assessment. Fifty percent reported having guidelines for delivering BI when identifying hazardous alcohol use (35.9% for hazardous illicit substance use). Among staff, 66.6% reported always screening for alcohol use and 57.8% reported always screening for illicit substance use at initial assessment. Further, 36.7% reported that they usually deliver BI when identifying hazardous alcohol use (35.7% for hazardous illicit substance use). Secondary analyses indicated that staff with substance abuse training were significantly more likely to screen for alcohol use than staff without such training. Further, staff at psychosis clinics were significantly less likely to screen for both alcohol and substance use than staff at both general and specialist psychiatric clinics. Most clinic directors reported having clear guidelines for staff to screen for alcohol use and illicit substance use, but fewer staff members than expected indicated that these guidelines were adhered to. Providing training about substance use disorders for staff may increase use of screening for alcohol use, and psychosis clinics may need to improve their screening routines.",

To determine who methamphetamine treatment should be designed for this study has two aims. First, to empirically describe changes in amphetamine treatment presentations to a rural NSW drug and alcohol treatment agency over time. Second, to examine how these characteristics may affect the likelihood of being treated for amphetamines compared to other drugs. The Australian Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Services National Minimum Data Set (AODTS-NMDS) containing closed treatment episodes from a single agency from three time periods was used. Characteristics of people receiving amphetamine treatments in these three periods were compared and the effects of these characteristics on the odds of being treated for amphetamine were estimated using a logistic regression model. The characteristics utilised in the analysis include age, sex, Indigenous status, usual accommodation, living arrangement, source of referral and source of income. The proportion of amphetamine treatment episodes doubled from 2006/2007 to 2015/2016 and overtook alcohol as the most commonly treated principal drug of concern. The estimated proportion of amphetamine treatments showed an increment across all ages and for men and women. It was found that younger people, women, people in temporary accommodation or homeless, people who were self-referred and people whose main source of income was not through employment are more likely to be treated for amphetamine use. Significant changes over time in the age, sex and Indigenous status of people receiving treatment for amphetamine as the principal drug of concern requires service delivery to match demand from younger people, particularly women; and Indigenous people. The needs and preferences for treatment of younger women who use amphetamine will be important factors in treatment planning service providers who are more used to providing treatment for young men who use cannabis and older men who use alcohol. Further research on women's experiences in treatment and outcomes would be useful for informing treatment practices.",

The purpose of the present qualitative study was to understand HIV care provider perceptions and approaches to managing unhealthy alcohol use in HIV primary care settings. Using a semi-structured interview guide, in-depth interviews were conducted among 14 HIV care providers (5 medical doctors, 5 nurse practitioners/physician assistants, 2 medical assistants, 2 clinical administrative staff) in private and public HIV clinics, across urban and rural areas of Florida. Interviews were coded using a grounded theory approach with inter-rater consensus. Six themes were identified. In summary, providers reported (1) inconsistent assessment of alcohol consumption, as well as (2) varying levels of confidence in self-report of alcohol use which may be affected by patient provider rapport and trust. While providers (3) acknowledge potential negative impacts of alcohol use on health outcomes and HIV treatment, providers reported (4) inconsistent recommendations regarding alcohol use among their patients. Lastly, providers reported (5) limited resources for patients with unhealthy alcohol use and (6) low confidence in their ability to help patients reduce use. Results from our study suggest salient differences in provider approaches to the assessment and management of unhealthy alcohol use in HIV primary care settings. Implementation of care for unhealthy alcohol use in these settings may be facilitated through use of clinically useful, validated alcohol use assessments and use of evidence-based recommendations of alcohol use/non-use among PLWH. Training in brief intervention techniques for alcohol reduction may increase provider confidence and support in the management of unhealthy alcohol use among PLWH.",

    "abstract": "For more than 30 years, drug consumption rooms (DCRs) have been implemented in Western countries. DCRs are supported by a large body of evidence about public safety and public health effectiveness. However, a political consensus has never been achieved in Belgium on amending the existing law that explicitly penalises the supply of a room for facilitating drug use. Despite this adverse legal and policy framework, a DCR opened in the city of Liège in 2018. In this case report, we applied the theoretical framework proposed by Shiffman and Smith for policy agenda setting, in order to describe and assess how political and legal barriers were overcome in the process of opening the DCR.For some years, fieldworkers and some city policymakers argued for DCR implementation in Belgium, but without gaining the support of the national authorities, mainly for ideological reasons. In order to address this debate, a feasibility study of DCR implementation in Belgian cities was commissioned. At the national level, an institutional debate took place about the political responsibility for DCRs as a public health intervention, as health care is mainly a matter of regional policy. The lack of consensus led to a situation of political deadlock. Meanwhile, the publication of the study report and the context of local elections offered an opportunity for Liège authorities to reignite the local debate on DCRs. At the local level, law enforcement, care professionals, residents, users, and the press were all involved in the implementation process. Therefore, a local consensus was formed and despite the absence of any national legal change, the DCR opened 1 month before the local elections. It has been working without major medical or legal incident since then. Incidentally, the mayor of Liège was re-elected.Although the lack of a legal framework may engender instability and affect longer-term effectiveness, the DCR implementation in Liège was successful and was based on a local consensus and effective communication rather than on an appropriate legal framework. The experience provides lessons for other cities that are considering opening a DCR despite an adverse legal and political context.",

Previous research shows improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and practices after exposure to OUD care. Few studies report outcomes for patients with OUD in resident physician continuity practices. Methods A novel internal office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) program was initiated in a resident continuity clinic. Surveys of resident and staff knowledge and attitudes of OBOT were administered at baseline and 4 months. A retrospective chart review of the 15-month OBOT clinic obtained patient characteristics and outcomes. Results Twelve patients with OUD were seen in the OBOT clinic. Seven patients (58%) were retained in care at the end of the study period for a range of 9–15 months. Eight patients demonstrated a good clinical response. Surveys of residents and staff at 4 months were unchanged from baseline showing persistent lack of comfort in caring for patients with OUD. Conclusions OBOT can be successfully integrated into resident continuity practices with positive patient outcomes. Improvement in resident and staff attitudes toward OBOT were not observed and likely require direct and frequent exposure to OUD care to increase acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Since 2004 >90% of outpatients in the US Veterans Health Administration (VA) have been screened for unhealthy alcohol use with the AUDIT-C. However, research suggests variability in the quality of screening. To understand factors underlying variable quality, we conducted two qualitative studies: 1) an ethnographic study where we observed clinical staff performing screening, and 2) a key-informant study where we conducted 1:1 interviews with clinical staff. For Study 1, four researchers observed alcohol screening at 9 primary care clinics and took handwritten notes, which were transcribed. For Study 2, snowball sampling was used to recruit key informants (n=29) at 5 additional clinics who completed 20-30 minute semi-structured interviews, which were recorded and transcribed. Both qualitative datasets were analyzed using an a priori coding template. In Study 1, we observed 58 clinical staff caring for 166 patients. Alcohol screening was observed 74 times. Clinical staff appeared uncomfortable conducting verbal alcohol screening, and most screening was not verbatim. Study 2 interviews found that clinical staff and providers believed that addressing unhealthy alcohol use is an important part of care but had not received standard training regarding how or why to conduct alcohol screening. Information on alcohol screening was provided to clinicians via email announcement of the availability of electronic clinical decision support and ad-hoc peer-to-peer demonstration of its use. Participants perceived the screening questions to be sensitive and reported modifying questions to increase patient comfort. Participants were largely focused on identifying patients with the most severe condition—alcohol dependence—for which brief intervention does not have confirmed efficacy. Lack of training and discomfort are barriers contributing to variability in screening quality. Addressing the spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use is not yet viewed as part of a preventive agenda. Additional strategies are likely needed to improve screening quality.",

Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted on: participation in the Natural Recovery Program; co-morbid psychiatric disorders; and legal, medical, and psychiatric issues. Participation in Natural Recovery was significantly associated with successful treatment completion when analyzed by univariate analysis (p = 0.01). Other significant variables associated with successful completion included: no co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis, fewer prior suicide attempts, and no homelessness prior to admission. Binary logistic regression demonstrated that participation in Natural Recovery was associated with improved treatment completion, even when other variables were considered (p = 0.01). Treatment retention was longer for patients who participated in Natural Recovery, even if they did not complete treatment. The Natural Recovery Program was associated with improved outcomes, as measured by treatment retention in the first 60 days and by treatment completion. Participants of Natural Recovery with co-morbid psychiatric disorders completed treatment at a higher rate than those with co-morbid psychiatric disorders who participated in the core program. Patients reported high satisfaction with the program. This program may be a valuable adjunct to residential treatment.",

    "abstract": "People who use drugs are an important priority for HIV programs. However, data related to their utilization of HIV services are limited. This paper reports patterns of HIV testing, drug use, and risk and service perception among people who use drugs. Study participants were receiving HIV and harm reduction services from a community-based program in Phnom Penh, comprised of itinerant peer-led outreach and static drop-in centers.This was a mixed-methods study conducted in 2014, comprising of a quantitative survey using a structured questionnaire, followed by two focus group discussions among a sub-sample of survey participants. Participants were recruited from hotspots in five HIV high-burden communes using a two-stage cluster sampling method. Quantitative descriptive analyses and qualitative thematic analyses were performed.This study included 151 people who use drugs with a mean age of 31.2 (SD = 6.5) years; 77.5% were male and 39.1% were married. The most common drugs used were methamphetamines (72.8%) and heroin (39.7%), and 38.0% injected drugs in the past 3 months. Overall, 83.3% had been tested for HIV in the past 6 months, of whom 62.5% had been tested by peers through community-based outreach. However, there were ongoing HIV risks: 37.3% were engaging in sex on drugs, only 35.6% used a condom at last sexual intercourse, and 10.8% had had a sexually transmitted infection in the last 6 months. Among people who reported injecting drugs in the past 3 months, 27.5% reported re-using needles/syringes. Almost half (46.5%) perceived themselves as being at lower risk of HIV compared to the general population. Qualitative results contextualized the findings of low perception of HIV risks and suggested that although services were often unavailable on weekends, at night, or during national holidays, peer-led community-based outreach was highly accepted.A peer-led community-based approach was effective in reaching people who use drugs with HIV and harm reduction interventions. To mitigate ongoing HIV risks, expanding access to combination prevention interventions and implementing strategies to enable people who use drugs to objectively assess their HIV risks are required. Additionally, community-based programs should collect data along the care continuum, to enable decentralized tracking of progress towards 90-90-90 goals at local levels.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and unhealthy drinking are prevalent among women involved in the criminal justice system and women military veterans. Pharmacotherapy—including naltrexone, topiramate, acamprosate, and disulfiram—for AUD is one form of effective treatment that is associated with better health and criminal justice outcomes. The current study examined the association of justice involvement with receipt of pharmacotherapy for AUD, as well as other patient factors that may explain variation in receipt of pharmacotherapy for AUD among women veterans who receive care at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. Using national VHA clinical records, we examined all women VHA patients who received an AUD diagnosis during an outpatient or inpatient visit in fiscal years (FY) 2014–2017. We compared patient characteristics by justice status, defined as contact with one of the VHA's justice outreach programs, and used a mixed-effects logistic regression model to test whether justice involvement was independently associated with odds of receiving pharmacotherapy for AUD. Of 10,511 women veterans diagnosed with AUD in FY2017, 852 (8%) met our definition of justice-involved. Since FY2014, the percentage of women veterans who received pharmacotherapy for AUD increased (14–21%). Women justice-involved veterans and those who were homeless had higher odds of receiving pharmacotherapy for AUD (OR 1.29, CI 1.15–1.45; OR 1.35, CI 1.25–1.47). Women veterans age 55 or older or who were African-American had lower odds of receiving pharmacotherapy (OR 0.74, CI 0.67–0.82; OR 0.73, CI 0.68–0.79). While women involved in the criminal justice system face many barriers to accessing health and social services, women justice-involved veterans had higher odds of receiving pharmacotherapy for AUD at VHA facilities compared to women veterans with no justice involvement. Legal mandates and supportive programming directed towards veterans in the criminal justice system may explain the higher rate of receipt of pharmacotherapy observed among justice-involved women veterans. Women veterans who are homeless may also have more opportunities to access and use pharmacotherapy for AUD compared to their housed counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Recently, electronic cigarette (e-cig) usage has increased significantly, making it a potentially effective smoking cessation tool. In Muslim countries, most people who use e-cigarettes fast the month of Ramadan, which results in intermittent fasting. This study aims to reveal the severity of e-cig withdrawal symptoms among users during this intermittent fasting period. Methods A self-administered survey was developed and validated to solicit anonymous responses from e-cig users living in Jordan, through a cross-sectional study design. Participants were recruited through social media resources. Severity scores of physical (out of 11) and psychological (out of 8) withdrawal symptoms for each participant were assessed and calculated for each participant, depending on the symptoms reported. Results A convenience sample (n = 523) of e-cig adult users were recruited. The majority of the participants were males (96.4%) aged between 18 and 40 years (86.4%). Many participants replaced tobacco smoking with e-cig (53.5%) in order to help them stop smoking. More than half of the participants experienced relatively weak physical (0.82 ± 1.78) and psychological (1.24 ± 1.89) withdrawal symptoms during the month of fasting. Most of the participants (63.2%) preferred to engage themselves with a busy schedule to tolerate the related withdrawal symptoms they experienced. Conclusion E-cigs could play a vital role in smoking cessation among tobacco smokers during intermittent fasting. Ramadan offers a good opportunity for smokers to quit, as the reported physical and psychological e-cig withdrawal symptoms were found to be relatively weak. Awareness and behavioral interventions would help clarify the effect of e-cigs and help determine alternative ways to cease smoking.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Unhealthy alcohol use is a key concern for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (‘Indigenous Australian’) communities. Due to systematic disadvantage and inter-generational trauma, Indigenous Australians may be less likely to have satisfied basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness). When people are need-thwarted, they may engage in compensatory behaviours to feel better in the short-term. We explore the relationship between perceived basic psychological needs satisfaction and alcohol consumption use among Indigenous Australians. Better understanding the functions that alcohol may play for some Indigenous Australian drinkers may aid communities, clinicians, and policy makers in improving programs for reducing drinking-related harms. Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey of Indigenous Australians (aged 16 years or older) living in two South Australian communities. Participants were eligible if they had consumed any alcohol in the past 12 months. Spearman correlations and linear regressions were used to determine if feeling more autonomous, competent, and related to others (need satisfied) while drinking, was linked to alcohol consumption and dependence. Results Controlling for participant demographics, reporting feeling need satisfied while drinking was linked to drinking more alcohol per day, reporting more frequent symptoms of alcohol dependence, spending more money on alcohol, and scoring higher on the AUDIT-C. Conclusions Unhealthy drinking may partly stem from attempts to satisfy basic psychological needs. Programs which support Indigenous Australians to meet basic psychological needs could reduce attempts to meet psychological needs through alcohol consumption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) programmes have resulted in generally positive outcomes in healthcare settings, particularly for problem alcohol use, yet implementation is hampered by barriers such as concerns regarding the burden on healthcare professionals. In low-resourced settings, task-sharing approaches can reduce this burden by using non-professional healthcare workers, yet data are scarce regarding the outcomes and acceptability to patients within a SBIRT service. This study aims to evaluate patient-reported outcomes, patient acceptability, perceived benefits and recommendations for improving a task-shared SBIRT service in South African emergency centres (ECs). Methods This mixed methods study incorporates quantitative substance use screening and patient satisfaction data collected routinely within the service at three hospitals, and qualitative semi-structured interviews with 18 EC patient beneficiaries of the programme exploring acceptability and perceived benefits of the programme, as well as recommendations to improve the service. Approximately three months after the acute EC visit, a sub-sample of patients were followed up telephonically to assess patient-reported satisfaction and substance use outcomes. Results Of the 4847 patients eligible for the brief intervention, 3707 patients (76%) used alcohol as their primary substance and 794 (16%) used cannabis. At follow-up (n = 273), significant reductions in substance use frequency and severity were noted and over 95% of patients were satisfied with the service. In the semi-structured interviews, participants identified the non-judgemental caring approach of the counsellors, and the screening and psychoeducation components of the intervention as being the most valuable, motivating them to decrease substance use and make other positive lifestyle changes. Study participants made recommendations to include group sessions, market the programme in communities and extend the programme’s reach to include a broader age group and a variety of settings. Conclusions This task-shared SBIRT service was found to be acceptable to patients, who reported several benefits of a single SBIRT contact session delivered during an acute EC visit. These findings add to the SBIRT literature by highlighting the role of non-professional healthcare workers in delivering a low-intensity SBIRT service feasible to implement in low-resourced settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Medications for opioid use disorder such as opioid agonist treatment (OAT, including methadone, buprenorphine) are the gold standard intervention for opioid use disorder (OUD). Persons with OUD have high rates of neurocognitive impairment and psychiatric and substance use disorders, but few studies have examined these characteristics in diverse patients initiating OAT in opioid treatment programs (OTPs). Additionally, in these individuals, poor neurocognitive functioning and psychiatric/other substance use disorders are associated with poor OUD treatment outcomes. Given rapid changes in the opioid epidemic, we sought to replicate findings from our pilot study by examining these characteristics in a large diverse sample of persons with OUD starting OTP-based OAT. Methods Ninety-seven adults with OUD ( M age = 42.2 years [ SD = 10.3]; M education = 11.4 years [ SD = 2.3]; 27% female; 22% non-Hispanic white) were enrolled in a randomized longitudinal trial evaluating methadone versus buprenorphine/naloxone on neurocognitive functioning. All participants completed a comprehensive neurocognitive, psychiatric, and substance use evaluation within one week of initiating OAT. Results Most of the sample met criteria for learning (79%) or memory (69%) impairment. Half exhibited symptoms of current depression, and comorbid substance use was highly prevalent. Lifetime cannabis and cocaine use disorders were associated with better neurocognitive functioning, while depression was associated with worse neurocognitive functioning. Conclusions Learning and memory impairment are highly prevalent in persons with OUD starting treatment with either methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone in OTPs. Depression and comorbid substance use are prevalent among these individuals, but neither impact learning or memory. However, depression is associated with neurocognitive impairment in other domains. These findings might allow clinicians to help persons with OUD starting OAT to develop compensatory strategies for learning and memory, while providing adjunctive treatment for depression.

    "abstract": "The emergency department (ED) offers an important opportunity to identify patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) and initiate treatment. However, post-ED follow-up is challenging, and novel approaches to enhance care transitions are urgently needed. Outcomes following ED visits have traditionally focused on overdose, treatment engagement, and mortality with an absence of patient reported outcomes (PROs), for example patient ability to schedule follow-up OUD treatment appointments or pick up a prescription medication, that may better inform evaluation of treatment pathways and near-term outcomes after acute events. In the context of increasing novel secure mobile health (mHealth) platforms, we explored the feasibility and acceptability of electronically collecting PROs from ED patients with non-medical opioid use to enhance care in the ED and transitions of care.ED patients with non-medical opioid use or opioid overdose who endorsed willingness and ability to complete electronic surveys after discharge were enrolled from a tertiary, urban academic ED. Participants were enrolled in an mHealth platform, shared electronic health records with researchers, and completed electronic surveys of PROs at baseline, three- and thirty-days post discharge from the hospital, including questions about ability to schedule a follow-up appointment, pick up a prescription medication and overdose risk behaviors. Primary outcomes were measures of feasibility and acceptability of electronic PRO collection among ED patients with non-medical opioid use.Among 1,808 patients assessed for eligibility between June-December 2019, 101 of 130 (78%) eligible adult patients consented to participate. Ninety-six (95%) of 101 patients completed registration in the mHealth platform, and 77/96 (80%) were successful in sharing their electronic health data. Completion rates for the baseline, three-day and thirty-day surveys were 97% (93/96), 49% (47/96) and 42% (40/96). Implementation challenges included short engagement window during ED visit, limited access to smartphones/computers, insufficient battery life of participant phone to access email and password, forgotten emails and passwords, multi-step verification processes for account set-up, and complaints about hospital care, most of which were effectively addressed by study personnel.ED patients with OUD were willing to share electronic health information and PROs, although implementation challenges were common, and more than half of participants were lost-to-follow-up after hospital discharge at 30 days. Efforts to streamline communication and remove barriers to engagement are needed to improve the collection of PROs and pathways of care in ED patients with OUD.

Over the past decade, there have been significant efforts to support the adoption and implementation of SBI in general health-care settings, including $305 million in SBI service and training grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and approximately $17 million per year from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism for more than 40 SBI studies. In addition, numerous individual state initiatives have focused on SBI dissemination. Nonetheless, a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey found alcohol SBI is rarely performed [6]. Only 1 in 6 adults reported they had talked with a health professional about their alcohol use in the past year [6]. The present study uses data from two SAMHSA-funded projects to identify barriers to widespread implementation of SBI and propose potential solutions.",

Once a Chinese citizen has been identified by Chinese law enforcement as a ‘drug addict’, that individual is ‘registered’ in an official government tracking system for the rest of his or her life, independent of verified rehabilitation and recovery. Most of what is known about heroin users in China is based on studies of registered heroin users participating, often involuntarily, in government-sponsored treatment. Using Grounded Theory Methodology, we collected and analyzed in-depth interviews of heroin users voluntarily seeking treatment at a new, non-government-sponsored, for-profit, addiction treatment hospital in Beijing, China. We identified three major themes among our participants: (1) intense social stigma towards individuals with drug addiction; (2) a desire for anonymous, confidential treatment to avoid social stigma and the loss of personal freedom that accompanies participation in government-sponsored treatment; and (3) a deep mistrust of government-sponsored treatment and a search for more effective alternatives. Despite a desire for treatment, our subjects were reluctant to access government-sponsored treatment facilities because of fear of a stigmatized identity, fear of loss of personal freedom, and lack of faith in the efficacy and safety of government-sponsored treatments. Their willingness to pay cash at a new, non-government-sponsored, addiction treatment facility illustrates the lengths to which they will go to remain ‘unregistered’ and to discover better alternatives. That the Chinese government allows such facilities to operate outside of government surveillance suggests a new openness to alternative options to combat China’s rising drug epidemic. The efficacy of these alternative options, however, remains in question.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol misuse among military service members from the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan is over two times higher compared to misuse in the civilian population. Unfortunately, in addition to experiencing personal consequences from alcohol misuse, partners and family members of alcohol-misusing service members also suffer in negative ways from their loved one’s drinking. These family members represent important catalysts for helping their loved ones identify problem drinking and overcoming the barriers to seeking care. This paper describes the protocol to a pilot study evaluating a 4-session, web-based intervention (WBI) for concerned partners (CPs) of service members with alcohol misuse. The WBI will be adapted from the Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) intervention. In the first phase, we will develop and beta-test the WBI with 15–20 CPs. In the second phase, we will randomize CPs to WBI (n = 50) or to delayed-WBI (n = 50) and evaluate the impact of the WBI on CPs’ perceptions of service member help-seeking and drinking, as well as the CP’s well-being and relationship satisfaction 3 months after the intervention. In the third phase, we will recruit 15–20 service members whose partners have completed the study. We will interview the service members to learn how the CP-focused WBI affected them and to assess whether they would be receptive to a follow-on WBI module to help them. This project has the potential to benefit a large population of military service members who may be disproportionately affected by recent conflicts and whose drinking misuse would otherwise go undetected and untreated. It also develops a new prevention model that does not rely on service members or partners attending a hospital or clinical facility to access care. NCT02073825 .",

    "abstract": "Fewer than one in 10 adolescents with substance use disorders (ASUDs) will receive specialty treatment, and even fewer will receive treatment designated as evidence-based practice (EBP). Traditional efforts to increase the utilization of EBP by ASUDs typically focus on practitioners-either in substance use clinics or allied health settings. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing that directly targets parents of ASUDs represents a potentially complementary paradigm that has yet to be evaluated. The current study is the first to evaluate the relevance of a well-established marketing framework (the Marketing Mix) and measurement approach (measurement of perceived service quality [PSQ]) with parents of ASUDs in need of treatment. A mixed-methods design is employed across three study phases, consistent with well-established methods used in the field of marketing science. Phase 1 consists of formative qualitative research with parents (and a supplementary sample of adolescents) in order to evaluate and potentially adapt a conceptual framework (Marketing Mix) and measure of PSQ. Phase 2 is a targeted survey of ASUD parents to elucidate their marketing preferences, using the adapted Marketing Mix framework, and to establish the psychometric properties of the PSQ measure. The survey will also gather data on parents' preferences for different targeted marketing messages. Phase 3 is a two-group randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of targeted marketing messages versus standard clinical information. Key outcomes will include parents' ratings of PSQ (using the new measure), behavioral intentions to seek out information about EBP, and actual information-seeking behavior. The current study will inform the field whether a well-established marketing framework and measurement approach can be used to increase demand for EBP among parents of ASUDs. Results of this study will have the potential to immediately inform DTC marketing efforts by professional organizations, federal agencies, clinicians, and clinical researchers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The ED Leads program was introduced to 11 emergency departments (EDs) within New York City public hospitals from 2018 to 2019 to address a need for addiction support services in the ED. The purpose of this study is to (i) describe the ED Leads blended licensed-clinician and peer counselor team model in the ED at three hospitals, (ii) provide a descriptive analysis of patient engagement and referrals to substance use disorder (SUD) care post-intervention, and (iii) highlight potential barriers and facilitators to implementing the model. Methods The program intended to combine Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment and peer support services. The authors analyzed electronic medical records data for patients encountered by ED Leads in the first 120 days of program launch. Data included the outcome of an encounter when a patient was engaged with one or both staff types, and 7-day attendance at an SUD treatment appointment when a patient accepted a referral within the 11-hospital system. Results There were 1785 patients approached by ED Leads staff during the study period. Engagement differed by staff type and patient demographics, and encounter outcomes varied significantly by hospital. Eighty-four percent (N = 1503) of patients who were approached engaged with at least one staff type, and 6% (N = 86) engaged with both. Patients were predominantly male (N = 1438, 81%) with an average age of 45 (SD = 13), and enrolled in Medicaid (N = 1062, 59%). A majority (N = 801, 45%) had alcohol use disorder. Of the patients who accepted a referral within the system (N = 433), 63% received treatment services within 7 days of the ED Leads encounter, a majority at detoxification treatment (N = 252, 58%). Conclusions This study describes the potential value and challenges of implementing a blended peer counselor and licensed clinician model in the ED to provide SUD services. While teams provided a high volume of referrals and the analysis of post-intervention treatment follow up is promising, the blended team model was not fully realized, making it difficult to assess the benefits of this combined service. Further research might examine patient outcomes among ED patients who are offered services by both a peer counselor and licensed clinician.",

Methods Participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study who smoked daily were invited to join a pilot randomized controlled trial of three smoking cessation interventions: guideline-based care (GBC), GBC plus nicotine metabolism-informed care (MIC), and GBC plus counseling guided by a polygenic risk score (PRS) for lung cancer. Feasibility was assessed by rates of study enrollment, engagement, and retention, targeting &gt; 70% for each. Using logistic regression, we also assessed whether feasibility varied by age, sex, race, income, education, and attitudes toward precision smoking treatment. Results Of 92 eligible individuals (79.3% Black; 68.2% with household income &lt; $15,000), 67 (72.8%; 95% CI 63.0–80.9%) enrolled and were randomized. Of these, 58 (86.6%; 95% CI 76.4–92.8%) engaged with the intervention, and of these engaged participants, 43 (74.1%; 95% CI 61.6–83.7%) were retained at 6-month follow-up. Conditional on enrollment, older age was associated with lower engagement (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73–0.95, p = 0.008). Conditional on engagement, retention was significantly lower in the PRS arm than in the GBC arm (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03–1.00, p = 0.050). No other selection effects were observed. Conclusions Genetically informed precision smoking cessation interventions are feasible in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, exhibiting high enrollment, engagement, and retention irrespective of race, sex, income, education, or attitudes toward precision smoking treatment. Future smoking cessation interventions in this population should take steps to engage older people and to sustain participation in interventions that include genetic risk counseling.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Pharmacists remain an underutilized resource in the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). Although studies have engaged pharmacists in dispensing medications for OUD (MOUD), few studies have evaluated collaborative care models in which pharmacists are an active, integrated part of a primary care team offering OUD care. Methods This study seeks to implement a pharmacist integrated MOUD clinical model (called PrIMO) and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and impact across four diverse primary care sites. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research is used as an organizing framework for study development and interpretation of findings. Implementation Facilitation is used to support PrIMO adoption. We assess the primary outcome, the feasibility of implementing PrIMO, using the Stages of Implementation Completion (SIC). We evaluate the acceptability and impact of the PrIMO model at the sites using mixed-methods and combine survey and interview data from providers, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, administrators, and patients receiving MOUD at the primary care sites with patient electronic health record data. We hypothesize that it is feasible to launch delivery of the PrIMO model (reach SIC Stage 6), and that it is acceptable, will positively impact patient outcomes 1 year post model launch (e.g., increased MOUD treatment retention, medication regimen adherence, service utilization for co-morbid conditions, and decreased substance use), and will increase each site’s capacity to care for patients with MOUD (e.g., increased number of patients, number of prescribers, and rate of patients per prescriber). Discussion This study will provide data on a pharmacist-integrated collaborative model of care for the treatment of OUD that may be feasible, acceptable to both site staff and patients and may favorably impact patients’ access to MOUD and treatment outcomes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Emergency departments (ED) are incorporating Peer Support Specialists (PSSs) to help with patient care for substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite rapid growth in this area, little is published regarding workflow, expectations of the peer role, and core components of the PSS intervention. This study describes these elements in a national sample of ED-based peer support intervention programs. Methods A survey was conducted to assess PSS site characteristics as part of site selection process for a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Clinical Trials Network (CTN) evaluating PSS effectiveness, Surveys were distributed to clinical sites affiliated with the 16 CTN nodes. Surveys were completed by a representative(s) of the site and collected data on the PSS role in the ED including details regarding funding and certification, services rendered, role in medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and naloxone distribution, and factors impacting implementation and maintenance of ED PSS programs. Quantitative data was summarized with descriptive statistics. Free-text fields were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results A total of 11 surveys were completed, collected from 9 different states. ED PSS funding was from grants (55%), hospital funds (46%), peer recovery organizations (27%) or other (18%). Funding was anticipated to continue for a mean of 16 months (range 12 to 36 months). The majority of programs provided “general recovery support (81%) Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) services (55%), and assisted with naloxone distribution to ED patients (64%). A minority assisted with ED-initiated buprenorphine (EDIB) programs (27%). Most (91%) provided services to patients after they were discharged from the ED. Barriers to implementation included lack of outpatient referral sources, barriers to initiating MOUD, stigma at the clinician and system level, and lack of ongoing PSS availability due to short-term grant funding. Conclusions The majority of ED-based PSSs were funded through time-limited grants, and short-term grant funding was identified as a barrier for ED PSS programs. There was consistency among sites in the involvement of PSSs in facilitation of transitions of SUD care, coordination of follow-up after ED discharge, and PSS involvement in naloxone distribution.",

Substance use treatment bridge clinics offer an opportunity to increase HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) delivery to WSWUD, but research on best practices is lacking. Therefore, we explored facilitators and barriers to PrEP across the PrEP care continuum in these settings. Bridge clinic and affiliated harm reduction health service providers and WSWUD from Boston were recruited using passive and active outreach between December 2021 and August 2022. Participants were invited to take part in semi-structured phone or in-person interviews to explore HIV prevention and PrEP care experiences overall and within bridge clinic settings. Deductive codes were developed based on HIV risk environment frameworks and the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model and inductive codes were added based on transcript review. Grounded content analysis was used to generate themes organized around the PrEP care continuum. The sample included 14 providers and 25 WSWUD. Most WSWUD were aware of PrEP and more than half had initiated PrEP at some point. However, most who initiated PrEP did not report success with daily oral adherence. Providers and WSWUD described facilitators and barriers to PrEP across the steps of the care continuum: Awareness, uptake, adherence, and retention. Facilitators for WSWUD included non-stigmatizing communication with providers, rapid wraparound substance use treatment and HIV services, having a PrEP routine, and service structures to support PrEP adherence. Barriers included low HIV risk perceptions and competing drug use and survival priorities. Provider facilitators included clinical note templates prompting HIV risk assessments and training. Barriers included discomfort discussing sex work risks, competing clinical priorities, and a lack of PrEP adherence infrastructure. WSWUD and bridge clinic providers favored integrated HIV prevention and substance use services in harm reduction and bridge clinic settings. Harm reduction and bridge clinic programs played a key role in HIV prevention and PrEP education for WSWUD. Effective behavioral and structural interventions are still needed to improve PrEP adherence for WSWUD.",

They were diagnosed with severe opioid use disorder (OUD) and stimulant use disorder (StUD) and initiated buprenorphine while inpatient. They were then transitioned to the only known outpatient primary care clinic in her county who was actively providing medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in adolescents. At the first visit, they reported a history of 20 overdoses, struggling with adherence to buprenorphine and continued opioid cravings. An overdose safety plan was reviewed with them and their parent including providing them naloxone kits, fentanyl test strips, and education handout sheets. Due to their significant overdose history and adherence challenges with sublingual buprenorphine, they were started on long-acting injectable buprenorphine (LAIB) with weekly provider visits and urine toxicology screening. In collaboration with the treatment team, they initiated behavioral treatment with contingency management (CM), with incentives for appointment completion, expected urine results, and successful medication administration. Over the next 19 months, and to date, they have increasingly engaged with care and have remained abstinent. LAIB may be an appealing alternative for adolescents with OUD to improve adherence and reduce risk of recurrent use and overdose. Adjunctive treatment with CM may improve retention in MOUD and have the benefit of treating StUD. There is a need for further research to explore innovative, community-based treatment for youth with OUD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Substance use disorders (SUDs) have been consistently shown to exhibit moderate intergenerational continuity (1–3). While much research has examined genetic and social influences on addiction, less attention has been paid to clients’ and lay persons’ perceptions of genetic influences on the heritability of SUD (4) and implications for treatment. Methods For this qualitative study, twenty-six structured Working Model of the Child Interviews (WMCI) were conducted with mothers receiving inpatient SUD treatment. These interviews were thematically analyzed for themes related to maternal perceptions around intergenerational transmission of substance use behaviours. Results Findings show that over half of the mothers in this sample were preoccupied with their children’s risk factors for addictions. Among this group, 29% spontaneously expressed concerns about their children’s genetic risk for addiction, 54% shared worries about their children’s propensity for addiction without mentioning the word gene or genetic. Additionally, 37% had challenges in even discussing their children’s future when prompted. These concerns mapped onto internal working models of attachment in unexpected ways, with parents who were coded with balanced working models being more likely to discuss intergenerational risk factors and parents with disengaged working models displaying difficulties in discussing their child’s future. Conclusion This research suggests that the dominant discourse around the brain-disease model of addictions, in its effort to reduce stigma and self-blame, may have unintended downstream consequences for parents’ mental models about their children’s risks for future addiction. Parents receiving SUD treatment, and the staff who deliver it, may benefit from psychoeducation about the intergenerational transmission of SUD as part of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Addiction medicine providers have a key role in HIV prevention amidst rising HIV incidence in persons who inject drugs (PWID). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are vastly underutilized in this population. Inpatient hospitalization represents a potential touchpoint for initiation of HIV prophylaxis, though little research explores the role of addiction providers. Here we describe rates of PrEP/PEP delivery to hospitalized PWID seen by an Addiction Consult Service (ACS) at an urban, essential hospital. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of hospitalized patients who were seen by the ACS from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 and had plausible injection drug use. We calculated the proportion of patients who received a new prescription for PrEP/PEP at discharge. We used descriptive statistics to characterize demographics, substance use, reason for admission, and indications for PrEP/PEP. Secondarily, we calculated the monthly proportion of all patients discharged from the hospital with PrEP/PEP who were seen by the ACS compared to those not seen by the ACS. Results The average monthly proportion of ACS consults with plausible injection drug use who received PrEP/PEP was 6.4%. This increased from 4.2% in 2020 to 7.5% in 2022. Those seen by the ACS who received PrEP/PEP had high rates of opioid use disorder (97.5%), stimulant use disorder (77.8%), and homelessness (58.1%); over half were admitted for an injection-related infection. The indications for PrEP/PEP were injection drug use only (70.6%), followed by combined injection and sexual risk (20.2%); 71.9% of prescriptions were for PrEP and 28.1% for PEP. Overall, the ACS was involved in 83.9% of hospital-wide discharges with PrEP/PEP prescriptions (n = 242). Conclusions PWID who were seen by the ACS received PrEP/PEP prescriptions at rates exceeding national averages. The ACS was also involved with the care of the majority of admitted patients who received PrEP/PEP at discharge. While PrEP/PEP use for PWID remains low, the inpatient ACS represents a key resource to improve uptake by leveraging the reachable moment of an inpatient hospitalization.",

This study aims to describe the policies related to substance use disorder treatment and identify challenges related to these policies in Iran since the beginning of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Methods This qualitative study utilized document analysis and interviews with policymakers and implementers. We reviewed a total of 22 documents related to substance use disorder treatment and harm reduction. The results from document analysis complemented and validated the interview data. The research population comprised policymakers and implementers, including individuals directly involved in formulating and implementing substance use disorder treatment policies. Purposive sampling was employed, with a snowball strategy utilized to maximize diversity. Data saturation was achieved after conducting 32 semi-structured interviews. Conventional content analysis was used for data analysis. Results In general, the policy landscape for substance use disorder treatment in the Islamic Republic of Iran can be divided into two periods: the “Moral Model” era (1979–1993) and the “Disease Model” era (1993–present). Challenges within the content of substance use disorder treatment policies in Iran encompass the lack of law revisions, existence of contradictions in laws and nature of disease, the absence of evidence-based policymaking, and an inadequate comprehensive perspective on the phenomenon of substance use disorder. Conclusions The presence of multiple authorities with different perspectives on substance use disorder and its treatment, coupled with the application of personal preferences in policymaking and the absence of evidence-based policymaking, have contributed to weaknesses in decision-making and policy formulation. The true philosophy of Disease Model appears not to have been fully grasped by health policymakers in Iran, as all Disease Model policies have been pursued with an emphasis on abstinence and quitting. Iran and other nations facing similar challenges should place more reliance on evidence-based approaches and shift away from the “Moral Model” paradigm to develop more effective substance use disorder treatment policies.",

Buprenorphine/Naloxone is a medication that has been shown to be highly effective for the treatment of OUD. However, the clinical management of patients on this medication is challenging as many patients discontinue treatment prematurely. We conducted a qualitative study focusing on experienced prescribers of buprenorphine to learn about what they believe are key challenges in prescribing this medication to patients with OUD and related strategies for improving treatment outcomes. Methods We conducted two rounds of interviews with 12 prescribers who were either trained as a primary care physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. These prescribers were recruited from an academically-based treatment program, a community health center, and a commercial substance use disorder treatment facility. Interview data were coded and analyzed in accordance with a grounded theory approach. Results Key findings and related recommendations emerged for patient monitoring, integration of behavioral health with prescribing, patient volume requirements, and use of telehealth. Conclusion The interviews generated a number of recommendations for improving patient outcomes from buprenorphine treatment. Some of these recommendations can be implemented quite readily whereas others entail more substantial resources and time commitments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background U.S. policy intervention to increase methadone treatment accommodations during COVID did not result in national adoption of the new patient-centered treatment practices. Staff-level interventions may facilitate adoption of these treatment practices, but this will depend upon knowledge about staff level characteristics and beliefs. Currently, the role of clinic staff characteristics, beliefs about patient-centeredness, and perceptions about the need for treatment practice change is unknown. This study explored the relationship between opioid treatment program staff characteristics, work roles and staff beliefs to identify opportunities for future staff-level treatment practice change interventions. Methods Staff of three Arizona opioid treatment programs were surveyed (n = 40) from April 11–22, 2023 using a hybrid online survey method. The 161 survey items required less than 30 min to complete. Pearson point biserial correlation coefficients assessed the covariation between staff beliefs, staff characteristics and staff work roles. Perception of the clinic as person-centered was a potential proxy indicator for staff awareness of discontinuity between the clinic’s person-centeredness and person-centered approaches to methadone treatment. Results Among staff, 47.5% reported lived substance use disorder experience and 27.5% reported lived opioid use disorder experience. Most staff (70%) held at least 1 prior clinic role at the current clinic and 5% had had more than 4 prior roles. Rotation was observed with roles that did not require licensure or degrees. Staff with lived experience with substance use disorder or opioid use disorder treatment reported having more prior roles at the clinic than those without such experience. Abstinence-oriented views were significantly associated with reporting vicarious (work related) trauma symptoms. Those who rated the clinic as significantly more person-centered were staff with lived substance use disorder experience who also held abstinence-oriented views, staff with trauma exposure, and staff with lived opioid use disorder treatment experience who held harm reduction beliefs. In contrast, staff without substance use disorder experience who held harm reduction beliefs perceived the clinic as less person-centered. Conclusions Staff beliefs, personal and work characteristics are likely factors in the recognition of need for clinic practice change. How these characteristics function in a clinic culture may also be influenced by clinic staffing patterns. A patient-to-provider pipeline with role cycling was observed and this staffing pattern may also influence shared beliefs of trauma-informed care or clinic person-centeredness. Vicarious trauma may also be an important factor. Larger studies should examine these relationships further to understand mechanisms associated with recognition of need for clinic practice change in order to inform staff-level interventions to increase opioid treatment program patient-centeredness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol use disorder (AUD) poses severe health risks, yet many affected individuals opt out of complete abstinence. Therefore, harm reduction strategies have become more prominent in treatment guidelines for AUD. Our two case reports illustrate how disulfiram, initially intended to enforce abstinence, was repurposed to support reduced drinking. Case Presentations A 41-year-old patient with a history of severe AUD successfully reduced his alcohol consumption to a low-risk level by leveraging the effects of the disulfiram-alcohol aversive reaction. Another patient, a 63-year-old woman with long histories of AUD and major depressive disorder, experienced fewer depressive episodes and hospitalizations with disulfiram therapy despite periodically intentional discontinuation of medication. Conclusion Individualized treatment strategies are critical in optimizing outcomes for patients with AUD. Continuous disulfiram therapy, despite its limitations in directly reducing alcohol intake, might offer a new avenue for harm reduction in exceptional cases even if alcohol consumption continues. The cases suggest that maintaining therapy, aiming at reduced drinking, can enhance the therapeutic alliance and help manage comorbid conditions. Regular medical monitoring is essential for safety and efficacy, warranting further study of possible long-term consequences and psychotropic effects of elevated acetaldehyde levels related to the disulfiram-alcohol interaction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hospitalizations involving opioid use disorder (OUD) are increasing. Addiction consultation services (ACS) initiate medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in hospital settings and arrange post-hospital follow-up for ongoing MOUD care. Engagement in MOUD following hospital discharge is hampered by challenges in timely access to MOUD. This protocol describes an open-label randomized comparative effectiveness trial comparing ACS treatment as usual (TAU) to a single injection of a 28-day formulation extended-release buprenorphine (XR-BUP) on MOUD engagement 34-days following hospital discharge. Methods Six U.S. hospitals with ACS capable of prescribing all MOUD (i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone) recruit and randomize hospitalized patients with OUD who have not been on MOUD in the fourteen days prior to hospitalization. TAU may consist of any MOUD other than XR-BUP. Participants randomized to XR-BUP may receive any MOUD throughout their hospital stay and receive a 28-day XR-BUP injection within 72-hours of anticipated hospital discharge. There is no intervention beyond hospital stay. Participants are followed 34-, 90-, and 180-days following hospital discharge. The primary outcome is engagement in any MOUD 34-days following hospital discharge, which we hypothesize will be greater in the XR-BUP group. Randomizing 342 participants (171 per arm) provides 90% power to detect difference in the primary outcome between groups with an odds ratio of 2.1. Safety, secondary, and exploratory outcomes include: adverse events, MOUD engagement on days 90 and 180, opioid positive urine drug tests, self-reported drug use, hospital readmissions and emergency department visits, use of non-opioid drugs, fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose, all-cause mortality, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Data are analyzed by intention-to-treat, with pre-planned per-protocol and other secondary analyses that examine gender as an effect modifier, differences between groups, and impact of missingness. Discussion Engagement in MOUD care following hospitalization in individuals with OUD is low. This randomized comparative effectiveness trial can inform hospital ACS in medication selection to improve MOUD engagement 34-days following hospital discharge. Trial registration NCT04345718.",

In the present study, we tested under what circumstances this generic MI conceptualization was supported. The study context was a Swiss clinical trial of brief MI for heavy drinking among non-treatment seeking young men (age 20). We conducted psycholinguistic coding of 174 sessions using the MI Skill Code (MISC 2.1, Miller et al. 2008) and derived the frequency of MICO and the strength of change talk (CTS) averaged over the session. CTS was examined as a mediator of the relationship between MICO and a drinking composite score (including drinking days per week, drinks per drinking day, and binge drinking frequency) measured 3 months after baseline, controlling for the baseline drinking composite score. Finally, we tested therapist gender and MI experience and client readiness to change and alcohol problems severity as moderators of this mediation model (see Hayes 2013). CTS significantly predicted outcome in the expected direction (i.e. higher strength related to less drinking), but MICO did not significantly predicted CTS. However, CTS mediated the relationship between MICO and drinking outcomes when therapists had more experience in MI and when clients had more severe alcohol problems (i.e. significant conditional indirect effects). Findings showed that the mechanism of change hypothesized by MI theory was operative in our brief MI model (mean=19, SD=5 minutes) with heavy drinking young men, but only under particular conditions. Our results suggest that particular attention should be paid to therapist selection and/or training and supervision until they reach a certain level of competence, and that MI might not be appropriate for non-treatment seeking clients drinking at lower level of risk.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Buprenorphine is a critically important treatment for addressing the opioid epidemic, but there are virtually no studies of physicians’ job satisfaction with providing buprenorphine. Physicians’ job satisfaction has been linked to burnout and turnover as well as patients’ adherence to treatment recommendations, so it is important to understand how physicians’ satisfaction with providing buprenorphine treatment compares to their overall job satisfaction. Methods As part of a cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) focused on expanding access to medication for opioid use disorder, 55 physicians working in 38 organizations in Florida, Ohio, and Wisconsin completed a baseline web-based survey. Study measures included global job satisfaction, career satisfaction, and specialty satisfaction. Physicians who were waivered to prescribe buprenorphine were asked to rate their satisfaction with their current buprenorphine practice. Results Overall, physicians were generally satisfied with their jobs, their careers, and their specialties. When waivered physicians (n = 40) were compared to non-waivered physicians (n = 15) on 13 satisfaction items, there were no statistically significant differences. Among waivered physicians, ratings for buprenorphine work were significantly lower than ratings for general medical practice for finding such work personally rewarding, being pleased with such work, and overall satisfaction. Conclusions Although waivered and non-waivered physicians both reported high global job satisfaction, these data suggest that some waivered physicians may view their buprenorphine work as somewhat less satisfying than their global medical practice. Given that job dissatisfaction is a risk factor for turnover and burnout, managers of treatment organizations should consider whether strategies may be able to mitigate some sources of lower satisfaction in the context of buprenorphine treatment.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background If Russia is to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 HIV targets, better approaches to engage, effectively treat, and retain patients in care are needed. This paper describes the protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of LINC-II, a strength-based case management program for HIV-positive people who inject drugs (PWID) to increase rates of HIV viral suppression, ART initiation, and opioid abstinence. Methods This RCT will enroll and randomize 240 participants, recruited from a narcology (addiction care) hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. Participants are randomized to the intervention or control arms. Those in the intervention arm receive: (1) strengths-based HIV case management supporting coordinated care; (2) rapid ART initiation; and (3) pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder. We will evaluate the intervention’s effectiveness compared to standard of care on the following outcomes: (1) undetectable HIV viral load at 12 months (primary); (2) initiation of ART within 28 days of randomization; (3) change in CD4 count from baseline to 12 months; (4) retention in HIV care (i.e., ≥ 1 visit to medical care in 2 consecutive 6 month periods); (5) undetectable HIV viral load at 6 months; and (6) past 30-day opioid abstinence (at 6 and at 12 months). Discussion This RCT will assess the LINC-II intervention in an urban Russian setting. If effective, it will offer a new approach for increasing the uptake of both HIV and opioid use disorder treatment and coordination of these modalities in standard Eastern European clinical settings.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background A lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate smoking cessation intervention programs exist among Chinese-Canadian communities. Smoking cessation programs that are provided in Canadian mainstream culture and language have shown limited effectiveness in altering smoking behaviours of smokers from these communities. Our study aimed to explore and compare smoking patterns, knowledge, beliefs, and risk perceptions of adult current smokers between Chinese- and English-speaking Canadians participating in a culturally and linguistically tailored smoking cessation program. Methods and Design A qualitative study embedded in an effectiveness study using an 8-month quasi-experimental design, was conducted to compare the effects of four one-on-one culturally and linguistically sensitive consultation sessions (intervention group) and three telephone follow-up assessments (control group). All participants were provided take-home educational materials (designed exclusively for this study), and completed study questionnaires at baseline and 6-month post-intervention. An 8-month post-intervention phone assessment was conducted with all participants to assess cessation progress and maintenance. Participants 70 Chinese- and English-speaking adult (aged 19-80) current smokers (≥ 5 cigarettes per day) residing in the Greater Vancouver Area, Canada, were recruited between May 2018 and April 2019. Data analysis Thematic analysis was conducted on self-reported qualitative information from study questionnaires and verbatim transcripts of in-person consultations and telephone follow-ups. Cultural- and demographic-related themes were considered. Results Perceptions of smoking patterns, smoking status, triggers, and barriers to smoking cessation were identified. Important elements of smoking cessation program, including facilitator characteristics, duration, procedures, cultural factors, and topics were also identified. Differences in perceptions of smoking were observed between gender and language groups. Stress was a major trigger for smoking in both language groups. An individual’s social network was reported as the largest barrier to successful cessation for Chinese-speaking participants. Conclusions Our study provides knowledge and information to further examine the role of risk perception (realization of the possible harms of smoking) in smoking cessation to facilitate the development of future interventions that could more effectively promote smoking cessation among new immigrants and within ethnocultural communities. We found that our program was generally accepted by smokers in both language groups and the participants reported that they were able to apply the strategies learned in the intervention during their quit smoking plan.",

Although challenges to clinical translation remain, stakeholders already face decisions about evidentiary thresholds for the uptake of pharmacogenetic tests in practice. There is optimism about potential pharmacogenetic applications for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, with particular interest in the OPRM1 A118G polymorphism as a moderator of naltrexone response. Findings from human and animal studies suggest preliminary evidence for the clinical validity of this association; on this basis, arguments for clinical implementation can be made in accordance with existing frameworks for the uptake of genomic applications. However, generating evidence-based guidelines requires evaluating the clinical utility of pharmacogenetic tests. This goal will remain challenging, largely due to minimal data to inform clinical utility estimates. The pace of genomic discovery highlights the need for clinical utility and implementation research to inform future translation efforts. Near-term implementation of promising pharmacogenetic tests can help expedite this goal, generating an evidence base to enable efficient translation as additional gene-drug associations are discovered.",

Methadone clinic-based, directly observed therapy (DOT) programs for HIV and tuberculosis improve adherence and clinical outcomes, but have not been evaluated for smoking cessation. We describe a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether a methadone clinic-based, directly observed varenicline therapy program increases adherence and tobacco abstinence among opioid-dependent drug users receiving methadone treatment. We plan to enroll 100 methadone-maintained smokers and randomize them to directly observed varenicline dispensed with daily methadone doses or treatment as usual (self-administered varenicline) for 12 weeks. Our outcome measures are: 1) pill count adherence and 2) carbon monoxide-verified tobacco abstinence. We will assess differences in adherence and abstinence between the two treatment arms using repeated measures models. This trial will allow for rigorous evaluation of the efficacy of methadone clinic-based, directly observed varenicline for improving adherence and smoking cessation outcomes. This detailed description of trial methodology can serve as a template for the development of future DOT programs and can guide protocols for studies among opioid-dependent smokers receiving methadone treatment. clinicaltrials.gov NCT01378858",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background To address the US opioid epidemic, there is an urgent clinical need to provide persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) with effective medication treatments for OUD (MOUD). Formulations of sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone (SL-BUP/NLX) are considered the standard of care for OUD including within the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). However, poor retention on MOUD undermines its effectiveness. Long-acting injectable monthly buprenorphine (INJ-BUP) (e.g., Sublocade®) has the potential to improve retention and therefore reduce opioid use and overdose. Designing and conducting studies for OUD pose unique challenges. The strategies and solutions to some of these considerations in designing Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) 2014, Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder in Veterans (VA - BRAVE), a randomized, 20-site, clinical effectiveness trial comparing INJ-BUP to SL-BUP/NLX conducted within the VHA may provide valuable guidance for others confronted with similar investigation challenges. Methods This 52-week, parallel group, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the comparative effectiveness of two current FDA-approved formulations of buprenorphine: (1) daily SL-BUP/NLX vs. (2) monthly (28-day) INJ-BUP for Veterans with moderate to severe OUD (n = 952) . The primary outcomes are (1) retention in MOUD and (2) opioid abstinence. Secondary outcomes include measures of other drug use, psychiatric symptoms, medical outcomes including prevalence rates of HIV, hepatitis B and C as well as social outcomes (housing instability, criminal justice involvement), service utilization and cost-effectiveness. Special considerations in conducting a comparative effectiveness trial with this population and during COVID-19 pandemic were also included. Discussion The evaluation of the extended-release formulation of buprenorphine compared to the standard sublingual formulation in real-world VHA settings is of paramount importance in addressing the opioid epidemic. The extent to which this new treatment facilitates retention, decreases opioid use, and prevents severe sequelae of OUD has not been studied in any long-term trial to date. Positive findings in this trial could lead to widespread adoption of MOUD, and, if proven superior INJ-BUP, by clinicians throughout the VHA and beyond. This treatment has the potential to reduce opioid use among Veterans, improve medical, psychological, and social outcomes, and save lives at justifiable cost.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Substance use disorders, depression and anxiety disproportionately affect people with HIV (PWH) and lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Routine screening can help address these problems but is underutilized. This study sought to describe patient and provider perspectives on the acceptability and usefulness of systematic electronic, self-administered screening for tobacco, alcohol, other substance use, and mental health symptoms among patients in HIV primary care. Methods Screening used validated instruments delivered pre-appointment by both secure messaging and clinic-based tablets, with results integrated into the electronic health record (EHR). Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 9 HIV primary care providers and 12 patients in the 3 largest HIV primary care clinics in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health system who participated in a clinical trial evaluating computerized screening and behavioral interventions was conducted. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. A thematic approach was utilized for coding and analysis of interview data using a combination of deductive and inductive methods. Results Four key themes were identified: (1) perceived clinical benefit of systematic, electronic screening and EHR integration for providers and patients; (2) usefulness of having multiple methods of questionnaire completion; (3) importance of the patient–provider relationship to facilitate completion and accurate reporting; and (4) barriers, include privacy and confidentiality concerns about reporting sensitive information, particularly about substance use, and potential burden from repeated screenings. Conclusions Findings suggest that electronic, self-administered substance use and mental health screening is acceptable to patients and may have clinical utility to providers. While offering different methods of screening completion can capture a wider range of patients, a strong patient–provider relationship is a key factor in overcoming barriers and ensuring accurate patient responses. Further investigation into facilitators, barriers, and utility of electronic screening for PWH and other high-priority patient populations is indicated.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid use disorders (OUD), co-occurring with either depression and/or PTSD, are prevalent, burdensome, and often receive little or low-quality care. Collaborative care is a service delivery intervention that uses a team-based model to improve treatment access, quality, and outcomes in primary care patients, but has not been evaluated for co-occurring OUD and mental health disorders. To address this treatment and quality gap, we adapted collaborative care for co-occurring OUD and mental health disorders. Methods Our adapted model is called Collaboration Leading to Addiction Treatment and Recovery from Other Stresses (CLARO). We used the five-step Map of Adaptation Process (McKleroy in AIDS Educ Prev 18:59–73, 2006) to develop the model. For each step, our stakeholder team of research and clinical experts, primary care partners, and patients provided input into adaptation processes (e.g., adaptation team meetings, clinic partner feedback, patient interviews and beta-testing). To document each adaptation and our decision-making process, we used the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Enhanced (Wiltsey Stirman in Implement Sci 14:1–10, 2019). Results We documented 12 planned fidelity-consistent adaptations to collaborative care, including a mix of content, context, and training/evaluation modifications intended to improve fit with the patient population (co-occurring disorders) or the New Mexico setting (low-resource clinics in health professional shortage areas). Examples of documented adaptations include use of community health workers as care coordinators; an expanded consultant team to support task-shifting to community health workers; modified training protocols for Problem-Solving Therapy and Written Exposure Therapy to incorporate examples of treating patients for depression or PTSD with co-occurring OUD; and having care coordinators screen for patients’ social needs. Conclusions We completed the first three steps of the Map of Adaptation Process, resulting in a variety of adaptations that we believe will make collaborative care more acceptable and feasible in treating co-occurring OUD and mental health disorders. Future steps include evaluating the effectiveness of CLARO and documenting reactive and/or planned adaptations to the model that occur during its implementation and delivery.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUDs), including methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone, decrease mortality and morbidity for people with opioid use disorder (OUD). Buprenorphine and methadone have the strongest evidence base among MOUDs. Unlike methadone, buprenorphine may be prescribed in office-based settings in the U.S., including by nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) who have a federal waiver and adhere to federal patient limits. Buprenorphine is underutilized nationally, particularly in rural areas, and NPs/PAs could help address this gap. Therefore, we sought to identify perceptions of buprenorphine efficacy and perceptions of prescribing barriers among NPs/PAs. We also sought to compare perceived buprenorphine efficacy and perceived prescribing barriers between waivered and non-waivered NPs/PAs, as well as to compare perceived buprenorphine efficacy to perceived naltrexone and methadone efficacy. Methods We disseminated an online survey to a random national sample of NPs/PAs. We used Mann–Whitney U tests to compare between waivered and non-waivered respondents. We used non-parametric Friedman tests and post-hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare perceptions of medication types. Results 240 respondents participated (6.5% response rate). Most respondents agreed buprenorphine is efficacious and believed counseling and peer support should complement buprenorphine. Buprenorphine was generally perceived as more efficacious than both naltrexone and methadone. Perceived buprenorphine efficacy and prescribing barriers differed by waiver status. Non-waivered practitioners were more likely than waivered practitioners to have concerns about buprenorphine affecting patient mix. Among waivered NPs/PAs, key buprenorphine prescribing barriers were insurance prior authorization and detoxification access. Conclusions Our results suggest that different policies should target perceived barriers affecting waivered versus non-waivered NPs/PAs. Concerns about patient mix suggest stigmatization of patients with OUD. NP/PA education is needed about comparative medication efficaciousness, particularly regarding methadone. Even though many buprenorphine treatment patients benefits from counseling and/or peer support groups, NPs/PAs should be informed that such psychosocial treatment methods are not necessary for all buprenorphine patients.",

Some mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing PTSD and SUD symptoms. Mindfulness practice is a core component of MBIs, thought to elicit and maintain positive behavioral change; however, no research to our knowledge has assessed the role of mindfulness practice on sustained treatment gains among women with co-occurring PTSD-SUD. Such research is necessary to better inform MBIs for dually diagnosed women. Methods This secondary analysis assessed whether post-intervention formal and informal mindfulness practice predicted reductions in PTSD symptoms and substance craving 6 months following an 8-session mindfulness-based relapse prevention intervention for women diagnosed with co-occurring PTSD-SUD ( N = 23). Data were derived from a pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a trauma-integrated mindfulness-based relapse prevention program for women with co-occurring PTSD-SUD.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Substance use among youth is a longstanding global health concern that has dramatically risen in the era of highly toxic and unregulated drugs, including opioids. It is crucial to ensure that youth using unregulated opioids have access to evidence-based interventions, and yet, youth encounter critical gaps in the quality of such interventions. This study aims to address these gaps by identifying opportunities to improve the quality of opioid use services from the perspective of service providers, a perspective that has received scant attention. Methods This community-based participatory study was conducted in four communities in British Columbia (Canada), a province that declared a public health overdose emergency in 2016. Human-centered co-design workshops were held to understand service providers’ (n = 41) experiences, needs, and ideas for improving the quality of youth opioid use services/treatments in their community. Multi-site qualitative analysis was used to develop overarching experiences and needs themes that were further contextualized in each local community. A blended deductive and inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the ideas data. Results Three overarching themes were identified, reflecting service providers’ goals to respond to youth in a timely and developmentally appropriate manner. However, this was significantly limited by organizational and systems-level barriers, revealing service providers’ priorities for intra- and inter-organizational support and collaboration and systems-level innovation. Across communities, service providers identified 209 individual ideas to address these prioritized needs and improve the quality of youth opioid use services/treatments. Conclusion These themes demonstrate a multi-level tension between macro-level systems and the meso-level organization of youth opioid use services, which undermine the quality of individual-level care service providers can deliver. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated multi-level response, such as developing youth-specific standards (macro-level), increasing inter-organizational activities and collaboration (meso-level), and creating programs that are specific to youths’ needs (micro-level).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Identifying patients in primary care services with opioid use disorder and co-occurring mental health disorders is critical to providing treatment. Objectives of this study were to (1) assess the feasibility of recruiting people to screen in-person for opioid use disorder and co-occurring mental health disorders (depression and/or post-traumatic stress disorder) in primary care clinic waiting rooms in preparation for a randomized controlled trial, and (2) compare results of detecting these disorders by universal in-person screening compared to electronic health record (EHR) diagnoses. Methods This cross-sectional feasibility and pilot study recruited participants from four primary care clinics, two rural and two urban, from three health care organizations in New Mexico. Inclusion criteria were adults (≥ 18 years), attending one of the four clinics as a patient, and who spoke English or Spanish. Exclusion criteria were people attending the clinic for a non-primary care visit (e.g., dental, prescription pick up, social support). The main outcomes and measures were (1) recruitment feasibility which was assessed by frequencies and proportions of people approached and consented for in-person screening, and (2) relative differences of detecting opioid use disorder and co-occurring mental health disorders in waiting rooms relative to aggregate EHR data from each clinic, measured by prevalence and prevalence ratios. Results Over two-weeks, 1478 potential participants were approached and 1145 were consented and screened (77.5% of patients approached). Probable opioid use disorder and co-occurring mental health disorders were identified in 2.4% of those screened compared to 0.8% in EHR. Similarly, universal screening relative to EHR identified higher proportions of probable opioid use disorder (4.5% vs. 3.4%), depression (17.5% vs. 12.7%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (19.0% vs. 3.6%). Conclusions Universal screening for opioid use disorder, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder was feasible, and identified three times as many patients with these co-occurring disorders compared to EHR. Higher proportions of each condition were also identified, especially post-traumatic stress disorder. Results support that there are likely gaps in identification of these disorders in primary care services and demonstrate the need to better address the persistent public health problem of these co-occurring disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Approximately 400,000 people who smoke cigarettes survive Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS; unstable angina, ST and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction) each year in the US. Continued smoking following ACS is an independent predictor of mortality. Depressed mood post-ACS is also predictive of mortality, and smokers with depressed mood are less likely to abstain from smoking following an ACS. A single, integrated treatment targeting depressed mood and smoking could be effective in reducing post-ACS mortality. Method/design The overall aim of the current study is to conduct a fully powered efficacy trial enrolling 324 smokers with ACS and randomizing them to 12 weeks of an integrated smoking cessation and mood management treatment [Behavioral Activation Treatment for Cardiac Smokers (BAT-CS)] or control (smoking cessation and general health education). Both groups will be offered 8 weeks of the nicotine patch if medically cleared. Counseling in both arms will be provided by tobacco treatment specialists. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at end-of-treatment (12-weeks) and 6, 9, and 12 months after hospital discharge. We will track major adverse cardiac events and all-cause mortality for 36 months post-discharge. Primary outcomes are depressed mood and biochemically validated 7-day point prevalence abstinence from smoking over 12 months. Discussion Results of this study will inform smoking cessation treatments post-ACS and provide unique data on the impact of depressed mood on success of post-ACS health behavior change attempts.

We sought to describe non-opioid overdose hospitalizations with documented OUD and examine receipt of post-discharge outpatient buprenorphine.We examined acute care hospitalizations with an OUD diagnosis in any position within US commercially-insured adults age 18-64 years (IBM MarketScan claims, 2013-2017), excluding opioid overdose diagnoses. We included individuals with ≥ 6 months of continuous enrollment prior to the index hospitalization and ≥ 10 days following discharge. We described demographic and hospitalization characteristics, including outpatient buprenorphine receipt within 10 days of discharge.Most (87%) hospitalizations with documented OUD did not include opioid overdose. Of 56,717 hospitalizations (49,959 individuals), 56.8% had a primary diagnosis other than OUD, 37.0% had documentation of an alcohol-related diagnosis code, and 5.8% end in a self-directed discharge. Where opioid use disorder was not the primary diagnosis, 36.5% were due to other substance use disorders, and 23.1% were due to psychiatric disorders. Of all non-overdose hospitalizations who had prescription medication insurance coverage and who were discharged to an outpatient setting (n = 49, 237), 8.8% filled an outpatient buprenorphine prescription within 10 days of discharge.Non-overdose OUD hospitalizations often occur with substance use disorders and psychiatric disorders, and very few are followed by timely outpatient buprenorphine. Addressing the OUD treatment gap during hospitalization may include implementing medication for OUD for inpatients with a broad range of diagnoses.",

However, they are rarely integrated into outpatient treatment programs, resulting in a missed opportunity for peer-to-peer learning, and increased connection to others social networks where people want to reduce or cease substance use. Method In this mixed-methods study, we examined the uptake, participant experiences and impacts of Self-Management and Recovery Training (SMART) when embedded in three public AOD treatment programs in a pilot program in Australia. Groups were delivered initially in-person but transitioned online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 75 SMART Recovery groups were run by the pilot sites, with an average attendance of 6.5 people per meeting. Among Participants ( N = 31) who completed the survey, 94% reported benefits relating to substance use (i.e., reduction/ successful maintenance of abstinence), 71% reported improvements in their mental health and wellbeing, 74% reported improvements in their physical health, and 81% reported feeling better connected with others. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 10 participants to explore their experiences. Thematic analysis revealed four themes: motivation to attend, active ingredients, views on the integration of SMART into formal AOD, and the advantages and disadvantages of online groups. Conclusion Taken together, these findings suggest embedding SMART Recovery in AOD treatment is a worthwhile endeavour. This was indicated by a good uptake and evidence of multiple and unique benefits to participants over and above their usual care, notably, better management of their AOD use, health, wellbeing, and sense of connection with others.",

Their use has been steadily increasing in recent years. The detoxification process is complex and prone to high rates of complications while little is known about the pathophysiology. This study aims to elucidate the characteristics of GHB-addicted patients and to evaluate the risks and complications of GHB withdrawal treatment. Methods This observational study describes prospectively the socioeconomic status, clinical history and course of inpatient detoxification treatment of a group of 39 patients suffering from GHB substance use disorder. Detoxification treatment took place in a highly specialized psychiatric inpatient unit for substance use disorders. Results GHB patients were characterised by being young, well-educated and by living alone. More than 50% of the patients had no regular income. The patients were male and female in equal numbers. Detoxification treatment was complicated, with high rates of delirium (30.8%) and high need for intensive care (20.5%). Conclusions In our sample, GHB users were young, well-educated people and male and female in equal number. Detoxification proved to be dangerous for GHB-addicted patients. The presence of delirium and the need for transfer to an intensive care unit during detoxification treatment was extraordinarily high, even with appropriate clinical treatment. The reasons for this remain unknown. Therefore an intensive care unit should be available for GHB detoxification treatment. Further studies are needed to evaluate the options for prophylactic treatment of delirium during detoxification.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Preventing progression to moderate or severe opioid use disorder (OUD) among people who exhibit risky opioid use behavior that does not meet criteria for treatment with opioid agonists or antagonists (subthreshold OUD) is poorly understood. The Subthreshold Opioid Use Disorder Prevention (STOP) Trial is designed to study the efficacy of a collaborative care intervention to reduce risky opioid use and to prevent progression to moderate or severe OUD in adult primary care patients with subthreshold OUD. Methods The STOP trial is a cluster randomized controlled trial, randomized at the PCP level, conducted in 5 distinct geographic sites. STOP tests the efficacy of the STOP intervention in comparison to enhanced usual care (EUC) in adult primary care patients with risky opioid use that does not meet criteria for moderate-severe OUD. The STOP intervention consists of (1) a practice-embedded nurse care manager (NCM) who provides patient participant education and supports primary care providers (PCPs) in engaging and monitoring patient-participants; (2) brief advice, delivered to patient participants by their PCP and/or prerecorded video message, about health risks of opioid misuse; and (3) up to 6 sessions of telephone health coaching to motivate and support behavior change. EUC consists of primary care treatment as usual, plus printed overdose prevention educational materials and an educational video on cancer screening. The primary outcome measure is self-reported number of days of risky (illicit or nonmedical) opioid use over 180 days, assessed monthly via text message using items from the Addiction Severity Index and the Current Opioid Misuse Measure. Secondary outcomes assess other substance use, mental health, quality of life, and healthcare utilization as well as PCP prescribing and monitoring behaviors. A mixed effects negative binomial model with a log link will be fit to estimate the difference in means between treatment and control groups using an intent-to-treat population. Discussion Given a growing interest in interventions for the management of patients with risky opioid use, and the need for primary care-based interventions, this study potentially offers a blueprint for a feasible and effective approach to improving outcomes in this population.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT) has proven to be a safe and effective treatment option for severe opioid use disorder (OUD). Yet, iOAT is often isolated from other health and social services. To align with a person-centered care approach, iOAT can be embedded in sites that combine systems and services that have been historically fragmented and that address multiple comorbidities (integrated care sites). The present study investigates the addition of iOAT at an integrated care in Vancouver, British Columbia. We aimed to capture what it means for service users and service providers to incorporate iOAT in an integrated care site and describe the processes by which the site keeps people engaged. Methods We conducted 22 interviews with 15 service users and 14 interviews with 13 service providers across two rounds of individual semi-structured interviews (Fall 2021, Summer 2022). The second interview round was precipitated by a service interruption in medication dispensation. Interview audio was recorded, transcribed, and then analysed in NVivo 1.6 following an interpretive description approach. Results The emergent themes from the analysis are represented in two categories: (1) a holistic approach (client autonomy, de-medicalized care, supportive staff relationships, multiple opportunities for engagement, barriers to iOAT integration) and (2) a sense of place (physical location, social connection and community belonging, food). Conclusion Incorporating iOAT at an integrated care site revealed how iOAT delivery can be strengthened through its direct connection to a diverse, comprehensive network of health and social services that are provided in a community atmosphere with high quality therapeutic relationships.",

The study included qualitative interviews with providers and patients and examined rates of screening, brief intervention and referral as implementation outcomes. On average, interventions were longer in duration in the non-physician arm, but barriers in this model included a complex ‘handoff”, the need for patients to often have a separate visit for the intervention, and patient resistance. Barriers salient for physician delivery included a region-wide primary care access initiative and new competing priorities due to health care reform. Inclusion of the screener in the EMR, opinion leaders, a physician testimonial linking alcohol use to performance measures for other chronic conditions, and compatibility with other practices were facilitators.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of bupropion-induced mood shift when used specifically for nicotine cessation in a nonbipolar patient. This case highlights the need for clinicians who prescribe bupropion for smoking cessation to perform regular and systematic mood follow-ups during treatment. These follow-ups could even be more important when bupropion is selected to quit smoking in a patient already taking an antidepressant.",

This study examined the association between AUDIT-C scores and two-year risk of any type of trauma among US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients and assessed whether risk varied by age or gender. Outpatients (215, 924 male and 9168 female) who returned mailed AUDIT-C questionnaires were followed for 24 months in the medical record for any International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9) code related to trauma. The two-year prevalence of trauma was examined as a function of AUDIT-C scores, with low-level drinking (AUDIT-C 1–4) as the reference group. Men and women were examined separately, and age-stratified analyses were performed. Having an AUDIT-C score of 9–12 (indicating severe alcohol misuse) was associated with increased risk for trauma. Mean (SD) ages for men and women were 68.2 (11.5) and 57.2 (15.8), respectively. Age-stratified analyses showed that, for men ≤50 years, those with AUDIT-C scores ≥9 had an increased risk for trauma compared with those with AUDIT-C scores in the 1–4 range (adjusted prevalence, 25.7% versus 20.8%, respectively; OR = 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.50). For men ≥65 years with average comorbidity and education, those with AUDIT-C scores of 5–8 (adjusted prevalence, 7.9% versus 7.4%; OR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02–1.31) and 9–12 (adjusted prevalence 11.1% versus 7.4%; OR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.30–2.17) were at significantly increased risk for trauma compared with men ≥65 years in the reference group. Higher AUDIT-C scores were not associated with increased risk of trauma among women. Men with severe alcohol misuse (AUDIT-C 9–12) demonstrate an increased risk of trauma. Men ≥65 showed an increased risk for trauma at all levels of alcohol misuse (AUDIT-C 5–8 and 9–12). These findings may be used as part of an evidence-based brief intervention for alcohol use disorders. More research is needed to understand the relationship between AUDIT-C scores and risk of trauma in women.",

Sexually active adults are less likely to use condoms in relationships with main partners than with non-regular partners, despite general knowledge that condom use reduces HIV transmission. The purpose of this secondary qualitative analysis was to explore and contextualize perceptions of main partnerships, HIV risk, and attitudes toward condom use within main partner relationships among a subsample of intervention-arm cocaine- and/or heroin-using patients enrolled in a negative trial of brief motivational intervention to reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted disease and unsafe sexual behaviors. The open-ended portion of these interview audiotapes consisted of questions about perceptions of risk and attitudes about condom use with main partners. Enrollees were aged 18-54, English or Spanish speaking, and included in this analysis only if they reported having a main partner. We identified codes and elaborated important themes through a standard inductive three step coding process, using HyperRESEARCH™ software. Among 48 interviewees, 65% were male, half were non-Hispanic white, over 60% were 20-39 years of age, 58% had intravenous drug use (IDU), and 8% were HIV-positive. Participants defined respect, support, trust, and shared child-rearing responsibility as the most valued components of main partner relationships. Condom use was viewed occasionally as a positive means of showing respect with main partners but more often as a sign of disrespect and a barrier to intimacy and affection. Enrollees appraised their partners' HIV risk in terms of perceptions of physical health, cleanliness, and sexual and HIV testing history. They based decisions regarding condom use mainly on perceived faithfulness, length of involvement, availability of condoms, and pregnancy desirability. Risk appraisal was commonly based on appearance and subjective factors, and condom use with main sexual partners was described most often as a demonstration of lack of trust and intimacy.

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with the highest all-cause mortality rates of all mental disorders. The majority of patients with AUDs never receive inpatient treatment for their AUD, and there is lack of data about their mortality risks despite their constituting the majority of those affected. Absenteeism from work (sick leave) due to an AUD likely signals worsening. In this study, we assessed whether AUD-related sick leave was associated with mortality in a cohort of workers in Germany.128,001 workers with health insurance were followed for a mean of 6.4 years. We examined the associations between 1) AUD-related sick leave managed on an outpatient basis and 2) AUD-related psychiatric inpatient treatment, and mortality using survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard regression models (separately by sex) adjusted for age, education, and job code classification. We also stratified analyses by sick leave related to three groups of alcohol-related conditions (all determined by International Classification of Diseases 9th ed. (ICD-9) codes): alcohol abuse and dependence; alcohol-induced mental disorder; and alcohol-induced medical conditions.Outpatient-managed AUD-related sick leave was significantly associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 2.90 (95% Confidence interval (CI) 2.24-3.75) for men, HR 5.83 (CI 2.90-11.75) for women). The magnitude of the association was similar for receipt of AUD-related psychiatric inpatient treatment (HR 3.2 (CI 2.76-3.78) for men, HR 6.5 (CI 4.41-9.47) for women). Compared to those without the conditions, higher mortality was observed consistently for outpatients and inpatients across the three groups of alcohol-related conditions. Those with alcohol-related medical conditions who had AUD-related psychiatric inpatient treatment appeared to have the highest mortality.Alcohol use disorder-related sick leave as documented in health insurance records is associated with higher mortality. Such sick leave does not necessarily lead to any specific AUD treatment. Therefore, AUD-related sick leave might be used as a trigger for insurers to intervene by offering AUD treatment to patients to try to reduce their risk of death.",

Data on drinking motives can be used for research, in the planning of prevention strategies and for treatment purposes. The Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised (DMQ-R) has become the most used measure of drinking motives. So far, the questionnaire has not been investigated with qualitative methods. The aim of this study was to investigate acceptability, accuracy and usability of the DMQ-R among persons receiving outpatient psychiatric care by studying how responders perceive and interpret the questionnaire.A cognitive interviewing technique, the think-aloud method, was used to collect data from 16 non-alcohol dependent patients seeking outpatient psychiatric care (12 women, 4 men). To analyse data, Qualitative Content Analysis was applied in which themes were formed from data only and not from predetermined areas of interest.Overall, acceptability of the DMQ-R was high although answers were sometimes given with low accuracy. Responders pointed out that they perceived the questionnaire as non-confrontational and exhaustive. Further, the DMQ-R seemed to launch processes of self-reflection.Taken together, the results suggest a support for the use of DMQ-R also in the group of psychiatric outpatients. Still, when interpreting the DMQ-R, a certain insecurity of the exactness of answers should be considered. The graphic design should be particularly clear in this group of patients.",

    "abstract": "Drug overdose deaths involving opioids have surged in recent years and the economic cost of the opioid epidemic is estimated to be over $500 billion annually. In the midst of calls for declaring a national emergency, health policy decision makers are considering the best ways to allocate resources to curb the epidemic. On June 9, 2017, 116 invited health researchers, clinicians, policymakers, health system leaders, and other stakeholders met at the University of Pennsylvania to discuss approaches to address the gaps in evidence-based substance use disorder policy and practice, with an emphasis on the opioid epidemic. The conference was sponsored by the Center for Health Economics of Treatment Interventions for Substance Use Disorder, HCV, and HIV (CHERISH), a NIDA-funded National Center of Excellence, and hosted by the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics of the University of Pennsylvania. The conference aims were to: (1) foster new relationships between researchers and policymakers through a collaborative work process and (2) generate evidence-based policy recommendations to address the opioid epidemic. The conference concluded with an interactive work session during which attendees self-identified as researchers or policymakers and were divided equally among 13 tables. These groups met to develop and present policy recommendations based on an opioid use disorder case study. Thirteen policy recommendations emerged across four themes: (1) quality of treatment, (2) continuity of care, (3) opioid prescribing and pain management, and (4) consumer engagement. This conference serves as a proposed model to develop equitable, working relationships among researchers, clinicians, and policymakers.",

    "abstract": "Background: Addressing alcohol harm in prisons can potentially reduce the risk of re-offending, and costs to society, whilst tackling health inequalities.Health savings of £4.3 m and crime savings of £100 m per year can be a result of appropriate alcohol interventions.Prison therefore offers an opportunity for the identification, response and/or referral to treatment for those male remand prisoners who are consuming alcohol above recommended levels.There is however, limited evidence for the effectiveness, optimum timing of delivery, recommended length, content, implementation and economic benefit of Alcohol Brief Interventions (ABI) in the prison setting for male remand prisoners.As part of the PRISM-A study, we aimed to explore the 'elements' of an acceptable ABI for delivery, experiences of engagement with services/health professionals about alcohol use, alongside barriers and facilitators to implementation within the prison setting for male remand prisoners.Materials and methods: Twenty-four in-depth interviews were conducted with adult male remand prisoners at one Scottish prison (n = 12) and one English prison (n = 12).A focus group at each of the prison sites was held with key stakeholders (e.g.prison nurses, prison officers, voluntary alcohol/addiction services, health service managers and commissioners).Thematic analysis techniques utilizing NViVo 10 were employed.Results: A thematic content analysis of the interviews consistently highlighted that the majority of prisoners reflected about the connection between alcohol consumption and criminal offending, particularly in relation to offenses involving physical assaults.They also expressed motivation to change their alcohol consumption.Both prisoner interviews and focus groups with stakeholders (N = 2), indicated the value of continuous follow-up support outside of the prison system and also the need to address the lack of stable social environments, which is often associated with alcohol and drug consumption.Stakeholders further identified organizational barriers to the delivery of ABI, such as limited funding and manageable workloads. Conclusions:The importance of interpersonal trust indicated that intervention delivery by external organizations and nurses were favored in comparison to intervention delivery by prison staff and peer-prisoners.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hookah smoking is an emerging global health issue, especially in Eastern Mediterranean region; and accordingly, women are at the center of this issue as they have a more positive attitude towards hookah smoking. Also, the rate of hookah smoking is increasing at a faster rate among women compared to men. The aim of the present study will be systematically designing and implementing an educational intervention program for hookah smoking cessation among 15 years old women and older in the Iranian southern city of Bandar Abbas. Methods We will use intervention mapping methodology for designing the study. Due to the breadth of factors affecting hookah smoking and the complexity of hookah cessation, we will initially conceptualize hookah smoking cessation program as a set of purposeful activities designed to stop the hookah smoking. In the first step (need assessment), the environmental and behavioral factors related to hookah smoking/cessation and the determinants of these factors will be determined by systematic review and local qualitative study. Then, based on the results of the first step, the behavioral and environmental goals of hookah smoking cessation will be identified. In the second step, the practical goals will be determined for each of the behavioral and environmental outcomes; and then, the logic and matrix of change objectives will be designed using the determinants extracted from the previous step. The products of the second step will be the intervention goals. In the third step, theoretical and practical methods affecting each of the intervention goals will be identified. In the fourth step, contents of educational program for hookah cessation will be produced. The fifth step will be about planning to implement the program. In the sixth step, the effectiveness of designed program will be evaluated in a quasi-experimental intervention. Discussion Appropriate development and successful implementation of a hookah cessation intervention requires a systematic and theory-based approach. We believe that using Intervention Mapping (IM) as the guiding methodology will make it possible to address complexities of developing an intervention program. Also, reflections on the quasi-experimental research and describing the context and executed methods of implementation would contribute to the development of IM and the knowledge needed for the implementation of program.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Effective brief treatments for methamphetamine use disorders (MAUD) are urgently needed to complement longer more intensive treatments in low and middle income countries, including South Africa. To address this gap, the purpose of this randomised feasibility trial was to determine the feasibility of delivering a six-session blended imaginal desensitisation, plus motivational interviewing (IDMI) intervention for adults with a MAUD. Methods We enrolled 60 adults with a MAUD and randomly assigned them 1:1 to the IDMI intervention delivered by clinical psychologists and a control group who we referred to usual care. Feasibility measures, such as rates of recruitment, consent to participate in the trial and retention, were calculated. Follow-up interviews were conducted at 6 weeks and 3 months post-enrollment. Results Over 9 months, 278 potential particiants initiated contact. Following initial screening 78 (28%) met inclusion criteria, and 60 (77%) were randomised. Thirteen of the 30 participants assigned to the treatment group completed the intervention. Both psychologists were highly adherent to the intervention, obtaining a fidelity rating of 91%. In total, 39 (65%) participants completed the 6-week follow-up and 40 (67%) completed the 3-month follow-up. The intervention shows potential effectiveness in the intention-to-treat analysis where frequency of methamphetamine use was significantly lower in the treatment than in the control group at both the 6 week and 3-month endpoints. No adverse outcomes were reported. Conclusions This feasibility trial suggests that the locally adapted IDMI intervention is an acceptable and safe intervention as a brief treatment for MAUD in South Africa. Modifications to the study design should be considered in a fully powered, definitive controlled trial to assess this potentially effective intervention.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background For many reasons, the emergency department (ED) is a critical venue to initiate OUD interventions. The prevailing culture of the ED has been that substance use disorders are non-emergent conditions better addressed outside the ED where resources are less constrained. This study, its rapid funding mechanism, and accelerated timeline originated out of the urgent need to learn whether ED-initiated buprenorphine (BUP) with referral for treatment of OUD is generalizable, as well as to develop strategies to facilitate its adoption across a variety of ED settings and under real-world conditions. It both complements and uses methods adapted from Project ED Health (CTN-0069), a Hybrid Type 3 implementation-effectiveness study of using Implementation Facilitation (IF) to integrate ED-initiated BUP and referral programs. Methods ED-CONNECT (CTN 0079) was a three-site implementation study exploring the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of introducing ED-initiated BUP in rural and urban settings with high-need, limited resources, and different staffing structures. We used a multi-faceted approach to develop, introduce and iteratively refine site-specific ED clinical protocols and implementation plans for opioid use disorder (OUD) screening, ED-initiated BUP, and referral for treatment. We employed a participatory action research approach and use mixed methods incorporating data derived from abstraction of medical records and administrative data, assessments of recruited ED patient-participants, and both qualitative and quantitative inquiry involving staff from the ED and community, patients, and other stakeholders. Discussion This study was designed to provide the necessary, time-sensitive understanding of how to identify OUD and initiate treatment with BUP in the EDs previously not providing ED-initiated BUP, in communities in which this intervention is most needed: high need, low resource settings.

    "abstract": "Knowledge of medical conditions and their evidence-based medications varies among individuals. This range of knowledge may affect attitudes and influence medical decision-making of both patients and providers. Perceptions may be even more impactful in pregnancy, a timeframe subject to bias, and in diseases that include behavioral symptoms and often carry significant societal stigma, such as opioid use disorder (OUD). We present our findings from a survey assessing participants' knowledge of three distinct medical conditions (diabetes mellitus, bipolar disorder, and OUD) and how this knowledge affects perceptions of these disease states during pregnancy.Using existing surveys in the literature as a guideline, we designed a cross-sectional survey including multiple-choice questions to evaluate our hypothesis that less knowledge about a medical condition would result in more negative opinions towards that condition and its treatment throughout pregnancy. Participants responded to perception statements using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = \"strongly disagree,\" 5 = \"strongly agree\"). Surveys were administered to patients in prenatal care, patients in OUD treatment, medical students, and medical residents within a single institution. Response means were generated and compared using t tests and ANOVA.A total of 323 participants completed the survey. There were differences in knowledge between respondent groups and by disease state, with prenatal patients having the least knowledge of all groups about OUD diagnosis (88.5% of prenatal patients answered correctly) and its treatment (91.8% answered correctly). Overall Likert means of all responses demonstrated that participants agreed that new mothers with OUD (mean 4.27, 5 = \"strongly agree\") and their babies (4.12) would have challenges that others would not, compared to mothers with bipolar disorder (4.03) and their babies (3.60) as well as mothers with diabetes (3.87) and their babies (3.47), p < .001. Overall, respondents were likely to agree that women with OUD should not try to get pregnant (3.47), whereas they overall disagreed with that statement when it pertained to women with bipolar disorder (2.69, 2 = \"disagree\") or diabetes (2.12), p = 0.03.With this single-center study, we found that, though there were gaps in knowledge regarding disease and disease treatment during pregnancy, less knowledge was not associated with more negative perceptions of disease and disease treatment during pregnancy. Perceptions were especially negative toward pregnant women with OUD. Increasing awareness of lived experiences of patients with disease, as well as the biases carried by both patients and providers, could improve treatment of chronic diseases and outcomes for patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background High comorbidity exists between mental illness and substance use disorders (SUD). Patients in psychiatry living with problematic alcohol or drug consumption can experience a sense of exclusion, where seeking help for SUD can be perceived as stigmatizing. The aim of this study is to illuminate staff experiences of encountering patients with SUD within the psychiatric outpatient context. Methods The study was exploratory, with a qualitative design. Interviews with outpatient psychiatry managers and focus groups with clinical staff focused on the experience of encountering patients with SUD. Data were evaluated using content analysis inspired by phenomenological-hermeneutic methodology. Results Three themes were identified and each illuminated by two sub-themes. Bridging the organizational gap included sub-themes of having an established collaboration and facing difficulties in the collaboration; Having beliefs about the patient you encounter included sub-themes of working with patients who are exposed to prejudicial thoughts and expressing prejudicial thoughts about the patient. Striving to achieve a therapeutic alliance included sub-themes of having a feeling of developing together and supporting the patient towards recovery. Conclusion A life-world perspective, used to interpret results, indicated that caring for patients with SUD in psychiatry was perceived as difficult, where collaboration between psychiatry and addiction care was often experienced as problematic. Based on these findings, we believe that the current gap between the psychiatry and addiction care could be reduced to some extent by offering patients digital treatment for SUD. In this way, patients could remain under the care of their regular psychiatric clinic without having to physically visit SUD services. Thus, a virtual bridge could be established to bring psychiatry and addiction care closer to each other for the patients’ benefit.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is invested in expanding access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to save lives. Access varies across VHA facilities and, thus, requires implementation strategies to promote system-wide adoption of MOUD. We conducted a 12-month study employing external facilitation that targeted MOUD treatment among low-adopting VHA facilities. In this study, we sought to evaluate the patterns of perceived barriers over 1 year of external implementation facilitation using the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework. Methods We randomly selected eight VHA facilities from the bottom quartile of the proportion of Veterans with an OUD diagnosis receiving MOUD (&lt; 21%). The 1-year external implementation intervention included developmental evaluation to tailor the facilitation, an on-site visit, and monthly facilitation calls. Facilitators recorded detailed notes for each call on a structured template. Qualitative data was analyzed by coding and mapping barriers to the constructs in the i-PARIHS framework ( Innovation , Recipients , Context ). We identified emerging themes within each construct by month. Results Barriers related to the Innovation, such as provider perception of the need for MOUD in their setting, were minimal throughout the 12-month study. Barriers related to Recipients were predominant and fluctuated over time. Recipient barriers were common during the initial months when providers did not have the training and waivers necessary to prescribe MOUD. Once additional providers ( Recipients ) were trained and waivered to prescribe MOUD, Recipient barriers dropped and then resurfaced as the facilities worked to expand MOUD prescribing to other clinics. Context barriers, such as restrictions on which clinics could prescribe MOUD and fragmented communication across clinics regarding the management of patients receiving MOUD, emerged more prominently in the middle of the study. Conclusions VHA facilities participating in 12-month external facilitation interventions experienced fluctuations in barriers to MOUD prescribing with contextual barriers emerging after a facilitated reduction in recipient- level barriers. Adoption of MOUD prescribing in low-adopting VHA facilities requires continual reassessment, monitoring, and readjustment of implementation strategies over time to meet challenges. Although i-PARIHS was useful in categorizing most barriers, the lack of conceptual clarity was a concern for some constructs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid use is one of the most critical public health issues as highly potent opioids contribute to rising rates of accidental opioid-related toxicity deaths. This crisis has affected people from all age groups, including youth (ages 15–24) who are in a critical developmental period where the stakes of opioid use are especially high. Efforts to reduce the significant harms of opioid use have focused on the expansion of evidence-based treatments, including medications for opioid use disorder (e.g. buprenorphine). While these treatments are unequivocally life saving, recent evidence suggests that they may not align with youths’ needs. Accordingly, the ‘Improving Treatment Together’ (ITT) project has been designed with the aim to improve youths’ opioid treatment service experiences and outcomes by co-developing, implementing, and measuring youth-centred opioid use treatment service innovations. This manuscript describes the protocol for this multi-phase project. Methods The ITT project follows community-based participatory research (CBPR) and strategically integrates co-design processes throughout its four phases. Upon establishing a project partnership between national, provincial and community-based organizations, Phase 1 follows four core elements of human-centred co-design (empathy, needs identification, ideation, prototyping) in nine separate workshops. These workshops will be held in four diverse communities with youth, caregivers and service providers who have accessed or delivered opioid treatment services. Phase 1 will culminate in the co-production of opioid treatment service innovations to be considered by the project’s partners for further co-development, pilot testing, and wider implementation during the remaining phases of the project. Throughout each phase, the project will collect and analyse both qualitative and quantitative research and evaluation data to determine the project’s impact. Discussion This protocol provides a detailed description of the ITT project, with an emphasis on the project’s application of co-design and CBPR processes, the planned research and implementation procedures, and the establishment of a unique partnership. To our knowledge, this is one of the first projects to integrate these participatory processes to the design, implementation and measurement of youth-centred opioid treatment services. Embedding these processes throughout each phase of the project will strengthen the relevance and feasibility of the project’s service delivery innovations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol is challenging to discuss, and patients may be reluctant to disclose drinking partly because of concern about being judged. This report presents an overview of the development of a medications review intervention co-produced with the pharmacy profession and with patients, which breaks new ground by seeking to give appropriate attention to alcohol within these consultations. Methods This intervention was developed in a series of stages and refined through conceptual discussion, literature review, observational and interview studies, and consultations with advisory groups. In this study we reflect on this process, paying particular attention to the methods used, where lessons may inform innovations in other complex clinical consultations. Results Early work with patients and pharmacists infused the entire process with a heightened sense of the complexity of consultations in everyday practice, prompting careful deliberation on the implications for intervention development. This required the research team to be highly responsive to both co-production inputs and data gathered in formally conducted studies, and to be committed to working through the implications for intervention design. The intervention thus evolved significantly over time, with the greatest transformations resulting from patient and pharmacist co-design workshops in the second stage of the process, where pharmacists elaborated on the nature of the need for training in particular. The original research plans provided a helpful structure, and unanticipated issues for investigation emerged throughout the process. This underscored the need to engage dynamically with changing contexts and contents and to avoid rigid adherence to any early prescribed plan. Conclusions Alcohol interventions are complex and require careful developmental research. This can be a messy enterprise, which can nonetheless shed new insights into the challenges involved in optimising interventions, and how to meet them, if embraced with an attitude of openness to learning. We found that exposing our own research plans to scrutiny resulted in changes to the intervention design that gained the confidence of different stakeholders. Our understanding of the methods used, and their consequences, may be bounded by the person-centred nature of this particular intervention.",

A genetic basis may explain the variability in this response. However, no consensus has been reached regarding which genetic variants significantly contribute to MOUD outcomes. Objectives This systematic review aims to summarize genome-wide significant findings on MOUD outcomes and critically appraise the quality of the studies involved. Methods Databases searched from inception until August 21st, 2020 include: MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL and Pre-CINAHL, GWAS Catalog and GWAS Central. The included studies had to be GWASs that assessed MOUD in an OUD population. All studies were screened in duplicate. The quality of the included studies was scored and assessed using the Q-Genie tool. Quantitative analysis, as planned in the protocol, was not feasible, so the studies were analyzed qualitatively. Results Our search identified 7292 studies. Five studies meeting the eligibility criteria were included. However, only three studies reported results that met our significance threshold of p ≤ 1.0 × 10 –7 . In total, 43 genetic variants were identified. Variants corresponding to CNIH3 were reported to be associated with daily heroin injection in Europeans, OPRM1 , TRIB2 , and ZNF146 with methadone dose in African Americans, EYS with methadone dose in Europeans, and SPON1 and intergenic regions in chromosomes 9 and 3 with plasma concentrations of S-methadone, R-methadone, and R-EDDP, respectively, in Han Chinese. Limitations The limitations of this study include not being able to synthesize the data in a quantitative way and a conservative eligibility and data collection model. Conclusion The results from this systematic review will aid in highlighting significant genetic variants that can be replicated in future OUD pharmacogenetics research to ascertain their role in patient-specific MOUD outcomes.

    "abstract": "Background Drug overdose mortality, particularly involving opioid analgesics, has risen steadily over the past two decades and is now the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed concurrently to individuals receiving opioid analgesics. Little is known about the association between benzodiazepine-prescribing patterns and overdose mortality in those receiving opioid analgesics. We aimed to study the association between benzodiazepine prescription history, dose, type and dosing schedule, and the risk of drug overdose mortality among individuals receiving opioid analgesics. Materials and methods This was a case-cohort study utilizing Veterans Health Administration (VHA) administrative data. Participants were all individuals who died of a drug overdose (n = 2326) while receiving opioid analgesics and a random sample of individuals (n = 404725) who received VHA medical services and opioid analgesics between fiscal years 2004 and 2009. Benzodiazepine prescription history, dose, type, and dosing schedule were determined by dispensation data from the VHA's Pharmacy Benefits Management Services. Benzodiazepine prescription history was categorized as periods of time when individuals were currently prescribed, formerly prescribed, or not prescribed benzodiazepines. Drug overdose mortality was based on cause of death information from the National Death Index. Associations between benzodiazepine prescription history, dose, type and dosing schedule, and overdose mortality were examined using Cox proportional hazards models. Results Twenty-seven percent of individuals who received opioid analgesics also received benzodiazepines during the study period. Approximately half of the drug overdose deaths (n = 1162) occurred during periods when individuals were concurrently receiving benzodiazepines and opioids. Risk of overdose death increased based on benzodiazepine prescription history: formerly prescribed versus not prescribed, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 2.22 (95% confidence interval [CI]; 1.95-2.52; absolute risk difference approximation [ARDA] = 0.12%); currently prescribed versus not prescribed, adjusted HR = 3.59 (95% CI, 3.24-3.97; ARDA = 0.25%). Risk of overdose death increased as daily benzodiazepine dose increased. When compared to clonazepam, temazepam was associated with a decreased overdose risk; adjusted HR = 0.73 (95% CI; 0.56-0.95; ARDA = 0.03%). Benzodiazepine dosing schedule was not associated with overdose risk. Conclusions Among individuals receiving opioid analgesics, receipt of benzodiazepines was associated with an increased risk of drug overdose death, and these risks were generally consistent at all levels of opioid dose. The risks and benefits of benzodiazepine-prescribing in this population warrant further evaluation. Language: en",

    "abstract": "When opioid-agonist treatments were approved in France in 1995, opiate use disorders began to be managed and treated by general practitioners (GPs), who have since then been encouraged to treat substance use disorders (SUDs) for heroin and other illegal substances. The objective of this study was to describe rates of: 1) SUDs in general practices in France; 2) characteristics of GPs treating SUDs; and 3) clinical practices surrounding SUDs. To place these data in the context of SUD treatment, we also gathered information from practicing SUD specialists.Between December 2011 and January 2012, a nationally representative sample of GPs and SUD specialists were interviewed by phone, using a 12-item questionnaire that covered number of SUD patients, types of SUDs, and treatments. Data collected were confidential, and analysis was blinded with regard to physician identity.Forty-four percent of GPs and 68 % of specialists were included in the analysis. The mean number of patients estimated to have been seen at least once in the previous year was 3036 for GPs and 920 for specialists. Ninety-six percent of GPs reported having patients with SUDs. Tobacco, alcohol, and psychoactive drugs were the SUDs most frequently encountered by GPs, whereas tobacco, alcohol, heroin, and cannabis were most frequently encountered by specialists. Forty-three percent of GPs saw at least one patient with a heroin use disorder (HUD), and 82 % of GPs treating patients with HUDs had prescribed an opioid-agonist treatment during the previous 12 months.The results of this study suggest that a large number of GPs now treat patients with opiate use disorders and that doctors appear to be convinced of the benefits of opioid-agonist therapy and have overcome their initial concerns. This represents a significant change in practice patterns since the introduction of opioid-agonist treatments in France.",

    "abstract": "Driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol is a major public health concern, and many individuals continue to drink and drive even after being convicted of a DUI offense. Latinos, in particular, are disproportionately likely to be arrested for a DUI, have higher rates of recidivism, and are more likely to die in alcohol-related accidents than non-Latino Whites. Latinos also experience significant disparities in accessing alcohol-related treatment. This study protocol paper describes a randomized trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to usual care in DUI programs for individuals with a first-time offense and at-risk drinking. We will utilize a two-group randomized design where individuals enrolled in a DUI program with a first-time conviction will be randomized to CBT (n = 150) or usual care (n = 150). Participants will be assessed at baseline, immediately post-treatment, and 6-months post-treatment. Recidivism data will be collected using administrative data within 2 years post-treatment. This project has the potential to benefit a large population of vulnerable individuals who are at risk of DUI recidivism. It also develops a new model of care by providing treatment in DUI programs to reduce disparities associated with poor treatment access. Trial registration NCT02588703",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a serious health condition that is effectively treated with buprenorphine. However, only a minority of people with OUD are able to access buprenorphine. Many access points for buprenorphine have high barriers for initiation and retention. Health care and drug treatment systems have not been able to provide services to all—let alone the majority—who need it, and many with OUD report extreme challenges starting and staying on buprenorphine in those care settings. We describe the design and protocol for a study of a rapid access buprenorphine program model in six Washington State communities at existing sites serving people who are unhoused and/or using syringe services programs. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a Community-Based Medication-First Program model. Methods We are conducting a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of a rapid access buprenorphine model of care staffed by prescribers, nurse care managers, and care navigators. The Community-Based Medication-First model of care was designed as a 6-month, induction-stabilization-transition model to be delivered between 2019 and 2022. Effectiveness outcomes will be tested by comparing the intervention group with a comparison group derived from state records of people who had OUD. Construction of the comparison group will align characteristics such as geography, demographics, historical rates of arrests, OUD medication, and health care utilization, using restriction and propensity score techniques. Outcomes will include arrests, emergency and inpatient health care utilization, and mortality rates. Descriptive statistics for buprenorphine utilization patterns during the intervention period will be documented with the prescription drug monitoring program. Discussion Results of this study will help determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Given the serious population-level and individual-level impacts of OUD, it is essential that services be readily available to all people with OUD, including those who cannot readily access care due to their circumstances, capacity, preferences, and related systems barriers.",

The screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) model was initially directed to practicing physicians. Recently, training has evolved to include medical students. This study describes the first known application of SBIRT training to social work students. The goal was to assess students’ knowledge of and attitudes toward alcohol misuse before and after SBIRT training. Students were given a questionnaire assessing attitudes, knowledge and perceived skills with regard to substance misuse. A computerized training session focused on symptoms of at-risk drinking and implementing SBIRT. Descriptive statistics explained overall knowledge, attitudes, and perceived screening and intervention skills. T-tests compared changes pre- and post-test. Seventy-four social work students (33 undergraduate and 41 graduate) completed the training modules and pre- and post-tests. Significant differences were found in seven of the 13 questions. Students reported more confidence in their ability to assess for alcohol misuse and successfully intervene with clients who have substance use behaviors. They reported feeling more strongly that routine screening and brief intervention were crucial to clinical practice. Incorporating alcohol screening and brief intervention techniques into social work practice is an important aspect of effective treatment. Training students to screen and intervene is critical to improving treatment skills. Teaching SBIRT is a simple and effective way to implement addictions education into social work curricula. Such training appears to increase students’ perceptions of their ability to change client behaviors and reduce client alcohol misuse.",

    "abstract": "Numerous screening methods have been developed to detect hazardous and harmful drinking in a range of health settings. Recent research has focused on developing briefer screening tools to maximize implementation in busy practice settings, particularly emergency departments (EDs) and primary care. However the relative utility of these tools is not fully understood. Further, there is a need to identify the utility of universal screening, in which all patients approaching primary care are screened, compared with targeted screening, which includes only patients with certain “red flag” conditions or presentations. The Screening and Intervention Program for Sensible Drinking (SIPS) program compared the relative utility of different screening tools (e.g., the Single Alcohol Screening Question [SASQ] and the Fast Alcohol Screening Test [FAST]) and approaches (universal versus targeted screening) in primary care. In addition, the utility of the Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT), a targeted screening tool, was compared with SASQ and FAST in EDs. Compared with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the FAST had a higher sensitivity than the SASQ in primary care. Although targeted screening in primary care is a more efficient screening method, it misses a large proportion of patients who could benefit from brief interventions. The SASQ performed better in EDs than either the FAST or PAT. These results have important implications for the choice of screening tools in different settings.",

Ontario OAT providers were surveyed to better understand their attitudes towards buprenorphine and potential barriers to its use, including the induction process. We used a convenience sample from an annual provincial conference to which Ontario physicians who are involved with OAT are invited. Based on 85 survey respondents (out of 215 attendees), only 4% of Ontario addiction physicians involved in OAT routinely used unobserved “home” buprenorphine induction: 59% of physicians felt that unobserved induction was risky because it was against “the guidelines” and 66% and 61% respectively believed that unobserved “home” induction increased the risk of diversion and of precipitated withdrawal. Ontario addiction physicians largely report following the traditional method of bringing in patients for observed in-office buprenorphine induction: they expressed fear of precipitated withdrawal, diversion, and going against clinical guidelines. The hesitance in using unobserved induction may explain, in part, Ontario’s reliance on methadone.",

    "abstract": "Urine drug monitoring for medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) such as buprenorphine can help to support treatment adherence. The practice of introducing unconsumed medication directly into urine (known as \"spiking\" samples) has been increasingly recognized as a potential means to simulate treatment adherence. In the laboratory, examination of the ratios of buprenorphine and its metabolite, norbuprenorphine, has been identified as a mechanism to identify \"spiked\" samples. Urine levels of naloxone may also be a novel marker in cases where the combination buprenorphine-naloxone product has been administered. This case study, which encompasses one provider's practice spanning two sites, represents a preliminary report on the utility of using urinary naloxone as an indicator of \"spiked\" urine toxicology samples. Though only a case study, this represents the largest published evaluation of patients' naloxone levels to date. Over a 3-month period across two practice sites, we identified 1,223 patient samples with recorded naloxone levels, spanning a range of 0 to 12,161 ng/ml. The average naloxone level was 633.65 ng/ml with the majority (54%) of samples < 300 ng/ml. 8.0% of samples demonstrated extreme values of naloxone (> 2000 ng/ml). One practice site, which had increased evidence of specimen tampering at collections, had a greater percent of extreme naloxone levels (> 2000 ng/ml) at 9.3% and higher average naloxone level (686.8 ng/ml), in contrast to a second site (570.9 ng/ml; 6.4% at > 2000 ng/ml) that did not have known reports of specimen tampering. We postulate that naloxone may serve as an additional flag to identify patient \"spiking\" of urine samples with use of the combination product of buprenorphine-naloxone.",

This process is a synthesis of cost and clinical information. For cost, the federal Medicaid Drug Rebate Program establishes mandatory rebates that pharmaceutical manufacturers must pay state Medicaid programs. In addition, state Medicaid programs may also negotiate supplemental rebates whereby, in exchange for a preferred position on the preferred drug list, manufacturers pay an additional rebate. These supplemental rebates are most important in therapeutic classes with multiple brand competitors (e.g., medication treatments for opioid use disorder). For clinical information, state Medicaid programs convene pharmaceutical and therapeutics committees, drug utilization review boards, or both, composed of a variety of stakeholders such as practicing clinicians. Cost factors such as federal rebate calculations and supplemental rebate negotiations may lead to counterintuitive preferred drug lists, for example, a state Medicaid program requiring prior authorization for a generic medication but not for its brand equivalent (e.g., buprenorphine/naloxone products). Because of states’ reliance on rebates, mandates to remove prior authorization may have the unintended consequence of increasing costs significantly through the loss of rebate negotiating power. In the face of high and rising medication costs, state Medicaid programs are also implementing innovative policy approaches to maintain access and control costs, such as targeted rebate negotiation and value-based pricing. Through participation in state Medicaid program clinical advisory committees, individual clinicians can have a powerful voice. Interested clinicians should consider joining to inform policy and help ensure their patients’ needs are met.",

    "abstract": "Juvenile Justice-Translating Research Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System (JJ-TRIALS; a cooperative implementation science initiative launched by NIDA in July 2013) seeks to reduce unmet substance use disorder (SUD) needs by assisting JJ agencies in their efforts to implement best practices and improve SUD service utilization along a behavioral health cascade (screening, assessment, referral, and treatment). Such efforts require systems-level change; thus, the JJ-TRIALS study targets JJ agencies and the behavioral health partners to which juveniles are referred (i.e., providers of SUD services).\r\n\r\nAaron’s implementation science framework [1] provides the foundation for study design and measurement. EPIS conceptualizes change processes as involving four phases: Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS). The development of the implementation intervention components, the timing of components, and the measurement of process improvement activities are guided by Aarons’ EPIS model. For instance, data-driven decisionmaking (DDDM) templates and tools will provide basic support for goal selection during the Exploration phase. EPIS also has implications for measurement of process improvement activities. While the four phases are presented linearly, improvement activities may be somewhat recursive, with sites revisiting earlier phases when modifications in their action plans are needed (e.g., reworking Preparation plans after initial Implementation).\r\n\r\nUsing a clustered randomized design, JJ-TRIALS will compare two implementation interventions: a Core Intervention, involving DDDM strategies to promote change across the EPIS phases, versus an Enhanced Intervention, providing support for DDDM through facilitation and inter-agency change teams. A total of 36 sites representing 7 states and the District of Columbia will be randomized to Core (n = 18) or Enhanced (n = 18) and to one of three start times. Primary research questions address whether DDDM strategies and facilitation of DDDM tools/implementation teams improve: a) the provision and quality of services along a behavioral health cascade (screening, assessment, referral, and treatment of youth with SUD); and b) attitudes toward/use of best practices among staff working with justice-involved youth. Exploratory research questions focus on aspects of the implementation process, inter-organizational collaboration, costs associated with each study arm, and youth outcomes.",

Substance misuse during this phase of life can be the beginning of longer-term problems, making intervention programs particularly important. This study's purposes were to identify alcohol use profile subgroups, describe the preintervention characteristics of each, and assess how many participants transitioned to lower-risk profiles during the course of the intervention.We used latent transition analyses to categorize 1183 people court ordered to attend Prime For Life® (PFL), a motivation-enhancing program, into preintervention and postintervention profiles. We then assessed how many made transitions between these profiles during the course of the intervention.Profiles included two low-risk statuses (abstinence and light drinking) and two high-risk statuses (occasional heavy drinking and frequent heavy drinking). We found that people in profile subgroups that reflected heavier 90-day preintervention drinking were likely to transition to profiles reflecting postintervention intentions for lower-risk drinking in the subsequent 90 days. In contrast, the likelihood of transitioning from a lower-risk to a higher-risk profile was extremely low. These positive changes were found for people of both sexes and for those above versus below the legal drinking age, albeit for more women than men in the heaviest drinking group.Findings showed positive changes during intervention for many emerging adult participants attending PFL. Further research is needed that include comparison conditions, as well as examine longer-term outcomes in this population.",

Encompassing both specialty care programs and general medical settings, the Network has become a unique resource for expertise on clinically focused research, bridging the gap between research and treatment delivery. Over 22 years, the CTN has completed 101 studies, resulting in 650 publications. In response to the opioid epidemic, a CTN task force generated a comprehensive list of research priorities in the areas of prevention, treatment, knowledge dissemination, and workforce training, to form the basis of the Network's opioid portfolio. The Network's opioid portfolio currently includes five main categories of studies: (1) large multi-site studies; (2) studies aimed at closing the treatment gap; (3) expansion of ongoing studies to improve service delivery and implementation; (4) studies to explore the use of substance use data in electronic health record systems; (5) training and dissemination projects to expand the research/health care provider workforce. With funding from the Helping to End Addiction Long-Term InitiativeSM (HEAL), the CTN established five new Nodes, which, along with the pre-existing Nodes, are distributed in every region of the nation and engage researchers and clinicians in areas that have been among the hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. Through this expanded network and its commitment to developing personalized, evidence-based treatments, the CTN is poised to address and provide solutions for the ongoing epidemic of opioid use and addiction.",

This randomized controlled trial examines the effect of providing an expedited pathway to addiction medicine treatment on initial treatment engagement and health care utilization. Methods Individuals with possible alcohol or opioid use disorder were recruited from three residential withdrawal management services (WMS). Subjects randomized to the Delayed Intervention (DI) group were given contact information for a nearby addiction medicine clinic; those randomized to the Rapid Intervention (RI) group were given an appointment at the clinic within 2 days and were accompanied to their first appointment. Results Of the 174 individuals who were screened, 106 were randomized to either the DI or RI group. The two groups were similar in demographics, housing status, and substance use in the last 30 days. In the 6-month period following randomization, 85% of the RI group attended at least one clinic appointment, compared to only 29% in the DI group (p &lt; 0.0001). The RI group had a mean of 6.39 ED visits per subject in the 12 months after randomization, while the DI group had a mean of 13.02 ED visits per subject in the same 12-month period (p = 0.0469). Other health utilization measures did not differ between the two groups. Conclusion Providing immediate facilitated access to an addiction medicine service resulted in greater initial engagement and reduced emergency department visits at 6 months.

Study participants randomized to XR-NTX were interviewed to assess their experiences with successful and unsuccessful XR-NTX induction. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were completed with a convenience sample of s tudy participants with HIV and OUD ( n = 37) randomized to XR-NTX in five HIV clinics between 2018 and 2019. All participants approached agreed to be interviewed. Interviews were digitally recorded, professionally transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Participants included women (43%), African Americans (62%) and Hispanics (16%), between 27 to 69 years of age. Individuals who completed XR-NTX induction (n = 20) reported experiencing (1) readiness for change, (2) a supportive environment during withdrawal including comfort medications, and (3) caring interactions with staff. Four contrasting themes emerged among participants ( n = 17) who did not complete induction: (1) concern and anxiety about withdrawal including past negative experiences, (2) ambivalence about or reluctance to stop opioids, (3) concerns about XR-NTX effects, and (4) preferences for other medications. Conclusions The results highlight opportunities to improve initiation of XR-NTX in high-need groups. Addressing expectations regarding induction may enhance XR-NTX initiation rates.

    "abstract": "Self-stigma occurs when members of a stigmatized group internalize negative views of themselves, resulting in devaluation and withdrawal. Studies have shown that people with substance use are heavily stigmatized and may internalize these negative beliefs about themselves. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between self-stigma and sociodemographic variables such as age, years of education, religious practice, and employment status. The instruments used were the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale adapted for substance users and a sociodemographic questionnaire developed by the authors, both applied in face-to-face interviews. The sample was composed by 248 patients diagnosed with substance abuse participating in treatment in Juiz de Fora, Brazil. Ninety-four percent of participants were male with a mean age of 35.3 years (SD = 10.9); 69.1% were unemployed, with the mean duration of their education of 7.9 years (SD = 4.8), and 51.3% were not practicing any religion. Associations between sociodemographic variables and internalized stigma were examined using the Spearman correlation test and t-test for independent samples. For all the analyses, we assumed confidence intervals of 95% (p < 0.05). The ISMI scores were not correlated to any of the sociodemographic variables, suggesting that certain psychosocial variables have greater influence on the internalization of stigma. However, analyses revealed that the only variable showing a difference between the means was employment status (t = -2.06; p < 0.05), indicating that people who are unemployed have greater self-stigma than people who are working. This may be due to employed persons having a greater inclusion in a social environment, which promotes a higher quality of social interactions. These results highlight the need to identify variables influencing self-stigma among people with drug use in order to develop interventions that lessen self-stigma more effectively.",

    "abstract": "Little has been reported on the efficacy of brief intervention (BI) among heavy episodic drinkers, although this drinking style is known to be especially harmful in relation to negative consequences including alcohol-related injuries. The comparative efficacy of BI is analyzed in two similar randomized controlled clinical trials of emergency department (ED) patients in two different cultures, both of which exhibit similar drinking styles of heavy episodic drinking: Poland and Mexican-Americans in the U.S. Improvements in drinking and problem outcomes are analyzed at 3-month and 12-month follow-up, using random effects modeling, among 446 Polish patients and 698 Mexican-American patients, randomized to screened only, assessment, and intervention conditions in each study. In Poland significant improvement was observed in all outcome measures for the assessed condition at 3-months compared to baseline, but only in the two problem variables at 12-months, while for the intervention condition, significant improvement was found in all outcome measures at both time periods; however, estimates of the interaction terms were not statistically significant. In the Mexica-American study, while significant improvement in nearly all outcome measures were observed at 3 months and 12 months for both conditions, estimates of the interaction terms suggest that for all drinking variables, but not problem variables, outcomes were significantly improved for the intervention condition over the assessed condition at 12 months, suggesting a 12-month intervention effect. Findings here are non-conclusive regarding a treatment effect of BI for heavy episodic drinking in ED patients. Given the mixed findings for BI in other ED studies, future studies need to explore the efficacy of BI in other populations and cultures exhibiting different drinking patterns to help identify what type of drinker would most benefit from BI in the ED setting.",

Early alcohol and drug use is linked to a range of immediate and long-term consequences (e.g., academic, brain development, and later dependence). Although studies such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey and National Survey on Drug Use and Health have recently shown stable or slight decline in the use of alcohol and certain drugs, alcohol remains the drug of choice, marijuana use has increased, and perceptions of harm has decreased. [1,2] Opportunities to address substance use exist in a range of settings where nurses, social workers and other health professionals work with youth yet training and adoption of adolescent screening and brief intervention has been slow. The cost of substance use disorders, in both adults and adolescents, could be reduced through the SAMHSA-backed prevention and early identification procedure of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), a cost-effective and widely-supported prevention framework. Research has shown SBIRT to be effective for the early identification of problematic alcohol use, with growing but inconsistent evidence for its effectiveness with other risky drug use. However, there is little substance use training in social work and nursing programs. SBIRT education is often optional or specialized, rather than being required coursework.",

This cross-sectional study examined prevalence and factors associated with hazardous drinking among young adults seeking outpatient mental health services, rate of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), and the relationship between hazardous drinking and other types of substance use. Participants were 487 young adults ages 18–25 who completed self-administered computerized screening questions for alcohol and drug use. Alcohol use patterns were assessed and predictors of hazardous drinking (≥5 drinks on one or more occasions in the past year) were identified using logistic regression. Of the 487 participants, 79.8 % endorsed prior-year alcohol use, 52.3 % reported one or more episodes of hazardous drinking in the prior year and 8.2 % were diagnosed with an AUD. Rates of recent and lifetime alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use were significantly greater in those with prior-year hazardous drinking.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Medications to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) including buprenorphine products are evidence-based and cost-effective tools for combating the opioid crisis. However, limited availability to buprenorphine is pervasive in the United States (US) and may serve to exacerbate the deadly epidemic. Although prior research points to rural counties as especially needy of strategies that improve buprenorphine availability, it is important to investigate the availability of waivered providers according to treatment need as defined by the county-level rate of opioid-overdose deaths (OOD). This study examined differences in buprenorphine provider availability relative to treatment need among rural and urban counties in the US. Methods Buprenorphine provider availability relative to need in each county was defined as the number of waivered providers divided by the rate of OODs (i.e., number of OODs/100,000 population), according to 2018 data. Counties with ratios in the bottom tertile of their state were classified as buprenorphine undersupplied. We estimated logit models to statistically test the association of rurality and state main effects and their interaction terms (independent variables) and the county classified as buprenorphine undersupplied (dependent variable). Results A total of 38 states and 2595 counties had sufficient non-suppressed data to remain in the analysis. A larger percent of urban counties (36.43%) than rural counties (32.01%) were classified as buprenorphine undersupplied (p = 0.001). The likelihood of a rural county being undersupplied varied considerably by state (Chi Square = 82.88, p = 0.000). All states with significant (p &lt; 0.05 or p &lt; 0.10) interaction terms showed lower likelihood of buprenorphine undersupply in rural counties. Conclusions The rural–urban distribution in undersupply of waivered buprenorphine providers relative to need varied markedly by state. Strategies for improving access to buprenorphine-waivered providers should be state-centric and informed by county-specific indicators of need.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to evaluate the results of a theory-based and systematic intervention on Hookah Tobacco Smoking (HTS) cessation in women local to Bandar Abbas, Iran. In the present quasi-experimental research, we used an intervention mapping approach to develop, implement, and evaluate an education and training course as our intervention. Applying the results of a systematic review and two prior local qualitative studies, we identified six HTS determinants and set goals for the intervention. We selected 212 eligible women through systematic stratified random sampling and enrolled them in control and intervention groups. The course was presented to the intervention group in 17 sessions for four months. The educational material was developed to address the goals of the intervention, improve HTS determinants, and change the HTS behavior. We used a questionnaire to collect data on participants' characteristics, HTS behavior, and detailed determinants of HTS in the control and intervention groups at the beginning of the study, at the end of the intervention, and at three- and six- months follow-up. All work done in the study was guided by ethical considerations. The results showed no significant difference between women enrolled in control and intervention groups regarding participants' characteristics and HTS behavior. At baseline, there were no differences between groups for six determinants of HTS (knowledge, attitude, social norms, self-efficacy, habit, and intention). At the end of the intervention and at three and six months follow-up, the women in the intervention group had significantly better results in all six domains, compared with those in the control group. The rate of HTS abstinence at the end of the intervention and at the three- and six-month follow-ups was 61.3%, 48.5%, and 45.5% for the intervention and 16%, 14.4%, and 10% for the control groups, respectively. HTS is a complicated behavior, and its cessation is hard. However, Intervention Mapping (IM) can be a powerful integrative, purposeful, theory-based, and participation-based method to reduce or cease HTS. This method should be tested in other settings.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background As a public health issue, non-fatal overdose (NFOD) is highly prevalent among people who inject drugs (PWID). This can lead to an elevated risk of future overdose, causing various harms including possible death. It is essential to improve knowledge concerning this problem and its associated risk factors to inform overdose prevention and assistance programs. The primary aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of NFOD and associated risk factors among PWID in Saveh, Iran. Methods In the present cross-sectional study, 272 PWID living in Saveh, Iran were interviewed face-to-face using a structured survey. Data concerning socio-demographics, substance use, risky behaviors, and services utilization data were collected. The outcome variable (i.e., NFOD) was assessed by answering “Yes” to the question: “In the past three months, have you ever overdosed (at least once) by accident?” Results The prevalence of NFOD among PWID in the past three months was 54%. The characteristics and behaviors that were associated with an increased risk of experiencing NFOD in the past three months were being of older age (AOR = 5.2, p &lt; 0.05), drug use initiation under the age of 22 years (AOR = 7.8, p &lt; 0.05), being an alcohol user (AOR = 3.0, p &lt; 0.05), and being a simultaneous multiple drug user (AOR = 5.8, p &lt; 0.05). Also, more recent initiates to injecting (&lt; 2 years) had an increased risk of experiencing a non-fatal overdose in the past three months. Findings also indicated that those who (i) attended a needle and syringe program (AOR: 0.3, p &lt; 0.05), (ii) were visited by a general practitioner (AOR: 0.03, p &lt; 0.05), and (iii) received a psychosocial intervention (AOR: 0.1, p &lt; 0.05) were 0.3, 0.03 and 0.1 times less likely to report non-fatal overdosing than other participants, respectively. Conclusions The results indicate that intervention and prevention initiatives seeking to reduce NFOD among PWID should not only be focused on the primary drug used but also the use of alcohol and polysubstance use. Specific and tailored psychological interventions combined with pharmacotherapy may be highly beneficial for PWID who experience more severe types of substance use, including alcohol use disorders and/or polysubstance abuse.",

Concurrent AUD-AnxD poses a challenge for clinical management as approaches to treatment of one disorder may be ineffective or potentially counterproductive for the other disorder. Case Presentation We present the case of a middle-aged man with anxiety disorder, AUD, chronic pain, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate use in context of tapering prescribed benzodiazepines who experienced severe alcohol withdrawal episodes during a complicated course of repeated inpatient withdrawal management. After medical stabilization, the patient found significant improvement in symptoms and no return to alcohol use with a regimen of naltrexone targeting his AUD, gabapentin targeting both his AUD and AnxD, and engagement with integrated psychotherapy, Alcoholics Anonymous, and addictions medicine follow-up. Conclusion Proper recognition and interventions for AUD and AnxD, ideally with overlapping efficacy, can benefit individuals with comorbid AUD-AnxD. Gabapentin, tobacco cessation, and integrated psychotherapy have preliminary evidence of synergistic effects in AUD-AnxD. Meta-analysis evidence does not support serotoninergic medications (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) which are commonly prescribed in AnxD and mood disorders as their use has not been associated with improved outcomes for AUD-AnxD. Additionally, several double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials have suggested that serotonergic medications may worsen alcohol-related outcomes in some individuals with AUD. Areas for future investigation are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite the proven efficacy of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and recent reduction in barriers to prescribers, numerous obstacles exist for patients seeking MOUD. Prior studies have used telephone surveys to investigate pharmacy-related barriers to MOUD. We applied this methodology to evaluate inpatient and outpatient pharmacy barriers to MOUD in South Florida. Methods Randomly selected pharmacies in South Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties) were called using a standardized script with a “secret shopper” approach until 200 successful surveys had been completed. The primary outcome was the availability of any buprenorphine products. Second, a list of all 48 acute care hospitals within the aforementioned counties was compiled, and hospitals were contacted by telephone using a second structured script. Results A total of 1374 outpatient pharmacies and 48 inpatient pharmacies were identified. 378 randomly selected outpatient pharmacies were contacted to accrue 200 successful calls (53% success rate). All 48 inpatient pharmacies were contacted to successfully complete 25 inpatient surveys (52%). Of the 200 outpatient pharmacies contacted, 38% had any buprenorphine available. There was a significant difference in buprenorphine availability by county, with Miami-Dade having the least availability and Palm Beach having the most availability (27% vs. 47%, respectively; p = 0.04). Of the 38% with buprenorphine available, 82% had a sufficient supply for a two-week prescription of buprenorphine 8 mg twice daily. Of the pharmacies that did not have buprenorphine, 55% would be willing to order with a median estimated time to receive an order of 2 days (IQR 1.25–3 days). Of the 25 surveyed inpatient pharmacies, 88% reported having buprenorphine on inpatient formulary, and 55% of hospitals had at least one restriction on ordering of buprenorphine beyond federal regulations. Conclusions The results of this study highlight significant pharmacy-related barriers to comprehensive OUD treatment across the healthcare system including both acute care hospital pharmacies and outpatient community pharmacies. Despite efforts to increase the number of MOUD providers, there still remain downstream obstacles to MOUD access.",

Main body The Women’s Health track was developed in collaboration between program leaders in Addiction Medicine and Obstetrics/Gynecology. Implementing the track led to the development of women-focused rotations and continuity clinics, as well as enrichment of women’s health didactic education for all fellows. The fellowship track spurred interdepartmental mentorship and collaboration on research and advocacy projects. Conclusion Addiction medicine fellowships can replicate this curriculum model to advance women-focused education, research, and policy.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) is a proven effective treatment option for individuals with severe opioid use disorder (OUD). In Switzerland, pharmaceutical heroin (diacetylmorphine, DAM) is available in tablet form or as injectable liquid. This creates a large barrier for individuals who require the rapid onset of effect but are either unable or do not want to inject, or who primarily snort opioids. Early experimental data has demonstrated that intranasal DAM administration can be a viable alternative to the intravenous or intramuscular route of administration. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of intranasal HAT. Methods This study will assess intranasal DAM using a prospective multicentre observational cohort study design in HAT clinics across Switzerland. Patients will be offered to switch from oral or injectable DAM to intranasal DAM. Participants will be followed-up over 3 years, with assessments at baseline, and after 4, 52, 104 and 156 weeks. The primary outcome measure (POM) is retention in treatment. Secondary outcomes (SOM) include prescriptions and routes of administration of other opioid agonists, illicit substance use, risk behaviour, delinquency, health and social functioning, treatment adherence, opioid craving, satisfaction, subjective effects, quality of life, physical health, and mental health. Conclusions The results derived from this study will generate the first major body of clinical evidence on the safety, acceptability, and feasibility of intranasal HAT. If proven to be safe, feasible and acceptable, this study would increase the accessibility of intranasal OAT for individuals with OUD globally as a critical improvement in risk reduction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Breaking Free Online (BFO), a computer-assisted therapy (CAT) program for substance use disorders (SUD), has been available across UK treatment services for the past decade and has demonstrated efficacy. The Covid-19 pandemic has contributed to digital and ‘telehealth’ approaches to healthcare delivery becoming more common and accepted, and has in parallel, increased numbers of referrals to SUD services because of the impact pandemic-related stress has had on substance using habits in the general population. Digital and telehealth approaches, such as BFO, have the potential to support the treatment system to meet this increased demand for SUD services. Methods Parallel-group randomized controlled trial of eight-week BFO as an adjunct to standard treatment for SUD, in comparison to standard treatment only, at a National Health Service (NHS) Mental Health Trust in North-West England. Participants will be service users aged 18 years and over with demonstrable SUD for at least 12-months. Interventional and control groups will be compared on multiple measures from baseline to post-treatment assessment at eight-weeks, and then three and six-months follow-up. Primary outcome will be self-reported substance use, with secondary outcomes being standardized assessments of substance dependence, mental health, biopsychosocial functioning and quality of life. Discussion This study will examine whether BFO and telehealth support, when delivered as an adjunct to standard SUD interventions, improves outcomes for services users receiving NHS SUD treatment. Findings from the study will be used to inform both developments to the BFO program and guidance around augmenting the delivery of CAT programs via telehealth.

We explored patient perceptions of incorporating harm reduction supplies and education in hospital care with patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Qualitative descriptive study of hospitalized patients with OUD in Philadelphia, PA using semi-structured interviews conducted between April and August of 2022. Three major themes emerged from 21 interviews with hospitalized patients with OUD: (1) Applicability and Acceptability of Harm Reduction Practices for Oneself; (2) Applicability and Acceptability of Harm Reduction Practices for Others; (3) Perceptions of Harm Reduction Conversations. Most participants were familiar with harm reduction but varied in their perceptions of its relevance for their lives. We noted differences in how participants viewed the applicability and acceptably of harm reduction practices that they perceived as intended to help others (e.g., naloxone) versus intended to help themselves (e.g., syringes). Most participants reported that meaningful conversations about drug use did not happen with their care team but that these conversations would have been acceptable if they were conducted in a way consistent with their individual substance use goals. Patients' interest and perceived acceptability of harm reduction services during hospitalization varied by individual patient factors and the perceived user of specific interventions. Given their positive potential, harm reduction practices should be incorporated in hospitals, but this must be done in a way that is acceptable to patients. Our findings reveal ways to integrate concepts from a harm reduction approach within a traditional medical model. More work is needed to understand the impact of such integration.",

Fifteen patients (8/7 female/male) participated in semi-structured interviews after receiving MET at a specialized addiction outpatient clinic in Sweden. Data were analyzed by thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: the therapist conveyed the MI-spirit, the therapist did not guide on how to reach the goal, participants were committed to change before starting treatment, participants were uncertain if treatment was enough to maintain change, and significant others were not wanted in sessions. Participants appreciated the supportive relationship with their therapist, but some experienced therapy as overly positive, with no room to talk about failure. Further, they experienced a low level of guidance in goal-setting. For some, this was empowering, while others requested more direction and advice. Participants perceived their motivational process to have started before treatment. MET was considered to be too brief. None of the participants brought a significant other to a session. Therapist behaviors in line with MI spirit were emphasized as key to the development of a positive therapeutic relationship. More specific advice on goal-setting may be effective for supporting change in some patients. Longer treatment is requested among patients to support the patient's self-efficacy for change. Significant others can support change without necessarily being present in sessions. The current trial was retrospectively registered at isrtcn.com (14539251).",

We followed PWH with OUD enrolled in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort from their first buprenorphine treatment episode between 2013 and 2020. We estimated 4-year restricted mean time spent on buprenorphine below buprenorphine retention threshold, on buprenorphine above retention threshold, off buprenorphine and in HIV care, loss to follow-up, and death. Retention definitions were based on retention threshold (180 vs 90 days) and allowable treatment gap (7 vs 30 days). Differences in 2-year restricted mean time spent retained on buprenorphine were estimated for patients with and without cocaine or hazardous alcohol use. The study sample (N = 179) was 63% male, 82% non-Hispanic Black, and mean age was 53 (SD 8) years. Patients spent on average 13.9 months (95% CI 11.4, 16.4) on buprenorphine over 4 years. There were differences in time spent retained on buprenorphine based on the retention definition, ranging from 6.5 months (95% CI 4.6, 8.5) to 9.6 months (95% CI 7.4, 11.8). Patients with cocaine use spent fewer months retained on buprenorphine. There were no differences for patients with hazardous alcohol use. PWH with OUD spend relatively little time receiving buprenorphine in their HIV primary care clinic. Concurrent cocaine use at buprenorphine initiation negatively impact time on buprenorphine.",

    "abstract": "Oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been effective at reducing mortality rates of people with HIV. However, despite its effectiveness, people who use drugs face barriers to maintaining ART adherence. Receipt of opioid agonist treatment, in the context of HIV care, is associated with medication adherence and decreased HIV viral loads. Recent pharmacological advancements have led to the development of novel long-acting, injectable, medications for both HIV (cabotegravir co-administered with rilpivirine) and OUD (extended-release buprenorphine). These therapies have the potential to dramatically improve adherence by eliminating the need for daily pill-taking. Despite the extensive evidence base supporting long-acting injectable medications for both HIV and OUD, and clinical guidelines supporting integrated care provision, currently little is known about how these medications may be optimally delivered to this population. This paper presents the study design for the development of a clinical protocol to guide the delivery of combined treatment for HIV and OUD using long-acting injectable medications. The study aims are to: (1) develop a clinical protocol to guide the delivery of combined LAI for HIV and OUD by conducting in-depth interviews with prospective patients, clinical content experts, and other key stakeholders; and (2) conduct This single group, open pilot trial protocol to assess feasibility, acceptability, and safety among patients diagnosed with HIV and OUD. Throughout all phases of the study, information on patient-, provider-, and organizational-level variables will be collected to inform future implementation. Findings from this study will inform the development of a future study to conduct a fully-powered Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation design.",

Despite this evidence, and the increasing toll of opioid-associated morbidity and mortality, it remains controversial in some settings. To investigate the possible contribution of heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) to HIV treatment-related outcomes, we sought to estimate the proportion and characteristics of HIV-positive people who inject opioids that might be eligible for HAT in Vancouver, Canada. We used data from a prospective cohort of people living with HIV who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada. Using generalized estimating equations (GEE), we assessed the longitudinal relationships between eligibility for HAT, using criteria from previous clinical trials and guidelines, with behavioural, social, and clinical characteristics. Between 2005 and 2014, 478 participants were included in these analyses, contributing 1927 person-years of observation. Of those, 94 (19.7%) met eligibility for HAT at least once during the study period. In a multivariable GEE model, after adjusting for clinical characteristics, being eligible for HAT was positively associated with homelessness, female gender, high-intensity illicit drug use, drug dealing and higher CD4 count. In our study of HIV-positive people with a history of injection drug use, approximately 20% of participants were eligible for HAT at ≥ 1 follow-up period. Eligibility was linked to risk factors for sub-optimal HIV/AIDS treatment outcomes, such as homelessness and involvement in the local illicit drug trade, suggesting that scaling-up access to HAT might contribute to achieving optimal HIV treatment in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background It has been estimated that approximately 15% of people who are incarcerated in the US have histories of opioid use disorder. Relapse to opioid use after release from prison poses a serious risk of HIV infection. Prison-initiated buprenorphine may help to reduce HIV infection given the association between opioid use and HIV-risk behaviors. Methods The present study is a secondary analysis of longitudinal data gathered from a randomized controlled trial of buprenorphine-naloxone for people who were incarcerated ( N = 211) between 2008 and 2012. It compares the impact of assignment to initiate buprenorphine in prison ( N = 106 randomized, N = 104 analyzed) versus in the community ( N = 107 randomized, N = 107 analyzed) and whether or not participants entered community treatment on the frequency of HIV-risk behaviors in the 12 months following release from prison. Data were analyzed hierarchically and for each outcome variable, a multilevel, over-dispersed Poisson model was fit to the data. Outcome variables were the number of times the following behaviors occurred in the last 30 days: (1) having sex without a condom (2) injecting drugs (3) using unsterilized needles, and (4) sharing injection paraphernalia. Results Participants assigned to begin buprenorphine in the community experienced a greater decrease in injection drug use over time compared to participants assigned to begin buprenorphine in prison. There were no significant associations between treatment assignment or community treatment entry and instances of having sex without a condom, sharing injection paraphernalia, or using unsterilized needles. Conclusions Overall, the present study did not find support for the initiation of buprenorphine in prison (as opposed to the community) as a means to reduce incidences of HIV-risk behaviors. Avenues for future research in the nexus of HIV-risk reduction, criminal justice, and pharmacotherapy are discussed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Integrating behavioral health in primary care is a widespread endeavor. Yet rampant variation exists in models and approaches. One significant question is whether frontline providers perceive that behavioral health includes substance use. The current study examined front line providers’: 1. definition of behavioral health, and 2. levels of comfort treating patients who use alcohol and other drugs. Frontline providers at two primary care clinics were surveyed using a 28-item instrument designed to assess their comfort and knowledge of behavioral health, including substance use. Two questions from the Integrated Behavioral Health Staff Perceptions Survey pertaining to confidence in clinics’ ability to care for patients’ behavioral health needs and comfort dealing with patients with behavioral health needs were used for the purposes of this report. Participants also self-reported their clinic role. Responses to these two items were assessed and then compared across roles. Chi square estimates and analysis of variance tests were used to examine relationships between clinic roles and comfort of substance use care delivery. Results Physicians, nurses/nurse practitioners, medical assistants, and other staff ( N = 59) participated. Forty-nine participants included substance use in their definition of behavioral health. Participants reported the least comfort caring for patients who use substances ( M = 3.5, SD = 1.0) compared to those with mental health concerns ( M = 4.1, SD = 0.7), chronic medical conditions ( M = 4.2, SD = 0.7), and general health concerns ( M = 4.2, SD = 0.7) ( p &lt; 0.001). Physicians ( M = 3.0, SD = 0.7) reported significantly lower levels of comfort than medical assistants ( M = 4.2, SD = 0.9) ( p &lt; 0.001) caring for patients who use substances. Conclusions In a small sample of key stakeholders from two primary care clinics who participated in this survey, most considered substance use part of the broad umbrella of behavioral health. Compared to other conditions, primary care providers reported being less comfortable addressing patients’ substance use. Level of comfort varied by role, where physicians were least comfortable, and medical assistants most comfortable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Chronic pain and heavy drinking are conditions that commonly co-occur among primary care patients. Despite the availability of behavioral interventions that target these conditions individually, engagement and adherence to treatment remain a challenge, and there have been no interventions designed to address both of these conditions together for patients presenting to primary care. This study seeks to incorporate the perspectives of patients regarding symptoms, treatment experiences, views on behavior change, and technology use to develop a tailored, integrated mobile health intervention that addresses both pain and heavy drinking among patients in primary care. Methods Twelve participants with moderate or greater chronic pain intensity and heavy drinking were recruited from primary care clinics in a large urban safety-net hospital. One-on-one interviews were recorded and transcribed. Codes were developed from interview transcripts, followed by thematic analysis in which specific meanings were assigned to codes. Participants also completed a series of Likert-based rating scales to evaluate components of the proposed intervention to supplement qualitative interviews. Results A number of themes were identified that had implications for intervention tailoring including: ambivalence about changing drinking, low expectations about pain treatment success, desire for contact with a designated provider, common use of smartphones but lack of familiarity with functions as a potential barrier to use, and strategies to maintain engagement and adherence. Evaluative ratings indicated that the proposed intervention content was perceived as helpful and the proposed structure, layout and design of the mobile intervention was acceptable to patients. Conclusions Results supported the view that a mobile health intervention delivered via smartphone with electronic coaching is an acceptable method of addressing chronic pain and heavy drinking among patients in primary care. The interviews highlight the need to utilize an intervention approach that addresses motivation to change drinking, sets realistic expectations for change, provides careful attention to training/education of the use of technology components, and fosters engagement through the use of reminders, feedback, and personalized activities.",

We compared the efficacy of two AUDIT-linked interventions provided by HTs: an informative leaflet and a BI plus leaflet.This is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with 1:1 randomization. Participants were identified through screening with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) at five primary care centers between March 2016 and July 2017. People older than 18 years at intermediate-risk (AUDIT score 8 to 15, inclusive) were randomized to receive either an HT-delivered BI (n = 174) or an informative leaflet (n = 168). Only data from participants (n = 294) who completed the 6-month assessment were analyzed. The leaflet was delivered without further advice. It contains alcohol consumption limits, a change planner, and strategies to decrease drinking. The BI was a 5-min discussion on the leaflet´s content plus normative feedback, tailored information on alcohol and health, and a change plan. The change in the AUDIT risk category six months after randomization (primary outcome) was compared among groups with a Chi-squared test. Changes in the secondary outcomes, which were scores on the AUDIT and the AUDIT´s consumption items (AUDIT-C), were compared with T-tests. Mixed-effects linear models adjusted for potential confounders. Outcome adjudicators were blinded to group assignment.At 6-month follow-up, low-risk alcohol consumption was observed in 119 (80%) participants in the BI group, and in 103 (71%) in the leaflet group, with no difference among groups ([Formula: see text] [1, N = 294] = 2.6, p = 0.1; adjusted odds ratio 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34, 1.05). The mean AUDIT score decreased by 5.76 points in the BI group, and by 5.07 in the leaflet group, which represents a 0.86 AUDIT point reduction attributable to the BI (secondary outcome) (T = 2.03, p = 0.043; adjusted mean difference 0.86 CI 0.06, 1.66).The AUDIT-linked BI delivered by HTs was not associated with a greater reduction of risky alcohol consumption than an informative leaflet. Delivering a leaflet could be more efficient than a BI when provided by HTs; however, more research on the effectiveness of the leaflet is needed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid use disorder (OUD) disproportionately impacts rural and American Indian communities and has quadrupled among pregnant individuals nationwide in the past two decades. Yet, limited data are available about access and quality of care available to pregnant individuals in rural areas, particularly among American Indians (AIs). Unannounced standardized patients (USPs), or “secret shoppers” with standardized characteristics, have been used to assess healthcare access and quality when outcomes cannot be measured by conventional methods or when differences may exist between actual versus reported care. While the USP approach has shown benefit in evaluating primary care and select specialties, its use to date for OUD and pregnancy is very limited. Methods We used literature review, current practice guidelines for perinatal OUD management, and stakeholder engagement to design a novel USP protocol to assess healthcare access and quality for OUD in pregnancy. We developed two USP profiles—one white and one AI—to reflect our target study area consisting of three rural, predominantly white and AI US counties. We partnered with a local community health center network providing care to a large AI population to define six priority outcomes for evaluation: (1) OUD treatment knowledge among clinical staff answering telephones; (2) primary care clinic facilitation and provision of prenatal care and buprenorphine treatment; (3) appropriate completion of evidence-based screening, symptom assessment, and initial steps in management; (4) appropriate completion of risk factor screening/probing about individual circumstances that may affect care; (5) patient-directed tone, stigma, and professionalism by clinic staff; and (6) disparities in care between whites and American Indians. Discussion The development of this USP protocol tailored to a specific environment and high-risk patient population establishes an innovative approach to evaluate healthcare access and quality for pregnant individuals with OUD. It is intended to serve as a roadmap for our own study and for future related work within the context of substance use disorders and pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Background: Emergency Departments (EDs) are important arenas for the detection of unhealthy substance use. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) for unhealthy alcohol use has been used in some ED settings with funding support from external sources. However, widespread sustained implementation is uncommon, and research aimed at understanding culture as a determinant for implementation is lacking. This study aims to explore cultural practices concerning the handling of patients with unhealthy alcohol use admitted to an ED. Methods: An ethnographic study was conducted in an ED in the Capital Region of Denmark. The data consists of participant observations of Health Care Professionals (HCPs) and semi-structured interviews with nurses. Data was collected from July 2018 to February 2020. A cultural analysis was performed by using Qualitative Content Analysis as an analytic tool. Results: 150 h of observation and 11 interviews were conducted. Three themes emerged from the analysis: (1) Setting the scene describes how subthemes “flow,” “risky environment,” and “physical spaces and artefacts” are a part of the contextual environment of an ED, and their implications for patients with unhealthy alcohol use, such as placement in certain rooms; (2) The encounter presents how patients’ and HCPs’ encounters unfold in everyday practice. Subtheme “Professional differences” showcases how nurses and doctors address patients’ alcohol habits differently, and how they do not necessarily act on the information provided, due to several factors. These factors are shown in remaining sub-themes “gut-feeling vs. clinical parameters,” “ethical reasoning,” and “from compliance to zero-tolerance”; and (3) Collective repertoires shows how language shapes the perception of patients with unhealthy alcohol use, which may cause stigma and stereotyping. Subthemes are “occupiers” and “alcoholic or party animal?”. Conclusions: Unhealthy alcohol use in the ED is entangled in complex cultural networks. Patients with severe and easily recognizable unhealthy alcohol use—characterized by an alcohol diagnosis in the electronic medical record, intoxication, or unwanted behavior—shape the general approach and attitude to unhealthy alcohol use. Consequently, from a prevention perspective, this means that patients with less apparent unhealthy alcohol use tend to be overlooked or neglected, which calls for a systematic screening approach.",

    "abstract": "Despite the relevance of screening and brief intervention (SBI) to the prevention of dental pathology, particularly with tobacco and at-risk alcohol use, there has been little attention to the determination of its effectiveness in dental settings. Further, most SBI research efforts have focused on the treatment of single risk factors despite the fact that use of psychoactive substances tends to co-occur. There is also debate about the optimal timing of interventions for multiple risk behaviors, i.e., whether to intervene simultaneously or sequentially. This study was designed to test the efficacy of SBI practices aimed at dental patients who were both smokers and at-risk drinkers. Participants (N = 288) were randomized into four experimental conditions to test the efficacy of comparative interventions for tobacco and at-risk alcohol use when delivered separately and in combined forms, and to compare the effects of sequential versus simultaneous interventions. The results indicated that individuals in each of three active brief intervention (BI) groups (alcohol BI, tobacco BI, and combined alcohol and tobacco BI) significantly reduced self-reported drinks per week and cigarettes per day compared with those in the wait-list control group. There was no advantage to the combined versus single-substance focused interventions as individuals changed both behaviors regardless of the treatment intervention received. No significant differences in self-reported drinks per week or cigarettes per day were found between those receiving simultaneous versus sequential interventions. These findings have implications for the design of BI aimed at multiple substance use and imply that no matter where a provider begins with respect to behavior-change focus, she or he may affect change in patients across multiple substance use behaviors.",

A cluster RCT was conducted involving 20 community pharmacies. Pharmacy customers were screened using the Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST) to determine eligibility. The control group received a general lifestyle leaflet, while the intervention group was offered BI from a trained pharmacist. Clients in both groups were asked to complete baseline and three- and six-month postal questionnaires of self-reported alcohol consumption and to re-take the FAST. Qualitative work included follow-up telephone interviews with clients as well as focus groups with the public and participating pharmacists. Over 1000 clients were approached, with 77.6% (n = 846) completing the FAST. Of these, 27.1% (n = 229) were eligible for inclusion (FAST score = 3), 69 of whom (30.1%) consented to participate (27 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Nearly twice the number of eligible clients were recruited from control versus intervention pharmacies (41.6% versus 21.2%). A range of barriers and facilitators were identified by participating pharmacists and clients regarding SBI delivery. The main barrier for pharmacists was approaching clients for screening. Delivery of SBI was acceptable to most pharmacists and staff, however, future success of SBI in this setting will depend on identifying strategies for supporting practitioners in engaging pharmacy clients for screening.",

    "abstract": "Approximately half of all people with high alcohol consumption in Sweden fulfill criteria for either harmful consumption or dependence. Among the alcohol-dependent, the majority have dependence with low severity. They are also reluctant to seek treatment. This qualitative study, with data from seven focus group discussions and 14 individual interviews, aims to describe and explain how representations of alcohol consumption, dependence, and treatment create barriers to treatment. Thirty-two adults from the general population fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence participated. Most of the participants agreed that they were heavy drinkers but did not perceive themselves as alcohol dependent. Having alcohol problems, as well as realizing the need for and entering treatment, was associated with shame and stigma, producing a strong barrier to treatment. The participants’ knowledge about treatment was limited and somewhat faulty, as they thought that treatment mainly involves medication with disulfiram, lifelong abstinence, and inpatient care at rehabilitation clinics. As these treatments are socially restrictive and stigmatizing, this understanding created a barrier to treatment. While treatment for alcohol problems in primary care was seen as less stigmatizing, the expertise among general practitioners in this field was questioned. Results indicate that, to lower the threshold for treatment seeking, treatment services need to better match the needs and wishes of the potential service users as well as take stigmatization into account. Primary care practices and general practitioners need to market their ability to treat people with drinking problems. The clinical understanding of alcohol dependence needs to be expanded to include mild to moderate dependence, conditions which can be managed in primary care.",

    "abstract": "Health outcomes are key to patients and clinicians, but trials of alcohol brief intervention (BI) tend to focus on behavioral outcomes, while those finding positive effects on physical- or mental-health outcomes generally lack power to show robust effects. To test the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of BI for either hypertensive or depressed primary-care patients who drink alcohol above recommended levels, records at 25 English primary-care practices were searched for adult patients with risky drinking and comorbid hypertension or depression. Eligible patients were randomized to either a hypertension or depression arm, then to a control or intervention condition. They were screened for at-risk drinking using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Consenting respondents scoring >7 on the AUDIT completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (depression arm) or blood pressure measurement (hypertension arm) and received either BI or standard advice. At six-month follow-up, participants are again screened for alcohol use and comorbid condition. Seventeen practices (median adult patients, 7181; quartile 1, 5195, quartile 3, 8050) searched their databases. Fourteen percent of adult patients (median; quartile 1, 8.4%, quartile 3, 16.5%) drank above guidelines. Twenty percent of adult patients (median; quartile 1, 18.5%, quartile 3, 23.2%) were hypertensive, of which 5% (median; quartile 1, 3.9%, quartile 3, 5.3%) also drank heavily. Fourteen percent of adult patients had mild to moderate depression (median; quartile 1, 8.9%, quartile 3, 16.9%), of which 2% (median; quartile 1, 1.9%, quartile 3, 2.9%) also drank heavily. Of 2590 eligible patients, 633 (24%) completed the AUDIT. Thirty-five percent scored positively on the AUDIT in the hypertension arm, and 50% scored positively in the depression arm. Eighty patients were recruited to the hypertension arm, and recruitment to the depression arm is ongoing. Patients eligible for an RCT of BI for comorbid heavy drinking and hypertension or mild/moderate depression are identifiable in primary care records, though with variation among practices. Almost a quarter of these patients can be screened by mail for current alcohol use; more screen positively in the depression arm than in the hypertension arm. A trial in the hypertension arm seems most feasible.",

The first aim sought to supplement the VA's existing facility-level performance metrics with SUD program-level metrics in order to identify high-value targets for quality improvement. The second aim recognized that not all key processes are reflected in the administrative data, and even when they are, new insight may be gained from viewing these data in the context of day-to-day clinical practice.VA administrative data from fiscal year 2012 were used to calculate pre-admission metrics for 97 programs (63 SUD Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (SUD RRTPs); 34 Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (MH RRTPs) with a SUD track). Interviews were then conducted with management and front-line staff to learn what factors may have contributed to high or low performance, relative to the national average for their program type. We hypothesized that speaking directly to residential program staff may reveal innovative practices, areas for improvement, and factors that may explain system-wide variability in performance.Average wait time for admission was 16 days (SUD RRTPs: 17 days; MH RRTPs with a SUD track: 11 days), with 60% of Veterans waiting longer than 7 days. For these Veterans, engagement while waiting occurred in an average of 54% of the waiting weeks (range 3-100% across programs). Fifty-nine interviews representing 44 programs revealed factors perceived to potentially impact performance in these domains. Efficient screening processes, effective patient flow, and available beds were perceived to facilitate shorter wait times, while lack of beds, poor staffing levels, and lengths of stay of existing patients were thought to lengthen wait times. Accessible outpatient services, strong patient outreach, and strong encouragement of pre-admission outpatient treatment emerged as facilitators of engagement while waiting; poor staffing levels, socioeconomic barriers, and low patient motivation were viewed as barriers.Metrics for pre-admission processes can be helpful for monitoring residential SUD treatment programs. Interviewing program management and staff about drivers of performance metrics can play a complementary role by identifying innovative and other strong practices, as well as high-value targets for quality improvement. Key facilitators of high-performing facilities may offer programs with lower performance useful strategies to improve specific pre-admission processes.",

    "abstract": "Background: I examined patient demographic, clinical, payment, and geographic factors associated with admission to low-safety inpatient psychiatric facilities.Methods: Massachusetts all-payer 2017 discharge data (N = 39,128) were linked to facility-level indicators of safety (N = 38).A composite of safety performance was constructed by averaging standardized measures of restraint and seclusion, as well as five-year (2014-2018) averages of overall, substantiated, and abuse-related (verbal, physical, sexual abuse) complaints per 1,000 discharges (• = 0.73).This composite informed the grouping of high (top 20%), middle, and low-safety (bottom 20%) performers.I first examined unadjusted differences across safety groups, as well as differences in bypass patterns across racial and ethnic groups.I then fit a series of multinomial regression models, adding payment and geography separately.Results: Outstanding factors independently associated with admission to low-safety facilities were being a racial or ethnic minority compared to White patient (relative risk ratio [RRR] for non-Hispanic Black = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.5-2.0;non-Hispanic Asian = 5.6, 95% CI = 3.6 -8.7; non-Hispanic \"other\" race =2.2, 95% CI = 1.7 -2.7; Hispanic/Latinx = 1.3, CI = 1.1 -1.5), and not having private insurance (RRR for uninsured/self-pay = 2.4, CI = 1.6 -3.6, Medicaid = 1.8, CI = 1.6 -2.0, Medicare = 1.3, CI = 1.2 -1.5).Several other factors were independently associated with admission to low-safety facilities, such as substance use disorder other than alcohol, proximity, severity, schizophrenia/ psychosis, homelessness, and younger age. Conclusion:There were considerable racial and ethnic inequities in admission to low-safety inpatient psychiatric facilities even after accounting for clinical, geographic, and payment characteristics.Future research should further examine quality variation and outcomes, as well as how community-based referrals, mode of transport (e.g., police, self ), and deliberate steering and selection affect admissions and outcomes.A2 \"Desafíos Enredados (entangled challenges): an intersectional examination of risk factors linked to substance use among sexual and gender minority Latinx individuals\" (AW02)",

    "abstract": "Juvenile Justice-Translational Research on Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System (JJ-TRIALS) is a cooperative implementation science initiative launched by NIDA in July 2013. The project seeks to reduce unmet substance use disorder needs for delinquent youth under community supervision by assisting juvenile justice (JJ) agencies in their efforts to implement best practices and improve service utilization along a behavioral health services cascade (screening, assessment, referral, initiation into treatment, and retention in treatment). Although many youth under JJ supervision have substance use and associated mental health disorders, there are numerous gaps in the identification of these problems and referral to appropriate services. Linkages between the JJ and behavioral health systems can be problematic because of the lack of shared mission, limited training of JJ staff on behavioral health issues, and limited sharing of information across service systems. Ideally, JJ staff will screen and assess youth for substance use and related disorders, and refer them to appropriate evidence-based treatment when needed; the youth should initiate treatment and be retained for a clinically effective period. The ultimate goal is to maximize the proportion of substance-involved youth identified and retained in treatment. Based on the HIV services cascade, we developed a conceptual framework, the Behavioral Health Services Cascade. This framework provides a useful heuristic for visualizing and measuring movement through the continuum of services. It illustrates the level of unmet needs at different points and provides a measurement framework for tracking improvements in reducing unmet needs. The model helps agency staff and leadership and policymakers understand the sequential and related stages of the services continuum and identify stages/linkage points that may need improvements. In the main JJ-TRIALS protocol, we are using the cascade framework to: 1) monitor and evaluate the primary outcome of reducing unmet service needs; 2) use local data to populate the cascade and provide feedback to agencies for need assessments and site feedback reports; and 3) help site staff select and monitor strategic goals to reduce gaps in one or more component of the cascade. We will also be developing measures related to the quality of the services delivered at each point in the cascade. Some challenges being addressed include: 1) defining and collecting consistent measures across multiple states and counties; 2) inconsistency in data availability across sites, especially on treatment engagement and continuing care; and 3) accounting for multiple and sometimes nonlinear processes at different points in the cascade.",

According to the ESPAD study, many European countries have to deal with a high prevalence of alcohol use amongst adolescents. Alcohol use has been associated with ADHD, autism, negative health behaviour, and neurocognitive damage. Parental rules are a major risk factor for alcohol use in adolescents.\r\n\r\nTo psychosocially screen, educate and follow-up on adolescents admitted with alcohol intoxication.\r\n\r\nIn January 2009 a protocol was implemented for the follow-up on adolescents admitted with alcohol intoxication. Screening for chronic alcohol abuse, underlying psychological disorders and social problems was done by the pediatrician and child-psychologist. Information on the dangers of alcohol use was given to adolescents and their parents. During 2009 and 2010 a total of 350 children were invited to the program, of which 204 were screened. Of the 16-year-old adolescents 61% stopped drinking, and 88,5% stopped binge-drinking at 6 months follow-up. In 82,5% parents reported to have implemented specific alcohol rules at follow-up. A total of 90% adolescents were screened with behavioral questionnaires, and 41,2% had psychosocial problems. In clinical practice, history taking of these adolescents revealed shocking stories on social, psychological or alcohol related issues. By informing adolescents and their parents during a clinical and outpatient setting the window of opportunity is widened and alcohol use can be decreased. Underlying social and psychological problems are frequent, serious and should be evaluated in adolescents admitted with alcohol intoxication.",

    "abstract": "The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) is a three-item alcohol screening questionnaire where threshold scores of ≥4 for men and ≥3 for women have been associated with a higher risk of alcohol misuse. However, some response patterns yield inconsistencies: some individuals who report drinking within National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) recommended limits on the individual AUDIT-C screen positive based on the AUDIT-C score, and some who report exceeding drinking limits on the individual AUDIT-C screen negative based on the AUDIT-C score. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of discordant AUDIT-C screening results and reported drinking on the individual AUDIT-C questions among men and women who reported drinking alcohol in the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) (n = 26,210) and to discuss the implications of this discordance for brief interventions. Among men in the US population-based sample, 5.0% had negative screens despite reporting risky drinking, and 8.8% had positive screens while reporting drinking within recommended limits. Among women, 0.8% had negative screens despite report of risky drinking, and 17.4% had positive screens despite reporting drinking within recommended limits. Of those with negative screens, all individuals who exceeded drinking limits reported heavy episodic drinking on AUDIT-C question 3, suggesting that brief interventions for heavy episodic drinking can be offered to 5% of men and about 1% of women who do not screen positive on the AUDIT-C. Patients who screen positive on the AUDIT-C despite not reporting risky drinking can be advised explicitly about drinking limits and told that, although they are not reporting drinking above the recommended limits, some patients with similar scores develop problems due to drinking. Web-based screening and brief intervention programs offer an opportunity to provide appropriate and specific feedback to address discordant AUDIT-C response patterns.",

    "abstract": "Although brief intervention (BI) for alcohol and other drug problems has been associated with subsequent decreased levels of self-reported substance use, there is little information in the extant literature as to whether individuals with co-occurring hazardous substance use and mental illness would benefit from BI to the same extent as those without mental illness. This is an important question, as mental illness is estimated to co-occur in 37% of individuals with an alcohol use disorder and in more than 50% of individuals with a drug use disorder. The goal of this study was to explore differences in self-reported alcohol and/or drug use in patients with and without mental illness diagnoses six months after receiving BI in a hospital emergency department (ED).This study took advantage of a naturalistic situation where a screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) program had been implemented in nine large EDs in the US state of Washington as part of a national SBIRT initiative. A subset of patients who received BI was interviewed six months later about current alcohol and drug use. Linear regression was used to assess whether change in substance use measures differed among patients with a mental illness diagnosis compared with those without. Data were analyzed for both a statewide (n = 828) and single-hospital (n = 536) sample.No significant differences were found between mentally ill and non-mentally ill subgroups in either sample with regard to self-reported hazardous substance use at six-month follow-up.These results suggest that BI may not have a differing impact based on the presence of a mental illness diagnosis. Given the high prevalence of mental illness among individuals with alcohol and other drug problems, this finding may have important public health implications.",

    "abstract": "Hazardous alcohol use is a function of implicit cognition, i.e., nonconscious influences on appetitive behavior stemming from memory associations that are automatically activated upon exposure to alcohol cues. Implicit cognition is typically not addressed by alcohol brief intervention (BI), which targets explicit or conscious processes underlying alcohol restraint (e.g., readiness-to-change). The potential role of implicit cognition in BI outcomes has not been well-studied. Eighty-nine hazardous drinking college students (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT] score > 8) participated in a general health study for course credit. Students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: assessment only or a 10-15 minute motivational intervention. Students completed measures of alcohol use and readiness-to-change at baseline and at 6-week follow-up. In addition, they completed an alcohol-specific implicit association test (a response-time measure of alcohol approach). The motivational intervention resulted in a significant increase in readiness-to-change immediately following the intervention. However, the effect of the intervention on change in quantity of alcohol use per drinking occasion at follow-up was significantly moderated by implicit cognition. Simple slopes analyses showed that those with low implicit appetitive responses showed significantly less drinking when exposed to the intervention condition, while those with high implicit cognition did not. Similarly, readiness-to-change scores predicted declines in drinking for those low in implicit cognition but not for those who showed high levels of implicit cognition. These results suggest that the effect of brief motivational intervention may be less effective among those with strong implicit alcohol-approach associations, and that implicit cognition may be important to address in subsequent BI development.",

    "abstract": "In making the case for considering quality-of-life outcomes in the treatment of addiction (Addiction Science & Clinical Practice, July 2011 [1]), Dr. Alexandre Laudet argues that reduced substance abuse is not in itself an adequate criterion for recovery [p. 49]. In this respect, however, management of drug dependence is no different than the almost universal approach to assessing care of all other chronic medical conditions. For example, in treating patients with diabetes or hypertension, the overwhelming (usually exclusive) focus is on the maintenance of blood sugar and blood pressure levels; in the treatment of epilepsy, efficacy is a function of the elimination or reduction in frequency of seizures. It is difficult to argue with Dr. Laudet's view that it would be appropriate and useful to ask substance abuse patients, Overall, how satisfied are you with your life?, but how often is this question posed by clinicians treating other chronic medical ailments?\r\n\r\nParadoxically, providers of substance abuse treatment demonstrate both too much and too little focus on quality-of-life parameters. Thus, with regard to medication-assisted treatment, most programs set criteria for termination based on attendance, adherence to counseling schedules, and urine toxicology results, and they apply these criteria rigidly, with no regard whatsoever as to how favorably the patient judges her or his improved overall condition. Other programs, however, make demands on patients that far transcend the primary problem they treat--drug dependence--and in some cases even discharge patients who fail to find employment within a specified period of time, even when illicit drug use has ceased altogether [2].\r\n\r\nThe best approach would seem to be to apply to addiction treatment precisely the same perspectives and practices, good and bad, as are commonplace in the care of all other chronic ailments.",

    "abstract": "Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) for substance use has received a great deal of empirical support. Despite the evidence for effectiveness of SBIRT and a compelling rationale for its integration into health-care settings, the circumstances under which it is likely to be implemented and sustained remain elusive. In this project, SBIRT was implemented into emergency departments (EDs) and primary care practices (PCPs) within a large, integrated health system in New York serving areas heavily affected by Hurricane Sandy. The SBIRT model was implemented in the following way: 1) Front-line staff (e.g., nurses and medical office assistants) administered a five-item SBIRT prescreen for alcohol, drug, and tobacco use to all patients during triage; 2) If a positive prescreen resulted, a health educator conducted a full screen using the AUDIT and/or DAST-10; and 3) The health educator conducted a brief intervention and referral to addiction treatment as indicated by the full-screen score. To assist in building the SBIRT process into the normal site workflow, prescreening questions were integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR) in a user-friendly way for front-line staff to administer. The EMR automatically scored the prescreen. As of May 2014, SBIRT was implemented in three EDs and two PCPs within the health system, with services starting on 12/1/13. Implementation was evaluated by reviewing EMR data as well as patient data collected at each site. Approximately 13000 patients were prescreened (13% positive). More women than men were prescreened (61% female), and there was a significant older population (9% were 18–24; 39% were 55 or older), as well as diversity in ethnicity (24% Latino) and race (19% African American). Almost 900 full screens were conducted (50% positive), which resulted in 284 brief interventions and 149 referrals to brief or formal addiction treatment. Further analysis revealed that multiple substances were an issue for many patients. For example, 20 percent of patients were positive on both the AUDIT and the DAST-10, and 39 percent of patients who full-screened positive for drugs or alcohol also screened positive for past-year tobacco use. Severity of full-screening scores was greater in the ED setting as compared to the PCP setting. Thirty-nine percent of patients who full-screened positive reported marijuana use in the past 30 days, and 14 percent were daily marijuana users. Overall, results suggest that SBIRT was successfully implemented in several busy sites within this large health system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The cervical cancer burden is high among women living in Appalachia. Cigarette smoking, a cervical cancer risk factor, is also highly prevalent in this population. This project aims to increase smoking cessation among women living in Appalachia by embedding a smoking cessation program within a larger, integrated cervical cancer prevention program. Methods The broader program, the Take CARE study, is a multi-site research collaborative designed to address three risk factors for cervical cancer incidence and mortality: tobacco use, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and cervical cancer screening. Break Free is a primary care clinic-based implementation program that aims to promote smoking cessation among female smokers in Appalachia by standardizing clinical practice protocols. Break Free includes: (1) implementation of a tobacco user identification system in the Electronic Health Record, (2) clinic staff and provider training on the Ask, Advise and Refer (AAR) model, (3) provider implementation of AAR to identify and treat women who want to quit smoking within the next 6 months, (4) facilitated access to cessation phone counseling plus pharmacotherapy, and (5) the bundling of Break Free tobacco cessation with HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening interventions in an integrated approach to cervical cancer prevention. The study spans 35 Appalachian health clinics across 10 healthcare systems. We aim to enroll 51 adult female smokers per health system (total N = 510). Baseline and follow-up data will be obtained from participant (provider and patient) surveys. The primary outcome is self-reported 12-month point prevalence abstinence among enrolled patients. All randomized patients are asked to complete follow-up surveys, regardless of whether they participated in tobacco treatment. Data analysis of the primary aims will follow intent-to-treat methodology. Secondary outcomes will assess program implementation and cost effectiveness. Discussion Addressing high tobacco use rates is critical for reducing cervical cancer morbidity and mortality among women living in Appalachia. This study evaluates the implementation and effectiveness of a smoking cessation program in increasing smoking cessation among female smokers. If results demonstrate effectiveness and sustainability, implementation of this program into other health care clinics could reduce both rates of smoking and cervical cancer.

Addressing these health inequities requires local monitoring of alcohol and other drug use. While culturally appropriate methods for measuring drinking patterns among Indigenous Australians have been established, no similar methods are available for measuring other drug use patterns (amount and frequency of consumption).

The Drug Survey App will be co-designed with stakeholders including Indigenous Australian health professionals, addiction specialists, community leaders, and researchers. The App will allow participants to describe their drug use flexibly with an interactive, visual interface. The validity of estimated consumption patterns, and risk assessments will be tested against those made in clinical interviews conducted by Indigenous Australian health professionals. We will then trial the App as a population survey tool by using the App to determine the prevalence of substance use in two Indigenous communities. The App could empower Indigenous Australian communities to conduct independent research that informs local prevention and treatment efforts.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use is a significant risk factor for disability and death in U.S. adults, and approximately one out of every six Veterans seen in primary care (PC) report unhealthy alcohol use. Unhealthy alcohol use is associated with increased risk for poor medical outcomes, substantial societal costs, and death, including suicide. Based on substantial evidence from randomized controlled trials and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, VA/DoD clinical guidelines stipulate that all Veterans screening positive for unhealthy alcohol use should receive evidence-based alcohol care in PC, including brief counseling interventions (BI) and additional treatment (e.g., pharmacotherapy) for those with alcohol use disorders (AUD). The VA pioneered implementing alcohol screening and BI in PC, yet substantial implementation gaps remain. To improve alcohol-related care, this study will conduct a pilot study to assess whether a multi-faceted evidence-based implementation strategy-practice facilitation-has the potential to improve PC-based alcohol-related care at a single VA clinic. We will first recruit and conduct qualitative interviews with Veterans with unhealthy alcohol use (n = 20-25) and PC stakeholders (N = 10-15) to understand barriers and facilitators to high-quality alcohol care and use results to refine and hone the multifaceted practice facilitation intervention. Qualitative interviews, analysis, and refinement of the intervention will be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Focus groups with a small sample of PC providers and staff (n = 5-7) will be used to further refine the practice facilitation intervention and assess its acceptability and feasibility. The refined practice facilitation intervention will then be offered in the PC clinic to assess implementation (e.g., reach) and effectiveness (reduced drinking) outcomes based on the RE-AIM framework. This research directly addresses one of the largest public health crises of our time, as alcohol kills more people than opioids and is associated with increased risk of suicide. If successful, this pilot may generate an intervention with far-reaching effects on adverse outcomes experienced by Veterans with unhealthy alcohol use, including increased access to care and suicide prevention.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use during pregnancy can cause significant harm to women and their developing fetuses. Despite recommendations for abstinence during pregnancy, some women continue to use, making screening for substance use during antenatal clinic attendances an important strategy for reducing risk. This study aims to improve the rates of screening and intervention for substance use among pregnant women, including appropriate referral for those who may be substance-dependent. The protocol outlined here focuses on a multi-stage implementation study. Methods This study will occur in four phases. Phase 1 will identify a baseline rate of screening and subsequent care at the antenatal clinics of two, South Australian hospital-based maternity services, through a retrospective case note audit. Rates of self-reported substance use identified in the case notes will also be compared against representative data from Adelaide Primary Health Network to establish rates of over or underreporting. Phase 2 will involve an online Training Needs Analysis of midwifery staff working at those services, to assess their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and commitment to the care of women who use substances during pregnancy. Phase 3 will involve a training package for all midwifery staff at those services, focused on routine screening for substance use, and how to provide appropriate care. Outcome measures from phase 2 will be reassessed during phase 3 and any changes since training will be evaluated. Phase 4 will then repeat phase 1 to compare the changes in rates of both screening and any associated intervention before and after training. Discussion From a public health perspective, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on reducing risk of harm from substance use disorders among pregnant women, and contribute to better health outcomes for their children.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and short messaging service (SMS)-based tobacco cessation interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing tobacco use in many populations, but evidence is needed on which tailored treatments are most efficacious in meeting the complex medical and psychosocial factors confronting people living with HIV (PLWH) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This paper describes the protocol of a study to test the efficacy of both NRT and a tailored SMS-based tobacco use cessation intervention among PLWH in Uganda and Zambia. Methods In a randomized controlled trial, 800 adult PLWH who use tobacco will be recruited by health care professionals at HIV treatment centers where they are receiving care. Participants will be randomized to one of the four study arms: (1) standard of care [SOC; brief clinician advice to quit combined with HIV education and information aimed at encouraging HIV treatment adherence (with no mention of tobacco) delivered via text messages]; (2) SOC + 12 weeks of NRT; (3) SOC + 6 weeks of SMS text messages to support quitting tobacco use (SMS); or (4) SOC + NRT + SMS. Participants will receive a cell phone and solar panel with power bank for charging the phone. The main outcome is cessation of tobacco use by study participants verified by urinary cotinine (&lt; 15 ng/mL) at 6 months post-enrollment. As a secondary tobacco use outcome, we will measure 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (7 consecutive days of no tobacco use) measured by self-report and biochemically-verified at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months post enrollment. Discussion Our study will provide insight into the efficacy, feasibility and applicability of delivering tobacco cessation interventions through health care professionals combined with tailored tobacco cessation SMS text messaging in two countries with different tobacco use patterns, policy environments, and health care resources and provide needed information to providers and policymakers looking for cost-effective tobacco cessation interventions. The previously tested SMS-platform to be used in our study is uniquely positioned to be scaled in low- and middle-income countries worldwide, in which case evidence of even modest success in reducing the prevalence of tobacco consumption among PLWH could confer enormous health and economic benefits.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Communities That HEAL (CTH) is a novel, data-driven community-engaged intervention designed to reduce opioid overdose deaths by increasing community engagement, adoption of an integrated set of evidence-based practices, and delivering a communications campaign across healthcare, behavioral-health, criminal-legal, and other community-based settings. The implementation of such a complex initiative requires up-front investments of time and other expenditures (i.e., start-up costs). Despite the importance of these start-up costs in investment decisions to stakeholders, they are typically excluded from cost-effectiveness analyses. The objective of this study is to report a detailed analysis of CTH start-up costs pre-intervention implementation and to describe the relevance of these data for stakeholders to determine implementation feasibility. Methods This study is guided by the community perspective, reflecting the investments that a real-world community would need to incur to implement the CTH intervention. We adopted an activity-based costing approach, in which resources related to hiring, training, purchasing, and community dashboard creation were identified through macro- and micro-costing techniques from 34 communities with high rates of fatal opioid overdoses, across four states—Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. Resources were identified and assigned a unit cost using administrative and semi-structured-interview data. All cost estimates were reported in 2019 dollars. Results State-level average and median start-up cost (representing 8–10 communities per state) were $268,657 and $175,683, respectively. Hiring and training represented 40%, equipment and infrastructure costs represented 24%, and dashboard creation represented 36% of the total average start-up cost. Comparatively, hiring and training represented 49%, purchasing costs represented 18%, and dashboard creation represented 34% of the total median start-up cost. Conclusion We identified three distinct CTH hiring models that affected start-up costs: hospital-academic (Massachusetts), university-academic (Kentucky and Ohio), and community-leveraged (New York). Hiring, training, and purchasing start-up costs were lowest in New York due to existing local infrastructure. Community-based implementation similar to the New York model may have lower start-up costs due to leveraging of existing infrastructure, relationships, and support from local health departments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) is a widely used screening tool for identifying patterns of cannabis use that have negative health or social consequences for both the user and others involved. This brief screening instrument has been translated into multiple languages, and several studies examining its psychometric properties have been published. However, studies on the factorial validity and psychometric properties of a Moroccan version of the CAST are not yet available. The objective of this study is to validate the CAST, translated, and adapted to the Moroccan Arabic dialect among persons with cannabis use. Methods A total of 370 participants from an addictology center in Fez City, were selected over two phases to form the study sample. First, in phase I, exploratory factor analysis was employed to evaluate the factor structure in the pilot sample (n 1 = 150). Subsequently, in the second phase (Phase II), confirmatory factor analysis was utilized to confirm this structure in the validation sample (n 2 = 220). All statistical analyses were carried out using the R program. Results The CFA unveiled a three-factor structure that showed a good overall fit (χ2/df = 2.23, RMSEA = 0.07, SRMR = 0.02, CFI = 0.99, NFI = 0.98) and satisfactory local parameters (standardized factor loadings between 0.72 and 0.88). The model demonstrates satisfactory reliability and convergent validity, as evidenced by the acceptable values of composite reliability (CR) (0.76–0.88) and average variance extracted (AVE) (0.62–0.78), respectively. The square roots of the AVE exceeded the correlations of the factor pairs, and the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio of the correlation values was below 0.85, indicating acceptable discriminant validity. Conclusion The reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity tests all demonstrated that the Moroccan version of the CAST performed well and can be considered a valid tool for screening of problematic cannabis use.",

The Navigation Services to Avoid Rehospitalization (NavSTAR) trial found that a patient navigation intervention for hospitalized patients with comorbid SUDs reduced subsequent inpatient admissions compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU). Methods This secondary analysis extends previous findings from the NavSTAR trial by examining whether selected patient characteristics independently predicted hospital service utilization and moderated the effect of the NavSTAR intervention. Participants were 400 medical/surgical hospital patients with comorbid SUDs. We analyzed 30- and 90-day inpatient readmissions (one or more readmissions) and cumulative incidence of inpatient admissions through 12 months using multivariable logistic and negative binomial regression, respectively. Results Consistent with primary findings and controlling for patient factors, NavSTAR participants were less likely than TAU participants to be readmitted within 30 ( P = 0.001) and 90 ( P = 0.03) days and had fewer total readmissions over 12 months ( P = 0.008). Hospitalization in the previous year ( P &lt; 0.001) was associated with cumulative readmissions over 12 months, whereas Medicaid insurance ( P = 0.03) and index diagnoses of infection ( P = 0.001) and injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications ( P = 0.004) were associated with fewer readmissions. None of the selected covariates moderated the effect of the NavSTAR intervention. Conclusions Previous findings showed that patient navigation could reduce repeat hospital admissions among patients with comorbid SUDs. Several patient factors were independently associated with readmission. Future research should investigate risk factors for hospital readmission among patients with comorbid SUDs to optimize interventions.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background As the return to alcohol use in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) is common during treatment and recovery, it is important that abstinence motivation is maintained after such critical incidences. Our study aims to explore how individuals with AUD participating in an app-based intervention with telephone coaching after inpatient treatment perceived their abstinence motivation after the return to alcohol use, whether their app use behavior was affected and to identify helpful factors to maintain abstinence motivation. Methods Using a mixed-methods approach, ten participants from the intervention group of the randomized controlled trial SmartAssistEntz who returned to alcohol use and recorded this in the app Appstinence , a smartphone application with telephone coaching designed for individuals with AUD, were interviewed about their experiences. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded using qualitative content analysis. App use behavior was additionally examined by using log data. Results Of the ten interviewees, seven reported their abstinence motivation increased after the return to alcohol use. Reasons included the reminder of negative consequences of drinking, the desire to regain control of their situation as well as the perceived support provided by the app. App data showed that app use remained stable after the return to alcohol use with an average of 58.70 days of active app use ( SD = 25.96, Mdn = 58.50, range = 24–96, IQR = 44.25) after the return to alcohol use which was also indicated by the participants’ reported use behavior. Conclusions The findings of the study tentatively suggest that the app can provide support to individuals after the return to alcohol use to maintain and increase motivation after the incidence. Future research should (1) focus on specifically enhancing identification of high risk situations and reach during such critical incidences, (2) actively integrate the experience of the return to alcohol use into app-based interventions to better support individuals in achieving their personal AUD behavior change goals, and (3) investigate what type of support individuals might need who drop out of the study and intervention and discontinue app use altogether.

This study aims to investigate factors related to confidence in providing methadone treatment among primary care providers in Vietnam to inform good practice development. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 276 primary care providers who were physicians, physician assistants, nurses, pharmacists or dispensing staff from 67 communes in a mountainous province in Northern Vietnam. Using self-report scales, we measured providers’ confidence in providing methadone treatment, beliefs in harm reduction, perceived work-related support, perceived stigma and risk in working with drug-using patients, and empathy towards this population. We used multiple linear regression analyses to explore factors associated with providers’ confidence in providing methadone treatment in the whole sample and to compare two groups of providers who did and did not have experience providing methadone. Potential associated factors were measured at facility and provider levels. Result 114 (41.3%) participants had previously experience in providing methadone treatment. Providers with methadone treatment experiences had higher confidence in and more accurate knowledge of methadone treatment, perceived less stigma of working with drug-using patients, and reported more work-related support than those without experiences. Higher medical education is associated with lower confidence in providing methadone treatment among providers without methadone experiences, but higher confidence among providers with methadone experiences. Better methadone knowledge was associated with greater confidence in providing methadone treatment among inexperienced providers but not among those with experiences. Receiving work-related support was associated with greater confidence in providing treatment in both groups, regardless of their past methadone experiences. Conclusion In rural provinces where methadone treatment has been expanded to primary care clinics, interventions to improve primary care providers’ confidence should benefit professionals with diverse experiences in providing methadone treatment. Continued training and support at work for providers is essential to ensuring quality in decentralized methadone treatment.",

Design Cross sectional mixed methods interview, incorporating a social network ‘egonet interview’ approach asking about whether participants had interactions with a range of substance use, health, social care or third sector organisations, or informal social interactions. Setting Five Alcohol and Drug Partnership Areas in Scotland. Participants 57 (42% women) participants were involved in the study, on average 42 years old. Measurements Five-point Likert scale reporting whether interactions with a range of services and people had gotten much better, better, no different (or no change), worse, or much worse since COVID19 and lockdown. Ratings were nested within participants (Individuals provided multiple ratings) and some ratings were also nested within treatment service (services received multiple ratings). The nested structure was accounted for using cross classified ordinal logistic multilevel models. Findings While the overall average suggested only a slight negative change in interactions (mean rating 2.93), there were substantial variations according to type of interaction, and between individuals. Reported change was more often negative for mental health services (Adjusted OR = 0.93 95% CI 0.17,0.90), and positive for pharmacies (3.03 95% CI 1.36, 5.93). The models found between-participant variation of around 10%, and negligible between-service variation of around 1% in ratings. Ratings didn’t vary by individual age or gender but there was variation between areas. Conclusions Substance use treatment service adaptations due to COVID19 lockdown led to both positive and negative service user experiences. Social network methods provide an effective way to describe complex system-wide interaction patterns, and to measure variations at the individual, service, and area level.",

This study aims to explore practitioners’ views and experiences from treatment of ageing OAT patients. Methods Data were collected as a series of semi-structured interviews with treatment staff (roles interviewed: doctor, psychologist, social worker, nurse, and learning disability nurse). Participants were recruited from three OAT outpatient clinics, one with an urban catchment area and two with a mix of urban and rural. The interviews incorporated questions on patients’ somatic and mental health, strengths and weaknesses of the service for this group, and patients’ quality of life. Results Older patients were perceived to be more often stable in terms of substance use and housing situation, but also experiencing some key challenges in terms of cognitive impairment, loneliness and isolation, and comorbidities. Both the practitioner-patient relationship and healthcare interactions outside OAT had the potential to impact treatment quality positively or negatively depending on how they were managed. Conclusions Treating older patients in a way that respects and enhances their dignity is important. We argue that this requires better services for those whose functioning is impacted by cognitive impairment/dementia, an age-informed treatment model for this patient group, along with urgent work to improve municipal-level services given practitioners describe them as unacceptable in certain areas.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The 15-method is a targeted screening and treatment approach for alcohol problems in primary care. The 15-method used in primary care has proven as effective as specialized treatment for mild to moderate alcohol dependence in Sweden. A feasibility study of the 15-method in Danish primary care found the method acceptable and feasible. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of the 15-method in a Danish primary care setting in (1) lowering the proportion of patients exceeding the Danish low-risk alcohol consumption limit of ten standard units per week and a maximum of four standard units on a single day for men and women, and (2) increasing the likelihood of alcohol use being addressed during a consultation in general practice. Further, the rate of prescribed pharmacological treatment for alcohol problems (Disulfiram, Naltrexone, Acamprosate, and Nalmefene) will be measured along with the use of the biomarkers Alanine Transaminase and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase. METHODS: Stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial in sixteen general practices in the Region of Southern Denmark. Following a three-month baseline, the practices are randomly assigned to launch dates in one of four clusters. General practitioners and nurses receive three hours of training in the 15-method before launch. Patient questionnaires will collect data on alcohol consumption levels among patients affiliated with the practices. The healthcare professionals will register consultations in which alcohol is addressed in their patient filing system. Pharmacological treatment rates and the use of biomarkers will be collected through Danish national registries. The study follows the Medical Research Council's guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions. DISCUSSION: From the patient's perspective, the 15-method may help identify alcohol-related problems at an earlier stage with flexible treatment offers in a familiar setting. For healthcare professionals, it addresses a traditionally challenging topic by equipping them with concrete tools, communication training, and clear treatment directives. From a societal perspective, primary care holds a unique position to identify hazardous and harmful alcohol use across different age groups, with potential public health and economic benefits through early identification and intervention.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Overdose deaths continue to rise within the United States, despite effective treatments such as buprenorphine and methadone for opioid use disorder (OUD). Mobile medical units with the ability to dispense buprenorphine have been developed to engage patients and eliminate barriers to accessing OUD treatment. This study reports survey responses of patients of a mobile medical unit dispensing buprenorphine in areas of Chicago, IL with high overdose rates. Methods All patients who were dispensed buprenorphine via the mobile medical unit were invited to participate in a 7-item anonymous survey between May 24, 2023, and August 25, 2023. The survey included 5-point satisfaction scale, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions. Outcomes included satisfaction with buprenorphine dispensing from the mobile medical unit, satisfaction with filling buprenorphine at a pharmacy in the past, barriers experienced at pharmacies when filling buprenorphine, and whether the client would have started treatment that day if the mobile medical unit had not been present. Satisfaction scale and multiple-choice question responses were assessed using descriptive statistics. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare median satisfaction levels between receiving buprenorphine from the mobile medical unit versus filling a buprenorphine prescription at a community pharmacy. Open-ended questions were analyzed qualitatively using inductive thematic analysis. Results 106 unique patients were dispensed buprenorphine from the mobile unit during the study period. Of these patients, 54 (51%) completed the survey. Respondents reported high satisfaction with the buprenorphine dispensing process as a part of a mobile medical unit. Of those who had previously filled buprenorphine at a pharmacy, 83% reported at least one barrier, with delays in prescription dispensing from a community pharmacy, lack of transportation to/from the pharmacy, and opioid withdrawal symptoms being the most common barriers. 87% reported they would not have started buprenorphine that same day if the mobile medical unit had not been present. Nearly half of survey participants reported having taken buprenorphine that was not prescribed to them. Qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses noted the importance of convenient accessibility, comprehensive care, and a non-judgmental environment. Conclusions Mobile medical units that dispense buprenorphine are an innovative model to reach patients with OUD who have significant treatment access barriers. This study found that patients who experienced barriers to accessing buprenorphine from a pharmacy were highly satisfied with the mobile medical unit’s buprenorphine dispensing process. Programs seeking to develop mobile buprenorphine dispensing programs should consider patient priorities of accessibility, comprehensive care, and welcoming, non-judgmental environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In the U.S. there are significant racial and gender disparities in the uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Black Americans represented 14% of PrEP users in 2022, but accounted for 42% of new HIV diagnoses in 2021 and in the South, Black people represented 48% of new HIV diagnoses in 2021 but only 21% of PrEP users in 2022. Women who use drugs may be even less likely than women who do not use drugs have initiated PrEP. Moreover, women involved in community supervision programs (CSP) are less likely to initiate or use PrEP, More PrEP interventions that focus on Black women with recent history of drug use in CSPs are needed to reduce inequities in PrEP uptake. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis from a randomized clinical trial with a sub-sample ( n = 336) of the total ( N = 352) participants from the parent study (E-WORTH), who tested HIV negative at baseline were considered PrEP-eligible. Black women were recruited from CSPs in New York City (NYC), with recent substance use. Participants were randomized to either E-WORTH ( n = 172) an HIV testing plus, receive a 5-session, culturally-tailored, group-based HIV prevention intervention, versus an HIV testing control group ( n = 180). The 5 sessions included an introduction to PrEP and access. This paper reports outcomes on improved awareness of PrEP, willingness to use PrEP, and PrEP uptake over the 12-month follow-up period. HIV outcomes are reported in a previous paper. Results Compared to control participants, participants in this study assigned to E-WORTH had significantly greater odds of being aware of PrEP as a biomedical HIV prevention strategy (OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.64–6.46, p = 0.001), and indicated a greater willingness to use PrEP as an HIV prevention method (b = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.06–0.32, p = 0.004) over the entire 12-month follow-up period. Conclusions These findings underscore the effectiveness of a culturally-tailored intervention for Black women in CSP settings in increasing awareness, and intention to initiate PrEP. Low uptake of PrEP in both arms highlight the need for providing more robust PrEP-on-demand strategies that are integrated into other services such as substance abuse treatment.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Opioid related overdose morbidity and mortality continue to significantly impact rural communities. Nationwide, emergency departments (EDs) have seen an increase in opioid use disorder (OUD)-related visits compared to other substance use disorders (SUD). ED-initiated buprenorphine is associated with increased treatment engagement at 30 days. However, few studies assess rural ED-initiated buprenorphine implementation, which has unique implementation barriers. This protocol outlines the rationale and methods of a rural ED-initiated buprenorphine program implementation study. Methods This is a two-year longitudinal implementation design with repeated qualitative and quantitative measures of an ED-initiated buprenorphine program in the rural Mountain West. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework outlines intervention assessments. The primary outcome is implementation measured by ED-initiated buprenorphine protocol core components. Reach, adoption, and maintenance are secondary outcomes. External facilitators from an academic institution with addiction medicine and prior program implementation expertise partnered with community hospital internal facilitators to form an implementation team. External facilitators provide ongoing support, recommendations, education, and academic detailing. The implementation team designed and implemented the rural ED-initiated buprenorphine program. The program includes OUD screening, low-threshold buprenorphine initiation, naloxone distribution and administration training, and patient navigator incorporation to provide warm hand off referrals for outpatient OUD management. To address rural based implementation barriers, we organized implementation strategies based on Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC). Implementation strategies include ED workflow redesign, local needs assessments, ED staff education, hospital leadership and clinical champion involvement, as well as patient and community resources engagement. Discussion Most ED-initiated buprenorphine implementation studies have been conducted in urban settings, with few involving rural areas and none have been done in the rural Mountain West. Rural EDs face unique barriers, but tailored implementation strategies with external facilitation support may help address these. This protocol could help identify effective rural ED-initiated buprenorphine implementation strategies to integrate more accessible OUD treatment within rural communities to prevent further morbidity and mortality.

Optimal provision of this care to individuals on community supervision (i.e., probation) requires an understanding of this unique and complex system at the local level. Methods We conducted in-depth individual interviews with key treatment providers and probation staff ( n = 10) involved with the provision of MOUD to individuals on community supervision in the Northeast. Interviews explored perspectives on the provision of MOUD and support services during the community supervision period. Thematic analysis was conducted to describe inductive and deductive codes, subcodes, and themes. Results Stakeholders shared diverse attitudes about the benefits and drawbacks of MOUD utilization. The provision of MOUD during the community supervision period was perceived to be influenced by both treatment and probation organizational characteristics, including the structures and values of the agencies. As such, the specific context of the community supervision setting facilitated and impeded MOUD delivery. Persistent challenges to enhancing MOUD delivery to this population remain including widespread MOUD stigma, inter-agency communication issues, and structural barriers to healthcare (i.e., transportation, finances). Conclusions There are opportunities to enhance access to evidence-based OUD treatment for persons on community supervision by engaging probation agencies and community treatment staff in systems change.",

    "abstract": "South Africa is marked by high rates of both HIV and alcohol use, and there is a detrimental synergistic relationship between these two epidemics. The Institute of Medicine recommends integrated care for alcohol use treatment and HIV, but implementation of integrated services remains a challenge in South Africa. This protocol describes a study designed to evaluate trainer, provider-, and patient encounter-level outcomes relating to the national rollout of a cascade train-the-trainer model of task-sharing to build capacity of the HIV workforce to deliver Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to address risky alcohol use. This 5 year protocol consists of two phases. First, we will finalize development of a robust SBIRT train-the-trainer model, which will include an SBIRT Trainer Manual, Provider Resource Guide, fidelity observational coding system, case vignettes, and a curriculum for ongoing consultation sessions. Materials will be designed to build the capacity of novice trainers to train lay workers to deliver SBIRT with fidelity. Second, we will recruit 24-36 trainers and 900 providers in order to evaluate the effects of the SBIRT train-the-trainer model on trainer- (e.g., fidelity, knowledge), provider- (e.g., SBIRT attitudes, confidence, acceptability), and patient encounter- (e.g., proportion receiving screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment) level variables. Data on patient encounters will be tracked by providers on programmed tablets or scannable paper forms in real-time. Providers will report on SBIRT delivery on an ongoing basis over a 6-months period. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that trainer-level factors will account for a substantial proportion of variability in provider-level factors which will, in turn, account for a substantial proportion of variability in patient encounter-level outcomes. This protocol will allow us to take advantage of a unique national training initiative to gather comprehensive data on multi-level factors associated with the implementation of SBIRT in HIV service settings. In the long-term, this research can help to advance the implementation of integrated alcohol-HIV services, providing lessons that can extend to other low-and-middle income countries confronting dual epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Findings have been mixed as to whether brief intervention (BI) is appropriate and effective for individuals with more severe alcohol use problems. Motivation to change drinking has been supported as a mechanism of behavior change for BI. This exploratory study examined aspects of motivation as mechanisms of clinical response to BI and alcohol problem severity as a moderator of treatment effects. Methods Non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers (average age = 35 years; 57% male) were randomized to receive BI (n = 27) or attention-matched control (n = 24). Three indices of motivation to change were assessed at baseline and post-intervention: importance, confidence, and readiness. Moderated mediation analyses were implemented with treatment condition as the focal predictor, changes in motivation as mediator, 1-month follow-up drinks per day as the outcome, and an alcohol severity factor as second-stage moderator. Results Analysis of importance displayed a significant effect of intervention condition on importance ( p &lt; 0.003) and yielded a significant index of moderated mediation (CI − 0.79, − 0.02), indicating that the conditional indirect effect of treatment condition on drinking through importance was stronger for those with higher alcohol severity. For all motivation indices, alcohol severity moderated the effect of post-intervention motivation levels on drinking ( p ’s &lt; 0.05). The direct effect of treatment condition on drinking was not significant in any model. Conclusions Findings highlight the relevance of considering one’s degree of alcohol problem severity in BI and alcohol screening efforts among non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Urine drug screening (UDS) is commonly used as part of treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), including treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone for OUD in a primary care setting. Very little is known about the value of UDS, the optimum screening frequency in general, or its specific use for buprenorphine treatment in primary care. To address this question, we thought that in a stable population receiving buprenorphine-naloxone in the primary care setting it would be useful to know how often UDS yielded expected and unexpected results. Methods We present a descriptive analysis of UDS results in patients treated with buprenorphine-naloxone for OUD in a primary care setting over a two-year period. An unexpected test result is: A negative test for buprenorphine and/or A positive test for opioids, methadone, cocaine and/or heroin. Results A total of 161 patients received care during the study period and a total of 2588 test results were analyzed from this population. We found that 64.4% of the patient population (n = 104 patients) demonstrated both treatment adherence (as measured by buprenorphine positive test results) and no apparent unexpected test findings, as defined by negative tests for opioids, methadone, cocaine and heroin. Of the 161 patients, 20 results were positive for opioids, 5 for methadone, 39 for heroin and 2 for cocaine. Analysis at the UDS level demonstrated that, of the 2588 test results, 38 (1.5%) results did not have buprenorphine. Of the 2588, 28 (1.1%) test results were positive for opioids, 8 (0.3%) were positive for methadone, 39 (1.5%) for cocaine and 2 (0.1%) for heroin. Conclusion Given that the majority of patients in our study had expected urine results, it may be reasonable for less frequent urine testing in certain patients.",

This retrospective trial design paper describes and discusses pragmatic features of a hybrid type III implementation/effectiveness trial of a contingency management (CM) intervention at an opioid treatment program. Prior reporting (Hartzler et al., J Subst Abuse Treat 46:429–438, 2014; Hartzler, Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy 10:30, 2015) notes success in recruiting program staff for voluntary participation, durable impacts of CM training on staff-level outcomes, provisional setting implementation of the intervention, documentation of clinical effectiveness, and post-trial sustainment of CM. Six pragmatic design features, and both scientific and practical bases for their inclusion in the trial, are presented: (1) a collaborative intervention design process, (2) voluntary recruitment of program staff for therapy training and implementation, (3) serial training outcome assessments, with quasi-experimental staff randomization to either single or multiple baseline assessment conditions, (4) designation of a 90-day period immediately after training in which the setting implemented the intervention on a provisional basis, (5) inclusive patient eligibility for receipt of the CM intervention, and (6) designation of two staff as local implementation leaders to oversee clinical/administrative issues in provisional implementation. Each pragmatic trial design feature is argued to have contributed to sustainment of CM. Contributions implicate the building of setting proprietorship for the CM intervention, culling of internal staff expertise in its delivery, iterative use of assessment methods that limited setting burden, documentation of setting-specific clinical effectiveness, expanded penetration of CM among staff during provisional implementation, and promotion of setting self-reliance in the oversight of sustainable implementation procedures. It is hoped this discussion offers ideas for how to impact local clinical and policy decisions via effective behavior therapy dissemination.",

Her echocardiogram demonstrated severe tricuspid regurgitation with a flail prosthetic valve leaflet, without concurrent endocarditis, necessitating a repeat valve replacement. Her care was overseen by our institution’s Endocarditis Working Group, a multidisciplinary team that includes providers from addiction medicine, cardiology, infectious disease, cardiothoracic surgery, and neurocritical care. The team worked together to evaluate her, develop a treatment plan for her substance use disorder in tandem with her other medical conditions, and advocate for her candidacy for valve replacement.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) affects not only the drinking individual, but also significant others (SOs), such as partners and children. Most of the harm to others caused by alcohol can be attributed to common, moderate drinking patterns, but existing studies have mainly included SOs of individuals with severe UAU. There is a need for increased knowledge regarding SOs of individuals in an earlier stage of UAU and efficacious support programs for this group. The aims of this study were to investigate reasons for seeking support as described by SOs sharing a child with a co-parent with UAU and to investigate how SOs perceived effects of a web-based self-delivered support program. Methods A qualitative design conducting semi-structured interviews with 13 female SOs sharing a child with a co-parent with UAU. The SOs were recruited from a randomized controlled trial of the web-based program and had completed at least two of four modules in the program. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis. Results Regarding reasons for seeking support, we created four categories and two subcategories. Main reasons were wanting validation/emotional support and coping strategies for handling the co-parent, and negative perceptions of available support options for SOs. Regarding perceived effects of the program, we created three categories and three subcategories. Main effects were an improved relationship to their children, increased own positive activities, and less adaptation to the co-parent, though SOs also mentioned what was perceived as missing in the program. We argue that the interviewees represent a population of SOs living with co-parents with slightly less severe UAU than previous studies and therefore provide new insights for future interventions. Conclusions The web-based approach with potential anonymity was important for facilitating support-seeking. Support for the SOs themselves and coping strategies for co-parent alcohol consumption were more common reasons for seeking help than worry about the children. For many SOs, the program was a first step in seeking further support. Spending more dedicated time with their children and being validated as living under stressful conditions were described by the SOs as particularly helpful.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background National opioid-related overdose fatalities totaled 650,000 from 1999 to 2021. Some of the highest rates occurred in New Hampshire, where 40% of the population lives rurally. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD; methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing opioid overdose and mortality. Methadone access barriers disproportionally impact rural areas and naltrexone uptake has been limited. Buprenorphine availability has increased and relaxed regulations reduces barriers in general medical settings common in rural areas. Barriers to prescribing buprenorphine include lack of confidence, inadequate training, and lack of access to experts. To address these barriers, learning collaboratives have trained clinics on best-practice performance data collection to inform quality improvement (QI). This project sought to explore the feasibility of training clinics to collect performance data and initiate QI alongside clinics’ participation in a Project ECHO virtual collaborative for buprenorphine providers. Methods Eighteen New Hampshire clinics participating in a Project ECHO were offered a supplemental project exploring the feasibility of performance data collection to inform QI targeting increased alignment with best practice. Feasibility was assessed descriptively, through each clinic’s participation in training sessions, data collection, and QI initiatives. An end-of-project survey was conducted to understand clinic staff perceptions of how useful and acceptable they found the program. Results Five of the eighteen health care clinics that participated in the Project ECHO joined the training project, four of which served rural communities in New Hampshire. All five clinics met the criteria for engagement, as each clinic attended at least one training session, submitted at least one month of performance data, and completed at least one QI initiative. Survey results showed that while clinic staff perceived the training and data collection to be useful, there were several barriers to collecting the data, including lack of staff time, and difficulty standardizing documentation within the clinic electronic health record. Conclusions Results suggest that training clinics to monitor their performance and base QI initiatives on data has potential to impact clinical best practice. While data collection was inconsistent, clinics completed several data-informed QI initiatives, indicating that smaller scale data collection might be more attainable.",

Peer recovery coaches (PRCs; individuals with lived SUD experience) facilitate SUD behavior change in recoverees but it is unknown if/how they address tobacco treatment in SUD recovery coaching. We assessed PRC’s tobacco-related practices and attitudes about tobacco treatment in SUD recovery. Methods The Tobacco use In Peer-recovery Study (TIPS) was a cross-sectional mixed-methods pilot survey (January–March 2022) of the 26 PRCs employed by a Massachusetts-based healthcare system’s 12 SUD treatment clinics/programs. PRCs completed a quantitative survey (n = 23/26; 88%) and a telephone-based qualitative interview (n = 20/26; 77%). Results One-third of PRCs reported current smoking, 50% reported former smoking, and 18% never smoked. Among PRCs, 61% reported accompanying recoverees outdoors to smoke, 26% smoked with recoverees, 17% had provided cigarettes to recoverees, 32% used smoking to help build peer-relationships, and 74% rated smoking as socially acceptable in SUD treatment. PRCs reported regularly talking to recoverees about tobacco treatment (65%), believed they should have a role in helping recoverees quit smoking (52%), and were interested in tobacco treatment training (65%). A majority of both nonsmoking and current smoking PRCs (73% vs. 57%) regularly talked to recoverees about quitting smoking. Conclusion PRCs’ attitudes about integrating tobacco treatment into SUD recovery coaching were generally positive and PRCs reported they could have a role in helping recoverees with tobacco treatment. Barriers to integrating tobacco treatment into SUD recovery include use of cigarettes as a peer-recovery tool and high prevalence and social acceptability of smoking in SUD recovery.",

Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HCV-infected patients who initiated OBOT treatment between December 2015 and March 2021 to characterize HCV treatment and assess associations with OBOT retention. HCV treatment was characterized as no treatment, early treatment (&lt; 100 days since OBOT initiation) or late treatment (≥ 100 days). We evaluated associations between HCV treatment and cumulative days in OBOT. A secondary analysis using Cox Proportional Hazards regression was done to determine the rate of discharge over time when comparing those who did versus did not receive HCV treatment as a time-varying covariate. We also analyzed a subset of patients retained at least 100 days in OBOT care and evaluated whether HCV treatment during that period was associated with OBOT retention beyond 100 days. Results Of 191 HCV-infected OBOT patients, 30% initiated HCV treatment, of whom 31% received early treatment and 69% received late treatment. Median cumulative duration in OBOT was greater among those who received HCV treatment (any: 398 days, early: 284 days and late: 430 days) when compared to those who did not receive treatment (90 days). Compared to no HCV treatment, there were 83% (95% CI: 33–152%, P &lt; 0.001), 95% (95% CI: 28%-197%, p = 0.002 and 77% (95% CI: 25–153%, p = 0.002) more cumulative days in OBOT for any, early and late HCV treatment, respectively. HCV treatment was associated with a lower relative hazard for discharge/drop-out, although results did not meet statistical significance (aHR = 0.59;95% CI: 0.34–1.00; p = 0.052). Among the subset of 84 patients retained in OBOT at least 100 days, 18 received HCV treatment during that period. Compared to those who did not receive treatment within the first 100 days, those who received treatment had 57% (95% CI: -3%-152%, p = 0.065) more subsequent days in OBOT. Conclusions A minority of HCV-infected patients received HCV treatment after initiating OBOT treatment, but those who did had better retention. Further efforts are needed to facilitate rapid HCV treatment and evaluate whether early HCV treatment improves OBOT engagement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background In studies of the general population and of military veterans, many primary care patients with hazardous drinking and PTSD and/or depression (abbreviated here as HD +) do not initiate or engage with alcohol-related care. To address this gap in care, we identified and will pilot test a promising evidence-based intervention, Connect To Care (C2C). C2C is a strengths-based approach, delivered by a Care Coach by telephone and/or video, with four components: (1) identifying and leveraging patient strengths to facilitate care initiation, (2) collaborative decision-making around a menu of care options, (3) identifying and resolving barriers to care, and (4) monitoring and facilitating progress toward care initiation by, for example, checking on barriers, identifying solutions, and revisiting care options. Methods/Design Aim 1 will involve adapting C2C for use in Veterans Affairs’ (VA) primary care. We will use an iterative process that includes focus groups and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (patients, primary care providers, and VA national policy leaders). In Aim 2, we will conduct a two-site, pilot randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger scale trial to test C2C’s effectiveness, ascertain the acceptability of C2C among primary care patients with HD + , and explore the efficacy of C2C to improve veteran patients’ initiation of and engagement in alcohol care, and their alcohol and mental health (PTSD, depression) outcomes, at 3-month follow-up. We will explore explanatory mechanisms by which C2C is effective. Discussion Study findings are likely to have implications for clinical practice to enhance current approaches to linking patients with HD + to alcohol care by applying a practical intervention such as C2C. The results may improve treatment outcomes for people with HD + by drawing on patients’ strengths to problem-solve barriers to care following a process of shared decision-making with a coach. In addition to possibly accelerating the translation of C2C into practice, study findings will also support additional research in terms of a planned effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial, adding to this study’s potential for high impact.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background and objectives Substance use in women is associated with unique psycho-social and physical vulnerabilities and poses complex challenges during pregnancy and motherhood. Gender-sensitive drug policy which considers the needs of women and their children could address these concerns. The objectives of this study were: (1) to systematically explore national-level drug policies’ sensitivity and responsiveness to women, pregnant women, and children; and (2) to examine the adherence of drug policies with international guidelines for gender sensitivity in drug policy. Methods The research team was diverse professional backgrounds and nine countries. A summative content analysis of national drug policy documents, action plans, and strategies was performed. Specific documents focusing on women, pregnancy, and children were analysed. Specific themes and how frequently they appeared in the documents were identified. This quantification was an attempt to explore usage indicating the relative focus of the policies. A thematic map was developed to understand how national-level drug policies conceive and address specific concerns related to women who use drugs. We adapted the UNODC checklist for gender mainstreaming to assess policies’ adherence to international guidelines. Results Twenty published documents from nine countries were reviewed. The common themes that emerged for women, pregnancy, and children were needs assessment, prevention, treatment, training, supply reduction, and collaboration and coordination. Custody of children was a unique theme for pregnant women. Specific psycho-social concerns and social reintegration were special themes for women, whereas legislation, harm reduction, research, and resource allocation were children-specific additional themes. For women-specific content analysis, special issues/concerns in women with drug misuse, need assessment, and prevention were the three most frequent themes; for the children-specific policies, prevention, training, and treatment comprised the three most occurring themes. For pregnant women/pregnancy, prevention, treatment, and child custody were the highest occurring themes. According to ratings of the countries’ policies, there is limited adherence to international guidelines which ensure activities are in sync with the specific needs of women, pregnant women and their children. Conclusion Our analysis should help policymakers revise, update and adapt national policies to ensure they are gender-responsive and address the needs of women, pregnant women and their children.",

Using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII), a novel instrument that assess pandemic-related impacts across multiple life domains, we tested the hypothesis that COVID-related impacts (on e.g., interpersonal conflict, employment, infection exposure, and emotional health) experienced in the early months of the pandemic would predict changes in opioid use and opioid-related problems at follow-up. This analysis was embedded within a cluster randomized type 3 implementation-effectiveness hybrid trial that had enrolled 188 patients across eight opioid treatments prior to the start of the pandemic. Participants had all been recently inducted on medication for opioid use disorder and were actively receiving treatment. Participants reported on their opioid use and opioid-related problems at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 9-month post-baseline assessments. Between May and August 2020, participants were sent an optional invitation to complete the EPII. One hundred thirty-three respondents completed the EPII and 129 had sufficient data to analyze the EPII and at least one subsequent follow-up. In logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial analyses adjusting for covariates, each endorsed pandemic impact in the interpersonal conflict domain was associated with 67% increased odds of endorsement of any opioid use, and each impact in the employment and infection exposure-domains was associated with 25% and 75% increases in number of endorsed opioid-related problems, respectively. Mitigating the effect of the pandemic on patients' interpersonal relationships and employment, and promoting greater infection control in opioid treatment programs, could be protective against negative opioid-related outcomes. Trial registration The present study describes secondary data analysis on a previously registered clinical trial: clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03931174.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Approximately 50% of the patients who globally seek help in psychiatry have been assessed with problematic substance use or been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). Given the high treatment gap for mental health care, in particular SUD, these individuals risk poorer treatment outcomes in psychiatry. Integrated treatment for psychiatric and SUD disorders has been proposed to reduce the treatment gap for SUD, but access to integrated treatment is low. Digital interventions addressing SUD in psychiatry could potentially make treatment available to patients who otherwise would not have access. In this study “digital interventions” comprise an umbrella term covering all kinds of interventions from minimal motivational app-based interventions to internet-based interventions with and without human guidance, up to remote sessions in telepsychiatry. This study aims to explore healthcare staff perceptions of referring patients to digital interventions for reducing problematic substance use, whether or not diagnosed as SUD, in the psychiatric outpatient setting. Method The study was exploratory with a qualitative design. Data were collected in the Swedish outpatient psychiatry setting, via individual semi-structured interviews with managers, and focus groups with healthcare staff. An adapted form of phenomenological hermeneutical analysis was used to analyze the data. Results Three themes emerged from the analysis. The first theme was Encountering obstacles on the path to future implementation of digital interventions, with sub-themes: Lacking resources and Feeling concerned about technical solutions . The second theme was Searching for ways forward to achieve increased access to care, with sub-themes: Blended care could facilitate integrated care and Addressing variations in patients’ technical skills . The third theme was Taking steps towards the future, with sub-themes: Wanting to know more about digital interventions and Formulating a vision for the future . Conclusions The study reveals a concern that implementing digital interventions in psychiatry will create additional work or be technically challenging. The staff see significant advantages from the patient perspective, but they feel that they themselves need training in implementing digital interventions. In order to establish constructive implementation of digital interventions for SUD in psychiatry, staff attitudes and concerns need to be considered and addressed. This study was conducted within the Swedish healthcare system and the findings may not generalize to other countries with differing healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background At-risk alcohol use and tobacco smoking often co-occur. We investigated whether brief alcohol interventions (BAIs) among general hospital patients with at-risk alcohol use may also reduce tobacco smoking over 2 years. We also investigated whether such effects vary by delivery mode; i.e. in-person versus computer-based BAI. Methods A proactively recruited sample of 961 general hospital patients with at-risk alcohol use aged 18 to 64 years was allocated to three BAI study groups: in-person BAI, computer-based BAI, and assessment only. In-person- and computer-based BAI included motivation-enhancing intervention contacts to reduce alcohol use at baseline and 1 and 3 months later. Follow-ups were conducted after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. A two-part latent growth model, with self-reported smoking status (current smoking: yes/no) and number of cigarettes in smoking participants as outcomes, was estimated. Results Smoking participants in computer-based BAI smoked fewer cigarettes per day than those assigned to assessment only at month 6 (mean net change = − 0.02; 95% confidence interval = − 0.08–0.00). After 2 years, neither in-person- nor computer-based BAI significantly changed smoking status or number of cigarettes per day in comparison to assessment only or to each other ( p s ≥ 0.23). Conclusions While computer-based BAI also resulted in short-term reductions of number of cigarettes in smoking participants, none of the two BAIs were sufficient to evoke spill-over effects on tobacco smoking over 2 years. For long-term smoking cessation effects, multibehavioural interventions simultaneously targeting tobacco smoking along with at-risk alcohol use may be more effective.

    "abstract": "While brief intervention (BI) for risky alcohol use generally yields positive effects among those identified by screening, effect sizes are small and there is unexplained heterogeneity in outcome. The heterogeneity may be related to differences in intervention style and content, including elements of motivational interviewing (MI). To date, it has been difficult to interpret the role of MI in BI and these gaps in knowledge interfere with efforts to train, disseminate and implement BI that retains and maximizes efficacy. This study sought to develop BI protocols with varying doses of MI and test their differentiability. Differentiable BI protocols could allow for future studies that prospectively evaluate the role MI plays in affecting BI outcome. We developed three intervention protocols: brief advice, standard BI (NIAAA Clinician's Guide), and MI-enhanced BI and administered them to 45 primary care patients who reported exceeding recommended drinking limits. We then rated the BI sessions for fidelity to the assigned protocol as well as MI consistency based on Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) scale scores. The differentiability of BI protocols was determined by calculating fidelity to assigned protocols and comparing MITI scores using pairwise, Tukey-adjusted comparisons of least squares mean scores. High rates of fidelity to each protocol were achieved. The three BI protocols were also highly differentiable based on MITI scores. The three interventions can be used in future trials to prospectively examine the role MI has in determining BI outcome.

    "abstract": "There is a wealth of evidence on the detrimental impact of excessive alcohol consumption on physical, psychological, and social health. There also exists a substantial evidence base for the efficacy of alcohol brief intervention (BI) aimed at reducing consumption across a range of settings. Research conducted in emergency departments (EDs) has reinforced the current evidence regarding the potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BI. However, the majority of this research has been conducted in a single center, and there is little evidence of the generalizability of SBI implementation across EDs. This pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial randomized nine EDs to a combination of screening tools (the Modified Single Alcohol Screening Question [M-SASQ], the Fast Alcohol Screening Test [FAST], or the Screening and Intervention Program for Sensible Drinking modified Paddington Alcohol Test [SIPS-PAT]) and interventions (patient intervention leaflet [PIL], brief advice [BA], or brief lifestyle counseling [BLC]). The primary hypothesis was that BLC delivered by an alcohol health worker would be more effective than BA or PIL delivered by ED staff. Outcomes were assessed at six and 12 months. Overall, 5992 patients were screened for eligibility in 9 EDs; of these, 3737 (62%) were found eligible, and 1491 screened positive for an alcohol use disorder (40%). Of those who screened positive, 1204 (81%) consented to participate in the trial. The mean age of participants was 35 years, and the mean AUDIT score at baseline was 12.4. The majority of the sample was male (65%) and white (88%). At 12 months, 803 (67%) of participants were followed up. No significant differences in follow-up rates were observed between intervention groups. Overall, the proportion of participants positive for an alcohol use disorder reduced significantly by 16.3%. This reflected a significant decrease of 18.8% in the PIL group and 15.1% in both the BLC and BA groups. An adjusted logistic regression model found no significant effects of intervention group, screening approach, or baseline AUDIT score.",

    "abstract": "Patients who misuse substances present in inordinate numbers for emergency department (ED) services. Therefore, EDs are an important environment for identifying, intervening and connecting patients with treatment and recovery support to improve patient health and reduce healthcare utilization. EDs have largely depended on external funding or additional personnel to execute SBIRT. Our aim was to integrate SBIRT into the ED workflow and coordinate transfer to treatment and community support programs without added monetary/staff resources. Beginning in 2010, we worked cooperatively with a local ED to integrate SBIRT into the normal ED workflow. This program of screening, brief interventions and warm-handoff referral is dubbed “Safe Landing.” Efforts have focused on: training staff; embedding SBIRT tools into existing data systems; nurturing relationships with community treatment and recovery providers; developing protocols for a “warm-handoff” that would ensure patients who, in the context of a health crisis, express an immediate interest in following a road to recovery; and securing reimbursement for services. Over one-and-a-half years since implementation, 45,770 patients have been screened, with 7,996 assessed, 2,058 receiving a brief intervention, and 137 referred to treatment or recovery support. Multiple staff trainings have resulted in a palpable culture shift to patient advocacy and increasing compliance with SBIRT protocols. Screening and BI tracking tools embedded in the ED data systems continue to be enhanced. ED reimbursement for SBIRT began 10/2012, and cooperative relationships with treatment and recovery providers have diversified. We will discuss the implementation strategies employed to overcome challenges in operationalizing SBIRT in the ED. Challenges to be discussed include changes in key personnel, embedding SBIRT into the labyrinth of data systems, initial staff scepticism and evolving area treatment and recovery services organizations. Regardless, Safe Landing perseveres, and commitment by the local ED is stronger than ever.",

    "abstract": "Motivational interviewing (MI) is increasingly used to address unhealthy behaviors. We examined the effectiveness of MI training for medical students to improve counseling of patients with unhealthy behaviors, including risky alcohol use. All students (N = 131) in year five of a six-year curriculum at Lausanne University Medical School in Switzerland were randomized into an experimental group (n = 66) or control group (n = 65). After training of all students in basic communication skills in years two and three (control condition), an eight-hour MI training workshop was completed by students in the experimental group. One week after the training, students in both groups were invited to meet for 15 minutes with two standardized patients. Motivational-interviewing skills were coded by four blinded research assistants using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) coding system, version 3.0. Superior performance was shown among trained versus control students as demonstrated by higher mean (standard deviation [SD]) scores (range, 1-5) for empathy (4.0 [0.6] versus 3.4 [0.7]; p < 0.001) and MI spirit (4.0 [0.6] versus 3.3 [0.6]; p < 0.001). Mean scores were similar between groups for direction, indicating that students in both groups invited the patient to talk about behavior change. Behavior-counts assessment demonstrated better performance in MI among trained versus control students regarding occurrences of MI-adherent behavior (mean [SD], 5.6 [2.5] versus 3.7 [1.7]; p < 0.001), MI nonadherent behavior (1.9 [2.3] versus 5.1 [3.7]; p < 0.001), closed questions (15.5 [5.3] versus 21.3 [6.9], p < 0.001), open questions (7.8 [2.9] versus 5.6 [2.1]; p = 0.001), simple reflections (13.2 [5.1] versus 11.1 [5.3], p = 0.03), and complex reflections (4.3 [2.1] versus 2.7 [2.0]; p < 0.001). Occurrences were similar between groups regarding giving information. In sum, an eight-hour training workshop was associated with improved MI performance, lending support for the implementation of MI training in medical schools.",

Data collection over a period of 17 months resulted in 698 patients recruited into the study and randomized to one of three conditions: screened only (n=78), assessed (n=310), and intervention (n=310). Patients in the assessment (77%) and intervention (72%) conditions were blindly reassessed at three months via one telephone interview. No difference was found in baseline demographic or drinking characteristics between the assessment intervention groups. At follow-up, the intervention group showed significantly greater decreases in five of six outcome variables: number of drinking days per week, average number of drinks and per drinking day, maximum number of drinks, RAPS4 score as an indicator of alcohol dependence and number of negative consequences related to drinking. Using analysis of covariance to control for baseline measures, the intervention group was lower on all drinking and problem measures than the assessment group, and significantly so on four of the measures. When the interaction of intervention by injury status (injury vs. non-injury), drinking within six hours prior to the event, causal attribution of the event to drinking and risk taking disposition were examined, only causal attribution had a significant effect for two of the problem measures – the intervention effect for the RAPS4 and negative consequences was greater for those who believed their injury or illness was related to their drinking. Findings here suggest that brief intervention was effective in this population compared to assessment at three month follow-up, and may be most effective for those linking the reason for their ED visit to their drinking.",

    "abstract": "As in many other countries, the cost of alcohol abuse to the Mexican health system is considerable. The main contribution to disease burden is related to morbidity and mortality associated with liver cirrhosis, accidents, and violence, including homicide. Moreover, the largest share of alcohol-related problems is caused by those who drink heavily but do not fulfill dependence criteria; consequently, this group is not properly identified and do not get treatment, since the services available are aimed at treating people with dependence. The most frequently used services are those of 12-step groups, followed by alcohol detoxification. However, in Mexico there are several initiatives to test evidence-based programs for the prevention, detection, and treatment of alcohol abuse. The most significant initiatives are reviewed in this paper highlighting its relevance in the development and implementation of public policies in Mexico, such as a solid e-learning program to train health professionals on screening and treat alcohol abuse problems; research projects to test the effectiveness of various interventions, centered primarily on the management of problem drinkers; and brief intervention for the relatives of heavy drinkers, among others. It is hoped that these initiatives will have a significant impact on the prevention, screening, and treatment of alcohol abuse, but there are tasks that remain; for instance, we need a better understanding of the barriers to implementation. Greater efforts are needed to broaden the range of alcohol screening and treatment programs, improve their efficacy and cost-effectiveness in different contexts, and encourage their adoption in the national health system.",

    "abstract": "The University of California at Los Angeles Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (UCLA QUIT) tested a very brief primary-care–based screening and brief intervention (SBI) approach to reduce risky substance use and substance-related harm in safety-net clinics. The QUIT involves screening, very brief clinician advice (two to three minutes), and two telephone drug-use health education sessions versus usual care (control group) (n = 240 per condition). We present findings on unique recruitment issues in Skid Row, an east-central area of Los Angeles with a high population of homeless individuals. Between February 18 and April 28, 2011, previsit screening of adults in the clinic waiting room was conducted using a touch screen tablet PC. At-risk substance use was defined as casual, frequent, or heavy episodic use without the physiological or psychological manifestations of dependence (i.e., a score of 4 to 26 on the World Health Organization’s Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Use Involvement Screening Test [ASSIST]). The focus of the study was on risky stimulant use, however, patients were screened for co-occurring alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. A total of 920 patients were approached: 89% were ≥40 years old; 68% were male; and 62% were black. Of these, 706 were excluded prior to taking the ASSIST (reasons included being pregnant, presenting for a non-primary-care visit, being in substance use treatment, or refusal to participate). Of the 214 patients who completed the ASSIST, substance use rates based on scores were as follows: no/low risk, 11%; moderate risk, 42%; and dependence, 47%. Totals for each risk group, respectively, were as follows: tobacco (55, 101, 58), alcohol (62, 98, 54), cannabis (94, 77, 43), cocaine (89, 74, 51), amphetamines (145, 45, 23), inhalants (185, 20, 9), sedatives (143, 45, 26), hallucinogens (174, 30, 10), and opioids (130, 54, 30). Few patients qualified for the study because of substance use treatment or co-occurring alcohol or cannabis dependence. Key informants revealed that many of those approached received intermittent substance use treatment required by shelters. Enrollment criteria were relaxed to allow intermittent past-month substance use treatment or co-occurring alcohol or cannabis dependence. Enrollment rates increased several-fold. Our findings indicate SBIRT conducted in clinics with homeless and marginally housed populations must be tailored to their unique substance use and housing characteristics.",

In this study, the intention was to trial a brief alcohol intervention which included web and mobile phone text elements enabling participants to create and schedule personal alcohol harm reduction messages. Two parallel-group randomized controlled feasibility studies, conducted between September 2011 and January 2013, attracted 136 visitors and 77 participants aged 18 to 67. Participants (54% European, 18% Māori) were predominantly female (63%) and half (48%) were college/tertiary students. They were randomly assigned to an intervention (participants could create their own text messages about their drinking and schedule the timing, number and frequency of the message delivery) or control (directed to standard alcohol information web sites) for three months. The primary outcome of each study was a change in unintended negative consequences from drinking at three months. Twenty four participants created 56 personal text messages. Messages that were neutral in tone employed a directive approach (e.g. “DO NOT PUNCH [name]”) providing pragmatic instructions on specific consumption reduction or safety actions. Fifteen abstract messages indirectly reminded the recipients of their safety intentions (e.g. “Don't get too rowdy ya silly girl…”) without specifying an action. Aspirational concepts (e.g. “Remember you’re the boss, act that way”) were contained in ten messages and represented the broadest range of motivations to encourage safe drinking. Sixty percent of the message content was very personal. Engaging participants in creating their own messages reveals a diversity of content approach and style which bears little resemblance to brief intervention messages commonly used in the alcohol brief intervention field. Empowering, personal messages delivered via text may resonate more deeply with the drinking population and improve alcohol brief intervention outcomes.",

Those in the post-event assessment condition were interviewed after their event, and participants in both conditions were interviewed three months after their event. Results showed higher readiness to change alcohol use among participants who received a post-event assessment. Across groups, there were significant increases in heavy drinking days prior to the event, and significant reductions post-event, but no post-event differences by assessment group. Moderation analyses showed more post-event reduction in drinking days among assessment group participants with high pre-college alcohol severity. Conversely, participants in the control group with high event aversiveness showed greater reduction in heavy drinking days than those assigned to the assessment group. Findings suggest that college student heavy drinking is reactive to alcohol events, but there were no apparent synergistic effects between an alcohol event and a post-event assessment. Assessment reactivity among students who have experienced an event may depend on alcohol severity and event aversiveness, highlighting the importance of considering possible interactions among extratherapeutic factors in college populations involved in BMI research.",

    "abstract": "Interest in the brain has risen dramatically in recent decades, suggesting that neuroscience-based information about substance use risks could be a compelling addition to prevention efforts. However, no studies have tested this approach among adolescents. In this study, we tested the effects of a high school science curriculum called “The Brain: Understanding Neurobiology through the Study of Addiction” developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) to teach students about how alcohol and drugs affect the brain. We examined the curriculum’s effects on students’ knowledge, attitudes, and use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Participants were 9th-11th graders attending 2 urban high schools whose parents consented (222/282=79%). We standardized the 5-lesson curriculum and trained 5 science teachers; 8 classes (n=133) received the NIH curriculum, 5 matched-grade comparison classes (n=89) received the usual curriculum. We used a self-administered survey to assess demographics, knowledge, perceived risk of harm from substance use, substance use, peer/family substance use, and prior health education. We collected data 1-2 weeks pre-intervention (T1), immediately post-intervention (T2; 1 month after T1), and 6-8 months later (T3). We used multiple logistic regression with generalized estimating equations for post-test comparisons, adjusting for T1 differences and within-class correlation. 180/222 (81%) students completed all measurements; group completion rates were similar (control=80%, intervention=82%). Compared to control students, intervention students had lower past-30-day cigarette use at T2 (7% vs. 21%, AOR=0.20, 95% CI 0.08-0.49, p=.01), and a marginal trend toward lower alcohol initiation between T1 and T2 (3% vs. 20%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.09 95% CI 0.01-1.03, p=.052). Among low-frequency marijuana users (1-5 times lifetime at baseline), fewer intervention students had past-30-day marijuana use at T2 (5% vs. 35%, AOR=0.01, 95%CI 0.00-0.30, p=0.03). All between-groups differences were extinguished by T3. Neuroscience education is a promising supplemental strategy for adolescent substance use prevention; however, ongoing reinforcement is needed.",

This randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the outpatient department of a large tertiary referral hospital in Newcastle (population 540,000), Australia. Some 772 adults with appointments at a broad range of medical and surgical outpatient clinics who score 5–9 inclusive on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) subscale will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to electronic alcohol screening alone (control) or to e-SBI. As randomization will be effected by computer, researchers and participants (who will be invited to participate in a study of alcohol use over time) will be blinded to group assignment. The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle and compare weekly volume (grams of alcohol) and the full AUDIT score with a six-month reference period between the groups six months post randomization. Secondary outcomes, assessed six and 12 months after randomization, will include drinking frequency, typical occasion quantity, proportion who report binge drinking, proportion who report heavy drinking, and health-care utilization. If e-SBI is efficacious in outpatient settings, it offers the prospect of systematically and sustainably reaching a large number of hazardous and harmful drinkers, many of whom do not otherwise seek or receive help.

Further, the social networks of YEH, although multi-dimensional in composition, are largely comprised of other YEH, substance users, and individuals who do not provide the youth with tangible or emotional support. For YEH who have the opportunity to enter a housing program, helping them to reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections during this critical transition period may increase their stability and reduce their risk of re-entering homelessness. The goal of this study is to pilot test a brief motivational network intervention (MNI), delivered by case managers, to help former YEH who have recently transitioned to a housing program reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections. Methods/design Up to 60 residents of housing programs in the Los Angeles area will be randomized to receive four sessions of usual case manager support or four sessions of case manager support + MNI. Each MNI session consists of three parts: (1) identifying two goals that are most important for the resident over the next year (e.g., get or keep a job, finish or stay in school, reduce substance use); (2) a network interview with the resident to capture network data pertaining to their interactions in the past 2 weeks; and (3) a discussion between the case manager and the resident of the resulting network visualizations, conducted in a Motivational Interviewing (MI) style, and what role the resident’s network may play in reaching their most important goals over the next year. Discussion This study addresses a critical gap by pilot testing a computer-assisted MNI, delivered using MI techniques, that can help case managers work with recent YEH to reduce substance use and increase permanent supportive connections during the critical transitional period from homelessness to housing.

    "abstract": "In smokers with chronic diseases, we examined the abstinence rates over 6 months and its affecting factors in the context of the Korea National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) smoking cessation program. To identify 6-month abstinence, we extracted a sample of 15,017 participants using the multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method from the 359,047 individuals enrolled in the 2016 NHIS smoking cessation program and 1500 smokers responded to the telephone survey. From this group, 1245 individuals (48.50 ± 12.55 years; men 89.8%) were enrolled, as they had no missing information for confounding variables. We compared chronic disease distribution between participants and current smokers in the 2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We evaluated the factors affecting continuous abstinence rate (CAR) across patients with different chronic diseases: hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia (DL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and major depressive disorder (MDD). While participation of DM patients was high, the participation of DL patients was relatively low. The CAR over 6 months was 44.74%. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for continuous abstinence over 6 months was significantly lower in the MDD group than in the no-MDD group (OR 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 to 0.85). The factors of program completion (complete versus incomplete: OR 3.11, 95% CI 2.43 to 3.98), region (non-metropolitan areas versus Seoul metropolitan area: OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.61), and nicotine dependence (severe versus light or moderate: OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83) were significantly associated with CAR. The smoking cessation program was not actively recruiting smokers with chronic diseases. The CARs in each disease group were not different from those in the non-disease groups, except that the MDD group had a lower CAR over 6 months than the no-MDD group. Recruiting smokers with chronic diseases and improving their CARs depends on the careful identification of their characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Over 1.6 million adolescents in the United States meet criteria for substance use disorders (SUDs). While there are promising treatments for SUDs, adolescents respond to these treatments differentially in part based on the setting in which treatments are delivered. One way to address such individualized response to treatment is through the development of adaptive interventions (AIs): sequences of decision rules for altering treatment based on an individual's needs. This protocol describes a project with the overarching goal of beginning the development of AIs that provide recommendations for altering the setting of an adolescent's substance use treatment. This project has three discrete aims: (1) explore the views of various stakeholders (parents, providers, policymakers, and researchers) on deciding the setting of substance use treatment for an adolescent based on individualized need, (2) generate hypotheses concerning candidate AIs, and (3) compare the relative effectiveness among candidate AIs and non-adaptive interventions commonly used in everyday practice. This project uses a mixed-methods approach. First, we will conduct an iterative stakeholder engagement process, using RAND's ExpertLens online system, to assess the importance of considering specific individual needs and clinical outcomes when deciding the setting for an adolescent's substance use treatment. Second, we will use results from the stakeholder engagement process to analyze an observational longitudinal data set of 15,656 adolescents in substance use treatment, supported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs questionnaire. We will utilize methods based on Q-learning regression to generate hypotheses about candidate AIs. Third, we will use robust statistical methods that aim to appropriately handle casemix adjustment on a large number of covariates (marginal structural modeling and inverse probability of treatment weights) to compare the relative effectiveness among candidate AIs and non-adaptive decision rules that are commonly used in everyday practice. This project begins filling a major gap in clinical and research efforts for adolescents in substance use treatment. Findings could be used to inform the further development and revision of influential multi-dimensional assessment and treatment planning tools, or lay the foundation for subsequent experiments to further develop or test AIs for treatment planning.",

Yet women’s treatment needs are mostly unmet in South Korea due to the lack of women-focused treatment programs. This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of a therapeutic community (TC)-oriented day treatment program for Korean women with AUD on alcohol abstinence self-efficacy, forgiveness, and spirituality. Methods The current study employed a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group design with a pretest and posttest. Participants were assigned to 6-month TC-oriented day treatment program (n = 19) or usual treatment (n = 21). Feasibility (treatment completion rate) and acceptability (overall program satisfaction) were assessed. Alcohol abstinence was measured as a clinical outcome at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Repeated measures using Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy (AASE), Enright Forgiveness Inventory-Korea (EFI-K), and Spiritual Assessment Scale (SAS) were also obtained from both conditions at those three time points. Results Fifteen participants (78.9%) in the intervention group successfully completed the program. The overall program satisfaction ratings were very high (4.9 ± 0.2). Continuous abstinence rates at 6 months were significantly higher in the treatment group (78.9%) than in the control group (9.5%). Results of the two-way repeated measures ANOVA indicated that statistically significant two-way (group × time) interaction effects were found for the intervention group on AASE, EFI-K, and SAS but not for the control group on any of the outcomes. Conclusion The current study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a TC-oriented intensive day treatment program to promote recovery in Korean women with AUD. This intervention merits further investigation as a potential strategy to help address alcohol abstinence self-efficacy, forgiveness and spirituality.

The patient suspected retention of a broken needle as the cause. She had used a re-used needle 3 months earlier. A plain pelvic radiograph confirmed a needle fragment in the patient's left groin, and a computed tomography scan located it adjacent to the femoral artery and vein. Another asymptomatic needle fragment was found in the right groin. Conclusion Needle fragments are possible causes of local symptoms among PWIDs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Psychosocial interventions are needed to enhance patient engagement and retention in medication treatment within opioid treatment programs. Measurement-based care (MBC), an evidence-based intervention structure that involves ongoing monitoring of treatment progress over time to assess the need for treatment modifications, has been recommended as a flexible and low-cost intervention for opioid treatment program use. The MBC2OTP Project is a two-phase pilot hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial that has three specific aims: (1) to employ Rapid Assessment Procedure Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE) to collect mixed methods data to inform MBC implementation; (2) to use RAPICE data to adapt an MBC protocol; and (3) to conduct a hybrid type 1 trial to evaluate MBC’s preliminary effectiveness and implementation potential in opioid treatment programs. Methods This study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will include RAPICE site visits, qualitative interviews ( N = 32–48 total), and quantitative surveys ( N = 64–80 total) with staff at eight programs to build community partnerships and evaluate contextual factors impacting MBC implementation. Mixed methods data will be analyzed using immersion/crystallization and thematic analysis to inform MBC adaptation and site selection. Four programs selected for Phase 2 will participate in MBC electronic medical record integration, training, and ongoing support. Chart reviews will be completed in the 6 months prior-to and following MBC integration ( N = 160 charts, 80 pre and post) to evaluate effectiveness (patient opioid abstinence and treatment engagement) and implementation outcomes (counselor MBC exposure and fidelity). Discussion This study is among the first to take forward recommendations to implement and evaluate MBC in opioid treatment programs. It will also employ an innovative RAPICE approach to enhance the quality and rigor of data collection and inform the development of an MBC protocol best matched to opioid treatment programs. Overall, this work seeks to enhance treatment provision and clinical outcomes for patients with opioid use disorder. Trial registration This study will be registered with Clinicaltrials.gov within 21 days of first participant enrollment in Phase 2. Study Phase 1 (RAPICE) does not qualify as a clinical trial, therefore Phase 2 clinical trial registration has not yet been pursued because all elements of Phase 2 will be dependent on Phase 1 outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption is a major public health challenge; the majority of employees consume alcohol regularly and a considerable proportion of employees can be characterized as risky drinkers in need of interventions. Occupational health services (OHS) are uniquely positioned for implementing alcohol prevention interventions targeting employees, but rarely do so. Studies have shown that lack of knowledge among OHS personnel is a barrier to alcohol prevention activity. This study aimed to explore OHS personnels' levels of theoretical and practical alcohol knowledge, and whether these two ways of knowing were differentially associated with alcohol prevention activity. In this cross-sectional study, survey data were collected from 322 OHS personnel in Norway in 2018 (response rate = 53.6%). The survey included variables of two ways of knowing (theoretical and practical) and three types of doing (intervention frequency, conducting individual interventions, and conducting group interventions). Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, paired sample t-tests, bivariate correlations, and adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses. OHS personnel rated their theoretical alcohol knowledge higher than their practical knowledge (η2 = 0.33, p < 0.001). Higher reported levels of practical knowledge were associated with higher intervention frequency (b = 0.39, β = 0.60, p < 0.001) and greater likelihood of conducting individual interventions (OR = 1.60, p < .001) as well as group interventions (OR = 1.84, p < 0.001). Theoretical knowledge was not associated with conducting interventions, and there was no evidence of an interaction between the two ways of knowing in their association with doing. Sensitivity analyses did not indicate clustering effects of OHS personnel being employed within different units. Different ways of knowing about alcohol among OHS personnel were dissimilarly associated with conducting alcohol prevention interventions in occupational health settings. For doing, knowing how seems to be more important than knowing that. Training programs for OHS personnel should emphasize knowledge about how to deal with alcohol-related issues and how to conduct prevention interventions, rather than focus on detrimental effects of alcohol.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Injection drug use (IDU) remains the strongest risk factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States. HCV rates are increasing in rural areas among young adult people who inject drugs (PWID). People with HCV and PWID have disproportionate rates of mental health problems; however, it is unclear whether risky injection behaviors mediate the association between mental health problems and HCV. We examined the association between mental health problems and HCV in a rural cohort of young adult PWID, with the goal of informing rural service delivery. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from a convenience sample of young adult PWID in 2 rural counties in New Mexico. Participants were recruited from 2 community venues between September 2016 and May 2018. Associations between mental health problems and HCV were examined using bivariate (Fisher’s exact) and multivariable modified Poisson regression analyses (with robust standard errors). Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we assessed duration of IDU and receptive syringe sharing (RSS) as mediators of this relationship. Results A total of 263 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 26.1 years. The majority were male (66.3%) and Hispanic/Latino (a) (87.6%). The median age first injected was 19 years, and over half reported having ever engaged in RSS (53.4%). At least one mental health problem was reported by 60.1% of participants, with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) being the most prevalent condition (42.2%). A majority (60.9%) tested positive for HCV antibody, and just under half (45.7%) of all participants tested positive for HCV ribonucleic acid. In SEM, PTSD had a significant total effect on HCV (τ = 0.230, P = 0.05), and this relationship was partially mediated by duration of IDU (αβ = 0.077, P = 0.03). The association between mental health problems and HCV was partially mediated by duration of IDU and the sequential mediation of duration of IDU and RSS (αβ + αββ = 0.091, P = 0.05). Conclusions High HCV rates among young adult PWID in rural New Mexico may be partly explained by mental health problems, duration of IDU and RSS. Mental health services for young adult PWID in rural areas may help decrease HCV transmission in rural areas. Trial Registration N/A.",

The ACT-ATAC project aims to identify the predictors associated with smoking cessation among persons treated for alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder in Barcelona. This manuscript reports its methodology and the experience of carrying it out during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Mixed methods project with three substudies. Substudy 1 (S1) comprises heterogeneous discussion groups among clinicians. S2 has two prospective cohorts composed of smokers under treatment for alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder and the clinicians in charge of these patients. Participating smokers will be followed for 12 months and interviewed about their substance use and the tobacco cessation services received using the Spanish version of the users’ Knowledge, Attitudes, and Services (S-KAS) scale. The clinicians will be asked about their self-reported practices in smoking cessation using the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (S-KAP) scale. S3 comprises heterogeneous discussion groups with smokers. Data will be triangulated using qualitative and quantitative analyses. To facilitate the recruitment process, the researchers have introduced several strategies (design clear protocols, set monthly online meetings, extend the project, provide gift cards, etc.). Discussion The results of S1 were used to develop the questionnaires. S2 required some adjustments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the follow-up interviews being conducted by phone instead of face-to-face, and the recruitment rhythm was lower than expected. Recruitment will last until reaching at least 200–250 users. The fieldwork could not have been possible without the collaboration of the ACT-ATAC team and the introduction of several strategies.

This exploratory research seeks to understand intervention-related stigma in community-based primary care providers in rural West Virginia, determine whether financial incentives for training may be linked to levels of stigma, and what level of financial incentives would be required for non-adopters of MOUD services provision to obtain training.Survey questions were included in the West Virginia Practice-Based Research Network (WVPBRN) annual Collective Outreach & Research Engagement (CORE) Survey and delivered electronically to each practice site in WV. General demographic, staff attitudes and views on compensation for immersion training for delivering MOUD therapy in primary care offices were returned. Statistical analysis included logistic and multinomial logistic regression and an independent samples t-test.Data were collected from 102 participants. Perceived stigma did significantly predict having a waiver with every 1-unit increase in stigma being associated with a 65% decreased odds of possessing a waiver for buprenorphine/MOUD (OR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.16-0.78, p = 0.01). Further, t-test analyses suggested there was a statistically significant mean difference in perceived stigma (t(100) = 2.78, p = 0.006) with those possessing a waiver (M = 1.56; SD = 0.51) having a significantly lower perceived stigma than those without a waiver (M = 1.92; SD = 0.57). There was no statistically significant association of stigma on whether someone with a waiver actually prescribed MOUD or not (OR = 0.28; 95% CI 0.04-2.27, p = 0.234).This survey of rural primary care providers demonstrates that stigmatizing beliefs related to MOUD impact the desired financial incentive to complete a one-day immersion, and that currently unwaivered providers endorse more stigmatizing beliefs about MOUD when compared to currently waivered providers. Furthermore, providers who endorse stigmatizing beliefs with respect to MOUD require higher levels of compensation to consider such training.",

    "abstract": "Residential opioid rehabilitation aims to improve the mental health and quality of life of opioid users through abstinence and residential program participation. This study aimed to determine the depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life amongst maintenance to abstinence (MTA) program residents. Secondary study aims were to assess the personal characteristics of MTA clients, addiction and risk taking behaviours, factors associated with program completion, as well as to assess the reliable change in participants’ mental health and quality of life on exit. Retrospective analysis of routinely collected data (2013–2017) from surveys completed by 100 clients. Outcome measures were: Depression, Anxiety, Stress Score (DASS-42), World Health Organisation Quality of Life 8 questions (WHOQOL-8) and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Other variables included demographics, drug use, other addictions, aggression, self-harm, suicidal ideation/attempts, and risk taking behaviours. Statistical methods included Chi-square, Fisher’s exact, t-tests, repeated measures analysis of variance and the Reliable Change Index. All mean DASS-42, WHOQOL-8 and K10 scores improved significantly in all participants from entry to exit (p < 0.001). The majority of participants demonstrated reliable improvement across all psychometric measures. Completion rates for the MTA program were 51%. Depression (p = 0.023), anxiety (p = 0.010) and stress (p = 0.015) DASS-42 scores decreased significantly more in completers compared to non-completers. The rate of improvement in mean WHOQOL-8 scores and psychological distress scores (K10) was not statistically significantly different between completers and non-completers over time. There was no significant difference between completers and non-completers on socio-demographics, self-reported drug addiction or risk taking behaviour on program entry, except for suicidal thoughts while intoxicated (p = 0.033). Completers were more satisfied with their relationships (p = 0.044) and living place (p = 0.040) on program entry. Overall, completers and non-completers demonstrated improved mental health and quality of life from entry to exit, regardless of program completion. Depression, anxiety and stress reduced more markedly in program completers. Policy makers and programmers could use these findings to further validate their own programs to improve mental health and quality of life of opioid users.",

    "abstract": "This special issue of Addiction Science & Clinical Practice, \"Addiction treatment access and utilization among criminal justice involved populations\", presents a series of articles on substance use disorder treatment access and utilization by people who have contact with the criminal justice system (e.g., jails, prisons, and courts). Despite the high prevalence of substance use disorders among people who experience these settings, evidence-based treatment for substance use disorders may be unavailable and/or care may be fragmented during transitions between settings. Articles in this special issue address several gaps in the literature and present a conceptual model of opioid overdose risk, the results of a randomized controlled trial to increase treatment uptake and retention during and after incarceration, descriptions of barriers to treatment after release from incarceration, and data from nationally representative surveys of substance use disorders and treatment use among people who have been involved in the criminal justice system. Importantly, the voices of people with lived experience in the criminal justice system were incorporated in two manuscripts. Together these articles advance our understanding of how to improve care coordination and expansion of services across systems and organizations to prevent overdose, improve treatment utilization, and ultimately, improve health outcomes among criminal justice involved populations in the United States who have substance use disorders or use substances.",

    "abstract": "Background This project will empower cancer patients to address their substance use by establishing an evidence-based strategy for identifying and managing substance use during cancer treatment. The question is: Does the proactive identification and management of substance use in oncology patients improve specific patient outcomes such as quality of life, treatment adherence, and reduction in treatment complications? A multidisciplinary team identified substance use as a contributing factor in several adverse patient outcomes. Further research revealed that there are currently no evidence-based standards to guide the care of patients with alcohol and illicit substance use (AISU) who are diagnosed with cancer. AISU during cancer treatment significantly worsens quality of life outcomes, including problems with pain, sleep, dyspnea, total distress, anxiety, coping, shortness of breath, diarrhea, poor emotional functioning, fatigue and poor appetite[1-4]. AISU in cancer patients may also cause significant safety risks in the short and long term[5-9] and increased mortality [10]. After completing a literature review and an exhaustive needs assessment, the team developed a program to implement Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Therapy (SBIRT) in the outpatient radiation oncology department. The implementation plan includes motivational interviewing training, clinical pathways, and risk-based intervention toolkits that will incorporate oncology-specific resources. Conclusions AISU in cancer patients is a threat to safety and quality of life, and patients who use substances during cancer treatment represent an opportunity to improve wellness in a vulnerable population. A program that incorporates the use of SBIRT as part of routine patient care should improve both cancer-specific and all-cause patient outcomes and is critical to patient safety.",

Simultaneously, OUDs persist as a large and growing public health problem across the United States, leading to epidemic levels of overdose death as well as many other damaging societal consequences. Our goal was to assess the current state of the U.S. substance abuse treatment system and measure its capacity for treating OUDs. Focusing on outpatient methadone maintenance therapy (OPMM), an effective but less frequently studied treatment in recent years, we investigated two primary questions about privately-run substance abuse treatment facilities: 1) What facility-level characteristics best predicted the provision of OPMM? 2) How much of the variation in OPMM availability was attributable to differences between states?",

    "abstract": "At-risk alcohol use is increasing among women and it has been linked to important harm to their health. However, the effectiveness of brief intervention (BI) among women is unclear. Research on the most effective components of those interventions in the female population is necessary, especially in low and middle income countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a BI, carried out among women in a household community setting, on their alcohol consumption. Participants were enrolled through a household survey, using a probabilistic sample of 905 adult women in the city of Juiz de Fora, Brazil. The 61 (6.7%) women who screened positive for at-risk drinking (AUDIT score ≥ 8) were randomly allocated to one of two groups: the Intervention Group (n=32), which received one single session of BI carried out in the household setting after screening, or the Control Group (n=29) which did not receive BI. After three months, 46 (75.4%) participants completed the follow-up interview (23 in each group). All participants received an informative leaflet, and the Intervention Group received a 15-40 minute BI, which provided information on the adverse consequences of alcohol and strategies to help moderate consumption. Participants of both groups decreased their alcohol consumption after three months. The intervention group decreased the mean AUDIT score from 12.4 to 9.4, while the control group reduced from 10.6 to 7.5. Preliminary analyzes using general linear modelling indicate that there was no difference between the Intervention Group and the Control Group in relation to the main outcome (total AUDIT score). Although no difference was found between groups, the results of this study are not conclusive and may reflect the small sample size of the trial. More studies are needed to better estimate the effectiveness of BI among women in a household setting.",

    "abstract": "Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) appears to be an important tool in Brazil and Latin America to address the use/abuse of alcohol and other drugs and to help implement and organize preventive activities, particularly in the services of primary health care (PHC). Nevertheless, there are few studies evaluating the implementation of SBIRT in PHC of Latin American countries, identifying elements that promote positive results in the prevention and/or reduction of consumption according to each situation. Therefore, this study presents a method for implementing SBIRT developed in the PHC of a small/medium Brazilian city, highlighting challenges and possibilities for its dissemination in other cities and countries in Latin America. This is a research intervention, with data collection and evaluation through participant observation. The entire process was evaluated to the suitability to local needs, determining factors that could facilitate or impede its implementation. The method developed consisted of six stages: initial contact and planning, diagnosis and mapping, raising awareness, training and monitoring. In the process of implementation the hindering points detected were: insufficient resources (human, financial, infrastructure), shortage of integration and intersectional health care settings, lack of participation by physicians, focus in dependence, scarcity of participation of civil society and absence of spaces where this population could participate. However, the participation of community health workers and nurses in the implementation and organization of SBIRT, the actions implemented by health teams, such as educational and preventive practices in schools and discussion groups with communities, are positive prospects for the implementation of SBIRT in the Latin American PHC context. Finally, the method presented is considered a useful model to other Latin American cities and countries, with necessary adaptations. Despite the advances, progress is needed in preventing alcohol and other drug abuse in Latin America, with long-term measures.",

    "abstract": "Drug use has an impact on physical and mental health. Quite often, patients attend accident and emergency (A&E) departments due to drug-use-related disorders, and this is why screening and brief intervention for substance use disorders are relevant in emergency room settings. Studies have shown that screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) programmes are effective in several medical settings, including A&E departments. Since most of the evidence has been gathered in the US, this study tries to identify the relevance of substance use disorders in a large Spanish A&E Department and the possible need to implement a SBIRT programme. All medical doctors on duty in a given day were asked prospectively about ward consultations attended during their 16 hours-shift. The questionnaire included information on patients’ substance use and if this was related to the medical visit, whether or not they thought the patient needed referral to an addiction specialist and their opinion on what may help them to improve the management of those patients. 194 patients were attended. 22 patients (11.3%) were reported as substance users. Only 2 were visited by the psychiatrist (1%). Alcohol (n=10), cannabis (n=3) and benzodiazepines (n=4) were the most reported drugs (n=10). Practitioners considered that support from an addiction specialist (8, 7/10) and specific training in the management of substance users (8, 2/10) as the most valuable aids. Availability of screening tools was somewhat less valued (7, 2/10). The number of patients who present to the A&E department with a drug related-problem is large, yet these patients are scarcely seen by the psychiatrist. Practitioners see training opportunities in the management of substance users and the availability of addiction specialists as the most valued aids. Regardless, the rate of patients presenting with substance use related disorders warrants further research and suggests the convenience to implement SBIRT programmes in A&E department settings.",

Common reasons included not being ready to stop consuming alcohol, social stigma, pessimistic attitudes toward the effectiveness of treatment, and attitudinal factors such as minimizing the problem. Disseminating the neuroscience behind alcohol disorders to these at-risk individuals may reduce barriers to acceptance of referral to specialty alcohol treatment. A 20-minute DVD was developed for that purpose. The Transtheoretical Model served as the framework for this brief intervention with active ingredients of the brief intervention corresponding to one of the 10 processes of change. The purpose of this study was to assess the acceptability of, and change in knowledge after the brief intervention. A sample (n=11) of professional firefighters was selected because a previous study among this population found more than half (56%) reported binge drinking (56%) and 14% reported hazardous drinking. A 10-item knowledge test was administered before and immediately after the brief intervention. Mean knowledge scores increased significantly (t=7.72, p < 0.001) from pre- to post-test (43% to 84%, respectively). Acceptability of the video was affirmed from positive comments and interactive discussion following the viewing. This brief alcohol intervention may help shift the current paradigm of shame and blame to one that is consistent with other chronic health disorders (i.e., biologically-based) and otherwise help diminish the stigma that prevents individuals from engaging in alcohol-specialty treatment. This brief intervention is ready to be tested among individuals who are eligible for referral to substance abuse treatment. Intended outcomes will include reduction in alcohol consumption, acceptance of referral to treatment, engagement in treatment, and completion of that specialty treatment.",

    "abstract": "Background Alcoholism is a debilitating disorder associated with widespread cognitive and neurological abnormalities. However, there is limited scientific literature evaluating gender-specific similarities and differences in microstructural white matter pathology associated with alcoholism. In our prior work, we used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging to examine the integrity of white matter fiber tracts in the brains of abstinent alcoholic (ALC) men compared with nonalcoholic (NC) men. We found that ALC men had decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) within white matter fiber tracts connecting to frontal and limbic networks, primarily of the right hemisphere (Harris et al., 2008). In the current project, we sought to confirm our prior findings in abstinent ALC men and, additionally, examine whether different white matter abnormalities were present in abstinent ALC women. Methods As determined by our manual inspection, 60-direction high-quality diffusion tensor imaging images were acquired from 30 abstinent (at least 4 weeks) ALC participants (21 women) and 25 NC controls (17 women). Tract-based spatial statistics tools included in FSL 5.0 were used to analyze a tensor model that yielded regional FA values for each participant. To examine the effects of gender, we built a 2 X 2 ANOVA design with three planned comparisons of primary interest: ALC group-by-gender interaction, ALC women versus NC women, and ALC men versus NC men. Results We observed FA deficits in ALC men relative to NC men, with a similar effect size and variability as observed in our prior study. In contrast, ALC women displayed strikingly greater FA values compared to NC women in widespread white matter regions, including most principal long-association fiber tracts. Also, they had greater FA for local white matter architecture in the dorsolateral and ventral prefrontal regions, as well as the sublenticular extended amygdala. When controlling for multiple comparisons, the higher FA observed in ALC women remained significant. For many regions, groupby-gender interaction effects were observed. However, likely due to the small sample sizes for men, the interaction effects did not survive threshold-free cluster enhancement, the correction procedure for multiple comparisons used in these analyses. Conclusions These results suggest antithetical gender abnormalities in white matter tracts of ALC brains. Whereas abstinent ALC men displayed deficits consistent with our prior study, our new findings for abstinent ALC women demonstrated increased FA values. These distinct patterns of white matter abnormalities point toward a differential underlying neural basis for gender-specific propensity and/or sequelae to long-term alcoholism, and suggest implications for further investigation of possible gender-specific approaches to prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The magnitude of the effect of hepatitis C viral infection on survival is still not fully understood. The objective of this study was to determine whether the presence of hepatitis C viral antibodies in 1991 was associated with increased mortality 20 years later within a cohort of patients with substance use disorders. Secondary objectives were to determine other factors that were associated with increased mortality in the cohort.A subset of a 1991 study cohort of patients who had presented for detoxification was reexamined 20 years later. The Social Security Death Index was queried to identify which of the original patients had died. Attributes of survivors and non-survivors were compared, with special attention to their hepatitis C status in 1991. The original study and this analysis were conducted in the chemical detoxification unit at Johns Hopkins Bayview (previously Francis Scott Key Hospital), an academic urban hospital. All participants met the criteria for alcohol or opioid dependence at the time of admission in 1991. The primary study outcome was 20-year mortality after initial admission in 1991, with a planned analysis of hepatitis C status.Twenty years after admission, 362 patients survived and 82 had died. Of the 284 patients who were hepatitis C positive, 228 survived (80 %). Of the 160 patients who were hepatitis C negative, 134 survived (84 %). This absolute risk increase of 4 % was not statistically significant (p = 0.37). Factors associated with increased mortality included male sex, white race, older age, and reported use of alcohol, cocaine, and illicit methadone. Binary logistic regression including hepatitis C status and these other variables yielded an adjusted odds ratio of 0.87 (95 % CI 0.49-1.55); (p = 0.64) for hepatitis C positive 20-year survival.Hepatitis C positivity was not associated with a statistically significant difference in 20-year survival. The effect of the virus on mortality, if present, is small, relative to the effect of substance use disorders alone.",

    "abstract": "Although alcohol consumption is a leading cause of preventable death and social problems worldwide, many studies have found an association between low-dose consumption and reduced risk of cardiovascular (CVD) disease. Despite important limitations in the underlying research, this idea has been promoted extensively, used to argue against the adoption of effective alcohol policies and led some doctors to advise patients to drink for better health.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of grounds for scepticism about these claims. There have been no randomised studies of low-dose alcohol consumption with disease or death outcomes to confirm findings from non-randomised studies. There are many methodological problems with observational studies, most importantly confounding and misclassification. In contrast to observational studies, a recent large Mendelian randomisation study found that having a genetic disposition that causes less drinking was associated with a significantly reduced risk of coronary disease, even among those who consume modest amounts of alcohol. Recent research has also challenged some of the purported mechanisms for the protective effect of moderate drinking, eg the effect on and impact of blood lipids.\r\n\r\nThis paper will provide methodological critique of the scientific basis for the claim that low-dose alcohol confers health benefits. It is concluded that the protective effects of moderate drinking may be spurious. Governments should strengthen effective alcohol control policies to reduce alcohol-related deaths, social problems and economic costs. Physician advice to patients should focus on reducing consumption among current drinkers, and should discourage drinking initiation or increased consumption on the basis of health-related considerations.",

The WaySafe curriculum was developed for prisoners in the last phase of their substance abuse treatment before transitioning back to the community, and was designed to improve decisionmaking and recognizing and planning for risky situations. A critical next step is to shift the setting from incarceration to a community setting with probationers during the high-risk transition period after release from prison or completion of residential or intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment. Literature supports the importance of prevention programs [1] as part of the continuity-of-care for offenders and probationers in addressing some service gaps (in the continuum), which are widely recognized to reduce the likelihood of successful client outcomes [2,3].\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this presentation is to provide evidence from the recently completed second phase of the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies (CJDATS 2), with insight from key stakeholders that informs the relevance of continuity-of-care and the significant role that community corrections and community-based health-care agencies fulfill in transitioning probationers from incarceration to home. These qualitative results come from two protocols conducted as part of CJDATS 2: HIV Services and Treatment Implementation in Corrections (HIV-STIC) and Medication-Assisted Treatment in Community Corrections Environments (MATICCE). The organizational-level findings reflect the opinions and views of criminal justice personnel and health-care providers—agencies in partnership with TCU in HIV-STIC and MATICCE. In CJDATS 2, stakeholders participated in an implementation research initiative, utilizing a change team strategy to identify and implement improvements to service delivery. In both HIV-STIC and MATICCE, the services delivery continuum incorporated elements of prison-based services and transition to community-based services in their respective areas. Qualitative results highlight the important contributions of community correction agencies, their direct contact to probationers, and their ability to facilitate linkages to service providers. Findings are discussed, emphasizing the importance of staff commitment and interorganizational relationships in continuity-of-care from prison to community as essential components to optimizing services to probationers.",

The survey (N = 437) examined PCP attitudes and knowledge, patient characteristics, and environmental influences, (e.g., mental health parity and medical marijuana laws). We examined how PCP, panel, and organizational characteristics influence screening practices. The pilot examined whether SBIRT versus usual care increased problem identification and specialty treatment rates and the feasibility of SBIRT in pediatric patients. Respondents were less concerned about alcohol than other drug use, rated alcohol use as more difficult to discuss (19% versus 15%) and diagnose (56% versus 70%) than depression, and were more comfortable discussing sexual practices than alcohol (32% versus 22%). They were more likely to screen boys than girls (male PCPs were even more likely: 23% versus 6% [p < 0.0001]). Self-reported screening rates were far higher than electronic medical record (EMR)-documented rates for all substances. Experience, specialty, and recent AOD training (all p < 0.05) predicted self-reported rates; only patient age predicted actual rates. Organizational approaches (e.g., EMR tools and workflow) may matter more than PCP or patient characteristics in determining screening. Respondents reported that SBIRT was highly feasible and that it improved care; more (77) teens receiving SBIRT were referred for further assessment than those receiving usual care, and specialty treatment initiation increased from 8.73% to 12% (p < 0.0001). Organizational factors, lack of training, and discomfort with screening may impact adolescent screening and intervention. Integrated models of care for adolescent behavioral health care should be considered.",

Brief intervention (BI) for alcohol is effective at reducing consumption in patients presenting with facial trauma. Single-session control of violence for angry impulsive drinkers (SS-COVAID) is a new intervention that attempts to address alcohol-related violence. This study assessed the effect of SS-COVAID and BI on drinking and aggression in facial trauma patients. Male facial trauma patients who sustained their injuries as a result of interpersonal violence while drinking and who had Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores of ≥8 were randomized to either BI or SS-COVAID. Patients were followed up at six and 12 months, and drinking and aggression outcomes were analyzed. One hundred ninety-nine patients entered the trial, and 187 were included in the analysis. Of these, 165 (89%) considered themselves to be victims, 92 (51%) had sustained a previous alcohol-related injury, and 28 (15%) had previous convictions for violence. Both interventions resulted in a significant decrease in negative drinking outcomes over 12 months of follow-up (p < 0.001). Neither intervention had a significant effect on aggression scores, nor was there a significant difference between interventions in terms of either outcome. Both SS-COVAID and BI had a significant effect on drinking variables in this patient cohort. No effect on aggression was seen despite the fact that SS-COVAID specifically addresses the relationship between alcohol and violence. One reason for this may be that the facial trauma patients in this study considered themselves to be victims rather than aggressors. Another possibility is that, while BI may successfully address lifestyle factors such as hazardous or harmful drinking, it may not be effective in modifying personality traits such as aggression.",

In order to disseminate the techniques of SBI among Brazilian health professionals, the National Secretary on Drug Policy (SENAD), in partnership with the Drug Dependence Unit of UNIFESP, developed the distance learning program SUPERA. The aim of this study was to assess whether health professionals who participated in SUPERA changed their beliefs and behaviors related to AOD after completing the training. Health professionals from the Brazilian public health network who successfully completed the course (N = 1062) participated in the study. They answered a questionnaire on their beliefs and attitudes regarding AOD use before and after the course. After completing it, 91% of participants reported feeling more able to use SBI techniques than before, and 60% (compared with 37% pre-training) reported believing that demonstrating concern for patients’ AOD use could help reduce their consumption. Seventy-three percent (versus 50% pre-training) believed in the importance of BI to reduce AOD use, and 60% (versus 30%) reported believing in patients’ capacity to reduce AOD use. Most of the participants (66% after training versus 28% before) considered themselves to have an adequate level of knowledge about AOD use, and 83% (versus 22%) reported high confidence in their ability to detect AOD use. These data indicate positive changes in health professionals’ knowledge and attitudes regarding AOD use after the course, suggesting that distance learning is adequate to train health professionals in SBI.",

This study evaluated two training packages for teaching BI-MI, an eight-week comprehensive and a four-week accelerated training in primary care medical settings. Interventionist trainees were medical social workers (n = 22) in primary care clinics serving safety-net patients with drug abuse. Trained coders evaluated post-training BI and MI performance during standardized patient role-play interviews using a checklist of BI clinical tasks and the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) 3.0 coding system. Both training models yielded similar end-point MI skill levels. The proportion of learners who reached beginning proficiency on MI skills by the end of training was comparable to that reported in similar MI training studies (between 25% and 65%). Results suggest that some practitioners working in busy medical settings can learn BI and reach beginning proficiency in MI in as little as one month. Adherence to BI content and MITI outcomes with patients in primary care settings will also be presented.",

    "abstract": "In Catalonia, the implementation of early identification and brief intervention (EIBI) started in 2002. Since then, through an iterative process consisted of two consecutive phases, significant improvements have been achieved in the number of professionals involved, in the level of screening conducted in primary care, and in the referral of people with alcohol use disorders to specialty care. Nevertheless, some elements still need to be addressed to achieve widespread adoption of EIBI. In this presentation, we review the elements identified as facilitators and obstacles to this process. The information comes from process indicators, from ongoing evaluation of results following implementation of the program, and from qualitative information gathered through surveys and interviews with participants in the referral network. Among the facilitators are the creation of the alcohol treatment referral network and the ongoing support for this network, peer-to-peer training, coordination between primary and specialist care, and inclusion in contractual incentives. Barriers included diversity of medical records available, lack of standardized tools for monitoring of action, and lack of a reliable system to monitor implementation in primary care. Once adequate training is available and a positive attitude toward EIBI has been achieved for all involved, one of the chief obstacles facing any health-care system is the institutionalizing the necessary work tools in the available clinical histories. In Catalonia this represents a challenge since there are 27 providers using nine different MR, with the resulting difficulties for integrating and monitoring results.",

An alternative to the traditional in-office approach to SBI holds promise as a way of broadening its reach. The purpose of this study is to share our experience using interactive voice response (IVR) technology to deliver and augment SBI in primary care. We draw on experience from a 12-year program of research in this area, summarizing results from prior studies and describing a new trial currently underway. Questions regarding the nature of IVR; how it works; why it might be a helpful modality for fostering, delivering, and/or augmenting SBI; and how others can embark on IVR research are addressed. We provide a brief overview of the IVR applications we have employed in alcohol research, a description of some methodological challenges we encountered in a prior SBI trial, and how these experiences led us to develop our current IVR-based SBI program. We cover technicalities of developing IVR applications and issues of their implementation in research. Interactive voice response is a feasible modality for delivering assessment and advice about drinking. The technology required for implementation is accessible to researchers and clinicians who do not necessarily have specialized training or expertise. Although this technology offers several advantages, including patient comfort with disclosure of personal information and widespread access and availability, it has downsides as well. For example, refusal and noncompliance can be higher than in other modalities. A small body of research suggests that process variables such as interviewer voice characteristics, survey length, and questionnaire-item format may influence consent to participate and compliance with IVR surveys and interventions.",

This project was funded by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to provided SBIRT for short-term-stay detainees. Elements of the program include increasing access to care and reducing alcohol and other drug (AOD) use by screening with the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Use Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), which assesses risk of developing problems related to AOD use; performing a motivational brief intervention based on the results of the ASSIST; and, when indicated, referring detainees to a course of brief treatment sessions. The university’s ISAP used the Government Performance and Results Act tool (GPRA) and ASSIST data to describe the population and assess outcomes. They also conducted a process evaluation. According to results, risky alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco use were high in this group. Among all participants who completed the ASSIST, 95% scored either high or moderate risk for at least one substance. Fewer participants reported using all AODs at follow-up than at baseline, and those who used substances reported using all AODs on fewer days at follow-up. Participants also had less involvement with the criminal justice system at follow-up and received more outpatient services. This SBIRT project was a successful collaboration between the greater Los Angeles criminal justice system and substance abuse treatment networks and offered access to treatment for thousands of detainees. A key lesson learned was that conducting the ASSIST in the jail setting decrease dropout from treatment in this transient population. Locating clients for follow-up was extremely difficult, thus, incentives plus tracking and locating are crucial. Staff felt the ASSIST and motivational interviewing was extremely well-suited to this population. The success of this project depends upon ongoing training, supervision, and collaboration among the stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Since 2004, the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has funded three cohorts of state grantees to implement screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), a public-health model to identify and address risky alcohol or other drug use. A sustainability study of the Cohort-I SAMHSA SBIRT grantees was conducted using telephone interviews, on-site interviews, and structured observations. Results indicated that seven of the nine Cohort-I sites sustained SBIRT services for alcohol and drugs following SAMHSA funding by incorporating services into a broader wellness model that screened for behavioral and mental as well as physical health. Under this holistic model, SBIRT staff of sustained programs reported greater integration into the host medical facility, buy-in from medical staff, and increased potential for third-party reimbursement for SBIRT services. The literature and findings from the World Health Organization further confirm the effectiveness of adapted SBIRT models for mental health in reducing depressive symptoms and reducing anxiety. The findings from the SBIRT sustainability study and the literature warrant further study among current SAMHSA SBIRT grantees to examine the status of mental health in the delivery of SBIRT for substance use. SAMHSA has begun work with grantees to integrate mental-health services as part of the SBIRT process. To examine grantee technical-assistance needs related to this, in June 2011, SAMHSA SBIRT grantees will report on the extent to which they are screening and delivering services for mental health, how services are delivered, and what grantees’ perceptions are of the needs for mental-health services among their populations and the importance of addressing those needs. The results of this report will be presented as they relate to the Cohort-1 sustainability study findings, the current literature, and future directions for SBIRT program sustainability.",

We interviewed 30 Maori, Pacific Island, and Pakeha (European/white) patients to explore their perceptions of the proposed mobile-phone–delivered intervention and the barriers and facilitators to participation and compliance. Participants were highly supportive of the intervention concept, noting aspects of message content and delivery that would appeal to the major ethnic communities as well as potential barriers that required attention. Text messages (informed by cognitive-behavioral and social-learning theory) that were adapted for the cultural context had particular appeal, as was the proposed delivery of one or two motivational messages on Fridays/weekends over a period of up to four weeks following hospital discharge. Collecting injury-outcome data through record linkage to national databases of hospital discharges and claims to New Zealand’s universal fully-funded accident insurance scheme was both feasible and effective. The proposed trial of 6000 participants appears feasible and acceptable to patients from communities of interest, with economies of scale in both the implementation of the intervention and trial methodology. If demonstrated to be effective, this approach to BI has the potential to be cost-effective, highly scalable, and accessible to harder-to-reach communities in New Zealand and elsewhere. As shown in previous trials, this strategy could also reduce ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in access to interventions.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that community-pharmacy– based screening and brief intervention (SBI) for risky alcohol use is feasible. However, few studies have reported significant reductions in alcohol use following pharmacy-delivered BI. In this study, trained pharmacists (N = 29) at 28 community pharmacies in London, UK, offered BI from February-July 2010. Customers seeking alcohol-related medication and/or advice were targeted. Participating pharmacists used Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) scores (≥3 for women and ≥4 for men), a seven-day drinking diary, and feedback on a readiness to change form to identify people with risky drinking and to inform appropriate advice and feedback. One in four community pharmacy customers (n = 246) offered the alcohol BI were initially interested, and half of these (n = 134, 87 of whom were men) received the intervention. Of the 128 customers whose alcohol use was recorded, 16% (n = 21) were classified as high-risk drinkers, 56% (n = 72) as increasingrisk drinkers, and 27% (n = 35) as low-risk drinkers. Three months following BI, low- and increasing-risk drinkers were contacted by a member of the study team to obtain a post-BI AUDIT-C score and to assess past seven-day alcohol consumption. High-risk drinkers were contacted to ascertain whether they had accessed specialty alcohol services. Seventy-five customers were available for follow-up (response rate, 56%). Of the high-risk drinkers, 91% (n = 10) had seen their general practitioner (GP) and/or accessed specialty alcohol services. Increasing-risk drinkers were found to have significantly reduced their weekly consumption (average decrease, 84%; p = 0.004) and number of drinking days (p = 0.05), however, no significant change in AUDIT-C score was observed. As anticipated, no significant differences in consumption were observed for low-risk drinkers. In this study, community-pharmacy–based alcohol SBI was effective in reducing weekly alcohol use among increasing-risk drinkers and facilitated contact between high-risk drinkers and their GPs and/or specialty alcohol treatment services.",

We investigated these associations as well as help seeking for drinking, awareness of local treatments and recommendations to help family or friends cut down or stop drinking in two Indigenous communities. A representative sample of Indigenous Australians was surveyed in one urban and one remote community in South Australia. Data were collected via the Grog Survey App. Participants were dependent if they reported two or more symptoms of alcohol dependence (ICD-11). Pearson chi-square tests were used to describe relationships between employment by gender, and dependence by awareness of medicines and local treatment options. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to predict the odds of dependent drinkers experiencing harms and getting help for drinking, controlling for age, gender, schooling and income. A total of 775 Indigenous Australians took part in the study. After controlling for confounders, dependent drinkers were nearly eight times more likely to report a harm and nearly three times more likely to get help for their drinking-compared with non-dependent drinkers. Participants recommended accessing local support from an Aboriginal alcohol and other drugs worker, or a detoxification/ rehabilitation service. More support and funding is needed for Indigenous Australians to ensure local treatment options for dependent drinkers are readily available, appropriate and accessible. Involvement of local Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander health professionals in delivery of care can help ensure that it is appropriate to an individual's culture and context.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that service-wide support can increase the odds of alcohol screening in any 2-month period in a cluster randomized trial of service-wide support to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS). Here we report an exploratory analysis on whether the resulting pattern of screening was appropriate. we assess whether that increase in screening was associated with: (i) increased first-time screening, (ii) increased annual screening, (iii) whether frequently screened clients fell into one of four risk categories as defined by national guidelines. Setting and participants: 22 ACCHS; randomized to receive the support model in the treatment ('early-support') arm over 24-months or to the waitlist control arm. eight-component support, including training, sharing of experience, audit-and-feedback and resource support. records of clients with visits before and after start of implementation were included. Multilevel logistic modelling was used to compare (i) the odds of previously unscreened clients receiving an AUDIT-C screen, (ii) odds of clients being screened with AUDIT-C at least once annually. We describe the characteristics of a sub-cohort of clients who received four or more screens annually, including if they were in a high-risk category. Of the original trial sample, 43,054 met inclusion criteria, accounting for 81.7% of the screening events in the overall trial. The support did not significantly increase the odds of first-time screening (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 0.81-2.18, p = 0.25) or of annual screening (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.42-2.37, p = 0.98). Screening more than once annually occurred in 6240 clients. Of the 841 clients with four or more screens annually, over 50% did not fall into a high-risk category. Females were overrepresented. More males than females fell into high-risk categories. The significant increase in odds of screening observed in the main trial did not translate to significant improvement in first-time or annual screening following implementation of support. This appeared to be due to some clients being screened more frequently than annually, while more than half remained unscreened. Further strategies to improve alcohol screening should focus on appropriate screening regularity as well as overall rates, to ensure clinically useful information about alcohol consumption.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol use increases risk for morbidity and mortality and is associated with over 3 million annual deaths worldwide. Contingency Management (CM) is one of the most effective interventions for substance use disorders, and has recently been coupled with technologies to promote novel treatments for alcohol use disorders (AUD). Leveraging these technological advances, we are developing the Automated Reinforcement Management System (ARMS), an integrated CM system designed to enable CM treatment as a component of a digital therapeutic or adjunct therapy remotely to anyone with a smartphone. Objective To collect detailed provider feedback on ARMS and determine the need for modifications to make the system most feasible, acceptable, and useful to providers. Methods Seven providers completed one-hour structured interviews/focus groups wherein we described the ARMS system and its application to clinical care. Providers viewed screen shots of the ARMS provider facing and patient facing systems. Providers gave feedback on their current AUD treatment practices, preferences for the functionality and appearance of the system, preferences for receipt of information on their patients, why they and their patients would or would not use the system, suggestions for improvement, and the proposed intervention overall. To analyze the qualitative data gathered, we used a qualitative descriptive approach with content analysis methods. Results The overarching theme of Individualized Treatment emerged throughout the interviews. This sentiment supports use of ARMS, as it is intended to supplement provider communication and intervention as an adjunctive and customizable tool with the ability to reach rural patients, not a stand-alone option. Themes of Accountability and Objective Assessment arose during discussions of why people would use the system. Themes within provider obstacles included , Information Overload and Clinical Relevance , and in patient obstacles, Sustained Engagement and Security Concerns . Two themes emerged regarding suggestions for improvement: Increasing Accessibility and Bi-directional Communication . Discussion Themes from provider input are being used to modify ARMS to make it more user friendly, time saving, and relevant to treatment of AUD. If successful, ARMS will provide effective, individualized-digital therapeutic for those needing adjunctive treatment or those living in rural remote areas needing better connected care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The 2016 U.S. Centers for Disease Control Opioid Prescribing Guideline (CDC Guideline) is currently being revised amid concern that it may be harmful to people with chronic pain on long-term opioid therapy (CP-LTOT). However, a methodology to faithfully implement the CDC guideline, measure prescriber adherence, and systematically test its effect on patient and public health outcomes is lacking. We developed and tested a CDC Guideline implementation strategy (termed TOWER), focusing on an outpatient HIV-focused primary care setting. Methods TOWER was developed in a stakeholder-engaged, multi-step iterative process within an Information, Motivation and Behavioral Skills (IMB) framework of behavior change. TOWER consists of: 1) a patient-facing opioid management app (OM-App); 2) a progress note template (OM-Note) to guide the office visit; and 3) a primary care provider (PCP) training. TOWER was evaluated in a 9-month, randomized-controlled trial of HIV-PCPs (N = 11) and their patients with HIV and CP-LTOT (N = 40). The primary outcome was CDC Guideline adherence based on electronic health record (EHR) documentation and measured by the validated Safer Opioid Prescribing Evaluation Tool (SOPET). Qualitative data including one-on-one PCP interviews were collected. We also piloted patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) reflective of domains identified as important by stakeholders (pain intensity and function; mood; substance use; medication use and adherence; relationship with provider; stigma and discrimination). Results PCPs randomized to TOWER were 48% more CDC Guideline adherent (p &lt; 0.0001) with significant improvements in use of: non-pharmacologic treatments, functional treatment goals, opioid agreements, prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), opioid benefit/harm assessment, and naloxone prescribing. Qualitative data demonstrated high levels of confidence in conducting these care processes among intervention providers, and that OM-Note supported these efforts while experience with OM-App was mixed. There were no intervention-associated safety concerns (defined as worsening of any of the PROMs). Conclusions CDC-guideline adherence can be promoted and measured, and is not associated with worsening of outcomes for people with HIV receiving LTOT for CP. Future work would be needed to document scalability of these results and to determine whether CDC-guideline adherence results in a positive effect on public health.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Up to 95% of pregnant women with alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems also smoke tobacco. Challenging psychosocial circumstances and a lack of targeted tobacco interventions contribute to low rates of prenatal abstinence and more effective treatment strategies are required. This study explores smoking in pregnant clients of AOD treatment services from a consumer and healthcare provider perspective to examine characteristics of behaviour change and the acceptability of evidence-based tobacco treatment strategies. Outcomes will support the design and implementation of a comprehensive tobacco intervention. Methods A mixed methods triangulated design was used. Thirteen women who smoked and attended antenatal AOD services in New South Wales, Australia, were interviewed and 28 clinicians from the same services were surveyed. Domains including experiences of tobacco smoking in pregnancy, motivators and barriers to cessation and evidence-based strategies to assist cessation during pregnancy were explored. Interviews were analysed using Iterative Categorization, with interpretation guided by Qualitative Description. Online surveys were analysed descriptively. A convergent-parallel mixed methods analysis was performed. Results Women and clinicians agreed that improving baby’s health outcomes was the primary motivation to stop smoking. Negative experiences with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), financial constraints and maternal contraindications restricted its uptake and effectiveness during pregnancy. Both groups agreed that other AOD use, stopping multiple substances concurrently, difficulty coping with stress and the influence of partners who smoke had the biggest impacts on cessation efforts. Clinicians favoured harm-reduction rather than abstinence-based tobacco interventions and women appeared satisfied with reduction efforts. Both views may influence the attainment of prenatal abstinence-based goals. Although previous evidence suggested the contrary, clinicians were willing to encourage simultaneous cessation of tobacco and other substances. Non-judgmental treatment approaches that provide extra support, education and motivation were important for women. Women and clinicians supported use of NRT despite concerns. Financial incentives, counselling, partner support and offering tobacco treatment with antenatal AOD care were considered acceptable treatment options. Conclusions NRT, incentives, counselling and partner support could be utilized in a tobacco intervention for pregnant women with substance use concerns. Non-judgmental education, motivation, and provision of NRT including instruction for correct use are important considerations.",

    "abstract": "During the first 5 years of the Disease Risk Reduction Project, an in-prison intervention curriculum was developed and tested that focused on decreasing risky sexual and drug use behaviors after release. The WaySafe intervention curriculum was delivered during the 2 months prior to release from incarceration. Compared to the control group, those in WaySafe showed greater gains on all composite measures (e.g., HIV knowledge confidence, avoidance of risky sex, avoidance of risky drug use, HIV testing awareness, and risk reduction skills. In addition, WaySafe was followed by a take-home workbook to be completed post-release. The goal of the take-home assignment was to reinforce skills and strategies learned through WaySafe during the offenders’ transition back into the community.\r\n\r\nWith lessons learned from the take-home assignment, as an important next step, the current project is focusing on adapting and delivering the intervention curriculum in community correction populations. Because computerized interventions have demonstrated promising results with substance abuse treatment [1], the new StaySafe intervention is formatted as an engaging computer-driven program. Computer applications in these treatment setting studies were found to be similarly or more efficacious than traditional counselor-led treatment sessions [1]. These findings suggest adoption of new technologies to deliver treatment. StaySafe will incorporate the same evidence-based cognitive principles as WaySafe in 12 self-paced modules that can be self-administered during the first 6 months under community supervision. This presentation will provide an overview of the computerized StaySafe approach and discuss the technological development of StaySafe elements. We will demonstrate the use of computerized, interactive, cognitive mapping strategies for presentation of ideas within the program as well as strategies for eliciting participant input and responses, including strengths and weaknesses of different response strategies (e.g., recording audio responses, using a keyboard or touchscreen to type responses, writing responses on the touchscreen, or choosing a response from a predetermined, pull-down list). Examples of several StaySafe computerized elements will be demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Background Self-report of nonmedical prescription opioid use (NMPU) is a cornerstone of drug abuse surveillance, policymaking, and treatment service planning, but misclassification creates bias and may confuse or undermine NMPU estimates [1]. We detected old OxyContin (OC) abuse reports long after a reformulated version (OP) was released (August 2010). This study explored sources of possible NMPU misclassification and proposed solutions. Materials and methods A mixed-methods approach identified demographic, behavioral, and cognitive factors influencing endorsement of old formulations in: a) multivariable regression analyses of NMPU data from the ASI-MV surveillance program [2] examined predictors of endorsing old (vs. new) formulations during the post-reformulation period (n = 8032); b) prevalence estimates of OC availability from an online recreational drug user forum survey (fall 2013; n = 459); and c) semistructured interviews (n = 29) and cognitive interviews (n = 7) among residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment program clients reporting past 2-year use of OC/OP. A coding guide identified patterns and themes of misidentification in transcribed interviews.",

    "abstract": "Background Motivational interviewing (MI) is a counseling technique used to elicit change by exploring an individual’ sd esire and commitment to making changes. In this study, probation clients are randomized to a two-session MI intervention occurring approximately 3–4 weeks apart. The first session primarily focuses on building motivation to change substance use, engage in treatment, and make other changes to improve probation outcomes; the second session focuses on goal setting and social support. Methods This paper examines responses from 96 clients who completed the first counselor-driven MI session. Researchers extracted client reasons associated with commitment to probation and treatment. Analyses matched the clients’ responses to the MI session with quantitative data on motivation to change, demographics, and criminal history obtained during the baseline assessment. Results Clients generally reported higher levels of treatment motivation during the MI session as compared to the scales from the CJ Client Evaluation of Self and Treatment (CEST). Results from the CEST indicated that the majority of the sample (79.2%) had low/moderate levels of motivation to seek help and recognize that they have a problem (82.3%). However, on a scale of 1–10, clients reported high commitment to complete probation (M = 9.67) and treatment/decreasing use (M = 8.30). Individuals under 36 years old who scored low/moderate on a criminal justice (CJ) risk tool, and males indicating that they did not want to go to jail reported higher commitment ratings. During the MI session, the primary reasons for increased motivation were family, tired of being in the CJ system, not wanting to go back to jail, and tired of using. For female probationers, family was the most frequently stated reason (28.6%) for being committed to finishing probation. Employment was the primary reason given for wanting to change substance use behavior, particularly among probationers under 36 years old. Older individuals were more likely to be tired of using drugs. During the MI session, clients’ goals for the next 30 days mostly dealt with probation issues like attending the first probation appointment (53.1%). Treatment-related goals (e.g., making a treatment provider appointment (26%) were less frequent. Conclusion",

    "abstract": "Since the approval of buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) in 2002, it has become increasingly likely that some individuals with OUD will have been treated with both buprenorphine and methadone at different points in time. However, this emergent group of patients has not been well described. We completed a retrospective cohort study of individuals at the Cincinnati Veterans Administration with treatment episodes for both buprenorphine and methadone and compared this group with individuals who received treatment with buprenorphine only or methadone only. Between January 1, 2006, and May 1, 2014, 163 veterans had both buprenorphine and methadone treatment episodes for OUD. We extracted information from the local administrative and pharmacy databases to describe these individuals. Individuals with treatment episodes for both medications had significantly higher levels of comorbidity with other substance use disorders (specifically, alcohol, benzodiazepine, cannabis, and cocaine use disorders) as well as mood and anxiety disorders than those who received either buprenorphine or methadone only. They also used a disproportionate amount of urgent and emergency services compared to individuals prescribed either buprenorphine or methadone only (mean of 17.8 billable days versus 11.3 for buprenorphine only and 10.4 for methadone only, p < 0.0001). We conclude that these patients represent a treatment-resistant group that would benefit from earlier identification and more intensive intervention.",

    "abstract": "Service organizational implementation trial The U.S. juvenile justice system has a number of possible behavioral health service community linkages for substance abuse and HIV services. However, there have only been a small number of systemic studies that examine and seek to improve these community behavioral health linkages for involved youth. Implementation science, as an emerging area, is a way of identifying, testing, and understanding effective strategies for translating treatment and prevention evidence-based approaches into community behavioral health service delivery. The purpose of this presentation, within the context of the Juvenile Justice-Translating Research Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System (JJ-TRIALS) implementation behavioral health trial, is to describe the diverse settings in which the study will be initiated and how partners are involved in the study design. State partners include juvenile justice (JJ) and behavioral health services organizations in seven states (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas) and the District of Columbia. Factors associated with selection, participation, and implementing the study in 36 sites will be explored. Each site will include a JJ agency and up to two community behavioral health service organizations for 7–10 implementation team members representing executive, management, supervisory, and line staff. JJ partner involvement is helping to design the study protocol that is both feasible for sites and meets partner needs. Study sites are defined as a county or service area, which can include multiple counties when behavioral health services are sparse. Site clusters will be used, which are defined within each state to assure that each of the six research centers have an equal number of experimental and control sites to take into account broader contextual factors. Options for defining clusters include county size, JJ youth population, urban/rural, or type of community supervision — probation or juvenile drug court. Sites will not be preselected for substance use or related behavioral health service needs, so youth are included with diverse behavioral health needs. Two JJ partners have actively participated on the study design work group, and the protocol has been vetted through partners at steering committee meetings and conference calls.",

    "abstract": "Background More than two-thirds of individuals with a substance use problem have seen a primary care provider in the previous 6 months. However, these substance use disorders often go unrecognized or without treatment due to a lack of optimized assessment and intervention models with which primary care providers are comfortable. As national guidelines call for improved integration of addiction treatment into primary care settings, mobile technology may provide an invaluable tool to primary care providers in assisting their patients in recovery and in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of office visits for these patients. This paper will describe preliminary qualitative data and the early experience with integrating Seva, a suite of mobile technological applications to support recovery, at two Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted with FQHC patients with substance use disorders at two study sites (Madison, WI: n = 12; Missoula, MT: n = 5) to identify potential strengths and concerns of Seva in addressing substance use problems in primary care. Focus groups were conducted with clinic staff (Madison, WI: n = 20; Missoula, MT: n = 8) to identify strengths and concerns from their perspectives. Notes taken during development meetings between clinic and research teams also provided qualitative data. Results",

Aside from psychosocial interventions, pharmacological treatment is effective for decreasing alcohol consumption and promoting abstinence. However, unique factors belonging to HCV-infected individuals, such as baseline hepatic vulnerability and possible ongoing hepatitis C treatment, complicate AUD drug therapy. The goal of this review is to systematically identify, summarize, and evaluate the existing evidence on the pharmacological management of AUD in HCV-infected individuals. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for English- and French-language articles published from 1993 to December 2013. The search criteria focused on clinical trials and observational studies assessing the efficacy and/or safety of pharmacological management of AUD in patients infected with HCV. Of 421 identified studies, three were included for analysis. Two were observational studies assessing the safety of disulfiram. One was a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of baclofen. There is paucity of data regarding the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatment of AUD in HCV-infected individuals, with studies being small series and showing significant heterogeneity. No strong recommendations can be made based on the current studies as to which pharmacological option should be preferred in this sub-population.",

    "abstract": "Various hospital accreditation and quality assurance entities in the United States have approved and endorsed performance measures promoting alcohol brief intervention (BI) for hospitalized individuals who screen positive for unhealthy alcohol use, the spectrum of use ranging from hazardous use to alcohol use disorders. These performance measures have been controversial due to the limited and equivocal evidence for the efficacy of BI among hospitalized individuals. The few BI trials conducted with hospital inpatients vary widely in methodological quality. While the majority of these studies indicate limited to no effects of BI in this population, none have been designed to account for the most pervasive methodological issue in BI studies presumed to drive study findings towards the null: assessment reactivity (AR). This is a three-arm, single-site, randomized controlled trial of BI for hospitalized patients at a large academic medical center affiliated with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs who use alcohol at hazardous levels but do not have an alcohol use disorder. Participants are randomized to one of three study conditions. Study Arm 1 receives a three-part alcohol BI. Study Arm 2 receives attention control. To account for potential AR, Study Arm 3 receives AC with limited assessment. Primary outcomes will include the number of standard drinks/week and binge drinking episodes reported in the 30-day period prior to a final measurement visit obtained 6 months after hospital discharge. Additional outcomes will include readiness to change drinking behavior and number of adverse consequences of alcohol use. To assess differences in primary outcomes across the three arms, we will use mixed-effects regression models that account for a patient's repeated measures over the timepoints and clustering within medical units. Intervention implementation will be assessed by: a) review of intervention audio recordings to characterize barriers to intervention fidelity; and b) feasibility of participant recruitment, enrollment, and follow-up. The results of this methodologically rigorous trial will provide greater justification for or against the use of BI performance measures in the inpatient setting and inform organizational responses to BI-related hospital accreditation and performance measures.

Methods Individuals were eligible to participate if they had OUD and had initiated treatment in the past month. Participants ( n = 244) completed a semi-structured interview using the Addiction Severity Index—Lite. Results At baseline, 37.70% of participants reported significant thoughts of suicide over their lifetime and 27.46% reported suicidal attempts over their lifetime. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of lifetime suicidal thoughts and attempts. A history of physical abuse (OR = 4.31, p &lt; .001), having chronic pain-related conditions (OR = 3.28, p &lt; .001), a history of depression (OR = 3.30, p = .001) or anxiety (OR = 7.47, p = .001), and Latino/a/x ethnicity (OR = 2.66, p = .01) were associated with an increased risk of lifetime suicidal thoughts.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS) is a widely used 12-item tool to assess mental health and social functioning. The French version has an added 13th item measuring adherence to psychotropic medication. The aim of the current study is to uncover the unknown pattern of the new item 13 and to compare the unidimensional and multidimensional fit of the new HoNOS-13 using Item Response Theory (IRT). This research question was studied among inpatients with substance use disorder (SUD). Methods Six hundred and nine valid questionnaires of HoNOS-13 were analyzed using unidimensional (one-factor) and multidimensional (two-factor) IRT modeling. Results The multidimensional model suggesting a first factor capturing psychiatric/impairment-related issues and a second factor reflecting social-related issues yielded better goodness-of-fit values compared to the unidimensional solution. This resulted in an improvement of all slope parameters which in turn translates to better discriminative power. Significant improvement in item location parameters were observed as well. The new item 13 had a good discriminative power (1.17) and covered a wide range of the latent trait (− 0.14 to 2.64). Conclusions We were able to validate the 13-item questionnaire including medication compliance and suggest that the HoNOS-13 can be recommended as a clinical evaluation tool to assess the problems and treatment needs for inpatients with SUD. Interestingly, the majority of item response categories are endorsed by respondents who are below and above the average levels of HoNOS. This indicates that the scale is able to discriminate between participants both at the low and at the high ends of the latent trait continuum. More importantly, the new item 13 has a good discriminative power and covers a broad range of the latent trait below and above the mean. It therefore has the desired profile of a good item and is a useful measure for the assessment of mental health and social functioning. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT03551301.

    "abstract": "Transition from incarceration to the community is a critical time for offenders, especially those with substance abuse problems. Many succumb to temptation to return to drug use and possibly risky needle sharing, and engaging in risky sex activities. This critical time period entails substantial health risks for the offender as well as significant risks to public health.\r\n\r\nWell-established and consistent use of HIV/HBV/HCV risk reduction prevention programs with continuity of care do not exist in most criminal justice treatment systems because of lack of policy development and integration between institution and community-based corrections, health, and social service agencies. Interventions targeting re-entry are crucial because of the likelihood for risk behaviors to increase upon return to the community. Approaches for community correction populations are needed that have the capability of addressing motivational, social, and cognitive deficits.\r\n\r\nThis presentation discusses an approach to translating ideas from the prison-based WaySafe curriculum into community settings for probationers who have recently completed residential, intensive outpatient, or prison-based substance abuse treatment. The adapted intervention, StaySafe, will be based on evidence-based cognitive principles, including TCU Mapping Enhanced Counseling techniques designed to improve decision-making skills regarding health risk behaviors during the critical first 6 months under community supervision. It is being designed to be self-administered by participating probationers during downtime, either prior to or following meetings with their probation officers.\r\n\r\nAn important goal in the adaptation and testing of StaySafe is to have a sustainable, evidence-based product for probation departments that can be administered with minimal staff training and time that is engaging and easy to use by probationers, requires minimal maintenance, and is free to probation departments (other than the cost of the touch-screen computers).\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we describe the StaySafe intervention and the adaptation process from a prison-based group curriculum to a community corrections-based individualized approach. The adaptation process borrows ideas from the ADAPT-ITT framework [1]. We will describe initial results from focus groups and interviews with probationers and probation officers on problems and successes in probation, logistical issues with delivering interventions in probation settings, and results of a “theater” test of elements of StaySafe to gauge participant reactions.",

    "abstract": "Nurses play a critical role in integrating screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) services as standard of care in healthcare settings. Nurses are well positioned to deliver SBIRT services because of their extended patient contact and existing skill sets in health promotion, communication, and patient education. Patients consistently rate nurses in population-wide surveys to be the most trusted professional group in the United States. Data collected from SBIRT initiatives funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in the United States indicate the vast majority of SBIRT service providers are nurses, social workers, and counselors. While nurses are key to deliver SBIRT services, specific training and preparation is necessary. This presentation will review evidence and rationale that support nurse-implemented SBIRT and will describe three models employed by the SBIRT Colorado initiative to integrate SBIRT into nursing academic preparation as well as nursing practice across diverse settings. The models include: 1) in-person skills-based training; 2) rapid improvement activities; and 3) interactive, online e-learning technology called “SBIRT Substance Use NursingMentor™.” The online training uses computational linguistics, search and streaming media to teach SBIRT skills through engaging simulated interactions. The SBIRT Substance Use NursingMentor was developed as a collaborative effort between MedRespond, Peer Assistance Services, Inc., and NORC at the University of Chicago. Quantitative and qualitative data collected from nurse training participants will be described. Pilot test results from nurses who participated in the online training demonstrated an increase in knowledge, awareness, and understanding of risky drinking, illicit substance use, and related consequences. Data collected from metrics integrated into the online module launched in May 2013 will be analyzed to evaluate the use of e-learning technologies to provide skill-based SBIRT competency training. Presenters will discuss recommendations that indicate how to target and tailor training for nurses for effective SBIRT dissemination.",

    "abstract": "To ultimately create more effective brief interventions (BIs), we compared the extent of alcohol misuse severity and estimated blood alcohol levels (BALs) between male and female emergency department (ED) patients. We surveyed a random sample of nonintoxicated subcritically ill or injured 18-64 year-old English- or Spanish-speaking patients on randomly selected dates and times at two EDs in July-August 2009. Participants self-administered the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and a questionnaire about their alcohol use in the past 30 days. Using the formulae by Mathews and Miller, gender-specific BALs were estimated for participants according to their weight and the number of alcoholic drinks consumed on days when typically drinking and on days of heavy episodic drinking (≥5 drinks per occasion for men, ≥ 4d rinks per occasion for women). Gender-specific alcohol misuse severity levels (harmful, hazardous, or dependent) were calculated using AUDIT scores. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Pearson’s chi-squared tests were used to compare outcomes by gender. Of the 513 participants, 52% were women. Mean AUDIT scores were greater for men than women (7.5 versus 5.3; p < 0.001), although alcohol misuse severity levels were similar between men and women (24.4% versus 26.6% for hazardous drinking, 2.8% versus 2.2% for harmful drinking, and 6.5% versus 3.4% for dependence, respectively; p < 0.38). Men reported greater mean alcohol consumption than women when typically drinking (4.3 versus 3.3 drinks per day; p < 0.001) and during heavy episodic drinking (8.6 versus 5.3 drinks per occasion; p < 0.001). However, the mean BALs for men and women were similar when typically drinking (0.05 and 0.06, respectively; p < 0.13) and during heavy episodic drinking (0.13 and 0.12, respectively; p < 0.13). For future ED brief interventions, women may benefit from realizing that, despite drinking less alcohol on average than their male peers, they are reaching similar BALs with comparable levels of alcohol misuse.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to explore associations between alcohol consumption and marijuana use in young adults and to discuss opportunities for brief intervention (BI). Face-to-face structured interviews were carried out with 2221 young adult Czechs (mean age, 29.9; SD, 5.8 years). Of the total sample, 51.4% were males. Alcohol consumption was calculated using a beverage-specific quantity/frequency method. Alcohol-related problems were assessed using the Czech version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Participants were also asked about the frequency of marijuana use in the last 12 months. Overall past-year alcohol consumption per individual was 9.2 L of ethanol. The past-year prevalence of marijuana use was 21.8%. The use of marijuana positively correlated with the frequency of beer drinking (r = 0.27), frequency of heavy episodic drinking [HED], (r = 0.32) and with the AUDI summary score (r = 0.39). People with harmful or problem drinking (AUDIT score > 16) reported marijuana use more frequently than people who drank moderately (60% compared with 18.8%; odds ratio [OR] = 6.54; 95% CI = 4.7; 9.1). The OR for marijuana use in people with HED was 4.3 (CI = 3.3; 5.6). These results suggest that frequent HED and harmful drinking are closely associated with marijuana use in younger adults. As marijuana use (including heavy use) is common in the Czech Republic, extending screening and BI to reduce the use of cannabis may be recommended. The existing guidelines for BI should be modified to cover marijuana consumption as well.",

Over 3000 people have been trained to deliver alcohol brief interventions across Wales by the small (2 man) central Public Health Wales alcohol team. However, the team cannot keep up with demand from the 7 Welsh Health Boards to receive training. In order to address this, a train-the-trainers course has been developed, piloted and evaluated. The evaluation was based on both post-course assessment of the delivery and has been followed up with qualitative field work to ascertain if the standards of the Public Health Wales team are being replicated by the trainees. The evaluation was targeted both at the Public Health Wales central team in regard to their train the trainers course but also in regard to the delegates ability to take the theory into practice. The key issue has been the commitment of the individuals to address the issue of alcohol as a problem across Wales. It is also apparent that those who attend the training course need to meet a number of key pre-requisites which make them better placed and more capable of delivering a brief intervention training course that will inspire others to conduct interventions. Public Health Wales was able to use the evaluation to adjust the training to make it more impactful but also to develop a list of key traits which prospective attendees would have to meet in order to effectively deliver brief interventions as part of their regular role.",

    "abstract": "Screening in primary care is widely recommended (e.g. U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), and is increasingly targeted for improvement. As health care payers try to influence the implementation and delivery of alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI), some are using provider payment approaches. These include specific reimbursement for conducting screening, other financial incentives and linking payment with performance measures. We present 2010 data from a nationally representative survey of private US health plans and US health plan claims data (private health plans and Medicare), supplemented by literature review. Results indicate, among private health plan products in the US, 72.6% report allowing primary care physicians to bill for alcohol SBI, yet claims data analysis found only 0.01% of individuals in private plans or Medicare had an SBI procedure code on a medical claim in 2010. As of April 2013 the UK National Health Service requires that primary care practices conduct screening of individuals 16 and over and reimburses for SBI. In the US, although financial incentives for providers are becoming more common in private health plans (used by 31.6% for any condition), only 6% of health plans provided financial incentives for primary care screening for alcohol and drug use problems. Provider payment policies may be tied to performance measures to improve the quality of care. Alcohol screening is one of more than 300 performance measures selected for inclusion in the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Physician Quality Reporting System. Despite this recognition, CMS analyses indicate the alcohol screening measure was not among the top five measures chosen by primary care providers. Although alcohol SBI is beneficial, it is not as widely implemented as it could be. Favorable payment policies are necessary, but not sufficient to encourage implementation of SBI.",

    "abstract": "In 2006, the Quebec provincial government committed itself to developing capacity for evidence-based alcohol and other drug screening and brief intervention (SBI) in frontline health-service delivery settings. Two studies were conducted prior to province-wide deployment to inform decision makers as to possible implementation challenges. Study 1 evaluated the efficacy of implementing a model of SBI, adapted from the World Health Organization, in three frontline public health services. Sixty-two clinicians were trained in systematic detection of substance use and brief motivational intervention. Chart review of new admissions (N = 453) prior and following training assessed clinician conformity to SBI guidelines. Forty percent of patients endorsed at least one item on the four-question CAGE-AID (Cut Down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye Opener screen Adapted to Include Drugs). Systematic screening among new admissions peaked at 70% and decreased to pre-training levels seven months after training. However, more than half of all new patients were assessed with validated questionnaires rather than informal questioning. Implementation of motivational interviewing techniques led to modest changes in clinician interventions. A second qualitative study was conducted to document possible organizational barriers to SBI implementation. Interviews were conducted with 24 clinicians and program administrators from frontline services of the six main health regions of Quebec province. Choice of vocabulary used in public policy documents and program material and sequence of delivery of services created confusion among clinicians as to what constituted alcohol and other drug SBI. Many resources developed for other SBI health programs in these frontline services seemed to be transferable to alcohol and drug SBI. Lessons learned were as follows: complexity in the SBI program is inversely related to the subsequent integrity of program deployment; clarity as to what constitutes SBI is paramount; and integration of parallel competencies/related programs could facilitate deployment of alcohol and other drug SBI.",

Evidence demonstrates that SBIRT in primary care settings is effective in changing behavior and preventing adverse outcomes attributable to alcohol and other drugs. Studies also show people living with HIV are more likely to experience substance abuse problems than the general population, and early detection offsets the negative ramifications, including poor treatment adherence. Despite the linkage between substance use and HIV, screening and brief intervention protocols have not been readily adopted in HIV/AIDS services in the United States. In order to introduce SBIRT procedures tailored for HIV/AIDS care, Colorado implemented a collaboration between the state’s SBIRT initiative and its Ryan White Part B HIV treatment and care program. Of 2500 patients screened, 31% received a brief intervention for risky alcohol, tobacco, or drug use, and 23% were referred for therapy or specialized treatment. Program evaluation findings gathered from focus groups and patient and provider surveys indicate that SBIRT can be successfully integrated into HIV treatment and care to address risky substance use. We explore the barriers to implementing SBIRT in HIV care and identify the administrative and policy considerations necessary for effective implementation. Recommendations are made for standardizing SBIRT in HIV care (applying a systematic approach to screening; training providers to conduct brief interventions; establishing a referral network; and integrating SBIRT with adherence and retention efforts).",

A two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial applying an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approach with 30 data time-points was conducted in the Netherlands, 2010-2011. Students aged 18 to 24 years old who reported heavy drinking in the past six months and who were ready to change behaviour were included in the study. Participants were randomized into the experimental (n = 456: WDYD intervention) or control condition (n = 451: no intervention). Outcome measures were weekly alcohol consumption and frequency of binge drinking. Latent growth curve analyses to model individual change in alcohol use over time by condition revealed that participants in the experimental condition had significantly lower weekly alcohol consumption and frequency of binge drinking compared to participants in the control condition that sustained after three (B0 = -2.60, p < .001; B1 = 0.16, p = 0.08) and six (B0 = -0.14, p = 0.01; B1 = 0.00, p = 0.19) months follow-up, respectively. Additional linear regression analyses indicated that the intercept differences resulted from an increase in alcohol use for participants in the control condition compared to those in the experimental condition. The WDYD intervention was shown to be effective in preventing an increase in weekly alcohol consumption and frequency of binge drinking shortly after the intervention that sustained after three and six months post-intervention, respectively.

    "abstract": "Pharmacy-based alcohol brief intervention (BI) has the potential to identify risky drinkers in the general population, but the opinions of users regarding the service remain relatively unexplored. Alcohol BI was offered to customers by trained pharmacists (n = 29) at 28 London, UK, community pharmacies between February and July 2010. Customers requiring alcohol-use related medication and/or advice were targeted. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C), a drinking diary, and a readiness to change assessment were used by pharmacists to assess and provide appropriate feedback regarding alcohol use. Customers also received written information, including a UK Department of Health “Units and You” booklet. Following BI, customers were given a confidential service evaluation questionnaire to complete and return to the project team using a prepaid envelope. This invited responses to closed- and open-format questions regarding their initial reason for visiting the pharmacy, why they took up the BI service, and their levels of satisfaction with the service delivery and environment. Of the 134 customers who received a BI, 58% (n = 78) returned the questionnaire. Bringing a prescription for dispensing was the most common reason for the pharmacy visit (55%, n = 43). Wishing to find out about alcohol use and concerns for personal health were the two most reported reasons for taking up the service. Almost one-quarter of customers (n = 18) reported that they liked having increased their alcohol-related awareness, and 18% (n = 14) indicated that they liked the informative written information. The privacy (74%, n = 57), confidentiality (77%, n = 59), and quietness (70%, n = 54) of consulting rooms was rated as good, with 77% (n = 60) of customers reporting they would recommend this service to others. In line with past primary care BI studies, customers were generally positive about the experience of receiving BI in community pharmacies and would recommend it to others.",

    "abstract": "Skill acquisition and maintaining fidelity to a practice requires ongoing monitoring and performance feedback in addition to initial training. This paper describes an evaluation of a training and coaching model employed for the Texas and Georgia screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) programs, funded by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Both programs were both implemented in large community medical settings that included hospital emergency departments, trauma and inpatient services, and primary care. We describe the specialist training processes with an emphasis on our web- and phone-based expert coaching model and standardized training programs. Specialists who received the multifaceted training package demonstrated significant improvements in SBIRT skills during a half-day standardized patient activity and over 12 months of coaching as measured by the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) coding system and coaching evaluations. Videotaped recordings of four standardized patient training sessions for 20 randomly selected trainees were coded by an expert external coder using the MITI-3 coding system. Trainees made significant improvements in evocation (p = 0.004), collaboration (p = 0.003), direction (p = 0.030), empathy (p = 0.029), spirit (p = 0.008), and in percentage of MI-adherent speech (p = 0.035). Further, 148 quarterly reports were examined for those trainees who received at least 12 months of coaching. Thirty-seven trainees (17 from Texas and 20 from Georgia) were included in these analyses. Trainee global ratings on spirit (Texas, p = 0.026; Georgia, p = 0.002) and empathy (Texas, p = 0.012; Georgia, p = 0.001) improved during the four quarters. In addition, MI-behavior ratings for both sites showed improvement at some point over the four quarters analyzed (p < 0.05). This study adds evidence to previous findings indicating that progressive feedback and coaching enhance SBIRT skill development.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) is effective in many health-care settings. Previous research has shown significant decreases in harmful drinking due to SBI, but many studies, particularly in emergency/trauma settings, did not use a control group. Thus, it is unclear if observed decreases in harmful drinking are due to the intervention or other factors such as the hospital visit, the substance use assessment, or simply regression to the mean. This project assessed the effectiveness of an SBI program implemented at an urban hospital in the US state of Georgia. Participants were enrolled between January 2009 and April 2010 during an emergency department visit. Intervention patients (n = 120) and control patients (n = 400) were assessed using the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) and completed a survey that measured harmful drinking, among other items. Intervention patients received a 10-15 minute motivational-interviewing–based brief intervention aimed at reducing harmful drinking. All patients were contacted six months later for follow-up assessment. Analyses investigated between-group differences in alcohol consumption over time. Among intervention group patients, results show that past 30-day mean drinking days were reduced from 11.7 days at baseline to 5.8 days at six months and mean binge drinking days were reduced from 7.6 days at baseline to 3.0 days at six months. Although the control group also showed significant reductions in mean drinking days and heavy episodic drinking days over time, regression analysis indicated a significantly greater reduction in heavy episodic drinking days for the intervention group. Further analyses examined the impact of the intervention across different risk levels, based on ASSIST score. Preliminary results suggest those with moderate-risk drinking received the most benefit from the brief intervention. These results provide further evidence of SBI’s effectiveness in reducing harmful drinking.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal alcohol consumption can result in a range of adverse outcomes including fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Russia has high alcohol use, and hazardous drinking among women has increased. Russian women reported that obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) would be the best source of information about associated risks of alcohol use during pregnancy. Two initiatives to reduce FASD, Project CHOICES (Changing High-Risk Alcohol Use and Increasing Contraception Effectiveness Study) and the Healthy Moms intervention, as well as a brief dial-focused physician intervention (DFBPI), were modified for use in Russian OB-GYN care. We compared OB-GYN skills demonstrated in an educational trial and in a clinical trial aimed at preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Sixty-five OB-GYNs participated in the educational trial through continuing medical education (CME) programs at St. Petersburg Pediatric Academy in Russia. Participants’ DFBPI skills were assessed using videotapes of roleplaying with a simulated patient. Audiotapes of 80 clinic visits conducted by 14 OB-GYNs trained in DFBPI were coded. The OB-GYNs and study participants completed exit checklists after each clinic visit. Compared with OB-GYN physicians assigned to regular CME programs, physicians who received DFBPI training had significantly improved skills and higher levels of competency in conducting alcohol screening and interventions. Discussing the difficulties and barriers that may prevent women from achieving alcohol abstinence/reduction goals appeared to be the most difficult component for physicians to implement, and OB-GYNs had difficulty assisting patients in discussing barriers and selecting contraception methods. Russian physicians trained in DFBPI were able to implement skills learned in the clinical trial. In addition to the alcohol focus, a component to improve physicians’ skills in discussing contraceptive use should be added to DFBPI training.",

    "abstract": "It is well-documented that alcohol and tobacco consumption reduce treatment efficacy, increase side effects, may encourage relapse and/or secondary cancers, and affect quality of life in patients being treated for cancer. Because it represents a “teachable moment” for many of those diagnosed, cancer may create a window of opportunity in which to intervene, to help patients identify behaviors that put them at risk for poor health outcomes, and to provide them with the support required to make and adhere to desired lifestyle modifications. Despite scientific, clinical, and political incentives, SBI for risky alcohol use in cancer settings is poorly implemented. Stigmatization of people with addictive behaviors and lack of education about the health consequences of at-risk alcohol use may contribute to the limited dissemination of SBI. We present the framework of implementation for a clinical program of screening, case finding, and brief intervention for first-time cancer patients with at-risk alcohol behavior in a surgical oncology unit. Our educational program for health caregivers focuses on screening and detection procedures, interpersonal skills, openness to implementing new intervention programs, types of interventions, and SBI training. We also present results of a preliminary qualitative analysis of human and organizational barriers and facilitators to implementing an SBI program. Implementing specific training courses may help health professionals placing the problem of alcohol in a new perspective and eliminate the aspects of fatalism and resignation which are so often observed.",

Fifty years later, in the Liberty Hotel, the same space as the former Charles Street Jail in Boston where there was a “drunk tank” and across from that same MGH ED, over 200 researchers and clinicians gathered to present over 100 abstracts and plenary sessions on screening and brief intervention (SBI). In those 50 years, thousands of patients participated in randomized trials of SBI; the US Institute of Medicine (in 1990) encouraged identification and intervention for unhealthy alcohol use for people across the spectrum from risky use through dependence; the World Health Organization validated assessment tools and showed SBI’s effectiveness in primary care settings; and the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration allocated substantial funding for SBI for both alcohol and other drugs across many general health settings.\r\n\r\nResearch presented at the September 2011 International Network on Brief Interventions for Alcohol and Other Drugs (INEBRIA) conference in Boston was from around the globe, covered alcohol and other drugs, crossed a variety of health settings and practitioners, and showed the sophistication that has been reached in the field. Research discussed when, where, and for whom SBI has or might not have efficacy, how to implement SBI programs, adaptations of SBI, costs and effectiveness, and many other topics. Nonetheless, despite the excitement, breadth, and sophistication, the fact remains that few patients eligible for SBI receive the service, and, as a result, opportunities to improve health and save health care costs are missed. Most people with alcohol and drug use disorders receive no treatment.\r\n\r\nAt least in some cases, SBI is ready for dissemination. And, with solid evidence available, health reforms promised in the US and elsewhere, and an international discussion taking serious shape regarding the integration of care for medical, mental health, and substance use conditions, SBI may have reached a tipping point for dissemination and implementation as well as for small- and large-scale studies of remaining efficacy and effectiveness questions.\r\n\r\nThe editors of ASCP invited INEBRIA attendees and presenters to submit their studies for peer review and possible publication. The initial core of this thematic series, “Screening and brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use,” is the result of that call for papers, a seed that we expect will grow as the SBI literature continues to become more robust. Papers will cover a range of topics from what the efficacy of SBI really is, to effectiveness in people with mental health and drug use conditions, to adolescent SBI, to health professional attitudes towards SBI, to SBI implementation research and even to state-of-the-art SBI research protocol design, among others. We hope this series begins a long and serious conversation.",

    "abstract": "Hazardous drinking and depression represent two major sources of harm and dysfunction for university students. This study sought to determine how best to address these frequently co-occurring conditions for students who are not seeking treatment. Participants were recruited through internet ads and screened by phone and in-person to participate in a study on alcohol use, stress, and student life. Thirty university students (aged 18-22) with hazardous drinking who exhibited depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: assessment only or goal systems intervention (GSI). The GSI is a 3-session motivational intervention that addresses risks and processes of change related to alcohol and depression within an integrated framework. Students completed assessments of depressive symptoms, alcohol consequences, and heavy drinking episodes at baseline, three months, and six months. Given the small sample size of this pilot trial, our main goal was to provide effect-size estimates. Results of the conditional latent growth analysis for alcohol-related negative consequences showed a significant medium-tolarge effect of the intervention (f-squared = 0.27). Similarly, analysis showed that the intervention resulted in a medium to large effect on reduction of depressive symptoms (f-squared = 0.323). There was little evidence of intervention effects on change in heavy drinking, as students in both conditions exhibited a significant decline in heavy drinking episodes over time. These results suggest that GSI may be an efficacious intervention to reduce alcohol-related harm and depressive symptoms among university students in opportunistic settings.",

Based on the outcomes from MOSBIRT, Missouri’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)-funded SBIRT program, individuals receiving brief interventions show reductions in risky use, along with improvements in employment, housing, legal involvement and physical and mental health. As numerous studies indicate a cost savings of $3.81 to $5.60 for each dollar invested in screening for risky use, the most promising approach to sustaining SBIRT services in Missouri after SAMHSA support expires is to fund the state Medicaid codes already on the state’s fee schedule, thereby allowing for reimbursement of SBI services. To that end, an analysis of the Medicaid fee schedules of the 50 states and DC was conducted to determine which states currently have SBI Medicaid codes H0049 and H0050, as well as the American Medical Association’s Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 99408 and 99409, on their schedules. The analysis indicated that 22 states have either the Medicaid or CPT codes with associated billing amounts on their Medicaid fee schedules. The average billing rate for screening is about $25 per unit, with rates of around $40 per unit for brief interventions. This information was presented to the Missouri governor’s budget office and resulted in rate setting and coverage of SBI services at federally qualified health centers and community mental health centers across the state. A rationale for supporting SBI services nationally is provided, along with recommendations for petitioning state budget offices to fund the Medicaid codes based on lessons learned from the MOSBIRT project.",

The Italian National Health Service (ISS) is the project leader of the Work Package 6 assessment tool. The aim of the ODHIN assessment tool is to formalise, operationalise and test the questionnaire developed under the PHEPA project in order to produce an update instrument to assess the extent of implementation of EIBIs for HHAC throughout PHC settings. The ODHIN assessment tool has been conceived as a semi-structured questionnaire for the identification of the state of the art, gaps and areas in the country that need further work and strengthening; to monitor the adequacy of brief intervention programmes for HHAC in order to provide recommendations to improve and optimize delivery of health care interventions. It analyses 24 questions distributed across 7 key sections. Data have been collected from 9 ODHIN collaborating countries (Catalonia, Czech Republic, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, The Netherlands and United Kingdom) and from other 14 European countries who have agreed to share their national experience with the ODHIN partners (Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Fyrom-Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Malta, Romania, and Switzerland). Preliminary data on the state of the art of the implementation and the extent of EIBI for HHAC throughout PHC settings across 23 European participating countries will be presented. Identified areas where services require development or strengthening across the participating countries as well as examples of good practices between countries will be also discussed.",

    "abstract": "New Zealand has a high level of acute alcohol-related harm compared with other countries. In the most recent alcohol use survey, 61.6% of New Zealand drinkers aged 16-64 years reported heavy episodic drinking at least once in a 12-month period, and 12.6% reported weekly heavy episodic drinking. There is substantial multinational evidence, and growing New Zealand evidence, showing that alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) in primary-care and emergency-department (ED) settings is an efficacious and cost-effective approach to reducing alcohol-related harm among people with heavy episodic drinking. Despite this, SBI is significantly underutilized in New Zealand. This implementation description demonstrates how SBI has been integrated successfully into general practice in the Whanganui region of New Zealand. In 2010, the Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand (ALAC) provided support to the Whanganui Regional Primary Health Organization (WRPHO) to implement an alcohol SBI approach that involved asking all patients ≥15 years about their alcohol consumption, offering brief advice to those identified as risky drinkers, and, where appropriate, referring patients to specialist services. This approach used a reminder system on the front page of electronic patient notes and an advanced form in the patient management system. In just under a year, 43% of all patients ≥15 years enrolled in the WRPHO had been asked about their alcohol consumption, with 36 percent of these patients receiving a brief intervention or specialist referral. The WRPHO project highlights how SBI can work in a New Zealand primary-care setting and its potential efficacy for reducing alcohol harm.",

This qualitative evaluation followed up staff in one integrated health and social-care service in Scotland to find out if and how multidisciplinary training in alcohol BI impacted practice, and if and why BI had been delivered following the training. Nineteen semi-structured in-depth qualitative telephone interviews were carried out among 10 of the 89 practitioners who had attended the course as well as among managers and administrators from various teams (e.g., social work, elder care, and community mental health). Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically. All quotations were checked with interviewees. Participants felt that training had improved their knowledge and confidence around alcohol and were supportive of having a role in delivering BI, but very few had actually delivered any. Practitioners perceived that their clients did not need alcohol BI for a variety of reasons, including that they either drank too much or too little to merit one. Despite this, practitioners described giving advice on alcohol but failed to recognize these conversations as opportunities to deliver BIs. A range of other barriers to delivery emerged, including the view that specific screening, delivery techniques, and monitoring of BIs did not fit with their current practice and assessment procedures, which already included (sometimes unhelpful) questions or questionnaires on alcohol use. The barriers to delivery were at individual, team, and service levels and are likely to be best addressed by a strategic approach of which training is only one part. The findings also suggest the need to take a setting-specific approach to efforts to embed BI delivery into routine practice.",

    "abstract": "In many countries, as in Sweden, it has been difficult to integrate early identification and brief intervention (EIBI) into daily primary health care (PHC) practice. We describe an ongoing study (the Secondary Prevention, Implementation, and Research on Alcohol [SPIRA] study) investigating possible solutions to overcome implementation obstacles and methods that facilitate the implementation process. This is the first Swedish EIBI study to include cost-effectiveness. The PHC practices have been cluster-randomized into four groups to test implementation strategies. It is estimated that 800-1000 patients will be recruited and will receive EIBI in two four-week periods, six months apart. The total project time is 14 months from baseline to follow-up, which will be done by telephone six months after the last intervention period. Two models are being tested: 1) the detection of risky drinking with screening (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption [AUDIT-C]) versus other methods of EI, and 2) whether an implementation coach increases the number of BI conducted by PHC providers beyond what an education package does. The implementation process is followed by focus group interviews. The SPIRA study is ongoing. So far, 15 PHC practices are involved in different counties of Sweden. Three have participated in two intervention periods, the rest in one. Twenty-three focus groups have been conducted. According to preliminary findings, many PHC practices wish to be involved in lifestyle interventions as they become mandatory; but, at the same time, many general practitioners and nurses are reluctant to work on what they do not consider to be a main treatment task. There is a considerable uncertainty as to what risky drinking is, particularly when alcohol problems have not yet appeared or been disclosed.

    "abstract": "Helping the large number of problem drinkers who will never seek treatment is a challenging issue. Public health initiatives employing educational materials or mass media campaigns have met with mixed success. However, clinical research has developed effective brief interventions to help problem drinkers. This project employed an intervention that has been validated in clinical settings and then modified into an ultra-brief format suitable for use as a public health intervention. This randomized controlled trial sought to establish the effectiveness of an ultra-brief personalized feedback intervention for problem drinkers. Problem drinkers (N = 1824) recruited via a baseline population telephone survey were randomized to one of three conditions: personalized feedback pamphlet, control pamphlet, or no intervention (control condition). In the week after the baseline survey, households in the two pamphlet conditions were sent their respective pamphlets by mail. Changes in drinking were assessed at three months. The follow-up rate was 83% (1529 participants). Preliminary analysis indicated that there was no significant impact (p > 0.05) of receiving the intervention pamphlet. Although the ultra-brief intervention had demonstrated promising results in two earlier pilot trials, results from the current trial failed to find any impact of this personalized feedback intervention for problem drinkers when delivered to households rather than directly to individuals. Combined with the results from the earlier trials, we surmise that the intervention may have an impact among recipients who voice an interest in receiving such materials but it is ineffective as an unsolicited public health intervention.",

The National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden recommends that treatment providers of psychiatric care systematically identify patients with problematic substance use, and provide Brief Intervention (BI) for them. It is not known to what extent these recommendations are followed. Two surveys were designed, one for directors of outpatient psychiatric clinics, the second for clinical staff at these clinics. The survey to clinic directors focused on guidelines at the clinic for identifying substance use during the assessment phase, and for offering BI to patients with problematic substance use. The survey to staff focused on identification of problematic substance use during the assessment phase and personal experiences in identifying such use as well as offering BI. The response rate for clinic directors was 60% (n=137). Most clinics had guidelines for always asking patients about substance use in the assessment phase (92% for alcohol; 80% for drugs). Guidelines existed for offering BI for hazardous alcohol use at 49%; for hazardous drug use at 42%. The response rate for staff in participating clinics was 40% (n=481), 66% stated that they always ask about alcohol use during the assessment phase. Corresponding figure for drug use was 58%. 36% reported using BI for hazardous alcohol and drug use. Guidelines for identifying problematic substance use had been formulated at almost all outpatient psychiatric clinics, but among staff, only two out of three reported applying them. Guidelines for using BI had been formulated at less than half of the clinics. Actual BI provision by staff to patients was even more rare. During 2013-14, directors and staff participating in this survey will be involved in design and implementation of e-interventions (internet self-help sites, IVR, mobile applications) for problematic substance use.",

The question is crucial for freely available web-based interventions tested in RCTs.\r\n\r\nWe compared participants in a primary/secondary prevention web-based alcohol brief intervention RCT to its source population. There is a mandatory army recruitment process in Switzerland at age 19 for men. Between 8.2010 and 7.2011, 12,564 men attended two recruitment centers (source population) and were asked to answer a screening questionnaire on substance use; of the 11,819 (94%) who completed it, 7,034 (56%) agreed to participate in a cohort with regular assessments. In 2012, irrespective of their drinking, cohort participants were invited to the RCT; 1,549 agreed to participate. Using chi-square and t-test, we compared screening data of RCT participants to other members of the source population with respect to weekly alcohol use, maximum number of drinks/occasion, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), prevalence of binge drinking (≥6 drinks per occasion at least monthly), unhealthy alcohol use (>210g of ethanol/week and/or ≥1 binge episode/month), and abstinence.\r\n\r\nRCT participants (n=1,549) drank less than other members of the source population (n=10,270): they reported a mean (SD) of 6.2(8.1) vs 7.4(10.7) drinks/week, t=5.2, p<.0001; 9.7(7.7) vs 10.3(9.1) maximum number of drinks/occasion, t=2.6, p=.009; and 6.6(4.4) vs 7.2(4.9) AUDIT scores, t=4.7, p<.0001.

Text-messaging (TM) may provide an effective way to collect drinking data from young adults after ED discharge as well as to provide ongoing support for behavior change. Young adults in three urban EDs identified as hazardous drinkers based on Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) score were randomly assigned to weekly TM feedback with goal setting (intervention group), weekly TM drinking assessments without feedback (assessment group), or a control group. Participants in the intervention group who reported drinking ≥5 drinks during any 24-hour period (≥4 drinks for women) were asked whether they would set a goal to reduce their drinking the following week. We assessed the interaction between TM and goal-setting as well as heavy drinking days (HDD), and drinks per drinking day (DPDD) using the timeline follow-back procedure at baseline and three months. Forty-five young adults (age 18-24 years, 54% female) met inclusion criteria and were randomized to one of the three study conditions. Of these, six (13%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5-27) did not complete the three-month web-based follow-up. Eighty-eight percent (95% CI, 84-91%) of weekly TM drinking assessments were answered, with 77% (95% CI, 58-90) of participants responding on all 12 weeks. Agreeing to set a goal was associated with a repeat HDD 36% of the time (95% CI, 17-55) compared with 63% of the time (95% CI, 44-81) when participants were not willing to set a goal. At three months, participants exposed to the TM intervention had 3.4 fewer past-month HDD (standard deviation [SD], 5.4) and 2.1 fewer DPDD (SD, 1.5) compared with baseline.

A large portion of work thus far has emphasized therapist skills and client language mechanisms in the context of single-session interventions. The present study examined three global therapist variables of clinical importance to MI (therapist focus on client ambivalence/discrepancy, therapist emphasis on client commitment to change, and therapist assessment of client goals/drinking) in the context of a multi-session intervention. The sample included adults with alcohol use disorders participating in the multi-site Matching Alcoholism Treatments to Client Heterogeneity (MATCH) clinical trial. Binomial generalized estimating equations examined therapist intervention effects on alcohol use over a 12-week treatment period (four sessions). The main effects analysis showed that therapist emphasis on commitment had a positive effect on drinking reduction for aftercare patients (odds ratio [OR], .64; p < 0.001). However, the opposite pattern was found for therapist focus on client ambivalence/discrepancy (aftercare OR, 1.31; p < 0.001) (outpatient OR, 1.10; p = 0.018) and assessing goals/drinking (aftercare OR, 1.22; p = 0.043) (outpatient OR, 1.27, p < 0.001) in both samples. Therapist-reported intervention foci are important to subsequent patterns of drinking within a multi-session MI intervention. The unexpected negative effect of focus on client ambivalence and assessment of goals and drinking suggests that therapists may use these interventions in reaction to client alcohol use, but are unsuccessful in movement toward resolution. Patterns of alcohol use within treatment moderately predicted follow-up outcome, supporting the importance of these clinical processes.",

    "abstract": "To encourage health professionals to raise the issue of alcohol among patients and to provide better advice to reduce hazardous drinking, Swedish health authorities implemented the Risk Drinking Project (RDP) between 2004-2009. The main activities were training seminars focusing on teaching motivational interviewing and screening for risky drinking. To evaluate the impact of RDP, baseline and follow-up surveys (in 2006 and 2009) were conducted. Participants were general practitioners (GPs) and district nurses (DNs). They were asked how often they discussed alcohol with their patients, and how they estimated their skill at providing advice about drinking and their effectiveness in helping patients reduce risky drinking. We triangulated the results with two population surveys where patients reported whether they had been asked about alcohol when visiting their primary health care (PHC) provider. We also studied changes in the number of alcohol-related diagnoses in PHC in western Sweden between 2005- 2009. Fifty-five percent of PHC providers in the 2009 follow-up survey reported participating in alcohol-related education in the past three years. For all three parameters analyzed (frequency, skill, and effectiveness), there were significant increases during the three years, particularly among DNs. However, the population surveys showed no change in patients being asked about their alcohol consumption. Further, there was only a small increase in alcohol-related diagnoses over this time-period (9%). The RDP is a likely cause of enhanced self-perceived competence among nurses and GPs. Using a combination of data sources to evaluate the impact of RDP raises uncertainty as to whether the educational effort alone was sufficient to increase screening and brief intervention.",

We evaluated the impact of SBIRT dissemination on attitudes related to preventive practices for alcohol consumption and on the moralization of alcohol and other drug use by primary care professionals (N = 123) in two Brazilian cities. Eighty-two participants received SBIRT training (intervention group), while 41 received no SBIRT training (control group). At baseline and three-month follow-up, both groups completed scales of beliefs and attitudes regarding SBIRT implementation and another scale about the moralization of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and crack use. The intervention group showed an increase in the perception of obstacles to screening implementation at follow-up assessment (p < 0.05). Regarding moralization, the intervention group had lower moralization for crack consumption than controls at follow-up (p < 0.05). The other measures showed no significant differences. According to these results, SBIRT training and three months of practice supervision were not sufficient to promote changes in primary care professionals’ attitudes toward drug and alcohol screening or to reduce substance use moralization. These findings are relevant to research related to SBIRT dissemination, since merely learning SBIRT techniques without attitudinal changes and moralization reduction compromises the quality and effectiveness of those practices with regard to alcohol and other drug use.",

Also, alcohol consumption clusters with other risk seeking behaviors such as substance abuse, high risk sexual engagement, violence and aggression. The WHO recently identified alcohol use amongst young people (10-24 years) as the most important factor contributing to disability adjustable life years (DALYs). To evaluate the trends occurring in the characteristics of adolescents treated for alcohol-related harm in Dutch hospital pediatric departments from 2007 to 2010. From 2007, Dutch pediatricians (NSCK) collected data on adolescents treated for alcohol-related harm. We analyzed all data from 2007 to 2010, involving adolescents suffered from (severe) alcohol intoxication (reduced consciousness).Data was collected via a questionnaire send out to all general and academic Dutch hospitals. Children aged 11-18 years, with a BAC > 0,0 g/L and presenting with reduced consciousness were included. A total of 2023 cases were reported in the years 2007-2010 of which 1616 questionnaires were analyzed. Numbers have more than doubled over the years from 297 to 684 reports. Age is increasing among boys (14.9 to 15.6 years, P < 0.001) but not among girls (14.8 to 15.0 years, P = 0.124). Duration of reduced consciousness increased from 2.2 hrs to 3.1 hrs (P = 0.046).

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Youth are frequently exposed to drugs, and most youth who misuse drugs are reluctant to seek help from services due to the worry of others being judgmental, lacking expertise, exposing their personal information, or informing their parents. Considering these concerns, we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of a medical peer-delivered intervention comprising brief motivational interviewing via instant-messaging interaction in reducing drug misuse among youth in Hong Kong. Methods A two-group single-blind, randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Multiple approaches, including online and face-to-face methods, will be used to recruit the participants. The participants, aged 25 years or younger and reporting any drugs that they have taken within the past 30 days, will be recruited and randomised to receive either brief motivational interviewing via interactive instant-messaging (the intervention) or general health text-messages (comparator). The primary outcome will be the change in the participants’ reductions in self-reported drug consumption at 12 months compared to that at baseline. The secondary outcomes will be the changes in the drug-abusing participants’ reductions in self-reported drug consumption at 6 months, the changes in the drug-quitting participants’ 6- and 12-month contemplation stages and relapse risk compared to that at baseline, 30 days’ self-reported drug abstinence at 6 and 12 months, and the treatment needs and motivation at 6 and 12 months compared to that at baseline. The effectiveness of the proposed intervention will be examined with adjusted regression models, with adjustment for baseline characteristics and the use of an intention-to‐treat approach. Discussion This proposed study will be the first randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a medical peer-delivered interactive intervention to reduce drug misuse among youth in Hong Kong. The proposed intervention has the potential to increase the help-seeking behaviour and intention to quit among youth who misuse drugs. As a result, more youth misusing drugs may be helped to abstain from drugs. This proposed study will inform decisions on whether it is worthwhile to invest resources in large-scale implementation of such an intervention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Poppy seeds contain morphine and other opioid alkaloids and are commercially available in the United States. Users of poppy seed tea (PST) can consume several hundred morphine milligram equivalents per day, and opioid dependence from PST use can develop. We report a case of a patient with chronic pain and PST use leading to opioid use disorder (OUD). This case represents the first published report of OUD from PST successfully treated with buprenorphine (BUP) in a primary care setting. The provider in this case used a unique model of care with an opioid prescribing support team to deliver safe and effective care. Case presentation A 47-year-old man with chronic pain and prescription opioid use presented to primary care to discuss a flare of shoulder pain, and revealed in subsequent conversation a long-standing use of PST to supplement pain control. Attempts at cessation resulted in severe withdrawal symptoms, leading to return to PST use. The primary care provider consulted the VA Puget Sound SU pporting P rimary care P roviders in O pioid R isk reduction and T reatment (SUPPORT) team to evaluate the patient for OUD. The patient discontinued all opioids, and initiated BUP under the supervision of the primary care provider. He remained on a stable dosage, without relapse, 24 months later. Conclusions PST, which can be made through purchase of readily available poppy pods, carries risk for development of OUD and overdose. Herein we highlight the utility of a primary care opioid prescribing support team in empowering a primary care provider to prescribe BUP to treat a patient with complex OUD.",

    "abstract": "Background:The aim of this paper is to evaluate the extent to which injured patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) with an alcohol-related injury may go undetected if signs of intoxication or withdrawal, a positive blood alcohol concentration (BAC), or signs of alcohol dependence or harmful drinking are relied upon as indicators of alcohol involvement in the injury event.Materials and methods: An alcohol-related injury (drinking within six hours prior to the injury event and causal attribution of injury to drinking) is examined by the amount consumed, BAC and usual drinking pattern for those with and without alcohol dependence or harmful drinking in a representative sample of 18,369 injured ED patients in 23 countries.Results: 18.8% reported drinking in the six hours prior to injury, and 47.1% of these attributed a causal association of their injury to drinking.16.3% of those reporting drinking and 10.3% of those attributing a causal association were negative for dependence or harmful drinking.The vast majority of both groups reported no heavy (5 +) drinking occasions during the last year and had a BAC of < 0.05 or negative.About a third of both groups were female and most were aged 50 and younger.Conclusions: Findings here suggest that some individuals may have an alcohol-related injury due to a single episode of drinking without a history of harmful use or dependence, and underscores the clinical and public health relevance of screening for these individuals in the ED to identify those who may benefit from a brief intervention.These findings also underscore the utility of a new diagnostic category of a single episode of harmful drinking proposed in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Disease.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Approximately 70–80% of people experiencing homelessness in the United States use tobacco. Smoking cessation programs specifically for this population have been found to be less effective for African American participants. The purpose of this study was to explore discrimination experiences and their impact on smoking habits and readiness to quit cigarette smoking while experiencing homelessness. Methods In the qualitative phase of this mixed methods study, five focus groups were conducted for African Americans residing in a homeless shelter in Skid Row, Los Angeles, CA. Using a semi-structured interview guide, we asked participants about discrimination experiences, how smoking habits were impacted by these experiences, and tools needed to successfully abstain from cigarette smoking. Qualitative descriptive content analysis was used to explore discrimination experiences and its association with readiness to quit cigarette smoking. Results Of the 17 participants, 14 (82.4%) were male, and the average age was 46.8 years. Using a qualitative In Vivo coding method, three themes were revealed: “ Experiencing Discrimination while Black ”, “ The Psychosocial Fabric—Why Quitting Cigarette Smoking is a Challenge ”, and “ The Lesser of Two Evils—Choosing to Smoke over More Harmful Options.” Participants discussed working in the blue-collar workforce while Black, identifying as a double minority, smoking to cope with stress, early exposure to cigarettes , smoking being a central part of one’s belonging to a group, and the legality of cigarette smoking. Discussion Our findings show that African Americans experiencing homelessness (1) may experience discrimination in multiple settings, regardless of housing status, (2) could have grown up around cigarette smoking and remain surrounded by it while experiencing homelessness, and (3) may experience a calming effect with smoking, which slows some from reacting negatively to adverse situations. Conclusion Barriers to successfully abstaining from smoking are multifactorial among African Americans experiencing homelessness and should be addressed individually. Future research should explore the cultural tailoring of interventions that support cessation efforts unique to minoritized populations to improve smoking cessation programs offered to this population.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with executive function (EF) deficits and sensory modulation dysfunction (SMD). Yet, these deficits are not addressed therapeutically. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of the Functional-Cognitive and Sensory Treatment (F-CaST) compared to standard care to improve everyday performance and behavior and length of stay at the therapeutic community (TC) in individuals with SUD. In addition, to assess the improvement in EF, sensory modulation, participation, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and use of strategies within and between groups. Satisfaction with F-CaST will also be assessed. Methods Forty-eight participants from a community of men in a TC, aged 18–45 years will be randomly allocated to (i) F-CaST—(experimental group) providing sensory and EF strategies for improving daily function; (ii) standard care (control group) as provided in the TC. Assessments will be conducted by assessors blind to group allocation at 4 time points: T1- pre-intervention; T2- post-intervention; T3- 1-month follow-up; and T4- 3-month follow-up. Primary outcome measures will be everyday performance, assessed by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), behavior and length of stay in the TC; secondary outcome measures will assess EF, SMD. Semi-structured in-depth qualitative interviews will be conducted at T1, T2 and T4. Discussion We hypothesize that F-CaST will lead to improved everyday performance and longer length of stay in the TC, compared to the control group. If F-CaST will prove to be effective, cognitive and sensory strategies may be incorporated as an adjunctive intervention in SUD rehabilitation.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine if a web-based algorithm designed to support the decision-making process of cancer care providers (CCPs) differentially impacted their self-reported self-efficacy and practices for providing smoking prevention and cessation services in Peru and Colombia. Methods A simple decision-making tree algorithm was built in REDCap using information from an extensive review of the currently available smoking prevention and cessation resources. We employed a pre-post study design with a mixed-methods approach among 53 CCPs in Peru and Colombia for pilot-testing the web-based algorithm during a 3-month period. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the CCPs’ self-efficacy and practices before and after using the web-based algorithm. The usability of the web-based algorithm was quantitatively measured with the system usability scale (SUS), as well as qualitatively through the analysis of four focus groups conducted among the participating CCPs. Results The pre-post assessments indicated that the CCPs significantly improved their self-efficacy and practices toward smoking prevention and cessation services after using the web-based algorithm. The overall average SUS score obtained among study participants was 82.9 (± 9.33) [Peru 81.5; Colombia 84.1]. After completing the qualitative analysis of the focus groups transcripts, four themes emerged: limited resources currently available for smoking prevention and cessation in oncology settings, merits of the web-based algorithm, challenges with the web-based algorithm, and suggestions for improving this web-based decision-making tool. Conclusion The web-based algorithm showed high usability and was well-received by the CCPs in Colombia and Peru, promoting a preliminary improvement in their smoking prevention and cessation self-efficacy and practices.",

    "abstract": "Supervised injectable opioid treatment (SIOT) is a promising alternative for people living with opioid use disorder (OUD) who have not sufficiently benefitted from oral opioid substitution treatment. Yet, SIOT utilization remains limited in Germany. We propose that this is due to beliefs, or schemas, on SIOT among people living with OUD. Drawing from medical sociology and social psychology, this study explores the emergence and evolution of such schemas on SIOT. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 34 individuals currently in or eligible for SIOT in two German outpatient treatment facilities and paralleled an inductive qualitative content analysis with the exploration of individual cases. The analysis revealed that peer-to-peer interaction and individuals' practical experiences in therapy are crucial in constructing and changing idiosyncratic and shared schemas of SIOT. When facing ambiguous information, cognitive strategies like subtyping served to mitigate uncertainty. This research has important practical implications for integrating experiential knowledge into clinical care and improve information sharing among people living with OUD. A nuanced understanding of the complex network of informal advice-seeking and -giving among people living with OUD is indispensable to adequately expand treatment modalities of proven effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Unhealthy alcohol use is a common public health problem in HIV care settings in Africa and it affects the HIV continuum of care. In Uganda and other low-income countries, HIV care providers are a key resource in caring for young people (15–24 years) living with HIV (YPLH) with unhealthy alcohol use. Caring for YPLH largely depends on care providers’ perceptions of the problem. However, data that explores HIV care providers’ perceptions about caring for YPLH with unhealthy drinking are lacking in Uganda. We sought to describe the perceptions of HIV care providers regarding caring for YPLH with unhealthy drinking in the Immune Suppression Syndrome (ISS) Clinic of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital in southwestern Uganda. Methods We used semi-structured in-depth interviews (IDIs) to qualitatively explore HIV care providers’ perceptions regarding caring for YPLH with unhealthy alcohol use. The study was conducted at the adolescent immunosuppression (ISS) clinic of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Using thematic content analysis, data from 10 interviews were analyzed. Results HIV care providers were concerned and intended to care for YPLH with unhealthy alcohol use. They understood that unhealthy drinking negatively impacts HIV care outcomes and used counseling, peer support, and referrals to routinely intervene. They however, did not apply other known interventions such as health education, medications and follow-up visits because these required family and institutional support which was largely lacking. Additional barriers that HCPs faced in caring for YPLH included; gaps in knowledge and skills required to address alcohol use in young patients, heavy workloads that hindered the provision of psychosocial interventions, late payment of and low remunerations, lack of improvement in some YPLH, and inadequate support from both their families and hospital management. Conclusion HIV care providers are important stakeholders in the identification and care of YPLH with unhealthy alcohol use in Southwestern Uganda. There is a need to train and skill HCPs in unhealthy alcohol use care. Such training ought to target the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control of the providers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background It is well established that an adolescent’s neighborhood is associated with their likelihood of developing a substance use disorder. The availability of drugs, lack of access to resources, and exposure to violence are all associated with greater substance use among young people, leading to more pronounced health inequities. Technology assisted interventions (TAIs) have been touted to enhance the reach of substance use treatment and improve outcomes for high-need families living in underserved neighborhoods. A key question is whether neighborhood characteristics impact the effectiveness of TAIs, given these interventions are embedded within an adolescent’s natural environment. This National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded Diversity Supplement will examine the role of perceived neighborhood characteristics on response to Parent SMART, a TAI for parents of adolescents in residential substance use treatment (R37DA052918; PI: Becker). Aim 1 will use both adolescent and parent self-report of multiple neighborhood dimensions (e.g., physical environment, social disorder, satisfaction with community resources) to identify indicators predictive of treatment response. Aim 2 will then explore the indirect relationship between neighborhood context and response to Parent SMART, via engagement. Methods Participants include adolescent and parent dyads enrolled in an effectiveness trial evaluating Parent SMART, a TAI for parents of adolescents in residential substance youth treatment. Participants will complete self-report measures of neighborhood physical environment, social disorder, and satisfaction with community resources at baseline to predict parenting and youth substance outcomes at 6-, 12-, and 24-weeks post discharge. Discussion To date, few studies have explicitly tested how neighborhood affects response to TAIs for adolescent substance use. Assessing adolescent and parent perceptions of neighborhood characteristics holds potential to pinpoint key contextual factors that affect TAI response and to promote consideration of multi-level health equity determinants in substance use research. Understanding neighborhood influences can advance public health by helping tailor TAIs to address the unique needs of adolescents living in underserved communities.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background As the opioid epidemic continues to have a major negative impact across the US, community pharmacies have come under scrutiny from legal systems attempting to hold them accountable for their role in over dispensing and lack of patient intervention. While the most available tool for monitoring patients’ opioid use is Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP), these do not provide pharmacists with actionable information and decision support. Our study addresses this gap through three objectives: [1] incorporate validated opioid risk metric thresholds into a PDMP platform to create the Opioid Risk Reduction Clinical Decision Support (ORRCDS) tool; [2] assess ORRCDS’ ability to reduce patient opioid risk; [3] assess ORRCDS’ sustainability and viability for broader dissemination in community pharmacy. Methods For objective 1, our team is partnering with leadership from the largest US PDMP organization and a top-five pharmacy chain to implement ORRCDS into the pharmacy chain’s workflow following the Guideline Implementation with Decision Support (GUIDES) framework. For objective 2, our team will conduct a type-1 implementation mixed methods study using a 2-arm parallel group clustered randomized design. We anticipate enrolling ~ 6,600 patients with moderate and high opioid use risk during the 6-month enrollment phase across 80 pharmacies. This sample size will provide 96.3% power to detect a 5% or greater difference in responder rate between the intervention and control arm. Responders are patients with moderate-risk at baseline who reduce to low-risk or those with high-risk at baseline who reduce to moderate or low-risk at 180 days post last intervention. To accomplish objective 3, we will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to develop and execute cross-sectional qualitative interviews with pharmacists ( n = 15), pharmacy leaders ( n = 15), and PDMP leaders ( n = 15) regarding long term adoption and sustainability of the ORRCDS tool. Conclusions A PDMP tool that addresses moderate- and high-risk opioid use is not available in community pharmacy. This study will implement ORRCDS in a large retail pharmacy chain that will include additional screening and guidance to pharmacy staff to address risky opioid medication use. Our results will make critical advancements for protecting patient health and addressing the opioid epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Rates of cocaine use disorder (CUD) among men who have sex with men (MSM) are high and rising. Among MSM, cocaine use is associated with negative socioeconomic, medical, and psychological outcomes. There are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy options to treat CUD, and psychosocial interventions demonstrate limited efficacy. While there have been numerous trials evaluating possible medications for CUD, there is a scarcity of qualitative data on the barriers and facilitators of medication-assisted treatment. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 participants enrolled in a phase II randomized control trial evaluating extended-release lorcaserin among MSM with CUD. Participants were asked about their motivations for enrolling in the study, attitudes towards taking a medication for CUD, barriers and facilitators of study pill adherence, and their general study experience. Interviews were analyzed using an inductive and exploratory approach to thematic analysis. Results Participants were highly motivated to reduce cocaine use and viewed pharmacotherapy as a viable and desirable treatment option. Pharmacotherapy was seen as having fewer access and adherence structural barriers compared to existing psychosocial therapies. Medication reminders facilitated pill taking, while side effects, travel, and active substance use presented barriers to study pill adherence. Disclosure of study participation within social networks was variable pointing to anticipated substance use and treatment stigma. Conclusions Our study highlights important factors affecting the acceptability and uptake of medication-assisted treatment for CUD among a diverse sample of MSM. These findings can help guide the development and implementation of future pharmacotherapy options for CUD and other substance use disorders in this key population.",

TBI often results in cognitive deficits which can affect the clinical course of SUD. Case presentation Here we present the case of a 34-year-old Spanish-speaking man with severe opioid use disorder and two prior TBIs affecting his cognitive abilities. He was linked to outpatient addiction specialty care at a community health center. After identification of his TBI history, his care team, which included a language-concordant physician and peer recovery coach, worked to develop a treatment plan that accounted for his unique cognitive deficits and behavioral challenges. He was also connected with community resources including a rehabilitation program designed for people with TBI. These individualized aspects of treatment helped to better engage and retain the patient in quality care for his SUD. Conclusions By identifying TBI history in people with SUDs, the treatment plan can be tailored to accommodate TBI-related deficits. An effective care plan should incorporate not only medical providers, but also resources such as peer recovery supports and TBI-focused rehabilitation programs when and where they are available, with an emphasis on improving functional capacity.",

However, despite high rates of HIV risk behaviors among people who inject drugs (PWID), this population remains underserved by current HIV prevention efforts in the United States. To address this challenge, we conducted an in-depth exploration of perspectives on using oral PrEP among PWID engaged in the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 094 INTEGRA Study. Methods Guided by the Practical, Robust, Implementation, and Sustainability Model (PRISM), our qualitative study drew on semi-structured interviews conducted as part of the embedded implementation science evaluation of HPTN 094 INTEGRA. Seventy-seven PWID participants from five sites across New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington DC were interviewed to assess intervention delivery, care access, and engagement sustainability. Audio files were transcribed verbatim and analyzed via an inductive and deductive thematic approach. Results Most participants ( n = 46, 59.7%) discussed oral PrEP during their interview, though not directly prompted. Participants discussing PrEP had a mean age of 41.6 years and were predominantly white (54.3%) and cisgender men (60.9%). Among these, 15 participants described using PrEP. All participants had facilitated access to oral PrEP. Yet, the choice to use PrEP was influenced by personal risk perceptions, (mis)information about PrEP, and external factors (i.e. housing, financial security), which, for some, limited the autonomy to use PrEP. Two key themes emerged among participants using PrEP: ease of access and perceptions of high HIV risk. Those not using PrEP described two themes: low risk perception and prioritizing more urgent needs. Among participants not using PrEP a subgroup commonly described ambivalent interest, PrEP knowledge gaps, and PrEP readiness (i.e., contemplation). Conclusions Qualitative findings highlight that facilitated PrEP access was insufficient to motivate use for many participants. Rather, PrEP decision-making process (i.e., choice) was linked to risk perception and individuals’ capability to leverage PrEP as a resource based on their circumstances (i.e., autonomy). Participants’ descriptions of the centrality of choice and autonomy for PrEP use underscore that ease of access is a necessary pre-condition, but person-centered interventions should also address housing, financial stability, and urgent medical conditions to promote PrEP utilization among PWID.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Contingency management (CM), an incentive-based intervention to encourage target behaviors, effectively promotes medication adherence. However, efforts to extend CM to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have been lacking. As part of a randomized clinical trial to promote HIV Prevention among people who inject drugs (PWID), we examined the readiness of staff in community-based organizations serving PWID to implement CM for PrEP uptake and adherence in this population. Methods From April to August 2022, we conducted a survey of staff from four community-based organizations providing HIV testing, harm reduction, and outreach services in the northeastern United States. We assessed knowledge and attitudes regarding PrEP for PWID on five-point Likert scales (e.g., Poor to Excellent, Not at all to Extremely). Using a modified version of the Contingency Management Beliefs Questionnaire, we assessed the degree to which attitudes about CM for HIV prevention influenced interest in its adoption on a scale from “1-No influence at all” to “5-Very strong influence”. We explored endorsement patterns, along with average values of individual items and subscale scores. Results Among 271 staff invitations, 123 (45.4%) responded. The majority (88.6%) of respondents reported prior PrEP awareness, with a mean self-rated knowledge of 2.98 out of 5 (SD = 1.1). Attitudes towards PrEP, including its relevance to and importance for clients (both means = 4.3), efficacy (mean = 4.5), and safety (mean = 4.2), were positive. Items related to practicality and confidence in providing PrEP-related care had relatively lower ratings. Respondents endorsed influential generalized (mean = 2.1) and training-related (mean = 2.5) CM implementation barriers less frequently than positive attitudes towards CM (mean = 3.6). Staff favored adding CM to existing services (mean = 3.8), and highly endorsed it as “useful for targeting HIV prevention with PrEP” (mean = 3.7). Conclusions Respondents generally supported the use of CM to promote HIV prevention among PWID and favored adding it to their existing services. Though respondents understood the value of both PrEP and CM to support HIV prevention activities, findings corroborate research citing relative lack of knowledge and confidence regarding PrEP management among clients, potentially detracting from implementation readiness.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background With advances in antiretroviral therapy, people with HIV (PWH) are living longer and are less likely to die from AIDS-related complications. Yet, prior research has shown that smoking is often not addressed in the context of HIV care, and few individuals are offered cessation treatment. Optimizing tobacco treatment delivery for PWH may increase engagement with evidence-based treatments and successful quit attempts. Methods The current study is a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the impact of a proactive, opt-out tobacco treatment intervention on cessation outcomes and advance understanding of key barriers and facilitators of implementation processes. A total of 230 PWH who smoke will be recruited from an infectious diseases clinic at an academic medical center and will be randomized to receive (1) treatment as usual (TAU) or (2) Pr oactive O utreach with M edication O pt-out for T obacco Treatment E ngagement (PrOMOTE). Primary outcomes include: biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) rates, continuous abstinence (Weeks 9–12), and the number of 24-hour quit attempts at the end of study treatment (Week 12). Secondary outcomes include: participant reach (proportion reached out of contact attempts), implementation fidelity (including number of prescriptions written), participant adherence to prescribed pharmacotherapy, acceptability (participant and provider satisfaction with intervention delivery and content), and perceived barriers. Discussion This study will examine a novel approach to optimizing tobacco treatment delivery for PWH. Integrating effectiveness and implementation results will help define best practices for engaging PWH with evidence-based tobacco treatment interventions. The intervention is low-cost, has the potential to be highly scalable, and could be translatable to other ambulatory HIV clinic settings.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Efficient and linguistically appropriate instruments are needed to assess response to addiction treatment, including severity of addiction/mental health status. This is critical for Russian-speaking persons in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) where Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) remain underscaled to address expanding and intertwined opioid, HIV, HCV and tuberculosis epidemics. We developed and conducted a pilot validation of a Russian version of the 24-item Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-24), an addiction/mental health severity instrument with six subscales, previously validated in English. Methods Using the Mapi approach, we reviewed, translated, and back-translated the content to Russian, pilot-tested the Russian-version (BASIS-24-R) among new MOUD patients in Ukraine (N = 283). For a subset of patients (n = 44), test-rest was performed 48 h after admission to reassess reliability of BASIS-24-R. Exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) assessed underlying structure of BASIS-24-R. Results Cronbach alpha coefficients for overall BASIS-24-R and 5 subscales exceeded 0.65; coefficient for Relationship subscale was 0.42. The Pearson correlation coefficients for overall score and all subscales on the BASIS-24-R exceeded 0.8. Each item loaded onto factors that corresponded with English BASIS-24 subscales ≥ 0.4 in PCA. Conclusion Initial version of BASIS-24-R appears statistically valid in Russian. Use of the BASIS-24-R has potential to guide MOUD treatment delivery in the EECA region and help to align addiction treatment with HIV prevention goals in a region where HIV is concentrated in people who inject opioids and where healthcare professionals have not traditionally perceived MOUD as effective treatment, particularly for those with mental health co-morbidities.",

Given the high prevalence rate of HCV in PWUD, the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes PWUD as a target population for HCV elimination. The introduction of pangenotypic direct acting antivirals (DAAs) greatly simplifies HCV treatment, which encourages integration of HCV treatment in primary care. Facilitating low threshold HCV care for PWUD by implementing decentralized models is crucial for HCV elimination. Aims With this study we aim to (1) eliminate 90% of identified HCV infections in Dutch addiction care, using a decentralized PWUD-HCV care model, and (2) identify facilitators and barriers for successful implementation of the model using interviews. Methods We will perform a multicenter mixed-method study on HCV treatment in addiction care. In a prospective observational study we will examine HCV-related outcomes in PWUD receiving HCV treatment as part of addiction care. The primary outcome is viral elimination, defined as percentage of identified HCV positive patients cured with DAAs. In parallel, we will perform a qualitative study to explore facilitators and barriers for implementation of fully decentralized HCV-PWUD care. We will interview addiction care professionals and board members about their experience with HCV-care as part of addiction care. Discussion This study will show effectiveness of integration of HCV care within addiction care, and provide insight in facilitators and barriers to implement integrated HCV-addiction care. The results will provide recommendations for implementation and maintenance of the decentralized HCV pathway, which can facilitate scaling-up to contribute to reaching WHO HCV elimination goals.

This study maps current treatment, the type of change techniques that are prioritized in treatment and how counselors perceive their clinical competence in their work with PG clients. Methods A sample of PG counselors from the healthcare and social services (N = 188, mean age: 49 years, 67% women) completed an online survey. A principal component analysis was conducted to map prioritized types of change techniques, and a multiple regression analysis was carried out to analyze predictors of counselors’ role adequacy in their clinical work. Results There was a large variation in the type of treatments offered for PG (mean 3.6). Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Motivational Interviewing were the most common treatments offered and motivation was rated as the most important type of change technique prioritized in the treatment of PG. A principal component analysis identified four components reflecting different types of change techniques prioritized by the counselors: (1) standard CBT, e.g., gambling cognitions, craving management, and finding alternative activities, (2) assessment of PG, (3) family orientation, i.e., involvement of concerned significant others in treatment, and (4) focus on exposure strategies. Counseling more clients monthly was associated with higher levels of willingness, adequacy and legitimacy in their clinical work with clients with PG. Additionally, offering CBT was a predictor for higher role adequacy and providing counseling on the origins of and consequences of PG. Conclusion There was a large heterogeneity among the treatments offered and what change techniques that were prioritized among the PG counselors. Clinical experience is of importance for developing competence in treating clients with PG. This finding suggests there could be benefits to establishing specialized, more visible treatment units where PG counselors could gain adequate clinical experience, thus increasing clinical competence for treating PG.",

The hypothesis is that changing the perception of drinking norms and risks will result in changes in drinking. We investigated whether the effect of a smartphone intervention was mediated through these mechanisms.Material and methods: 1770 students (Mean [SD] age = 22.35 [3.07]) with unhealthy alcohol use were randomized to receive access to a smartphone application or to a no-intervention control condition. The smartphone application provided normative feedback and personalized feedback on risks associated with drinking. A parallel mediation analysis was conducted to test whether the intervention effect was related to lower drinking (in standard drinks per week) at 6 months (adjusting for baseline values) through drinking norms and risk perceptions at 3 months (adjusting for baseline values).Results: The total intervention effect was significant (b = − 0.87 [95% bootstrap confidence interval − 1.50; − 0.26]), indicating lower drinking at 6 months in the intervention group. The direct effect (i.e. controlling for mediators) was significant but smaller (b = − 0.75 [− 1.34; − 0.18]). The indirect effect was significant through drinking norms (b = − 0.12 [− 0.23; − 0.02]): The intervention was associated with lower drinking norms at 3 months (b = − 0.76 [− 1.33; − 0.16]), and norms at 3 months were associated with drinking at 6 months (b = 0.15 [0.08; 0.24]). The indirect effect through risk perception was not significant.Conclusion: Drinking norms, but not risk perception, partially mediated the intervention effect on alcohol use, confirming one hypothesized mechanisms of action. These findings lend support for normative feedback interventions for unhealthy alcohol use.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Non-profit hospitals in the U.S. are required by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) to conduct a community health needs assessment (CHNA) every three years and to formulate an implementation strategy in response to those needs. Hospitals often identify substance use as a need relevant to their communities in their CHNAs and then must determine whether to create strategies to address such a need within their implementation strategies. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between a hospital’s prioritization of substance use within its community benefit documents and its substance use service offerings, while considering other hospital and community characteristics. Methods This study of a national sample of U.S. hospitals utilizes data collected from publicly available CHNAs and implementation strategies produced by hospitals from 2018 to 2021. This cross-sectional study employs descriptive statistics and multivariable analysis to assess relationships between prioritization of substance use on hospital implementation strategies and the services offered by hospitals, with consideration of community and hospital characteristics. Hospital CHNA and strategy documents were collected and then coded to identify whether the substance use needs were prioritized by the hospital. The collected data were incorporated into a data set with secondary data sourced from the 2021 AHA Annual Survey. Results Multivariable analysis found a significant and positive relationship between the prioritization of substance use as a community need on a hospital’s implementation strategy and the number of the services included in this analysis offered by the hospital. Significant and positive relationships were also identified for five service categories and for hospital size. Conclusions The availability of service offerings is related both to a hospital’s prioritization of substance use and to its size, indicating that these factors are likely inter-related regarding a hospital’s sense of its ability to address substance use as a community need. Policymakers should consider why a hospital may not prioritize a need that is prevalent within their community; e.g., whether the organization believes it lacks resources to take such steps. This study also highlights the value of the assessment and implementation strategy process as a way for hospitals to engage with community needs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Knowledge of co-occurring mental disorders (termed ‘dual diagnosis’) among patients receiving opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is scarce. This study aimed (1) to estimate the prevalence and structure of dual diagnoses in two national cohorts of OAT patients and (2) to compare mental disorders between OAT patients and the general populations stratified on sex and standardized by age. Methods A registry-linkage study of OAT patients from Czechia ( N = 4,280) and Norway ( N = 11,389) during 2010–2019 was conducted. Data on mental disorders (F00-F99; ICD-10) recorded in nationwide health registers were linked to the individuals registered in OAT. Dual diagnoses were defined as any mental disorder excluding substance use disorders (SUDs, F10-F19; ICD-10). Sex-specific age-standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were calculated for 2019 to compare OAT patients and the general populations. Results The prevalence of dual diagnosis was 57.3% for Czechia and 78.3% for Norway. In Czechia, anxiety (31.1%) and personality disorders (25.7%) were the most prevalent, whereas anxiety (33.8%) and depression (20.8%) were the most prevalent in Norway. Large country-specific variations were observed, e.g., in ADHD (0.5% in Czechia, 15.8% in Norway), implying differences in screening and diagnostic practices. The SMR estimates for any mental disorders were 3.1 (females) and 5.1 (males) in Czechia and 5.6 (females) and 8.2 (males) in Norway. OAT females had a significantly higher prevalence of co-occurring mental disorders, whereas SMRs were higher in OAT males. In addition to opioid use disorder (OUD), other substance use disorders (SUDs) were frequently recorded in both countries. Conclusions Results indicate an excess of mental health problems in OAT patients compared to the general population of the same sex and age in both countries, requiring appropriate clinical attention. Country-specific differences may stem from variations in diagnostics and care, reporting to registers, OAT provision, or substance use patterns.",

    "abstract": "Although clinical substance use disorder (SUD) care is multidisciplinary there are few opportunities to collaborate for quality improvement or systems change. In Oregon, the Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model was adapted to create a novel multidisciplinary SUD Leadership ECHO. The objective of this study was to understand the unique effects of the adapted ECHO model, determine if the SUD Leadership ECHO could promote systems change, and identify elements that enabled participant-leaders to make changes. Four focus groups were conducted between August and September of 2022 with a purposive sample of participants from the second cohort of the Oregon ECHO Network's SUD Leadership ECHO that ran January to June 2022. Focus group domains addressed the benefits of the adapted ECHO model, whether and why participants were able to make systems change following participation in the ECHO, and recommendations for improvement. Thematic analysis developed emergent themes. 16 of the 53 ECHO participants participated in the focus groups. We found that the SUD Leadership ECHO built a multi-disciplinary community of practice among leaders and reduced isolation and burnout. Three participants reported making organizational changes following participation in the ECHO. Those who successfully made changes heard best practices and how other organizations approached problems. Barriers to initiating practice and policy changes included lack of formal leadership authority, time constraints, and higher-level systemic issues. Participants desired for future iterations of the ECHO more focused presentations on a singular topic, and asked for a greater focus on solutions, advocacy, and next steps. The adapted ECHO model was well received by focus group participants, with mixed reports on whether participation equipped them to initiate organizational or policy changes. Our findings suggest that the SUD Leadership ECHO model, with fine-tuning, is a promising avenue to support SUD leaders in promoting systems change and reducing isolation among SUD leaders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The American Society of Addiction Medicine Patient Placement Criteria (ASAM PPC) are guidelines for matching addiction patients to an optimal level of care (LOC). South Korea lacked a systematic approach to assigning alcohol use disorder patients to suitable treatment. To address this, Park et al. translated the ASAM PPC into Korean, creating the Korean Patient Placement Criteria (KPPC). We aim to assess the efficacy of the KPPC by evaluating whether receiving KPPC-matched treatment would result in longer periods of alcohol abstinence and higher number of treatment program completion. Methods This is an observational, multi-site study of 225 individuals with hazardous alcohol use or alcohol dependence, defined by Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test score of 10 or more for men, and 6 or more for women. We evaluated patients using KPPC at baseline and one-month follow-up visits and recommended a LOC at every visit. Patients freely chose to receive KPPC-matched treatment or not. We examined the duration of alcohol abstinence and number of one-month treatment program completion within a three-month period. Results Of the 225 participants, 47 never pursued their matched level of care treatment, 54 pursued it once, and 124 pursued it twice. Individuals who received KPPC-matched treatment once had significantly higher odds of achieving alcohol abstinence (OR = 2.23), with greater odds when they received KPPC-matched treatments twice (OR = 2.88). The association was also significant for treatment completion, with greater odds of completing treatment program for one KPPC-matched treatment (OR = 3.28) and two KPPC-matched treatments (OR = 3.19). Conclusions Individuals who followed the KPPC matched level of care had longer periods of alcohol abstinence and better treatment completion. Our results should encourage community addiction management centers and hospitals to adopt KPPC for classifying treatment settings for alcohol use disorder patients. Further research is warranted to maximize the potential benefits of KPPC.",

The data provided from this study covers probationer involvement with the MAPIT intervention in relation to early goal planning and electronic reminder selection on positive 2-month outcomes. In terms of early goal planning, clients were most likely to select goals such as “Make a list of things I could do to stay sober” (62%); “Write down the date and time of my first PO visit” (52%); and “Get a binder to keep my probation documents in” (50%). In terms of reminder preference, 51 percent wanted to receive text or email reminders about their goals (31% requested text; 20% requested email). Most clients wanted reminders early in the week, and in the morning. Women, low/moderate risk, and older clients (> 35 years old) were more likely to ask for reminders. Those who selected to receive email reminders selected the greatest number of goals (M = 5.3) compared to those who chose text (M = 4.1) or no reminder (M = 3.0), F = 6.20, p = .004. In term of positive 2-month outcomes, probationers in the email reminder group were significantly more likely to be abstinent and were significantly more likely to initiate treatment at follow-up (c = 6.25, df = 2, p < .05 and c = 6.51, df = 2, p < .05, respectively), compared to the text reminder and no reminder groups. Early signs of non-responding were indicated by participants choosing the minimum number of goals (2), not selecting to receive electronic reminders, and not completing any goals by visit two, and were indicative of poorer outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In order to address JJ-TRIALS goals of: a) improving behavioral health services for youth with substance use problems; and b) advancing the investigation of implementation efforts in the field of behavioral health, the JJ-TRIALS Workgroup on Evidence-Based Practices (EPA) was first charged with defining quality indicators for practices and programs. We limited that effort to programs, practices, and instruments relevant to the steps in the Behavioral Services Cascade (Screening, Referral and Linkage, Assessment, Prevention and Psychosocial Treatment) for five identified clinical problem areas (Substance use, Mood disorder, ADHD, Trauma exposure, HIV risk). Problem areas were selected as those of moderate prevalence among adolescents in community justice systems with problem substance use. Quality indicators were consistent with the AACAP Practice Parameters Clinical Standard, as reflecting either “rigorous empirical evidence” or “overwhelming clinical consensus” (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2013). In a series of directed literature reviews, we catalogued evidence-based programs and instruments addressing these problem areas that had been identified as most strongly supported by existing systematic reviews (e.g., SAMHSA, 2011) and then categorized them into tiers, based on their applicability for JJ-TRIALS efforts (e.g., number of TRIALS problem areas addressed, administration format, delivery setting, inclusion of family collaterals). These reviews identified 18 psychometrically sound screening instruments (3 tiers), 16 sound assessment instruments (4 tiers), 43 EB prevention programs (3 tiers), and 39 EB treatment programs (3 tiers). While the evidence base regarding programs that focus on cross-system linkage (e.g., from screening in a probation setting, with a subsequent referral to a behavioral health provider) is less established, EPA was able to designate three tiers of such programs, defined both by their soundness and their applicability to juvenile justice community settings. As a second set of quality indicators, we considered core content components (that may cut across particular instruments or programs). For assessment, these included eight elements essential for clinical treatment planning for adolescents (e.g., family relationships, readiness for change: American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2013). For treatment programs, these included treatment modalities identified as effectively addressing one or another of the TRIALS problem areas (e.g., CBT; Chorpita, et al., 2011). A final quality indicator for assessment and treatment considered procedural elements (that relate to how an instrument or program is used by a service provider), such as manualization, staff training, and fidelity monitoring (e.g., Brannigan, 2004; Howell & Lipsey, 2012). EPA workgroup products will be incorporated into future JJ-TRIALS training efforts; they will be used to generate menus of high-quality instrument and program options to help juvenile justice partners and the behavioral health agencies with which they collaborate to set implementation goals for participation in JJ-TRIALS.",

    "abstract": "A substantial number of women consume alcohol while pregnant, thereby putting their unborn fetus at risk for developing a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) [1]. Despite the fact that some of the highest rates of FASDs in the world have been reported in the Western Cape of South Africa [2,3], little research looks at the experiences of pregnant women who drink and what influences their alcohol use. Gaining insight into the social and psychological processes that contribute to risky drinking during pregnancy will help in guiding interventions that aim to prevent prenatal alcohol use, thereby preventing the occurrence of FASDs [4,5].\r\n\r\nUsing a qualitative approach, 15 semistructured interviews were conducted in a Western Cape community with women who consumed alcohol during their pregnancy, and two focus group discussions with community members. Data collection aimed to elicit how these women and members of their community construct and make sense of alcohol use [6]. The interview and focus group data were analyzed using thematic decomposition analysis [7].\r\n\r\nAlcohol use was consistently represented as a social activity that was heavily influenced by peers. Implicit in this construction was the notion that heavy drinking is a norm within this particular community. Although prenatal alcohol use was stigmatized, it was also understood by the pregnant women and community members as a way of dealing and coping with difficult domestic problems, such as infidelity. For some pregnant women, these problems coupled with the social nature of drinking contributed to their alcohol use throughout their pregnancy. For other pregnant women, access to social support and the desire to have a healthy baby and be a responsible mother contributed to a decision to stop drinking.\r\n\r\nFuture interventions should take the social context of drinking into account, and rather than ignoring it—as most interventions do—use it to not only shift the social norms that surround heavy alcohol use, but also to support pregnant women to stop drinking. Prevention and intervention initiatives should also take a nonjudgemental and supportive approach that focuses on capitalizing on the moment of pregnancy and on teaching psychosocial skills that enable pregnant women to manage their problems effectively.",

    "abstract": "Background Access to care is an important concept in health policy and health services research, yet it is one which has not been defined precisely. To some researchers “access” refers to entry into or use of a health-care system, while to others it characterizes factors influencing entry or use. [1] This paper studied accessibility as it refers to entry into or use of a health-care system by measuring geographic accessibility from the location of clients (opioid-dependent individuals) to preventive and treatment facilities for substance use disorders (SUDs), mental health, and HIV/AIDS. Materials and methods The study population is opioid-dependent clients (N = 530) screened for an ongoing study of opioid substitution therapy (OST) in Washington, DC. There were three major methodological steps. First, the study geocoded and mapped the spatial distribution of clients’ self-reported neighborhood of residence (algorithmically moved to a nearby location to protect privacy) and health-care facilities specific to their addiction and comorbidities. The facilities included centers for prevention, OST (buprenorphine and methadone), and recovery from SUDs, mental health, STI clinics and HIV/AIDS, harm reduction sites (needle exchanges), and community support (counseling centers, AA, and NA meetings). Second, the study used geostatistical methods to measure accessibility (distance and travel time) from the location of clients to the health-care facilities. Third, the study constructed Addiction Severity Index scores using client questionnaires to measure correlations between opioid users and treatment services. Results The majority of the opioid-dependent clients were located in the south-central and southern parts of the District, with significantly higher concentration in the southeast. On the other hand, the preventive and treatment centers for SUDs and mental health issues were concentrated in the south-central region with fewer substance abuse services, OST providers (Figure 1), mental health services, and AIDS drug assistance program-affiliated pharmacies in the southeast. Furthermore, there was only one site for needle exchange in this area. The results indicate that health care services needed by opioid-dependent clients with their comorbidities are not geographically accessible to those clients.",

Bundled payments, a predetermined fee or budget that includes the prices of a group of services that would typically treat an episode of care in a defined period of time, are considered one of the most promising new payment models. Bundled payments for SUD treatment have the potential to improve care coordination, implementation of evidence-based practices, and engagement in outpatient treatment; reduce readmissions to detox; make care more patientcentered; and cover treatment services that are not traditionally reimbursed.

Although we have some information about testing among African Americans, most surveys do not include homeless, impoverished, or other disenfranchised and therefore hard-to-reach groups, many of whom may be particularly high-risk for HIV infection, and few studies have compared HIV testing among rural and urban African Americans. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to address this gap by systematically examining perceived need for HIV testing among rural as compared to urban African American cocaine users. Methods This is a cross-sectional, community-based study of 400 not-in-treatment African American cocaine users residing in selected rural and urban areas of Arkansas. We used respondent-driven sampling methods to fill our sample. Face-to-face computer-assisted interviews were conducted in study offices lasting 1½ – 2 hours. A logistic regression model was used to examine the association between perceived need for HIV testing and rural/ urban residence, while controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. Covariates in the model included: demographics (age, gender, education, health insurance), clinical characteristics (lifetime drug abuse treatment, lifetime mental health treatment, routine health-care visit in past year, general health status, ever being tested for hepatitis C or gonorrhea, number of times tested for HIV), access factors (ease of access to HIV testing, availability of HIV testing, skepticism towards medical care, stigma for HIV testing) and behavioral risk factors (perceived risk of acquiring HIV, number of sex partners, inconsistent condom use, ever trading sex for foods or drugs). Results We did not find significant differences among rural and urban African American cocaine users’ perceived need for HIV testing. Female gender, perceived risk for acquiring HIV, stigma, and receipt of testing for other sexually transmitted diseases were each positively and significantly related to perceived need to be tested for HIV in multivariate regression analysis in which all other variables were held constant. Receipt of routine medical care in the past year, being tested for HIV from 3–5 times, and skepticism towards medical care were negatively and significantly related to perceived need for HIV testing. Behavioral risk factors or general health status were not significantly associated with perceived need for HIV testing. Access to testing was not perceived as a significant barrier to testing.

    "abstract": "Background Sober living houses (SLHs) are peer-managed residences that require sobriety and household participation among residents who rent rooms on a monthly (indefinite) basis and otherwise live normal lives according to personal schedules and needs. The houses do not provide counseling or services, but regular attendance at 12-step or other types of mutual-help groups is generally required. Approximately 1000 sober living houses, members of two state-wide organizations, operate in California to serve a large and complex population. This presentation provides an overview of work conducted to date studying sober living houses in Northern and Southern California. Methods and results In a study of SLHs in Northern California, 300 residents were followed for 18 months after entry. Our research found that neighbors and key informants (e.g., criminal justice, housing and political officials) were highly supportive of SLHs. Findings showed resident improvement in a variety of areas, including drug and alcohol use, employment, psychiatric symptoms, and arrests, with improvements that were maintained over the course of the study period. Although residents on parole and probation had substance use reductions that were comparable to voluntary residents, they had far more problems maintaining employment, higher rates of re-arrest and incarceration, and lower attendance to self-help groups. An ongoing randomized clinical trial in Southern California (anticipated N = 330 residents; 50 houses) is currently examining the effectiveness of an intervention to improve access to services and reduce HIV risk among sober living house residents on parole or probation. Residents randomized to the treatment condition receive a Motivational Interviewing Case Management (MICM) intervention specifically targeted to the problems presented for each resident. The list of potential problems that MICM can address is extensive and aims to help in a variety of problem areas inclusive of: 1) adapting to the sober living house environment; 2) complying with parole and probation; 3) finding and maintaining work; 4) successfully accessing and retaining services; 5) addressing HIV risk, testing, and treatment; 6) mobilizing personal and informal resources; and 7) managing setbacks (e.g., relapse, loss of housing, loss of work). Study participants are being tracked over a 12-month time period and being assessed on criminal justice, HIV risk, and drug and alcohol outcomes. Conclusions Sober living houses play an important role in helping individuals in their recovery from substance abuse, and providing additional services in these houses (MICM) to increase access to formal services may further enhance outcomes for high-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "Background The U.S. correctional population is disproportionately burdened with chronic health conditions, particularly mental health and substance use disorders. Though inmates receive health care, linkages to care upon release are often poor or nonexistent. Further, the magnitude of the justiceinvolved population strains state and Federal finances. The annual cost per offender awaiting trial in Rhode Island is approximately $40,000. A diversion program (an alternative sentence diverting from incarceration and offering potential relief to courts and better outcomes for offenders) with linkages to health care has the potential to reduce costs by addressing the underlying physical, mental, and behavioral health issues keeping individuals in the justice system. We describe a diversion pilot program and our observations thus far. In partnership with Brown University and The Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights, Justice Assistance, a nonprofit organization in Cranston, Rhode Island, received support from the Rhode Island General Assembly to develop a program to reduce the Rhode Island awaiting population by linking participants to community-based health care. The pilot program developed, Office of Community Alternatives (OCA), tests an intensive case management model. MAPIT (Motivational Assessment Program to Initiate Treatment) is an Internetbased motivational interviewing program piloted as a component of the OCA program.",

Although screening procedures are relatively straightforward and easily utilized by nurse professionals, developing a personalized, brief, and effective response to promote behavior change for indicated cases is a clinical skill that, for many nurses, requires deliberate effort to acquire [1,2]. To support development of alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) skills among nurses and implement alcohol SBI as a routine practice, Alaska Public Health Nursing (PHN) collaborated with the Arctic FASD Regional Training Center at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The objective is to describe ongoing training needs for nurses conducting alcohol SBI.",

While studies concur that substance use is not the underlying cause of Interpersonal Violence (IPV), approximately 50% of men in BIP are reported to be using substances at unhealthy levels. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) initiated a pilot to address risky substance use in BIP participants, with the Institute for Health & Recovery (IHR), providing curriculum development, training, and technical assistance. The curriculum employs an innovative application of SBIRT designed for use in groups, allowing BIP group leaders to provide substance use health education to men in groups. Some studies indicate that MI can result in better engagement with participants than the typical directive, confrontational approaches often used with individuals involved with the criminal justice system. It uses MI strategies adapted to allow the group members to describe the benefits and costs of substance use themselves rather than a more traditional ‘health education’ lecture by a group leader. Validated single item screening tools, for alcohol and for other drugs, were completed in silence during the group, and open-ended questions were asked as the Brief Intervention; leaders were encouraged to ask permission before sharing information in order to give participants a greater sense of control and ownership of their place on the road to change.",

The consumption pattern of heavy and sporadic alcohol reaches 11.5% of alcohol consumers, accounting for serious health problems. In Brazil, the pattern of alcohol use has shown alarming rates in general on average are consumed six liters of pure alcohol per capita per year. So many workers abusively consume alcoholic beverages, due to lack of knowledge of its pattern of alcohol consumption and its consequences. In this context early detection of the pattern of alcohol consumption among workers, requires further investigation in order to enable better strategies for prevention and health promotion. The objectives are to identify the pattern of alcohol consumption and to analyze the association between social and occupational profile of workers.",

    "abstract": "Background The transfer and translation of programs with scientific evidence to clinical scenarios is often limited by a number of barriers to their implementation [1], making it difficult to provide benefits for a society that requires effective services [2]. The aim of this study was therefore to identify barriers to the adoption of brief intervention programs for the treatment of the abuse of alcohol and other drugs [3,4] at addiction treatment centers in Mexico. On the basis of the experience of experts in the implementation and dissemination of programs, a number of actions are established to address them and advance the transfer process. It is a qualitative study using interviews. The results reported several barriers to the adoption of programs in clinical scenarios. The study discusses the fact that the technology transfer process requires a deliberate, combined effort to ensure the implementation of programs in clinical scenarios. The barriers identified by the actors involved in the process should be considered in the development of strategies to disseminate brief intervention programs. Material and methods The team used an interview guide that included: 1. Knowledge about brief intervention programs, 2. Knowledge about working with brief intervention programs based on scientific evidence, 3. Training and supervision got during the transfer process about brief interventions, 4. Modifications to programs, 5. Barriers on the implementation of programs, 6. Advantages and limitations of brief intervention programs, 7. Other important information. Sixteen interviews were conducted and recorded for about two hours each in the working place of the participants (therapists), who were informed about the recording, the confidentiality and the use pretended for the information. The interviews were transcribed, read, analysed, organized in categories. Results The participants reported three types of barriers to the brief programs operation: Institutional barriers, Therapist barriers, Barriers in the researcher himself and barriers in the program users. Regarding the Institutional barriers therapists report bureaucracy, lack of budget for material or for adequate working areas. About the therapist barriers the therapists report that they own few information about the cognitive-behavioral model; they don’t have affinity with the model, lack of time in the capacitation and lack of feedback. Finally therapist reported the next researcher barriers: differences between the researcher and population goals. Conclusions Findings show the point of view of the people often forgotten in the process of knowledge transfer. It is important to remark also the necessity that the therapist and the organizations be aware of the new knowledge. Also about The impact of the implementation of new technology in the efficacy of any treatment. In the other hand, the researcher needs to take into account that the therapist has an practical vision of the phenomenon. The barriers found in this paper, can be beaten by creating longitudinal capacitation strategies like manuals, and theoretical meetings. It is also needed a bigger",

As the substance use treatment system moves toward treating addiction as a chronic disease, it will be necessary to develop models for the coordination of general medical and addiction treatment services, coupled with a number of social services. Patient-centered care models are one way of improving care coordination by incorporating the goals as expressed by the patient into the treatment plan, which is then coordinated by all members of the treatment team to surround the patient with all necessary resources [1]. Recovery residences, such as recovery homes in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, could represent a potentially important mechanism for such coordination that is patient centered by providing a stable, supportive, living environment that promotes access to a variety of community-based resources.",

    "abstract": "Background: Many young people in England do not use services associated with delivery of alcohol IBA (also called screening and brief intervention).The project tested whether IBA can be delivered to 18-30 year-old, on busy city streets, by trained workers who were not healthcare professionals, without framing it as an 'alcohol reduction' intervention.This approach may be referred to as 'IBA Direct' .Materials and methods: Numbers of participants in the intervention were recorded on a monitoring sheet, along with the individual's gender, age and AUDIT score.The evaluator asked some participants to complete a brief, anonymous feedback form about their experience of the intervention.Results: The project was delivered over 3 days, amassing a total of 24 h across 2 Saturdays and 1 Sunday in August 2015.Four workers were present on all days.In total, 402 brief interventions were completed; however, data from 379 participants were recorded.Forty-one percent were female (21 % missing data) and 42 % were aged in their teens or twenties.A participant feedback form was completed by 61 people.Ninety-three percent (n = 57) rated the service as 'Excellent' or 'Good' .All respondents who answered the question on the suitability of the setting of the service (n = 58) said it was suitable.Nine out of ten respondents (n = 55) stated they would participate in this service in a public setting again.Conclusions: The evaluation of this project has demonstrated the feasibility and high acceptability of IBA Direct being delivered by non-health workers to the public on the streets of London.There were high levels of engagement at each location and among those aged 18-30.Important facilitators were considered to be the 'branding' of the intervention and materials, for example, framed as a 'health quiz' not 'alcohol reduction' and incentives to draw people in such as free 'mocktails' (soft drinks).",

    "abstract": "Many individuals enter the U.S. prison system with a history of high-risk drug and sexual practices, which are two primary contributors to the high rates of HIV and hepatitis cases among this population. As these individuals return to the community, they are likely to continue high-risk behaviors, making it critical that decisionmaking programs designed to reduce risky behaviors be instituted during incarceration close to their release. Prior research on Texas Christian University (TCU) Mapping-Enhanced Counseling (included in the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices as an evidence-based practice) has identified its utility for improving decisionmaking, communication, problem exploration, and personal planning through the use of graphical representations designed to help clients “see” the links and relationships among thoughts, ideas, feelings, and behaviors. It serves as an important tool for helping move traditional, public health-focused educational efforts toward a more comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of personal decisionmaking around sex and drug use behaviors.\r\n\r\nThe TCU Disease Risk Reduction (DRR-1) project developed and tested an intervention, WaySafe, designed to increase positive decisionmaking skills among offenders for healthy living, including skills for reducing disease risk behaviors. WaySafe uses TCU Mapping-Enhanced Counseling to focus on the cognitive aspects of risky sexual and drug use behaviors during re-entry to improve problem recognition, commitment to change, and strategies for avoiding behavioral risks of infections. WaySafe includes six 1-hour, highly interactive sessions to increase motivation and planning. A total of 1398 incarcerated offenders from eight different correctional facilities in two states participated in the study during the last phase of their in-prison substance abuse treatment prior to transition back to the community.\r\n\r\nAll participating offenders completed baseline surveys and then were randomly assigned to the WaySafe intervention or treatment as usual (TAU). At the completion of the 6-week WaySafe curriculum, participating offenders completed follow-up surveys. Baseline and follow-up surveys included measures of knowledge, confidence, and motivation regarding general HIV information, risky sex and drug use, what to do if exposed, and general life skills. Results supported hypotheses that offenders in WaySafe improved significantly more than TAU clients on knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions to avoid risks. Finding new methods to reinforce the lessons learned in the community is a critical next step, because these changes in attitudes and intentions will degrade over time with the stress and pressures of transitioning from prison to the community. Reinforcing lessons learned while offenders are currently facing risky situations may be helpful.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic has created a crisis in access to addiction treatment. Programs with residential components have been particularly impacted as they try to keep infection from spreading in facilities and contributing to further community spread of the virus. This crisis highlights the ongoing daily trade-offs that organizations must weigh as they balance the risks and benefits of individual patients with those of the group of patients, staff and the community they serve. Main body The COVID-19 pandemic has forced provider organizations to make individual facility level decisions about how to manage patients who are COVID-19 positive while protecting other patients, staff and the community. While guidance documents from federal, state, and trade groups aimed to support such decision making, they often lagged pandemic dynamics, and provided too little detail to translate into front line decision making. In the context of incomplete knowledge to make informed decisions, we present a way to integrate guidelines and local data into the decision process and discuss the ethical dilemmas faced by provider organizations in preventing infections and responding to COVID positive patients or staff. Conclusion and commentary Provider organizations need decision support on managing the risk of COVID-19 positive patients in their milieu. While useful, guidance documents may not be capable of providing support with the nuance that local data and simulation modeling may be able to provide.",

    "abstract": "Self-stigma represents a barrier in finding appropriate treatment services, and brings several negative consequences for the individual and the worsening of the situation. Considering that substance dependence is one of the most stigmatizing health conditions, this study aims to assess self-stigma among crack, alcohol, and both substances (crack and alcohol) dependents. The instruments used were: 1) sociodemographic questionnaire to describe participants’ characteristics; the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale adapted for substance users to assess self-stigma; 3) MINI to confirm the substance dependence diagnosis. The sample was composed by 461 patients divided into three groups: 165 alcohol dependents, 141 crack dependents, and 155 crack and alcohol dependents. Most participants were male (91.4%), unemployed (68.6%), and single (70.5%), with incomplete elementary school education (53.3%), with a mean age of 35.38 years. Regarding to involvement in illicit activities, 56.8% stated they were not involved with this type of activity. Comparing self-stigma among the groups investigated, it was found a significant difference between the groups regarding the ISMI overall scores. Similarly, ISMI subscales Alienation, Discrimination Experience, Social Withdrawal and Stigma Resistance also showed a significant difference between groups. On the other hand, the degree of agreement with stereotypes measured by the Stereotype Endorsement subscale did not differ between the groups investigated. The negatives stereotypes associated with substance dependence are equally endorsed and internalized by all groups, however this study showed evidence that crack dependents internalize more negative evaluations related to their condition, and therefore are less likely to seek treatment and adhere to it. The results pointed out the need to consider the impact of stigma on prevention and treatment strategies, in order to encourage patients to seek help and ensure the benefits of interventions.

    "abstract": "This study examined the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing (MI) to reduce hazardous drinking among patients in treatment for depression. The sample consisted of 307 participants ages 18 and over in depression treatment in Kaiser Permanente outpatient psychiatry who reported hazardous drinking, illegal drug use or misuse of prescription drugs in the prior 30 days, and who scored ≥ 5 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Participants were randomized to receive either 3 sessions of MI or printed literature about alcohol and drug use risks, as an adjunct to usual outpatient depression care. Preliminary analyses examined baseline group differences and outcomes among the 264 participants who completed 3- month follow-up to date. In the 3 month follow-up sample, both groups showed reduction in hazardous drinking and depression. Among participants reporting any hazardous drinking at the 4+/5+ level at baseline (N=154), MI-treated participants were less likely than controls to report hazardous drinking at 3 months, at a level approaching statistical significance (44.9% vs. 59.2%, p = .075). No group differences in cannabis use reduction or depression reduction were observed. This study examined preliminary data regarding the efficacy of MI (intervention) versus printed literature on alcohol use risks (control) among depression patients in a clinical setting as a supplement to usual care in psychiatry. Initial findings indicate that both groups reduced hazardous drinking at 3 months, but that MI may be somewhat more effective among participants drinking at a 4+/5+ level. The investigators are in process of completing 3-, 6- and 12-month follow up. Further analyses will examine long term outcomes, outcomes among subgroups based on drinking and psychiatric severity, predictors of hazardous drinking reduction in the sample as a whole, initiation with specialty alcohol and drug treatment among dependent participants, and cost effectiveness of the intervention.",

The aim of this project is to recommend a standardised method to be used in Wales for screening in nonclinical settings with Health and Social care partners. The Public Health Wales team have successfully undertaken a training programme so that everyone who has a 'teachable moment' has the skills and confidence to address hazardous or harmful drinking behaviours via an evidence based approach. They have been training across Wales in all Health and Social care settings. AUDIT-C is one of the screening tools recommended by NICE and the PHW team will undertake an evaluation of AUDIT-C as a 'method of choice' in nonclinical settings. The advantages and disadvantages of the AUDIT- C screening tool and a comparison with FAST will be undertaken. The initial stage would be a review of the literature and methodology available and an evaluation will be conducted. The review and recommendations will take place through 2013.

    "abstract": "Cardiff University, the Welsh Government and Public Health Wales are working together to implement screening and brief interventions across a variety of health and community settings through a unique collaboration; a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP). Previous research has uncovered both barriers and facilitators to implementation. This KTP seeks to build upon this work and translate the research into practice. The Have-a-Word social marketing initiative, the first of its kind, was launched in 2013 in Wales and seeks to specifically address the barriers to implementing SBI. To date over 2000 health and community professionals have received training1. This paper demonstrates how social marketing has been used to overcome barriers to implementing screening and brief interventions across a variety of health and community settings in Wales. The Have-a-Word campaign, currently being rolled out across Wales, seeks to manage the image of screening and brief interventions and encourage those who have received training to deliver brief interventions. Evaluation of the Welsh model shows that many health and community professionals who received training continue to view a formal screening tool such as FAST as a barrier to successfully implementing the SBI model in specific settings. Social marketing has helped overcome barriers to delivery (some nurses commented that they felt part of an SBI community which empowered them). A more pragmatic approach to screening is required since the formal screening tool was dissuading some professionals from delivering brief interventions at all. Social marketing campaigns can help manage the image of brief interventions however sustaining those who have received training remains a challenge and continued support and encouragement are needed.\r\n\r\n1This includes maxillofacial and trauma clinic nurses, midwives, health visitors, dieticians, custody sergeants, youth workers and practice nurses.",

    "abstract": "In 2000, voters in Colorado approved an amendment to the state constitution to legalize medical marijuana. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice indicated that patients complying with medical marijuana laws would not be a priority for prosecution. The state subsequently experienced widespread growth in in the number of individuals with a medical marijuana card and in marijuana dispensaries. In 2012 Colorado passed an amendment to legalize use of recreational marijuana. Medical and recreational marijuana legalization poses challenges for providing effective SBI. This presentation will summarize trends in marijuana use in Colorado and modifications to brief screening to improve detection of marijuana use. It will also describe challenges reported by health professionals delivering brief interventions on marijuana, and key points to emphasize in SBI training to reduce harm, prevent diversion to youth, and tailor brief interventions to individual patient conditions. Quantitative data collected through SBIRT implementation in Colorado will be summarized and qualitative data on training needs of health professionals who deliver marijuana SBI. Colorado data through 2011 indicates that approximately 8% of adults screened at-risk for problems from marijuana use, and that risky use is increasing. In a subset of patients who received SBI, six month follow-up indicated that use decreased 45%. Data collected after implementation of recreational marijuana legislation will also be presented. Health professionals need information about the following issues to provide effective SBI: how marijuana risk compares with tobacco, medication interactions and effects on chronic health conditions, driving under the influence, cyclic vomiting associated with chronic use, differential effects in youth, and a perceived lack of harm among adults and youth. Marijuana legalization poses new challenges and it is important to prepare health professionals to provide effective SBI to decrease harm and prevent diversion to youth.",

    "abstract": "The perception of Italian GPs on alcohol problems has changed in recent decades, but it is still inclined to make a too clear-cut distinction between normal drinkers without any problem and hopeless alcoholics, according to an ongoing cultural tradition. On the other hand, according to consistent observation during the last 25 years, the identification of risky drinkers among clients has been as low as 4-11%, and of alcoholics between 0.8 and 2%. Understanding the obstacles that GPs encounter when they communicate with patients about the issue of alcohol can provide appropriate information tools to improve GP's ability to identify risky drinkers and to motivate those identified to reduce their drinking behaviour. The BIQ questionnaire, previously used by Struzzo in Italy, was administered to 158 GPs in the area of Florence who attended a one-day alcohol training course, prior to the start of the training. Six such courses were carried out during the period 2010-2012. 45.7% of participants recognized as a limit for at risk drinking for males of 30-40 g of alcohol per day, and 20.4% identified 20-30 g of alcohol per day for females (70.6% of whom set this limit at 10-20 g per day, suggesting a more restrictive approach to female patients regardless the gender of the physician). 47.7% said they have no problem addressing the issue of alcohol with their patients, while 52.7% said they had little or no effect on changing their patients’ drinking behaviour. A need for training in early identification and brief intervention was felt by most GPs (over 90%), with a minority (14%) indicating that an economic incentive is necessary to implement brief intervention. As to GP lifestyles, 81% of physicians reported drinking at least one alcoholic beverage during the last year, and 25% smoked (above the mean for Tuscany and Italy).",

    "abstract": "Targeted interventions for high risk groups are increasingly important. Alcohol problems are not evenly distributed. Highly differentiated patterns and prevalence have been identified among workers according to their industry and occupational groups. Young workers in the hospitality industry have been found to be among the highest consumers of alcohol and drugs yet largely overlooked for early and brief intervention. To assess the efficacy of an innovative brief intervention on risky drinking and associated psycho-social measures a trial was undertaken with a cohort of Australian first year hospitality trainees. The study comprised a block randomised controlled trial. Baseline data (T1) was collected at the commencement of hospitality training from both control and intervention groups prior to the administration of a brief intervention and 5 months later at the end of the first term of training (T2). The intervention focused on strategies to address workplace social norms and pressures, resilience and coping strategies, alternative stress management techniques, assertiveness training and social support mechanisms. The intervention was informed by a systematic review of the literature and a qualitative study involving focus groups. Measures included AUDIT, K10, quality of life measures and life satisfaction scales. The findings indicate high levels of risky alcohol consumption among this group of young workers. Significant relationships between age, gender and psycho-social measures were found for risky drinkers. The results of brief intervention indicated changes in the desired direction. Findings are presented together details of efficacy, acceptability to students, implications for wide scale implementation and the feasibility of sustained interventions of this type. This is one of few brief intervention RCTs of its type that address a high risk population using a tailored and targeted intervention and offers considerable promise.",

Our aim was to investigate the comparative efficacy of a stage-tailored intervention and a non-stage-tailored intervention of the same intensity in reducing alcohol use and alcohol problem severity among job-seekers with unhealthy alcohol use. The interventions were based on the most prominent representative models, the transtheoretical model of behavior change (TTM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A total of 1,243 proactively recruited job-seekers with unhealthy alcohol use (64% male, M=30 years, 76% not motivated to change) were assigned by random to three study groups: (1) individualized stage-tailored feedback letters based on the TTM, (2) individualized non-stage-tailored feedback letters based on the TPB, and (3) assessment only (controls). Both intervention groups received up to two interventions. All groups were followed-up three, six and 15 months after baseline. Piecewise latent growth models were conducted to investigate change in alcohol use and severity from baseline to month 3 and month 3 to 15. Initial motivation was tested as a moderator of intervention efficacy. All groups reduced alcohol use and severity significantly in the short term. In the long term and when including motivation as a covariate, the stage-tailored group produced a significantly greater reduction than the two other groups. Initial motivation was a significant moderator of intervention efficacy. Neither intervention was generally more or less effective than the other. The efficacy of the interventions largely depended upon the initial motivation to change alcohol use: the lower the motivation to change, the more likely the individuals were to benefit from the stage-tailored intervention; and the higher the motivation to change, the more likely the individuals were to benefit from the non-stage-tailored intervention.",

There was no significant gender gap between girls (18%) and boys (17%); which is in general agreement with a local survey (Roberts, 2011); where around one in ten secondary students report having been drunk four or more times in their life, with no significant difference in gender. The difficulty is that while there are validated and established screening tools for adults and over 16's the NICE guidelines (2010) recommend the Common Assessment Framework as the only screening tool for under 15's.

In daily professional practice, Primary health care (PHC) professionals frequently deal with patients who consume alcohol at risk for their health. In 2011 in Italy, 23.9% of men and 6.9% of women aged 11+ years have been estimated as hazardous drinkers—more than 8 million individuals. In the context of the European Alcohol Measures for Public Health Research Alliance (AMPHORA) project, the National Observatory on Alcohol of the National Centre for Surveillance, Prevention and Health Promotion (NOA-CNESPS) of the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), in collaboration with the “Societa nazionale di aggiornamento per il medico di medicina generale” (SNAMID), a scientific society for the training of general practitioners (GPs), carried out a survey on national knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of GPs on the use of EIBI for hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption. The aim of the survey, performed in 6 EU countries, was the identification of the main barriers and facilitators for the implementation of EIBI in PHC. Most of participants did not receive training on alcohol and alcohol-related problems: 24% did not receive training at all, 26% less than 4 hours, 28% from 4 to 10 hours, and only 7% “more than 40 hours” across the professional life. Only 31.9% (the lowest percentage among participating European countries) said they were familiar with standardized screening instruments, of which only half used them in their clinical practice. Furthermore, only 37.5% were familiar with brief intervention techniques. In Italy, EIBI strategy for hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption is included in nearby all strategic public health documents. Nevertheless, EIBI is still offered sporadically. Discussion on barriers, facilitators and on perceptions of GPs on the use of EIBI are presented.",

The Scottish government has invested in a range of policies to address this and the wider harms from alcohol, including a national programme on alcohol brief interventions (ABIs). The initial focus of this work was primary care, accident and emergency care, and antenatal care but it was expanded in 2012 to include ABIs delivered in wider settings and with populations such as social work service users and young people. This process evaluation aims to explore the feasibility and acceptability of ABIs delivered to young people and in social work settings. The study involves two phases: one that maps existing projects providing ABIs in these areas and examines barriers and facilitators to their delivery, and a second that explores case study projects in depth and develops proposals for a potential future outcome evaluation. Phase 1 of the study involved conducting 24 semi-structured interviews with 28 professionals from 12 projects providing ABIs in the wider settings of social work and young people's services between December 2012 and April 2013. Two field visit observations were also completed and documentation/data gathered from all projects, including numbers of clients and ABIs delivered where possible. A framework approach was used for coding and analysis of data. In addition to a detailed thematic analysis, 10 project case summaries were produced to retain the specificity of information about the diversity and similarities across the cases studied. Results from Phase 1 of the study will be presented and implications for policy and practice will be discussed.",

First page results of each search were collected and classified by two researchers through an adapted websites rating scale. One hundred and eighty-five websites were found. Duplicate records were removed. Of the 69 websites analyzed, 31.9% lacked information on alcohol-related content, 26.1% included articles on the subject, but not so structured for alcohol users, 24.6% provided direct information on the consumption reduction processes or alcohol withdrawal, and the remaining 17.4% were classified as selling products, links to other websites, and product and facilities advertising for alcoholism treatment. Of the 17 sites that provided information about the consumption reduction process or abstinence, 9 were classified as evidence-based content and 8 as superstitions or beliefs like popular teas and potions. Most of the internet content is not evidence-based. Thus, it is necessary to develop websites with appropriate information for users who wish to reduce their alcohol consumption or for those who need to be referred to public health professionals.",

    "abstract": "In the past 20 years, research has shown that brief interventions are effective in reducing health risk behaviors. Now we are in the second generation of brief intervention trials, investigating how to improve efficacy, including the investigation of cost-saving communication channels. Our aim was to investigate whether motivationally tailored interventions are more effective in reducing unhealthy alcohol use when delivered by computer or in person. Proactively recruited general hospital inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use (n=975) participated in a randomized controlled trial, and were allocated to one of three groups: 1) individualized theory-based computer generated feedback letters, 2) motivational interviewing based counselling, and 3) assessment only (controls). Both intervention groups received up to three interventions. All groups are followed up at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Between February 2011 and December 2012, recruitment and interventions have been completed. We have assessed 10,591 inpatients aged 18-64 years for eligibility. We have screened 6,236 inpatients regarding unhealthy alcohol use, corresponding to 91.1% of those eligible. Of all inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use, 80.6% gave informed consent to participate in the trial. So far, 71.3% to 81.5% of these have participated in the follow-ups. A large study has been successfully implemented at a general hospital. Satisfactory participation rates provide a solid basis to investigate the comparative efficacy of brief alcohol interventions delivered by computer versus in person. The follow-up period of up to 24 months provides an excellent opportunity to investigate gradually increasing effects.",

    "abstract": "Brief motivational intervention (BMI) has shown promising results among young adults, but its underlying mechanisms are seldom investigated. Analyzing the dynamic processes of therapist and client behaviors throughout the session might help to better understand mechanisms operative during BMI. We used data from a BMI randomized controlled trial for heavy drinking among non-treatment seeking Swiss young men. The parent study found significantly lowered drinking in the BMI group (N=179) compared to a control group receiving no intervention (N=182) 3 months later. In the present study, we conducted psycholinguistic coding of 174 BMI using the Motivational Interviewing (MI) Skill Code (MISC 2.1; Miller et al. 2008) and then divided the sessions in thirds to examine within-session processes across time. Alcohol outcome was dichotomized into a “changers” group (baseline to 3-month difference greater than the mean of the control group) and a “non-changers” group. We then tested for interactions between time (thirds) and outcome group in GEE models accounting for within-person correlations across repeated (time) measures. Interactions were not significant for therapist frequency of MI-consistent behaviors, percent of open questions, and ratio of reflections to questions, but were significant for the frequency of MI-inconsistent behaviors (MIIN) and the percent of therapist reflections that were complex. Regarding client change talk, interactions were significant only for commitment to change. Findings indicated that there were dynamic processes at play during our BMI which were related to better alcohol outcomes. Specifically, the presence of MIIN in the beginning of a BMI appeared to be related to poor outcomes while an increase in complex reflections was related to good outcomes. As in prior MI process research, commitment to change strength was related to outcomes, but here the difference came from non-changers increasing their commitment not to change rather than from changers increasing their commitment to change.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have decried the lack of investigation regarding the “how and why” of brief intervention effects. Additional research is needed to explicate the processes at work during motivational interviewing brief interventions, as well as the most salient factors influencing these processes. The overall aim of the current study was to better understand the nature and possible active ingredients of the screening and brief intervention encounter. Specifically, this inquiry focused upon the effect of patient-level variables and two distinct brief motivational interviewing-based counseling interventions on six-month drinking outcomes. Three hundred and thirty-three adult participants were recruited from a Level I trauma center. Participants were randomized to one of two brief counseling intervention arms. All interventions were conducted by professional mental health counselors or graduate student counselors-in-training. Follow-up data regarding participants’ drinking patterns and well-being were collected via telephone approximately 6 months subsequent to the intervention. Data were analyzed using MANOVA and hierarchical regression. There were two primary significant findings of this study: one, that a new standardized brief counseling intervention appeared to be as efficacious as a widely-used brief intervention focusing upon quantity and frequency of drinking; and two, that patient pre-intervention AUDIT scores were a major predictor of changes in patient AUDIT scores at 6 months post-intervention in a way that was theoretically counter-intuitive: namely, that high scores (indicating possible alcohol dependence) were associated with the greatest changes at follow-up. Limitations and implications of findings are discussed. Future investigation of the construct of patient engagement is recommended.",

This possibility extends the settings in which BIs have been delivered and has attracted international attention. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of BI delivered by community pharmacists in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in London. A two-arm RCT was conducted to determine the effectiveness of BI delivered by community pharmacists. Pharmacists and their support staff were trained in the trial procedures. Pharmacy support staff (N = 23) approached and informed customers about the study, to support formal recruitment by the community pharmacist (N = 17). Eligible and consenting pharmacy customers (aged≥18 years) at the 16 community pharmacies were randomised in equal numbers to either BI delivered by a community pharmacist or a non-intervention control condition, conducted in the pharmacy consultation room. The intervention was a brief motivational discussion of approximately 10 minutes duration. Participants randomised to the control arm were given an alcohol information leaflet with no opportunity for discussion. At 3-month follow up, alcohol consumption and related problems were assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) administered by telephone. Of the 1440 customers approached, 541 (38%) consented to participate. Of those who consented, 409 were identified as hazardous/harmful drinkers (AUDIT 8-19), 94 as low risk drinkers (AUDIT≤7), and 38 as possibly dependent drinkers (AUDIT≥20), with the latter two groups excluded from the trial. The 409 trial participants were followed up at three months (follow-up rate ≥80%). Data analysis is under way and the preliminary main trial results are presented here.

    "abstract": "Progression of alcohol-related liver fibrosis stops when drinking stops, but the diagnosis is usually missed because the process of fibrosis is symptom free and missed by the usual liver function tests. Non-invasive tests to detect fibrosis and cirrhosis are available, but not currently used in primary care. We aimed to: identify optimal ways of engaging communities with liver disease screening; to inform a future trial to augment brief interventions with a liver risk score; and to estimate the prevalence of liver disease. Participants, aged 36-55y, registered with general practice (GP) or working in Merseyside, UK, were contacted by post (GP) or through workplaces. Risky drinkers (previous week drinking >112g females/168g males) were invited for a liver screen. Blood samples were tested for fibrosis markers (hyaluronic acid and procollagen type III N-terminal peptide) and categorised using the Simple Traffic Light (STL) algorithm. Of 6439 GP registrants, 539 (8%) returned the alcohol consumption questionnaire; 152 were risky drinkers and were invited for liver screening, and 27 attended. Screening in the 13 participating workplaces (out of 37 approached) was attended by 2-6% of the eligible workforce (n=363). Of 142 risky drinkers, most (91%) accepted the liver screening test. In total, seven samples were graded ‘red’, yielding a prevalence of 4.6% (95%CI 2.02—9.14%) of probable liver disease and further 26.3% (20.0—33.7%; 41 samples) scored ‘amber’ (moderate risk). Detecting and supporting cases in the community could avert deaths and save costs, and this work informs development of a trial to determine whether feedback of liver disease risk scores is more effective than brief intervention alone. We conclude that workplaces are optimum sites, because screening takes place at a time and location that was convenient for participants; however alternative methods will be required to access those who do not work, whose risk may be higher.",

The present study aims to develop a reflection about the application of brief intervention and it utilization by nurses in a real-world work context. It recognized the importance of nurses’ performance on preventive actions, especially those acting under the auspices of primary care. The application of strategies for diagnosis and brief intervention is especially useful to reduce problems caused by alcohol use, because it can reach a large segment of the population before the individual has become alcohol dependent. Appropriate situations to consider the application of screening and brief intervention by nurses would be: during nursing consultation for adults users or the elderly, even if the consultation has been scheduled for another purpose; during activities aimed to draw people's awareness of a health topic (e.g., campaigns held in public places); during home visits; during groups (e.g., those for pregnant women or people with hypertension or diabetes). In this context, nurses should be taught the specific technologies and approaches to screening and brief intervention, but in a straightforward manner that allows its use by professionals without specialized formation.",

Identificazione Precoce Intervento Breve (IPIB) is the national EIBI working team at the NOA-CNESPS, ISS. The team started its activities in April 2006, publishing the national strategy and organising conferences to announce, promote and disseminate the IPIB training programme. The ISS has been indicated by the National Committee on Alcohol (Consulta Nazionale Alcol) as the national provider of the training activities in tight connection with the SIA (Italian Society of Alcohology) and the Regions. IPIB training is not yet compulsory for the professionals of the National Health System, but an example of implementation at the Regional level has been the specific training experience of the Tuscany Region, a programme for all the Regions on IPIB in the workplace funded by the Centre for Control of Diseases (CCM) of the Italian Ministry of Health.

However, there continues to be a broad gap between the scope of the problem and the use of preventive and treatment services. This situation is particularly acute near the border between Mexico and the United States, where drug use and availability are greater. Funding was obtained in both countries to conduct a feasibility study about the early identification of consumption at primary health care centers and to test the Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT) of brief intervention. Early identification and brief intervention have proven to be cost-effective and to encourage timely care and reduce the care gap. Men and women aged 18+ (approximately 1000 in each country) will be screened with the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). Risky users (about 65 participants in each country) will be enrolled and randomized to either QUIT or a control condition. An electronic material management application (EMMA) and “talking touch-screen” wireless tablets will be used for screening, randomization, and data monitoring. The main results of the implementation phase are the creation of a binational research team; consolidation of the research design; adaptation of instruments and strategies of the ASSIST-QUIT intervention and the EMMA system; technology exchange; and identification of areas requiring cultural adaptation. An ethnographic approach to health centers in Tijuana, Mexico and Los Angeles was used to identify the differences and similarities between centers. Comparisons of the prevalence of drug consumption among participants in both countries will be presented. The main contribution is the identification of the challenges, scope, and cultural differences in the implementation of a program for early detection and treatment of drug consumption in primary health care centers in the border region. The results will underpin new research to apply this model among similar populations.",

By pulling together results from five individual studies, we aim to enable the audience to explore how the overall narrative enables additional insight in to our understanding of development, effectiveness, and implementation of online interventions. Methods and results from studies will be explained and contrasted. The theoretical underpinnings of the development of Unitcheck, an intervention initially developed for UK university students, will be explored briefly before outlining results of three randomised control trials. The results of a study employing qualitative think-aloud methodology will then be presented. Evidence will be presented of the ability of Unitcheck to prompt users to actively engage with information presented, relating information to their own experience; resulting in an evaluation of their own drinking behaviour. Evidence will be presented of user's immediate cognitive and emotional reaction when comparing their own drinking with that of others. Next, we discuss how experiences with Unitcheck were applied to inform development of ChangeDrinking, an online screening and brief advice intervention for non-help-seeking individuals who have recently been hospital inpatients. The results of a study employing qualitative think-aloud methodology to understand how those identified as having substance misuse problems engage with ChangeDrinking will then be presented. The presentation will consider how context of implementation (e.g. university vs national hospital) shaped development of each intervention tool and subsequently impacted the evaluation process. The synthesis of the results of the think-aloud studies with randomised control trial results enables insight in to potential mechanisms for behaviour change. This paper will consider the implication of results for our understanding of the use of online brief personalized feedback interventions for modifying alcohol use.",

    "abstract": "Increasing alcohol consumption among older individuals in the UK is a public health concern. Although brief interventions (BIs) can effectively reduce heavy drinking in older age groups generally, social and contextual factors may influence implementation and effectiveness. Identities offer a useful theoretical concept to explain why the potential for public health messages to reduce rates of heavy drinking in this sector has not been realised, and can inform preventive approaches. A qualitative study explored older people’s reasoning about drinking in later life and how this interacted with health concerns, to inform future, targeted prevention in this group. A diverse sample of older adults in North East England (ages 51-90) participated in interviews (n=24, 12m, 12f) and three focus groups (participants n=27). Data were analysed using grounded theory and discursive psychology methods. Older adults portrayed drinking less alcohol as an appropriate response if one experienced impaired health. However continued heavy drinking could be presented as normal behaviour for someone experiencing relative wellbeing in later life, or if ill health was construed as unrelated to alcohol consumption. When talking about alcohol use older people oriented strongly towards opposed identities of normal or problematic drinker, defined by propriety rather than health considerations. These identities were flexible in older people’s talk since they could be applied to either moderate or heavy drinking. Older people displayed scepticism about health advice on alcohol when avoiding stigmatised identity as a drinker. Findings indicate that older UK adults do not recognise unhealthy drinking as distinct from dependent drinking, and are highly sensitive to stigma when discussing alcohol consumption. Preventive strategies should encourage older people’s identification of heavy drinking as neither healthy nor synonymous with dependence. BIs for heavy drinkers in later life should be tailored to address lay reasoning that is resistant to recognition of health risks.",

    "abstract": "Significant attention has been given to alcohol screening and brief intervention, with the majority of studies focused on the risky drinking population. The more severe-risk population has been excluded purposely although there is limited evidence as to why this has been established as an acceptable procedure. There have been numerous claims made that the more severe-risk drinker would not respond well to brief interventions, however these claims are not made on the basis of empirical research, only general consensus. The purpose of this study was to identify potential predictors of alcohol screening and brief counseling intervention outcomes for severe-risk drinkers. Specifically, age, gender, race, blood alcohol level, counseling intervention type, injury mechanism, and the constructs of the AUDIT assessment use were examined to see whether the variables were able to predict reduction to low-risk levels among severe-risk participants. The current study was a retrospective analysis of a larger randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 participants were identified as severe-risk from the large study (30.3%). All variables were gathered from participant self-report at baseline. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to analyze the data. The results of the analysis highlighted that over two-thirds (67.3%) of the participants reduced from severe-risk (AUDIT >15) to low-risk (AUDIT <8) at six-month follow-up. The average reduction in AUDIT scores was 14 points, representing a large effect size with a Cohen’s d value of 1.68. The two models examined in the logistic regression were non-significant, indicating there is little support for the predictors examined within this analysis. These results imply that severe-risk drinkers can benefit from receiving a brief counseling intervention while hospitalized after a traumatic injury. More research focused on the severe-risk drinker is needed.",

In Wales, harm caused by alcohol costs the NHS over £85 million per year and is responsible for 1 in 30 deaths. A national programme of brief intervention training is taking place across Wales to impact the culture of hazardous and harmful drinking across Wales. In order to ensure a population approach, Public Health Wales is developing a basic scratch-card so drinkers can easily keep track on how much alcohol they consume and receive some advice and information on their of consumption. Scratch-card will be made available for free and drinkers will 'log/scratch' their intake. This will be monitored over a period of months by various health and social care professionals delivering Alcohol Brief Interventions to see if there is any reduction in their client's drinking patterns. The pilot project will be rolled out over the winter 2013. It is hoped that the scratch-card will help reduce hazardous and harmful drinking and reduce the impact on services due to alcohol.",

One year after the end of the 1st edition of the course and eight months after the end of its 2nd edition, an online questionnaire was sent to all approved participants (7387). The instrument contains questions on the use of the techniques, the implementation problems faced after the course, and their activities to disseminate the knowledge gained to other community or religious leaders. In all editions, adherence was high; about 80% of those who started the course went on to finish it. 1815 people (24.6%) agreed to answer the online questionnaire. Most of them (68.5%) considered the course was very important to their daily activities and felt very motivated to use the screening tools (57%) and BI (53.5%). Regarding dissemination, 54% of them had already trained between one to 20 people, and 15% reported having trained between 21 to 50 people. Most of the participants had already applied the ASSIST (61%), BI for alcohol (78%) and BI for tobacco (67%). We also found some differences between the participants in the two editions as regards the importance of the techniques, their incorporation in their daily activities, and colleague support. The participants from the 2nd edition were aware of the importance of SBI and used the techniques more often than those from the 1st edition.

Leading researchers recognize that alcohol and violence are major factors in the leading causes of death among youth. Trauma centers are key locations for services aimed at reducing future violent incidents (recidivism and retaliation) and alcohol misuse through the implementation of brief interventions. Multiple beneficial outcomes associated with culturally competent counseling interventions, including lower violent crime arrests after trauma center discharge and lower health care costs are anticipated yet unknown. Our objective was to examine the feasibility of providing alcohol screening in combination with violence screening and 2 brief counseling intervention (AVSBI) sessions to hospitalized trauma patients (15-25 years) with violence-related injuries in two Level I Trauma Centers in the US. Following consent protocol, screening tools were administered to assess violence risk factors, overall functioning and risky drinking with trauma patients (ages 15-25) with severe violence-related injuries followed by two brief interventions. Feasibility was assessed at both hospital trauma centers. Preliminary results pertaining to barriers and receptivity to AVSBI indicate overall positive receptivity and low decline rates; barriers were primarily institution-related in both hospital trauma centers. Trends noted in patient interactions were analyzed in a qualitative manner determining pertinent feasibility themes. AVSBI yielded positive trends when addressing both alcohol misuse and violence risk factors in violently-injured hospitalized youth. Further large scale study is warranted.",

The aims of this study were to investigate if BI (Brief intervention) counseling decreased alcohol consumption and to study if it improved health related quality of life for individuals seeking care at PHC-units in Sweden. Patients visiting PHC-units were asked to answer questionnaires containing AUDIT-C and EQ-5D-questions. 643 of 2918 respondents were contacted in 2012 for follow-up. 16 PHC-units participated and were randomized into four strands. These received two different education programs in how to detect risk-behavior related to alcohol consumption and half of the strands were assisted by implementation coaches. All received the same information on intervention methods. Intervention was done with 5-A BI or a modified MI-model.\r\n\r\nFemale risk drinkers who received BI decreased the AUDIT-C total score from 4.93 to 4.29 and women who not received BI lowered the score from 4.93 to 4.29. For male risk drinkers who received BI the AUDIT-C total score decreased from 6.23 to 5.52 and male risk drinkers who did not receive BI decrease the score from 5.87 to 5.12. No statistical difference between intervention group and control group regarding AUDIT-C and EQ-5D was found at follow-up. Both groups lowered their total scores. There is no clear evidence that BI has effect on alcohol consumption or health related life quality. A larger part of individuals identified as risk drinkers did not receive BI, a finding that demands further research. Our prime suggestion to explain the findings is that also the control intervention was effective.",

This paper aims to present the results of the national project, in particular, we evaluated the effectiveness of training and the satisfaction of the participants, both at the national and regional levels. The national project involved training courses in 13 partner regions. These courses were evaluated by 3 questionnaires made by the CAR, analyzed by Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) statistical program. The issues discussed were: motivations and expectations, knowledge and expertise on alcohol before and after training, overall satisfaction. The national project has trained 450 workers in all Italy, especially doctors in the National Health System (NHS) that deal with safety in the workplace. The results showed a significant increase in knowledge/skills. They can use in their professional practice the tools provided by the courses (AUDIT-C). The Campania region was the most expert with this method, Marche the least but the most satisfied and motivated to continue: this region, in fact, organized other courses after the first one. The courses have increased access to the best practices for the prevention of alcohol-related risks and underlining the need to establish national guidelines.",

This paper presents the preliminary results of the first 2 training courses for dental hygienists initiated by CAR. In particular, we evaluated the effectiveness of the courses and the satisfaction of the participants. In addition, we present the first results of a research project designed to evaluate the effectiveness of AUDIT and brief intervention carried out during oral hygiene sessions at reducing alcohol consumption. The sample included 60 DHs from Florence and Bologna. The two training courses were evaluated by three questionnaires made “ad hoc” by the CAR. The data was analysed by the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) statistical program. In particular we evaluated motivations and expectations and knowledge and expertise on alcohol before and after training. Moreover, we assessed the satisfaction of participants. Dental hygienists used IPIB in their work settings. The AUDIT questionnaire was used most often, with additional questions about lifestyle and the consumption of alcohol (grams) during the week. Prior to training, results showed DHs lacked alcohol knowledge; the majority did not know about brief intervention and didn't investigate alcohol consumption in their patients. At the end of the courses, participants showed a significant increase in knowledge and skills. The preliminary results of the research project show the effectiveness of brief intervention in this context: of 268 patients, a reduction in alcohol consumption was seen in 45% between the first and the second meeting.",

Motivation to change one’s lifestyle is an important determinant of actually changing lifestyle. However, little is known about factors that could be used to modify an individual’s motivation to change. Aim To examine in patients with manifest CVD which factors determine motivation to change alcohol consumption. Participants 2037 subsequent patients in the departments of General Internal Medicine, Cardiology, Neurology, and Vascular Surgery, most of whom had had a recent CVD event, participated in the study. Methods They completed a cardiovascular risk assessment, including a computerized self-report lifestyle questionnaire and motivation to change behavior. In this presentation we focus, however, on alcohol use. Results On a scale from 1 (not willing to change) to 5 (definitely willing to change), patients scored 1.68 willingness to change their alcohol consumption. Being female, older and a smoker were positively associated with the motivation to change. The relationship between participants’ age and their motivation to reduce their alcohol consumption was moderated by their sex. These factors together, however, explained only 2.5% of the total variance. Although being female, older and a smoker were associated with stronger motivation to change their alcohol consumption to a healthy norm, also other individual patient factors appeared to be involved. Based on this, personalized medicine and motivational interviewing, which could help choosing the right strategy for fostering changes in lifestyle, may be more effective.",

The authors re-examined the data elicited by a GP brief intervention project, which involved 308 risky drinkers among 2869 clients enrolled between 2005 and 2007 in two areas in and around Florence. Data presented in previous INEBRIA meetings showed that baseline risky drinkers had a 55.30 g/day average intake (60.15 g for males, 41.63 g for females), which decreased to 37.61 g/day at the first follow-up (41.71 g for males, 26.06 g for females). Regression to the mean methods (both uni- and multi-variate) were used to overcome possible statistical flaws. Applying the regression coefficient of the two series of measurements, the extent of regression to the mean was 6.77 g and 6.78 g for males and females. Therefore, the reduction of the consumption in grams between enrolment and the first follow-up has been transformed respectively into 11.67 and 8.80 g/day. This change does not appreciably alter the previous results. The GPs who identify between 8% and 20% of their patients as at-risk drinkers (which is the rate considered as more approximate to reality) had a statistically significantly higher number of patients showing up at follow-up (68.69%) compared to those who identify a lower ( 20 %) (p <0.001). Women compared to men, and people aged 40-49 compared to the other age classes, appear to be most amenable to change. Identification of risky drinking by GPs is a good predictor of decreased alcohol consumption among clients. Being a woman and being middle-aged are good predictors of improved alcohol drinking patterns among clients with at-risk drinking.",

    "abstract": "There are some evidences in Brazil and others countries pointing out insufficient resources and actions to promote prevention and rehabilitation for substance abuse related disorders. Also the lack of professional qualification contributes to this scenario, generating knowledge deficiencies and inadequate practices. The study evaluates the Regional Reference Centre on Drugs of Juiz de Fora, Brazil (CRR-JF). The CRR-JF aims to train professionals of the local health sector (NHS) and social care system increasing their knowledge of screening and brief intervention (SBI) practices on the use of drugs and strengthening health care activities. Five courses are provided: Motivational Counseling and Brief Intervention, Case Management and Social Reintegration of Drug Users, Improvement of Medical Practices about Drugs, and Comprehensive Drug Care for Hospital’s Professionals. Questionnaires were applied measuring participant satisfaction and changes in the practices. The added workload of the courses was 360 hours. A total of 180 professionals attended the courses (community health workers, social workers, nurses, doctors, psychologists and others). According to results, 83.2% of participants were satisfied or very satisfied about the courses attended; 61.3% evaluated the content of the courses as good, 28% as great, and 60% were very satisfied or satisfied with the applicability of the course content. Regarding SBI, the participants showed a significant increase in their level of trust and ability to approach users of psychoactive substances and counsel them to reduce or stop their consumption. Besides providing knowledge acquisition, participation in the CRR-JF enabled greater discussion of the practices carried out, reflecting on the work of professionals in the development of more effective interventions in prevention, promotion, and psychosocial rehabilitation of users of psychoactive substances.

    "abstract": "The sexual violence (SV) suffered in childhood and adolescence significantly affects the physical and mental health of the victims who are subjected to pain, shame and guilt, requiring them to adopt coping strategies of these feelings. The use of alcohol and drugs is a recognized way of dealing with the pain of living. This work of narrative feature analyzes and discusses through the life story of eight people, chemical dependency as a result of VS suffered in childhood or adolescence. The participants of this study are male and have suffered sexual violence in this age period of life. Their ages range from 23 to 39 years, and all are admitted to a therapeutic community in a city in the interior of Sao Paulo state, in Brazil, for treatment of chemical dependency, being met by the department of Psychology. Seven participants cited the violence suffered in childhood (between 7 and 9 years), and adolescence (age 14). The attackers were people closed to the victims. All patients claim that violence suffered influenced their entry into the world of drugs. Six participants declare themselves as homosexuals, a participant claims to have ceased to be gay and the other is not stated as a homosexual, but presents difficulties regarding sexuality. The participants see the drugs as an anesthetic of heartaches. Was noted that the patients have a double stigma in society: the issue of drugs addiction and the orientation of sexual desire, because the majority of participants are homosexual. The results reinforce the need for effective action geared to accommodate the victims of sexual violence and effective preventive measures to prevent them, as well as preventing the use of alcohol by adolescents victimized.",

In this study, health effects were analyzed for a total of 835 Internet help-seekers who participated in one of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce either alcohol or drug use following online assessment and brief intervention. Health effects over 12 months for participants who reduced their use to a clinically less problematic category were compared to health status for participants who maintained their use or increased it. Participants’ alcohol use was measured with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and drug use was measured with the Drug Use Disorders identification Test (DUDIT). A battery of previously validated questions assessed experienced levels of general health. Health effects were analyzed using a repeated measures general linear model. The 633 participants with only problematic alcohol use (alcohol RCT), 55% women and 45% men, showed initial AUDIT scores suggesting alcohol dependence. The 202 problematic drug users (drug RCT), 45% women and 55% men, had initial AUDIT scores suggesting alcohol dependence and DUDIT scores suggesting harmful use of drugs. Participants from both trials showed low health outcome measures at baseline, with drug RCT participants generally lower in health compared to alcohol RCT participants. At the 12-month follow-up, about 35% of participants in both RCTs had reduced their substance use. In comparison to participants with unchanged or increase substance use, those with reduced alcohol use over 12 months reported positive health outcomes in wellbeing, sleep, concentration, energy, social life, sadness and current life meaning; those with reduced drug use reported better sleep, concentration and less sadness. Results were limited by significant attrition, typical to internet-based treatment studies. Our future studies will highlight both treatment- and health-related outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Implementation of alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) is a prevention priority. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System uses a clinical reminder (CR) in the electronic medical record to prompt and document results of screening and trigger a subsequent CR for BI when screening is positive. Although screening rates are over 90%, marked variability in screening quality has been documented. Four researchers observed clinician interactions with CRs during alcohol screening at nine primary care clinics in the northwest US to identify barriers and facilitators to using CRs to implement quality screening. Observers took handwritten notes, which were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively using an a priori coding template adapted during analyses. We observed 58 support staff (25 registered nurses, 26 licensed practical nurses, and seven health technicians) caring for 166 patients. Alcohol screening prompted by the CR was often uncomfortable and of low quality. Clinicians often offered disclaimers prior to screening or made adjustments to how questions were presented, with some citing the sensitive nature of the questions. Verbal screening typically did not include asking questions verbatim. There was substantial variability in methods of conducting screening across clinics, with some using the CR to facilitate in-person screening by interview and others entering patient responses into the CR after completion of a paper-based screen. Although the CR was designed to trigger a subsequent CR for BI when positive, some clinics used paper encounter forms for this. Findings suggest that VA CRs have important limitations as a method of facilitating effective, high-quality alcohol screening. Barriers observed reflect a combination of limitations of CR technology (and the alcohol screening CR specifically), ways the CR was implemented, clinical workflow, complexity of patient needs, and alcohol-related stigma. Future research should address these barriers to effectively implement recommended care.",

A 25-year-old African American woman presented with right lower-quadrant and flank pain, nausea, fever, and dyspareunia three days after unprotected intercourse. The patient had a past history of sexually transmitted infections. An initial alcohol screening was negative for heavy episodic drinking. Physical exam revealed fever, tachycardia, costovertebral angle tenderness, pelvic tenderness, vaginal discharge, and cervical motion tenderness. Urine analysis showed pyuria and bacteriuria. The patient was admitted with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and pyelonephritis. Repeat screening by an SBIRT-trained resident revealed recurrent weekend heavy episodic drinking with unprotected intercourse. The patient was treated with antibiotics and brief intervention. During the intervention, she demonstrated awareness of the link between heavy episodic drinking and PID. She reported high level of importance and readiness to decrease her drinking to prevent recurrences. She improved quickly and was discharged on hospital day three but failed to follow up. This case supports the following findings from the research literature: significant high rates of risky drinking among women, the link between alcohol consumption and high-risk health behaviors, the hesitancy of many women to disclose alcohol misuse, and the importance of linking alcohol misuse identified through brief intervention in primary care with alcohol-related consequences. Routine alcohol screening is indicated for all adult patients, and SBIRT training is an important element of primary-care residency training. Nonjudgmental alcohol screening identified binge drinking in a patient who previously denied it, helped the patient recognize the link between alcohol misuse and hospitalization, and enhanced the patient’s motivation to change. Effective SBIRT in such situations have the potential to prevent recurrent alcohol-related hospitalizations among at-risk drinkers.",

    "abstract": "Injuries constitute a major public health problem. Millions of people are injured each year, and acute drinking is a well-known risk factor for injuries. Research suggests that acknowledgment of alcohol as a factor in an injury enhances willingness to change drinking behavior, possibly because the patient becomes aware of the negative consequences of their drinking. We investigated the prevalence of acute alcohol consumption among injured patients in Sweden and examined the factors associated with motivation to reduce alcohol consumption among these patients. All injured patients aged 18–69 years were given a card by a triage nurse with a request to answer alcohol-related questions on a touch-screen computer. Patients who completed the test received a printout containing personalized feedback on his or her drinking habits as calculated by the computer program from the patient’s answers. Fifteen percent of injured patients were categorized as acute drinkers, and of these, 64% reported that their injury was connected with alcohol. There were significant differences for sociodemographic and drinking characteristics between acute drinkers and nonacute drinkers. Acute drinkers were categorized as risky drinkers to a much higher extent than nonacute drinkers. Acute drinkers had considerably higher average weekly alcohol consumption and engaged far more frequently in heavy episodic drinking than nonacute drinkers. Acute drinkers were motivated to reduce their alcohol intake to a greater extent than nonacute drinkers: 51% were in the action, preparation, and contemplation stages compared with 19% of nonacute drinkers. Results indicate that acute drinkers had considerably more detrimental alcohol consumption than nonacute drinkers and were more motivated to reduce their drinking than nonacute drinkers.",

Community pharmacies attract a large and diverse range of people to a health-care environment that is promising for BI research. Work undertaken by this research group included semi-structured interviews with pharmacy service users to obtain their views on potential pharmacy BI; a five-month cohort study with 134 participants conducted in 28 pharmacies that assessed feasibility issues; and focus-group studies with “active” and “less active” pharmacists to identify barriers and facilitators of implementing BI. Pharmacy service users were positive about participating in BI, which was found to be feasible. Training and staff support were identified as important factors influencing service delivery, and there are preliminary indications of effectiveness including an impressive reduction in overall consumption among those who completed follow-up. Pharmacist motivation has been evaluated with the Short Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Perception Questionnaire (SAAPPQ), and role adequacy and work satisfaction improved among “active” pharmacists. These outcomes are currently being used to inform the development of a randomized controlled trial of BI delivered in the pharmacy, due to begin soon. It is hoped that findings from the trial will contribute to current knowledge and promote interest in the area. Unanswered questions include how pharmacy BI can be implemented in routine practice if trial results demonstrate effectiveness, and how SBI fits with the needs of a changing pharmacy profession.",

This study aimed at analyzing BZD misuse among women, with an emphasis on the search for subsidies for brief intervention (BI). Thirty-three women aged 18–60 years (median, 46 years) with a history of misuse of BZD in the year comprised the sample. They received a semi-structured interview, the content of which was transcribed and submitted for analysis using NVivo software. Most participants reported a much longer period of BZD use (median of seven years) than is recommended but with medical follow-up and prescription. The reasons reported for use were to reduce anxiety, fight insomnia, or to “escape from problems.” About half of women (n = 14) reported that they intended to continue using BZD despite the possibility of dependence and/or other risks. One-third of the sample reported using strategies to quit and/or reduce use, including praying, practicing relaxation, and receiving psychotherapy. Our results suggest that, although they had medical follow-up, many BZD users in this study had a low perception of the risks of BZD and continued using them for years with no concern for dependence. In such patients, BI might be useful to raise awareness of the BZD risks and the benefits of alternative strategies to cope with anxiety or insomnia.",

Data from a questionnaire-based survey performed on a representative sample of 2221 persons (51.4% were men) aged 18 to 39 (average age, 29.9) were used for the analysis. The validated Czech version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test was employed to define low- and high-risk drinkers. Respondents scoring >16 were deemed to be high-risk consumers. To measure alcohol expectancies, we used a 14-item scale: seven items represented pleasurable and socially positive expectancies, and the seven remaining items represented negative expectancies. The low-risk group scored significantly lower on positive as well as negative expectancies (19.1 compared with 23.2, t = -11.8; p < 0.001, and 11.4 compared with 17.5, t = -18.3; p < 0.001). The results were equally significant for males and females. The mean score for positive expectancies was much higher compared with the mean score on negative expectancies, indicating alcohol consumption is associated with positive expectancies much more than with negative. According to these results, high-risk drinkers exceed low-risk drinkers in both negative and positive expectancies, suggesting that cognitive representation of alcohol is different in high-risk consumers. When providing brief advice to high-risk drinkers, these differences in alcohol-related expectancies should be addressed.",

For the GP- and pharmacy-delivered SBI, decision models and scenario analysis assessed outcomes and costs in the 10 experimental communities of the trial. For the ED-delivered SBI, a randomized controlled trial design was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of mailed personalized feedback. For both the GP- and pharmacy-delivered SBI, the most cost-effective outcome was to increase screening alone: GPs and pharmacies screening all patients achieved an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AUD $197 and AUD $29, respectively, per risky drinker who reduced drinking. The ED-based SBI resulted in a reduction of 2.6 fewer drinks per week at an average cost of $5.55 per patient and an ICER of $2.13 per one standard drink reduction in average weekly consumption. In addition to cost-effectiveness, the AARC community approach provided the opportunity to analyze the effect of SBI on community level outcomes. Currently, 19% of risky drinkers in a community visit a GP and reduce their drinking, which would increase to 36% if all patients got SBI. Similarly, 23% of risky drinkers in a community visit a pharmacy and reduce their drinking, which would increase to 34% if they all got SBI. Although our results confirm SBI is cost-effective, the impact at the community level is unclear: if all GPs and pharmacists delivered SBI to all their risky drinking patients, only 34-36% would reduce their drinking. A trial that assessed the impact of SBI delivered in multiple settings simultaneously on community level indicators of alcohol harm would move the field toward demonstrating the cost benefit, as well as cost-effectiveness, of SBI.",

The design was a cross-sectional alcometer street survey. Data from 1997 respondents (mean age, 26.96 years; 61.86% male) were used in analyses. Data were collected from five night-time economies characterized by excessive alcohol use. Prospective respondents were randomly approached to complete a short survey, including perceptions of the long-term health effects of their current state of intoxication and their self-perceived drunkenness, with those who consented to participate providing a breathalyzer score. Alcometer score was ranked according to other respondents and by discrete reference groups. Those whose breath alcohol content ranked high in their reference group reported that they felt more drunk and that they perceived the negative health consequences of alcohol misuse as more likely. No effect of breath score or social norm was observed. Our results generalize fundamental psychophysical theory and indicate that attitudes are spontaneous and relative to context; and that manipulating the social context in which alcohol is served—for example, by including more sober individuals—would increase perceived intoxication and increase the perceived likelihood of alcohol-related poor health. This is contrary to assumptions indicating attitudes are stable and informed by perceived social norms or absolute levels of consumption.",

    "abstract": "University students in Sweden routinely receive e-mail– based alcohol interventions sent from student health services. Earlier trials have examined the effectiveness of these interventions in simple parallel group designs. This exploratory study was undertaken in preparation for a larger trial. Using a dismantling design, we randomized 5227 students to either routine assessment and feedback (Group 1); assessment-only without feedback (Group 2); or no assessment and no feedback (Group 3). At baseline, all participants were blinded to study participation, with no contact made with Group 3. At 6-8 week follow-up, students were approached to participate in a cross-sectional alcohol study. Overall, 45% (N = 2336) of those targeted for study completed follow-up. Attrition was similar in Groups 1 and 2 (approximately 41% retained) but somewhat lower in Group 3 (52% retained). Intention-to-treat analyses among all participants, regardless of their baseline drinking status, revealed no differences between groups. Per-protocol analyses of Groups 1 and 2 among those who accepted the e-mail intervention offer (approximately 37%) and who screened positive for risky drinking (62% followup rate) suggested small beneficial effects on weekly consumption attributable to feedback. E-mail offer of alcohol intervention alone in an unselected population of university students was not found to be beneficial, although between-group differences in attrition prevent strong conclusions. Small benefits may follow actual uptake of e-mailed feedback intervention. The design of the main trial was positively influenced by data from this unusually large pilot study.",

    "abstract": "General practitioners (GPs) often cite inadequate training as one of the reasons for not performing early identification and brief intervention (EIBI) for substance use disorders. Providing “more” medical education on EIBI is an important step for policy makers. From an economic and public health point of view, it is important to know how much is “more.” We summarize the results of a one-day continuing medical education (CME) training of Italian GPs on EIBI, unhealthy lifestyles, and cardiovascular risk. An eight-hour CME interdisciplinary training day was offered to the 1040 GPs in the Udine region of Italy. Lessons by expert GPs, cardiologists, and public health professionals were offered on CV risk reduction by provision of EIBI and brief motivational interviewing to address unhealthy lifestyles. Video role-playing presentations were shown and discussed in the afternoon session. Of the 774 GPs who attended the training day, 563 (72.7%) completed a pre- and post-training questionnaire assessing EIBI general knowledge, self-efficacy, and professional satisfaction level using 11-point (0-10) scales. We analyzed the correlation between pre- and post-training self-efficacy on different lifestyles counseling using the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test and the correlation between professional satisfaction level and self-efficacy on lifestyles counseling using the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient. After training, a significant improvement in general knowledge and self efficacy were demonstrated by most of the participants (p = 0.0001) . Pre- and post-training differences were all significant, but GPs showed less self-efficacy on addressing alcohol use (p = 0.5902) compared with addressing tobacco use (p = 0.8961), weight control (p = 0.3008), and physical activity (p = 0.4054). Self-efficacy was linked to professional satisfaction level. One day of interdisciplinary CME training on EIBI and cardiovascular risk reduction increased GPs’ self-efficacy, but professional satisfaction needs to also be addressed in future training programs. Practical implementation should follow a short time after training so as not to reduce the effect.",

Participants were divided into two groups: successful outliers (those who regularly administered the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT] to patients) and unsuccessful outliers (those who did not regularly administer the AUDIT). We used semistructured interviews and thematic content analysis to identify personal SDBI facilitators (good relationship with the community, satisfaction and commitment to work, feeling prepared to visit patients, feeling comfortable talking about alcohol) and organizational SDBI facilitators (planning, activities organization, and involvement of a multidisciplinary team). We concluded that the factors facilitating successful SDBI implementation were related to both participants’ personal characteristics and organizational factors.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between preventive practices in relation to risky use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs and perceived OC among 149 professionals in Brazilian primary health-care (PHC) settings. The OC was measured by a scale involving the following factors: leadership, professional development, team spirit, relationship with the community, workplace safety, strategy, and reward. Prevention activities were measured by counting the number of drug and alcohol screenings conducted using the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) and the number of brief interventions (BIs) held within three months after theoretical training. We also used scales to examine self-efficacy and confidence in performing screening and BI and a structured questionnaire about drug-use prevention activities. To verify the proximity of the variables, we used multiple correspondence analysis and correlation analysis with 95% confidence intervals. The teams that had higher scores on OC also had the best performances in prevention activities for drug use. The OC factors most associated with performance of preventive activities were professional development and relationship with the community. The dimensions of leadership and rewards also showed significant positive associations. Findings suggest that a more positive OC can facilitate drug-use prevention activities in PHC settings.",

This research aims to translate medical SBI into behavioral health-care practice in US work settings, where millions of workers might be reached annually. The primary objectives of this pilot study are to assess the feasibility of adapting medical SBI practices to telephonic employee assistance programs (EAPs); to develop practical training, implementation, and quality/fidelity monitoring protocols and processes that can be integrated into existing practices; to assess the impact of implementing systematic routine alcohol SBI on key performance measures (rates of screening, alcohol problem identification, treatment initiation); and to assess preliminary outcomes (self-reported alcohol use, mental well-being, and productivity). The multi-site study is being conducted by US EAP providers using pre-test/post-test single-group pre-experimental designs. Screening and brief intervention processes were adapted from the World Health Organization’s alcohol SBI protocol and included systematic screening using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) during clinical intake, BI using motivational interviewing techniques, referral to face-to-face counseling, and telephonic follow-up. Preliminary findings suggest that integration of routine SBI by EAP consultants at intake is not only feasible in a telephonic delivery system but also increases alcohol problem identification to levels found in the general US population; hence, it provides the opportunity for brief motivational counseling for risky drinking. Furthermore, it is clear that when SBI is integrated as part of routine EAP practice, members are willing to answer questions about their alcohol use and participate in follow-up. To date, findings have shown increases in alcohol-problem identification from 400% to 600% when SBI is integrated into routine practice.",

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the cost-effectiveness of tailored mailed feedback on general practitioner (GP) prescribing for alcohol dependence and alcohol-related hospital admissions. General practitioners (N = 115) in 10 communities randomized to the experimental arm of the Alcohol Action in Rural Communities (AARC) project received tailored mailed feedback on their prescribing of acamprosate and naltrexone. Segmented regression analysis examined the impact of the intervention relative to GPs’ prescribing and inpatient hospital admissions for alcohol dependence in those communities. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated to compare costs per additional prescription written and costs per inpatient admission averted. Trend analysis showed GPs significantly increased their prescribing of acamprosate (s = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.35) and significantly decreased their prescribing of naltrexone (s = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.13-0.35). Rates of alcohol-related inpatient admissions for alcohol dependence decreased significantly in the experimental group compared with the control group (s = 0.98; 95% CI, 1.80-0.16). Similar to evidence showing SBI can improve patient outcomes, this study showed mailed tailored feedback to GPs achieved cost-effective increases in their prescribing of acamprosate, with a subsequent and plausibly causal reduction in inpatient hospital admissions for alcohol dependence. Demonstrating the capacity of brief intervention in primary-care settings to reduce demand for tertiary care services appears to be a promising direction for the SBI field. A large-scale RCT of the cost benefit of tailored feedback to GPs appears warranted.",

The Portuguese government’s National Plan to Reduce Alcohol Related Problems includes the development of projects that provide training to health professionals in screening and intervention for alcohol use disorders, particularly for professionals who work in primary care. Primary care professionals are the first level of assistance in Portugal’s national health care system and have ongoing contact with people who use primary health centers. High consumption of alcohol is responsible for a number off physical, psychological, and social problems. The high prevalence of excessive alcohol consumption and its high economic, social, and health costs justify the implementation of such projects to address alcohol-related problems. Objectives of the national plan include identifying needs specific to primary care settings; designing a training program tailored to primary care center needs; defining priorities (e.g., providing services and building infrastructure to optimize hazardous and harmful alcohol use management and providing monitoring to ensure adherence to protocols that consider clinical referral procedures and specific indicators); ensuring both undergraduate and postgraduate training; and identifying organizational and political components critical to the successful implementation and dissemination of alcohol screening and brief intervention in primary care. We show preliminary results of the plan and the importance of addressing alcohol-relate problems at the national and international level to facilitate sharing of knowledge and standardizing of evidence-based practice between countries.",

Publications selected were primary or secondary research of SBIRT in ED settings for alcohol or drug use. Publications were separated into three categories: outcomes, costs, and implementation. Outcome literature excluded secondary research, focusing on primary analyses of SBIRT in ED settings that targeted drug and alcohol use. Twenty-six articles were found and grouped into interventions for alcohol or drugs. Some studies appeared in both groups. Of the 25 alcohol studies, 22 reported significant treatment effects. Of the 10 drug studies, eight reported significant treatment effects. Most studies reported outcome measures as change in alcohol or drug use; others identified treatment attendance or assessment scores as outcome variables. With regard to cost, nine publications outlined cost-savings, including reduced recurrent substance-related ED visits and reduced cost per patient. With regard to implementation, 22 publications discussed SBIRT implementation in EDs. Research suggests that physicians and mid-level providers can efficiently conduct SBIRT and address substance use disorders among ED patients. Although SBIRT has been successfully integrated into many busy EDs, it is a challenge requiring ongoing commitment, planning, and support from ED staff. Despite barriers to SBIRT implementation, EDs that have implemented SBIRT show cost savings and improved ability to diagnose and treat alcohol- and drug-related problems. Future research should explore the effect of SBIRT in EDs for drug-related problems as well as its long-term sustained implementation.",

Delivery of BI adds up to 15 minutes to the primary consultation, constituting a significant barrier to implementation by PHC professionals. A review of trials of computer-based interventions (on- and off-line) for college drinkers found them to be more effective than no treatment and as effective as alternative treatment approaches. The recent large-scale trial of the online Down Your Drink (DYD) intervention found potentially significant reductions in alcohol consumption and risky drinking behavior, but there was evidence that users of the DYD website made only relatively limited use of it (average, 2.33 visits). Facilitated access by professionals in PHC settings could not only increase patient engagement but also address the know/do” gap in PHC by removing the need for providers to deliver a time-consuming face-to-face intervention. The University College of London eHealth team has undertaken an exploratory qualitative study using interviews and participant observation of facilitated access to DYD at PHC practices in two London localities (Kingston and Islington) to assess acceptability and uptake. Preliminary results suggest good levels of acceptability and uptake of facilitated access to DYD. Findings are presented together with proposals for a noninferiority international randomized controlled trial to determine whether there is similarity in outcomes in patients identified as risky drinkers who receive facilitated access to an alcohol reduction website and those who receive conventional face-to-face BIs. Research is needed to determine whether PHC-based facilitated access to alcohol reduction websites can reduce the know/do gap in primary-care alcohol screening and intervention.",

We adapted the World Health Organization’ sA lcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) to ACASI format and administered it on touch-screen tablet computers. English- and Spanish-speaking patients were recruited from a large urban primary care clinic. Participants completed the ACASI ASSIST in the waiting area and received a $4.50 transit card. Of 47 eligible patients approached, 35 (74%) agreed to participate. Participants were 57% male with a mean age of 49 years (range 28–72 years, SD = 11). The majority (54%) were foreign born, 50% were Hispanic, and 29% were African American. Twenty-five subjects completed the ASSIST in English, and 10 in Spanish. Thirty participants (86%) screened positive for lifetime use of alcohol, and 18 (51%) for other drugs (excluding tobacco). Twenty-two (63%) had used alcohol and/or other drugs in the past three months, and 13 (37%) had moderate- or high-risk use (6 alcohol; 11 other drugs; 4 both). Mean time to complete the ACASI ASSIST was 5.6 minutes (range, 1.5– 17.2 minutes, SD = 3.2). Responses were 100% complete. All but one participant felt comfortable answering these questions on a computer. Most either preferred the computer to an interviewer (50%) or had no preference (38%). These results indicate that computer-assisted substance use screening may be feasible and acceptable among a culturally diverse primary care patient population.

Unfortunately, most medical school curricula do not adequately address the topic of screening and brief intervention (SBI) for tobacco use, SHS exposure, and/or problematic drinking. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a three-part educational intervention for health-professions schools to address the consequences of SHS exposure and develop SBI skills in medical students. Because information regarding the effects of smoking and SHS can be effectively communicated via self-directed online lectures, we developed an online training module including a videotaped lecture series with accompanying PowerPoint slides. To help students develop diagnostic skills related to SHS and other substance exposure, 10 standardized patient cases were included for instruction and testing. Finally, a clinical-instruction DVD provided examples of how practitioners can implement motivational-interviewing strategies in behavior change counseling related to tobacco use, with or without co-occurring alcohol use. Participants in the educational intervention, compared with controls (no intervention), scored significantly higher on the SHS Competency Exam. In addition, 100% of students who received the intervention reported plans to screen for SHS exposure. This educational intervention may be a valuable addition to medical and health professional school curricula while requiring minimal faculty time and effort.",

    "abstract": "Evidence-based screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) programs focusing on drug and alcohol use have successfully been implemented in a variety of general medical settings. Such programs require adaptations to function effectively in a high-volume hospital emergency department (ED) setting. We describe implementation and training procedures used in the six-site National Institute on Drug Abuse-Clinical Trials Network (NIDA-CTN) Screening, Motivational Assessment, Referral and Treatment (SMART-ED) trial and present lessons learned from the implementation of the study. The discussion is organized around issues of site selection, staff selection, research assistant and interventionist training, site preparation, and data collection. Several implementation components were particularly important in the SMART-ED trial: 1) Site selection—department and ED staff buy-in was central to decisions on which sites were chosen to participate. 2) Staff selection—interventionists/RAs needed to possess both the empathy necessary to deliver a motivational-interviewing intervention and the research knowledge necessary for protocol adherence. 3) Research assistant and interventionist training and ongoing coaching—in-person and webinar trainings ensured that research staff understood and were able to follow protocol procedures and were certified to deliver the intervention and study procedures that required it. Ongoing coaching based on reviews of the intervention recordings and feedback on compliance with study procedures is successfully preventing drift. 4) Site preparation—prior to beginning the main trial, each site had real-world practice conducting study procedures through standardized patient visits. 5) Data collection—screening data is collected using direct entry into tablet computers to facilitate rapid screening and mobility in the ED setting. There are unique factors associated with effective implementation of SBIRT delivered in the ED. Some of the procedures used in this clinical trial may be useful in the successful implementation of clinical SBIRT programs in EDs.",

However, there have been no controlled studies on the implementation of BI techniques when health professionals were trained by a distance learning (DL) process. In this study, we evaluated the use of SBI by health professionals trained by DL. All participants were invited by email and regular mail to participate in the project. Those who agreed to participate received, by email, a questionnaire about their use of SBI, including questions on the difficulties associated with implementing SBI, screening tools used (e.g., the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT] or the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test [ASSIST]), and whether or not they conducted BIs. All participants answered a similar questionnaire immediately after the end of the course. Considering both questionnaires, only a few participants had problems conducting BI due to lack of support from their work team. Of the 94% of participants who intended to implement BI in their work, 74% did. After the course, most of the participants approached patients to assess their alcohol (72%) or drug (66%) use and out of those, 64.5% applied the AUDIT and 57.5% applied the ASSIST. Most participants (71%) also felt able to perform BI and to develop strategies to reduce substance use (84%); of these, 83% and 80%, respectively, did it. These results show that health professionals trained by DL can apply SBI. A study to evaluate the effectiveness of BI delivered by DL participants is under way.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about optimal screening processes for brief intervention (BI) targeting substances other than alcohol and nicotine. An ongoing multi-site trial conducted through the National Institute on Drug Abuse-Clinical Trials Network (NIDA-CTN) investigates the effectiveness of BI for people who use drugs (with or without alcohol use) presenting to medical emergency departments (EDs). Here we describe the screening procedures and present preliminary data on the screening process and characteristics of participants enrolled in the trial. Following triage, patients are selected through ED tracking logs, and demographic information, triage level, and presenting complaint are recorded. Patients are then invited to complete screening with an instrument including four tobacco screening questions, the three consumption questions of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C), and the 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST). A DAST score of three or more plus past 30-day use of the primary problem substance are required for enrollment. During the first six months of recruitment, a total of 5713 patients were selected for possible screening; 3731 completed screening, and 343 were randomized (6% of all selected). The sample is 64% male with a mean age of 39 (± 12), and is racially and ethnically diverse. Only 2% are college graduates, 9% are married, 10% have full-time jobs, and 79% have household incomes under $15,000. The most common primary drugs of abuse were cannabis (33%, used on an average of 18 out of the past 30 days), cocaine (26%, use on and average of 9 of the past 30 days), street opioids (26%, used on an average of 19 of the past 30 days), prescription opioids (6%, used on an average of 18 of the past 30 days), and methamphetamine (6%, used on an average of 7 of the past 30 days). Six percent of those selected for screening and 9% of those screened were enrolled in the study. Baseline data indicate that the screening procedures identified people with problems in multiple life domains who had heavy use of several types of drugs.",

As part of a US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration resident training grant, we sought to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of initiating screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) in a pediatric residency program. We evaluated the efficacy of a training program for all second- and third-year pediatric and/or medicine/pediatric residents in an adolescent medicine rotation located in an urban teaching hospital. Main outcome measures were pre-/post-training knowledge scores, performance of the Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI) as measured by the BNI adherence scale in pre-/post-training standardized patient encounters (SPE), training satisfaction, and tracking of BNI performance. Thirty-four residents were trained (30 in pediatrics and four in medicine/pediatric programs). The mean age of participants was 28 years (range, 25-35 years); 26 (76%) were women. Fifty percent reported 0-5 hours of didactic training in medical school and residency. Thirty-five percent reported that they never had formal or informal teaching regarding alcohol and drug problems in their residency. There was a significant improvement in knowledge scores pre-/post-training (20.5 versus 23.4, p < 0.001) and a significant improvement in BNI adherence scores during SPE (3.1 versus 8.4, p < 0.001). Residents were very satisfied with their training, reporting a score of 1.6 on a scale of one to five (one = very satisfied, five = very dissatisfied). Integrating an SBIRT curriculum into a pediatric residency program is feasible and effective in increasing residents’ knowledge and skills in performing screening and brief interventions among adolescents and young adults.",

In this study, 878 randomly selected level-I trauma center inpatients were systematically screened for alcohol and drug use problems with blood and urine toxicology laboratory results and self-report questionnaire items. Patients were systematically screened for alcohol use by blood alcohol concentration (BAC) testing and administration of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C). Screening for stimulant use (i.e., amphetamines and cocaine) included urine toxicology testing and single-item self-report. Screening for marijuana use included urine testing and single-item self-report. Screening for prescription and nonprescription opioid use included single-item self-report only. Fifty percent of patients (435/878) screened positive for problem alcohol use. Approximately 20% screened positive for cocaine use, 7.7% for amphetamine use, 7.5% for opioid use, and 37% for marijuana use. Among the 50% of patients who screened positive for problem alcohol use, 61.1% had one or more drug comorbidities. Of all 878 patients in the sample, 166 were seen by the trauma center’s addiction intervention service for mandated alcohol SBI. Of these, 33% were positive for problem alcohol use only, 44% were positive for alcohol and other drug use, 12% were positive for marijuana, stimulants, or opioid use only, and 11% screened negative for both alcohol and drugs. The majority of patients receiving mandated alcohol SBI at a level-I trauma center screened positive for comorbid use of one or more drugs. Clinical SBI research protocols that realistically account for alcohol and drug comorbidity are needed to inform the development of ACS/COT SBI guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Unhealthy alcohol use and HIV risk often co-occur. To intervene on this association, we are conducting a pilot study to determine the feasibility and impact of providing brief alcohol- and sexual-risk reduction counseling with rapid HIV testing in a large urban emergency department (ED). We are recruiting ED patients aged 18-40 years who 1) meet National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism criteria for at-risk drinking, 2) have >1 sexual-risk behavior, 3) have negative or unknown HIV status, and 4) are willing to undergo HIV testing. We are conducting a brief, manual-guided intervention combining an alcohol- and sexual-risk reduction counseling session with rapid HIV testing followed by a booster telephone call at two weeks. At baseline and eight weeks, we assess alcohol consumption with the Timeline Follow-Back for alcohol consumption and a modified HIV Risk Behavior Scale to characterize sexual risk behaviors. Statistical analyses include Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, McNemar test, and two-way ANOVA. Of the 82 participants enrolled to date, 60% are male, the mean age is 25 years, 63% are white, 83% are unmarried, 59% are college-educated, 41% are without primary care, and 79% have an AUDIT score of >8. All tested HIV negative. Among the 62 with follow-up data so far, alcohol consumption decreased with fewer average weekly drinks (25.5 versus 10.4, p < 0.0001) and binge drinking episodes (2.03 versus 0.99, p < 0.0001). This decrease was greater in men than women (p < 0.0002). Post-intervention, participants endorsed increased condom use (median change = 3 points on a 5-point scale, W = 275, p < 0.0001) and decreased episodes of sex while intoxicated (RR = 0.14, p < 0.0001). Mean intervention duration was 44 minutes. Preliminary analyses demonstrate that a brief intervention combining alcohol- and sexual-risk reduction counseling with rapid HIV testing in the ED is feasible and effective for reducing alcohol use and HIV risk behaviors among young unhealthy drinkers.",

    "abstract": "This qualitative study compared social workers’ and their patients’ attitudes toward screening for alcohol-related problems. Existing studies on attitudes toward alcohol screening have largely been quantitative and have typically been conducted in primary-care settings. The aim of this qualitative research was not to make generalizations from sample to population but to analyze plurality of viewpoints with regard to screening. Social workers (n = 14) and their customers (n = 14) were interviewed. All interviewees were asked to comment on the following statement: It is stigmatizing to ask a client, who is not a heavy drinker, about their alcohol consumption. Both social workers and their patients presented a range of positive, reserved, and negative attitudes towards the statement. Participants in both groups justified their agreement with the statement by referring to the assumption that asking about alcohol consumption implies a suspicion of heavy drinking. Social workers also connected this suspicion to a stereotypical view of social work clients and thought their patients would want to avoid such stigmatization. Reserved attitudes of social workers and their patients were justified from the viewpoint that, even if they personally did not perceive asking about alcohol consumption to be stigmatizing, others might think so. Finally, while justifying their negative attitudes towards the statement, both groups considered asking about alcohol consumption to be an integral part of social work. These findings suggest that social workers and their patients have similar attitudes toward the alcohol screening. Further research is warranted.",

The need for specific training standards on EIBI outlined by the Primary Health Care European Project on Alcohol (PHEPA) were the impetus for the Italian national program “Gaining Health” with the purpose of developing, implementing, and disseminating a national EIBI training program adhering to PHEPA standards. National EIBI courses started in 2007 with the first formal “training the trainers” program opened to general practitioners and other professionals involved in primary care. Courses were funded by the Italian Ministry of Health and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers’ Department of Anti-Drug Policies. Since 2007, six formal courses have been conducted at the ISS and at other regional training sites. The last course was offered in May 2011, and data analysis of training effectiveness is now in progress.

A causal chain between therapist motivational interviewing behaviors, subsequent client change talk (CT), and actual behavior change has been postulated. Other researchers have proposed the notion of a working alliance between counselor and client to explain better outcomes. However, these links have never been tested within a single mediation framework. We investigated the articulation of counselor behaviors, CT, working alliance, and six-month alcohol use outcomes (drinks per week at follow-up adjusted for drinks per week at baseline) during BMI with young men using regression analyses. There were no direct links from counselor skills to alcohol outcomes. Some counselors skills predicted more CT (MI-consistent behaviors frequency [p = 0.02] and MI spirit rating [p = 0.04]) as did working alliance (p more ADN > better outcomes). Adding a step in this model, we showed that the percent of MI-consistent behaviors and the MI spirit, empathy, and acceptance ratings predicted better working alliance scores (all p < 0.01). As the final step, we will calculate the mediated effects in these models. We found that MI skills and behaviors predicted a better working alliance, which, in turn, predicted more ADN change talk, which, in turn, predicted better alcohol use outcome. This gives support to previous findings but also highlights the importance of working alliance. Such findings might give precious clues for clinicians by giving an indication of the most determinant elements in BMI.",

An online Delphi study was set up in three rounds starting with open-ended questions on task views among pharmacists, GPs, and mental health professionals in a single Flemish district. Provisional task definitions, barriers, and suggestions were ordered by profession and send to a larger group of potential respondents throughout Flanders. Respondents were asked to rate importance, acceptability, and feasibility. Responses came from GPs, pharmacists, mental health workers, and pediatricians working in mental health or social services. This allowed us to define subsidiarity of task descriptions and communication principles. General practitioners can offer the full screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment approach but are in need of structured support and communication with mental health resources more than other professions. Pharmacists are able to detect cases using structured questioning. Brief advice is merely based on indicating the need for further support. Pediatricians and gynecologists see a role for themselves in performing early identification and brief intervention (EIBI) but not in following up; they tend to refer and do not want structured contacts with mental health resources as support. All respondent groups indicate that clear agreements between disciplines need to be in place locally. Case-related discussions and quick diagnostic and therapeutic advice from mental health professionals are also needed. Improved task definitions and communication allow more uptake of EIBI. Principles of EIBI should be included in continuing professional education. Official endorsement and local health promotion is expected to further increase EIBI effects. Web support is planned as an online stepped-care communication platform.",

An intervention and associated curriculum was developed to train health-care workers to screen all patients and deliver a brief motivational intervention (BMI). A pocket guide and patient handouts were developed as implementation aids. Local beverages were referenced as standardized equivalents of beer, wine, and liquor. Materials were produced in English and prevalent local languages. Ministries of Health in each country adopted the methods as a strategy to reduce risky alcohol consumption and associated HIV infection risk in targeted areas.

The Screening and Intervention Program for Sensible Drinking (SIPS) trial aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different intensities of BI at reducing risky drinking in primary care. Practices were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: a leaflet-only control; five minutes of brief structured advice; or 20 minutes of brief counseling. Practices were asked to recruit at least 31 risk drinkers who received a short assessment followed by BI. Patients were followed up at six and 12 months post-intervention. The primary outcome was the proportion of risky drinkers as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Overall, 3562 patients were assessed for eligibility in 29 practices: 2991 (84%) were eligible; 900 (30%) screened positive for risky drinking; and 752 (83.6%) consented to participate in the trial. At 12 months, 79% patients (n = 598) were available for follow-up. No significant differences in follow-up rates were observed by condition. There was an overall reduction in risky drinking of 16.5% between baseline and 12 months. By condition, the reductions were 17.3% for controls, 12.7% for brief advice, and 19.6% for brief counseling. An adjusted logistic regression model identified baseline AUDIT score and gender as significant predictors of risky drinking at 12 months. Patients with lower baseline scores and women were more likely to be negative for risky drinking at follow-up based on AUDIT score. Brief advice and brief counseling did not produce significantly greater effects in reducing risky drinking than leaflet-only. We discuss these findings in light of the current BI literature.",

    "abstract": "The University of California at Los Angeles Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT) aims to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a primary-care based very brief intervention protocol for reducing risky stimulant use and drug-related harm in low-income, racially diverse primary care patients attending safety-net clinics in the east central Skid Row area of Los Angeles. The QUIT trial emphasizes screening, very brief clinician advice (2-3 minutes), and two telephone drug-use health education sessions versus usual-care in the control group (240 patients per condition). Between February 18 and April 28, 2011, pre-visit screening of adults in the waiting room was conducted using a touch-screen Tablet PC. “At risk” drug use was defined as casual, frequent, or binge use without the physiological or psychological manifestations of dependence (a score of 4 to 26 on the World Health Organization’s Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). A total of 920 adult patients were approached: 89% were 40+ years old; 68% were male; 62% were black, 21% were Latino, and 17% were white. Of patients approached, 706 were excluded due to pregnancy, because it was a nonprimary care visit, or because they refused to participate. Among the 214 who completed the ASSIST, substance use scores were none or low risk in 11% of participants, moderate risk in 42%, and dependence-level in 47%. The number of participants in each score range by substance were, respectively, tobacco 55, 101, and 58; alcohol 62, 98, and 54; cannabis 94, 77, and 43; cocaine 89, 74, and 51; methamphetamine/amphetamine type stimulants 145, 45, and 23; inhalants 185, 20, and 9; sedatives 143, 45, and 26; hallucinogens 174, 30, and 10; and opioids 130, 54, and 30. Participants who were older than 50 years were more likely to use tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine; younger patients were more likely to use amphetamines, inhalants, sedatives, hallucinogens, and opioids. Twenty-seven patients (3% of those approached) met study criteria of past three-month risky stimulant use. Seventy percent were homeless, and 30% were marginally housed. In Skid Row, only 3% of patients qualified for risky stimulant use intervention.",

    "abstract": "Post-discharge support is key to effective treatment for hospitalized smokers. The few hospitals that systematically address tobacco refer smokers via fax to tobacco quitlines, yet few smokers enroll. “Warm handoff” (direct referral by one provider to another provider) is used in some cases of tobacco screening and brief intervention (SBI) to link patients with treatment, but little data exists on process or outcomes. We present pilot outcomes and early implementation data on an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT). Recruitment began in July 1, 2011. The purpose of the trial (Enhancing Quitline Utilization by Inpatients [EQUIP]) is to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of warm handoff versus fax referral for linking hospitalized smokers with tobacco quitlines. The EQUIP trial is a two-arm RCT funded by the National Institutes of Health (trial registration: NCT01305928) in which smokers who wish to quit permanently after discharge are randomized to either fax referral (standard in-hospital intervention with fax-referral for counseling post-discharge) or warm handoff (brief in-hospital intervention and immediate staff call to the state quitline and transfer of the call to the patient’s mobile or bedside hospital phone for enrollment and an initial counseling session). Outcomes, including costs, are assessed at one, six, and 12 months following baseline. We hypothesize that warm handoff will outperform fax referral in terms of enrollment in services, cessation, and cost-effectiveness. This study explores what alcohol and other drug trials have done to strengthen handoffs and the evidence for efficacy; how EQUIP compares with AOD handoffs, and what pitfalls might be expected; and whether tobacco SBI and referral to treatment would or could be incorporated into alcohol and other drug SBI and referral to treatment.",

    "abstract": "Although a large body of research has documented that severe consequences are associated with alcohol use among college students, this may not be the case for all students who consume alcohol. Identifying those variables associated with risk for negative consequences in this population has important public health implications. Mixed findings are available on the relationship between alcohol-related negative consequences and alcohol consumed, depressive symptoms, and use of illicit substances. We examined the relationship between alcohol-related consequences and amount consumed during a typical and a heavy drinking week, cannabis use in the previous 12 months, and depressive symptoms. Participants consisted of a convenience sample of 85 (53.5% females) undergraduate college students (mean age = 19 years) taking part in an on-campus mental-health screening. Participants reported use of alcohol and of other drugs, mental heath symptoms, and negative consequences. Results showed a direct association between alcohol-related negative consequences and total drinks consumed during a typical week (r = 0.41; p < 0.001) and during a heavy drinking week (r = 0.58; p < 0.001). Students with any cannabis use in the previous 12 months reported a significant greater number of alcohol-related negative consequences (t [1, 80] = -2.66; p < 0.01). Alcohol-related negative consequences were not associated with depressive symptoms. In a hierarchical linear regression model including cannabis use, total drinks during a typical week, and total drinks during a heavy drinking week, the latter was the only predictor of alcohol-related negative consequences. The other two variables did not predict any variance over and above the one explained by total drinks during a heavy drinking week. In conclusion, programs aimed at reducing the negative outcomes of alcohol consumption should aim at screening for heavy rather than typical drinking.",

    "abstract": "Over the past five years, trauma-center alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) implementation has advanced considerably. A key catalyst has been the willingness of the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS/COT) to consider policy guidelines based on empiric investigation. We summarized data on and policy discussions pertaining to the college’s current implementation of the alcohol SBI mandate at US trauma centers. Trauma programs at all US level-I trauma centers (N = 204) were contacted and asked to complete a survey regarding alcohol SBI practices in the year before the ACS/COT requirement became standard practice. A questionnaire that assessed alcohol screening methods and intervention capacity was developed to evaluate premandate SBI practices. Of the 204 level-1 trauma centers contacted, 148 (73%) responded to the survey. Over 70% of responding centers routinely employed laboratory tests to screen patients for alcohol; 39% routinely used a screening questionnaire or standardized screening instrument. Patients who screen positive for an alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive a formal alcohol consult or an informal alcohol discussion with a staff member approximately 25% of the time. We conclude that there was marked variability across level-I trauma centers in the percentage of patients screened for AUD and in the nature and extent of intervention among those who screened positive before implementation of the ACS/COT alcohol SBI mandate. In the wake of the mandate, orchestrated research and policy efforts could systematically implement and evaluate training in the delivery of evidence-based SBI as well as training in the development of trauma-center organizational capacity for the sustained delivery of SBI.",

The authors who published most frequently on BI efficacy were Carey KB,” Fleming MF,” Floyd RL,” “Martens MP,” Nilsen P,” Saitz R, and Shang G,” with two publications each. The quantitative approach was prevalent among studies, with randomized controlled trials the most frequent (35). The BIs were conducted mainly in clinical and health-services settings (18). However, interventions were also conducted via the Internet (5) and by telephone (4). Regarding the study population, 22 articles addressed BI for men and women, 14 addressed BI for women, and 9 addressed BI for pregnant The efficacy of BI in the reduction of consumption was confirmed in most research, but some studies showed a reduction only in men.

    "abstract": "While the efficacy of screening and brief intervention (SBI) for problematic alcohol use has been proven in various outpatient settings, findings from inpatient studies remain inconclusive. Some research has shown that inpatient treatment leads to elevated motivation to change problem behaviors. This study analyzed changes in drinking behavior among untreated patients with problematic alcohol use recruited proactively in general practice (GP) settings and in two general hospitals. We compared problem drinkers randomly assigned to an untreated control group from a study of GP patients (n = 99) with inpatients recruited at the surgical and internal wards of the two general hospitals (n = 173). In both studies, all incoming patients aged 18-64 years were screened for alcohol use. Patients meeting criteria for at-risk drinking according to British Medical Association guidelines (>20-30 g alcohol per day) or meeting criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence according to DSM-IV criteria were included. Both samples received a non-alcohol–specific brochure on healthy living and were re-assessed 12 months later (response rate, 90.4%). The hospitalized patients were older, more often male, had less schooling, and showed elevated readiness to change at baseline compared with GP patients. The groups did not differ concerning alcohol-related diagnoses. At 12-month follow-up, significantly more GH patients than GP patients reported abstinence or low-risk drinking (50.0% versus 26.1%, p < 0.001). Recruitment setting (GH versus GP) remained a significant predictor for nonproblematic drinking or abstinence even after controlling for baseline differences between groups. Findings suggest that natural processes of change from problematic alcohol use are elevated after non-alcohol–related inpatient treatment. This might, in part, explain the lack of findings supporting BI for problematic alcohol use in inpatient settings.",

    "abstract": "Questions have been raised in screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) research concerning the role the assessment process may serve in contributing to behavior change. However, most SBIRT trials have not been designed in a way to disaggregate the impact of assessment versus the combined effect of assessment plus brief intervention. We describe the design of the National Institute on Drug Abuse-Clinical Trials Network (NIDA-CTN) Screening, Motivational Assessment, Referral, and Treatment (SMART-ED) trial, with a focus on the screening and assessment instruments used and three treatment conditions to which participants have been randomized: minimal screen only (MSO); screening, assessment, and referral to treatment (if indicated) (SAR); or screening, assessment, and referral plus a brief intervention (BI) with two telephone follow-up booster calls (BI-B). The screening and assessment measures are relatively brief in the context of a clinical trial to minimize participant burden and assessment reactivity. The design allows a comparison of the impact of assessment as an independent factor over and above minimal screening (SAR versus MSO) as well as an evaluation of the incremental benefit of the BI with booster calls over and above assessment without BI (BI-B versus SAR). Assessment reactivity is of concern, especially in BI studies, because it may reduce effect size and conceal therapeutic benefit. On the other hand, if found to contribute independently to behavioral change, assessments could be designed to maximize the therapeutic benefit they provide. The design used in the SMART-ED trial will allow an evaluation of the independent and incremental contribution of the assessment process to behavior change.",

    "abstract": "For over a decade, a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have found that internet-based brief intervention (IBBI) can reduce consumption in people with alcohol use disorders. As technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, IBBI has the potential to offer highly tailored feedback to different populations. First launched in 2005, CheckYourDrinking.net (CYD), version 3.0, is a free anonymous IBBI that has undergone several randomized controlled trials and technical upgrades. Apart from the free online version, the technology has been modified for several specific populations such as college students, youth aged 13-17, public health institutions, and for use as a screening tool in private clinics. To illustrate how algorithms can be modified, we are examining data from 21,640 Canadian men (59%) and women (41%) who anonymously accessed CheckYourDrinking.net version 2.0 from April 8, 2008, to July 28, 2010. Through describing CYD’s development methodology and research-based maturation process, we illustrate how IBBI can be tailored for special populations. Technical limitations and other barriers are discussed. The purpose of this presentation is to share knowledge of the resources required for the ongoing technical enhancement and maintenance of IBBIs. With the use of sophisticated algorithms, IBBIs hold the exciting potential of providing highly tailored feedback to not only people with problem drinking but for those with specific unhealthy drinking patterns (i.e., heavy episodic drinking) and for special populations across languages and cultures. In order to fully understand the potential of IBBI technology, further research is required.",

Despite this, routine alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) within general dental practice remains uncommon. This review of the literature examined the background and evidence base for undertaking alcohol SBI in general dental practice, including the rationale behind it and the range of issues related to it. Questions addressed include why alcohol consumption is of relevance to dental professionals; what policy context exists for the role of prevention and health promotion in dentistry; what screening tools are appropriate for use within a general dental practice; what evidence of efficacy is there for alcohol SBI in general dental practice; and what barriers and facilitators must be considered before alcohol SBI can be successfully implemented in this setting. We conclude that alcohol SBI in general dental practice, delivered as part of a multidimensional approach to tackling risky alcohol consumption, offer significant potential to improve the oral and general health of the population.",

Such websites need to target individuals with unhealthy alcohol use and to be known of and visited to be efficacious. We developed a French-language website offering general information on alcohol use, screening, and brief intervention with tailored feedback. To increase the site’s visibility, we conducted a media campaign in the French part of Switzerland. We assessed the characteristics and satisfaction of web visitors using a screening questionnaire and satisfaction survey built into the site. To qualify the impact of the media campaign, we recorded the geographical provenance of the users. Between July 15, 2011 (the official site release date) and January 31, 2011, 15,633 unique visitors accessed the website, and 84% (13,160) completed the screening and received tailored feedback. General information pages represented 25% of the 28,986 visited pages. Most users were men (67%); the mean age was 36.3 years (standard deviation, 13.6 years). Thirty-four percent of men and 38% of women reported risky alcohol use (> 14 drinks per week for men, >7 for women), and 54% of men and 30% of women reported heavy episodic drinking (> 6 drinks in a single occasion) at least once a month. Of the 56% people with unhealthy alcohol use, 66% envisioned change after receiving the feedback. Among those who completed the satisfaction survey (n = 1001), 88% said the website provided useful information. Most visits (83%) came from Switzerland. People may visit websites providing information and tailored feedback on alcohol use on their own, but a media campaign appear to greatly increase the number of visitors. Our website targets the appropriate users, since unhealthy alcohol use was overrepresented among visitors compared with the general population, and satisfaction was high. Most at-risk drinkers envisioned change after their visit.",

This study took advantage of a naturalistic situation where a screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) program had been implemented in a large hospital emergency department in Seattle, WA. A subset of patients who received BI was interviewed six months following the intervention about current alcohol/drug use. A search of the patients’ medical records allowed us to divide the sample into those with and without evidence of mental illness and to analyze their self-reported drug use. Although unadjusted means indicated a possible decrease in illegal drug use between baseline and follow-up interviews for both groups, there was no significant difference between mentally ill and non-mentally ill subgroups with regard to self-reported changes in substance use. Changes in self-reported alcohol and binge drinking days showed a similar pattern. Although the lack of a comparison group prevented us from attributing change in reported use to BI alone, these data suggest the impact of BI on subsequent drug and alcohol use may not differ among patients with mental-health diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Smoking and resulting health problems disproportionately impact low socioeconomic status (SES) individuals. Building resilience presents an approach to 'closing the gap'. Mindfulness-based interventions and setting realistic goals are preferred in low socioeconomic communities. We aim to test if these interventions, delivered online and consolidated with peer support offered via ex-smokers, are successful in promoting smoking cessation and resilience. Our conceptualisation of resilience encompasses the inner capacity/skills and external resources (e.g., social support) which smokers utilise to bounce back from adversity. We include a process evaluation of barriers/facilitators to interventions and cost-effectiveness analysis (from health system perspective). We plan a four-arm parallel 12-month RCT with a 6-month follow-up to test the efficacy of three group-based interventions each followed by peer support. Arm 1: mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavioural therapy; Arm 2: mindfulness training; Arm 3: setting realistic goals; Arm 4: active control group directed to quit services. All interventions will be administered online. Participants are adult smokers in Australia (N = 812) who have an average weekly household income less than $457AUD or receive welfare benefits. Group-based interventions will occur over 6 months, followed by 6 months of forum-based peer support. self-reported 14-day period prevalence of smoking abstinence at 6 months, with remote biochemical verification of saliva cotinine (< 30 ng/mL). Secondary outcomes include: internal resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-25); external resilience (ENRICHD social support tool); quality adjusted life years (EQ-5D-5L); self-efficacy for smoking abstinence (Smoking-Abstinence Self-Efficacy Questionnaire); motivation to quit smoking (Biener and Abrams Contemplation Ladder); nicotine dependence (Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependency); equanimity (Equanimity Scale-16); stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10); goal assessment/attainment (Problems and Goals Assessment Scale). This study is the first to compare resilience interventions for low SES smokers which have been identified by them as acceptable. Our various repeated measures and process evaluation will facilitate exploration of mechanisms of impact. We intervene within the novel framework of the Psychosocial Model of Resilience, applying a promising paradigm to address a critical and inequitable public health problem.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Smokeless tobacco (SLT) products are gaining popularity around the globe, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Among these products, Nass (aka Naswar) is popular among the Turkmen ethnicity in Iran. Although several studies reported nicotine dependence (ND) among SLT users, psychometric instruments have never been utilized to specifically measure ND among Nass users. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ) among Turkmen Nass users. Methods A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted in June-December 2018 among 411 Turkmen adults who currently (past 30 days) used Nass. Two bilinguals (Persian English) individuals translated and back-translated the FTQ-SLT, which maintained both the questionnaire's accuracy and cultural sensitivity. Construct validity was assessed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results The mean age and standard deviation for initiating Nass were 22.5 ± 11.81 years. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis indicated a single-factor solution with 8-items that captured several important ND components. Using Nass frequently, soon after waking, when sick, and experiencing a craving were some of the main components. Subgroups comparison revealed that higher scores occurred among those who were married, had Nass user(s) in their immediate family, and consumed bulk form of Turkmen Nass directly without using a tissue. Conclusion Our findings show that the FTQ- SLT is a fairly reliable and valid scale to measure ND among Turkmen Nass users and warrants further testing to accommodate cross-cultural differences in other populations.",

Our research objective was to develop a better understanding of the factors that influence health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) among this population during the high-risk transition period from incarceration to community. Few studies have assessed health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) among individuals with OUD who are involved with the criminal-legal system, let alone over the period directly surrounding release from incarceration. Methods Secondary longitudinal analysis of data from a clinical trial where participants were randomized 1:1 to pre-release extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) + referral to community XR-NTX, vs. referral only. We conducted individual, multivariable regressions of EQ-5D domains (mobility, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression; usual activities and self-care were excluded due to insufficient variation in scores), and the overall preference/utility score. HRQoL data were subset to timepoints immediately before release (baseline) and 12 weeks post-release; treatment groups were collapsed across condition. Multiple imputation by chained equations was conducted to handle missing 3-month data in the dependent variables and covariates, ad hoc. Results Greater severity in the psychiatric composite score was associated with substantially lower HRQoL, across all measures, following release from incarceration. Greater severity in the medical composite score was associated with lower pain/discomfort-related HRQoL. Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of ensuring individuals with OUD are linked not only to MOUD, but also treatment for their comorbid conditions upon release from incarceration.",

We conducted qualitative interviews as part of a larger study in 2019-2020. The interview assessed patterns of substance use (including methamphetamine), benefits and drawbacks of methamphetamine use, and interest in a medication to treat MUD. Analysis used an inductive thematic approach, guided by three primary questions: (1) would participants be interested in taking a potential medication for MUD?; (2) what effects would they would like from such a medication?; and (3) what would their ideal treatment route and schedule be (e.g. daily pill, monthly injection)?. We interviewed 20 people reporting methamphetamine use in the past 3 months (10 from Reno, Nevada, USA and 10 from Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, USA). Seven used exclusively methamphetamine, while thirteen used other substances in addition to methamphetamine. Most were enthusiastic about a potential medication to treat MUD. Of those who were not interested (n = 5), all indicated no current concerns about their methamphetamine use. Perceived functional benefits of methamphetamine use (i.e., energy, counteracting opioid sedation, and improved social and emotional wellbeing) informed preferences for a replacement-type medication that would confer the same benefits while mitigating drawbacks (e.g., psychosis, hallucinations, withdrawal). Opinions on preferred dosing varied, with some preferring longer acting medications for convenience, while others preferred daily dosing that would align with existing routines. Participants were excited about a potential for a medication to treat MUD. Their preferences were informed by the functional role of methamphetamine in their lives and a desire to maintain the stimulant effects while mitigating harms of illicit methamphetamine. Treatment outcomes that emphasize functioning and wellbeing, rather than abstinence, should be explored.",

This study aimed to examine the temporal association between time from last treatment contact to suicide and comorbid mental disorders in patients with substance use disorders. Methods This study is a historical prospective case series using nationwide registry data. It included 946 individuals registered the year before suicide with a substance use disorder (F10-F19) in Norway's specialized health services for treating substance use and mental health disorders between 2010 and 2020. The outcome was the number of weeks from the last contact with services to suicide. The exposure was comorbid mental disorders divided into 'no comorbid mental disorder’; ‘psychosis or bipolar disorders’ (F20−F31), ‘depressive or anxiety disorders' (F32−F49); and 'personality disorders' (F60-F69). Covariates included gender, age, last diagnosed substance use disorder, registered deliberate self-harm last year, and the number of in- and outpatient contacts the previous year. Results The number of weeks from last service contact to suicide differed ( p = &lt; 0.001) between patients with no comorbid mental disorders (Median = 7; IQR 2–23), psychosis or bipolar disorders (Median = 2; IQR = 1–7), depressive or anxiety disorders (Median = 3; IQR = 1–11) and personality disorders (Median = 1; IQR = 1–5.5). Significantly decreased adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) were found for psychosis or bipolar disorders [aIRR = 0.67 (95% CI 0.53–0.85)] and personality disorders [aIRR = 0.56 (0.42–0.77)] compared to no comorbid mental disorder when adjusted for individual characteristics and service contact. For depressive and anxiety disorders compared to no comorbid mental disorder, the association was significant when adjusted for individual characteristics [aIRR = 0.55 (0.46–0.66)]. Conclusions While patients with substance use disorders generally died by suicide a short time after contact with services, patients with comorbid mental disorders died an even shorter time after such contact and significantly shorter than patients without such comorbidities.",

Our team developed a Spanish language version of the TAPS Tool that supports provider- and self-administration screening using a mobile/web-based platform, the TAPS Electronic Spanish Platform (TAPS-ESP). Methods This article describes the protocol and rationale for a study to validate the TAPS-ESP in a sample of Spanish-speaking primary care patients recruited from a network of community-based clinics in Texas (target N = 1,000). The TAPS-ESP will be validated against established substance use disorder diagnostic measures, alternative screening tools, and substance use biomarkers. The study will subsequently examine barriers and facilitators to screening with the TAPS-ESP from a provider workflow perspective using qualitative interviews with providers. Discussion Validating a Spanish language version of the TAPS Tool could expand access to evidence-based, linguistically accurate, and culturally relevant substance use screening and brief assessment for an underserved health disparity population.

Lynch et al. found that all categories of substance use disorders were associated with increased risk of suicide. We present the Suicide Safer Care project as one model to address this need. The Suicide Safer Care project contains a training model that provides education on basic principles of suicide prevention and skills for integration into practice. Data collected from pre- and post-training surveys of participants demonstrates the success of the training in increasing knowledge and confidence in identification and treatment of patients at risk of suicide. Utilizing training techniques such as Suicide Safer Care and combining it with the findings from Lynch et al. providers in primary care settings and emergency departments can optimize the number of patients they identify with suicide risk, impacting the number of patients who receive treatment and the number of potential lives saved.",

    "abstract": "Poster Presentation AbstractsP1 A multi-stakeholder approach to developing outcome measures to evaluate an initiative promoting management of unhealthy alcohol use in primary careShana Sandberg1, Tracy McPherson1*, Adrienne Call1, Jenna T. Sirkin1, Alexandria Figueroa1, Marian James2, Brent Sandmeyer2 1NORC at the University of Chicago, Chicago, USA; 2 U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Bethesda, USACorrespondence: Tracy McPherson (Mcpherson-tracy@norc.org)Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P1Background: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, excessive alcohol use had been the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States, affecting nearly a third of adults but remaining largely unaddressed in primary care (PC) settings. In 2019 the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) launched an initiative to fund six grantees to disseminate evidence-based approaches managing UAU in 70 PC practices. Given the lack of national consensus on outcome measures to assess rates of screening, brief intervention, and medication assisted therapy (MAT), we took a multi-stakeholder approach to develop a novel measure set for the cross-grantee evaluation of this initiative. We describe strategies used in the initiative's first year to develop measures for use in the mixed-methods evaluation.Methods: We designed a collaborative approach to systematically gather crucial input on measure concepts, relevance, and feasibility from the six grantees and AHRQ. Three primary strategies defined our approach: individual meetings between independent evaluator and each grantee, a cross-grantee evaluation workgroup to facilitate engagement, and regular calls between the evaluator and AHRQ to clarify aims and resolve issues. Overall, we worked to maintain rigor and cross-grantee comparability while remaining agile and flexible in our design.Results: Collectively, we developed six novel outcome measures for PC practices to document and evaluate the target population and number and percent of those receiving screening, brief intervention, MAT initiation, and specialty care referrals. These measures are intentionally designed to accommodate variation in screening tools, grantee interventions, and documentation and reporting (e.g., paper chart abstraction, electronic health records). We highlight overall strengths and limitations of these measures and the degree of alignment with other measures currently in use.Conclusions: Seeking input from diverse stakeholders can aid in developing outcome measures to evaluate an initiative designed to promote management of UAU in PC.P2 A psychosocial program for the prevention and mitigation of the consumption of psychoactive substances in young people of ColombiaSlyn T. R. Vega, Liliana M. G. Vega, Marco A. M. Gómez*Psicologa, Universidad Nacional Abierta y a Distancia, Bogotá, ColombiaCorrespondence: Marco A. M. Gómez (marco.marquez@unad.edu.co)Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P2Background: The consumption of psychoactive substances (SPA) is a worldwide public health problem, and with repercussions at the individual, family, educational, social and community levels, which is why the general objective of this program is to prevent and mitigate the consumption of psychoactive substances based on the guidelines of psychosocial programs, specifically those focused on life skills, with a comprehensive and complex understanding of the problem, and which is based on the development of certain skills in childhood and Adolescence allow to face in a positive and adequate way the different difficulties of daily life and avoid the interest with the consumption of SPA.Methods: To achieve this, the development of an observational-descriptive study with a phase of psychosocial intervention begins. The population was 755 secondary school students from the sixth to eleventh grades of the Agustina Ferro educational institution in the municipality of Ocaña, the sample was randomly made up of 255 students who were administered an online questionnaire on rapid identification of consumption of SPA.Results and conclusions: According to the results, the study group is chosen, a ninth grade course, made up of 36 students who develop a life skills test before starting the implementation of the program, based on the results it is designed a SPA consumption prevention and mitigation program, based on the life skills training model, and with an implementation methodology through participatory and interactive teaching strategies, seeking its results to prevent new cases of consumption SPA, strengthen life skills in students that translate into a better coexistence school and family giants, a more critical and conscious attitude of decisions and behaviors, from a double action, through direct work with students as the object of said intervention, with teachers and parents as preventive agents in their closest environment.P3 Barriers and facilitators of the use of alcohol screening and brief intervention within the Accident and Emergency and Urgent Care Centre healthcare environment: a systematic reviewChristopher Moat1, Professor Newbury-Birch1, Katie Haighton2, Maggie Leese1 1Teesside University, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom; 2Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United KingdomAddiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P3Background: Alcohol screening and brief interventions are routinely adopted in primary care environments with the aim of reducing alcohol consumption and related harm in hazardous drinkers who are not currently receiving help. This review aimed to investigate the barriers and facilitators in relation to alcohol screening and brief interventions for adult service users presenting to Accident and Emergency and Urgent Care centres. The doctoral research which this systematic review contributes to focuses on exploring the feasibility of carrying out alcohol screening and brief interventions by Paramedics, in the pre-hospital environment. NHS Ambulance service staff do not currently undertake any screening activities with this patient group. Methods: A search of medical and social sciences databases was undertaken to locate qualitative studies using methods such as semi-structured and in-depth interviews, focus groups and ethnographical work, to explore the barriers and facilitators for adults in the general population. Surveys which included open-ended questions were also included. Thematic analysis of the transcripts was undertaken and recommendations for a future pilot study were made.Results: Findings from 39 results aligned with and reinforced known barriers and facilitators. Analysis of the data distinctively considered a variety of roles and settings of the professional staff undertaking alcohol screening and brief interventions and acknowledged the thoughts and feelings of service users. Themes which emerged included, training needs and knowledge of staff, staff attitudes, patient issues, lack of time, issues with referral and the location where the screening or intervention is undertaken. Conclusions: This study has identified barriers and facilitators to successful implementation in a variety of clinical settings, adequate training, resources, and staff motivation were identified as both barriers and facilitators to effective implementation. Further research, through my doctoral research will evaluate the feasibility of carrying out alcohol screening and brief interventions by Paramedics, in the pre-hospital environment.P4 Brief intervention for older adults (BIO) delivered by non-specialist community health workers to reduce at-risk drinking in primary careTassiane C. S. de Paula, Camila Chagas, Cleusa P. FerriUniversidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP), São Paulo, BrazilAddiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P4Background: Evidence suggests that brief interventions are effective in reducing alcohol consumption among the adult population. However, the effectiveness of these interventions when delivered specifically to older adults and by community health workers (non-specialists) in a primary health care setting still is unknown.Methods: The Brief Intervention for Older Adults (BIO) is a 10 to 15 min intervention designed to change behavior and includes seven components: 1) feedback; 2) identification; 3) information; 4) reflection; 5) normative; 6) construction; 7) booklet and to be delivered by community health workers (CHW). For this it was developed: a customized teaching manual on the intervention; a script that guides the CHW; and an educational booklet addressing alcohol and aging information. This intervention was designed to be delivered in primary care settings in the Brazilian public health system and to be conducted in an everyday environment. The BIO is a simple, fast, low-cost intervention that could be translated and easily applied by non-specialist professionals working in low-resource settings worldwide. The clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the BIO was approved by Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry—REBEC (nº RBR-8rcxkk) and the protocol of this controlled trial to test the effectiveness of BIO was written and will be published soon. This clinical trial had been started in January 2020, but it was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, in this period it was carried out an initial recruitment considered a pilot study, which allowed to assess the feasibility and acceptance by the participants with positive results. This complete trial will be carried out after the pandemic, when possible.P5 Brief intervention in Brazilian workers with an adult AUDIT score of 8 or higherSandra R. C. Ayub1*, Raul A. Martins2 1FATEC Catanduva—Centro Paula Souza, Catanduva, Brazil; 2Universidade Estadual Paulista, São Paulo, BrazilCorrespondence: Sandra R. C. Ayub (sandrachalela@gmail.com)Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P5Background: Alcohol abuse is considered a public health problem, being the third cause of absenteeism in the workplace and the eighth cause of disability benefits granted by Social Security in Brazil. The worker performance and the work environment are affected by the consequences of alcohol abuse, causing a decrease in productivity and quality of work, absences, changes in personal habits, bad working relationships, work accidents, among others. The objective of this research was to identify the pattern of alcohol consumption in workers and then apply the Brief Intervention (BI) in those who presented a pattern of excessive drinking, aiming at withdrawal or at least a decrease in consumption.Methods: This research was exploratory, descriptive, quasi-experimental, and carried out in 4 stages: initial screening, interview, BI, and follow-up sessions. In the first stage, 230 workers took part, from whom 34 percent reached an AUDIT score of eight or higher (classified as positive). In the second stage, these results were confirmed with the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) and the workers were divided into: experimental group (43 workers) and control group (28 workers). In the third stage, the BI was applied only to the experimental group. In the fourth stage, AUDIT was applied after 3 and also 6 months of BI to both groups for comparison.Results: The results showed that BI was effective with workers, both in the first and second follow-up sessions. In all follow-up sessions, the data showed that the experimental group decreased their amount of drinking. The control group also showed a decrease in the intake of alcoholic drinks, but not in the same proportion as the experimental group.Conclusion: We believe these results can contribute to the implementation of programs aimed at the employees' health using the BI, which is easy to apply, quick, inexpensive and effective.P6 Cannabis use, comorbidities, and polypharmacy among older adults receiving care in a large urban healthcare system 2019–2020Marjan Javanbakht1, Sae Takada2, Whitney Akabike3, Lillian Gelberg3*, Steven Shoptaw3 1UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; 2 UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Los Angeles, CA; 3 UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Department of Family Medicine, Los Angeles, CACorrespondence: Lillian Gelberg (lgelberg@mednet.ucla.edu)Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P6Background: The aim is to describe the prevalence of cannabis use and co-use with prescription medications among patients ≥ 50 years of age attending primary care (PC) clinics in a large urban healthcare system in Los Angeles, CA, after legalization of recreational cannabis use.Methods: We used electronic health record (EHR) data from over 60 PC clinics of patients' ≥ 50 years of age who had an annual physical examination between July 2019 and May 2020. Cannabis use was assessed by clinical staff at the time of the visit. We also used EHR data on clinical characteristics including current prescriptions and comorbidities (ICD-10).Results: 42,455 patients were included: median age 63 years (range: 50–101), 56% female; 66% identified as white/Caucasian, 10% Asian, 9% Hispanic/Latinx, and 5% black/African American. Current cannabis use was reported by 7.6% and higher than tobacco use (4.0%). Prevalence of cannabis use was higher among those with a current diagnosis of respiratory (9.1% vs. 7.6%; p value = 0.03) or psychiatric condition (9.7% vs. 7.3%; p value < 0.01). Cannabis use was also higher among those prescribed inhaled short-acting beta agonists/anticholinergics (8.6% vs. 7.5%; p value < 0.01), benzodiazepines (10.9% vs. 7.3%; p value < 0.01), antiepileptics (13.6% vs. 7.6%), opioids (12.0% vs. 7.5%; p value < 0.01), or muscle relaxants (10.3% vs. 7.5%; p value < 0.01). After adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index), those prescribed medications for psychiatric (adjusted OR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.4–1.7), respiratory (adjusted OR = 1.2; 95% CI 1.1–1.3), or neurologic conditions (adjusted OR = 1.4; 95% CI 1.2–1.5) had increased odds of cannabis use compared to those not prescribed these medications.Conclusion: The prevalence of cannabis use among older adults in PC is high and higher among those prescribed medications which may interact with cannabis. Older patients may benefit from routine PC screening for cannabis use and brief advice regarding cannabis use and other prescription medications.P7 Correlation between therapist´s competencies and change factors in usersKaren I. M. Williams*, Violeta F. RomeroUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico, MexicoCorrespondence: Karen I. M. Williams (5karenmontoyaw@gmail.com)Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P7Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the implementation of brief counseling competencies in addictions by advisers on factors of change in the consumption behavior of the participants attended.Methods: The research included the assessment of adviser´s competencies through direct observation and completion of the Behavioral Assessment Checklist of skills and attitudes, as well as the assessment of motivation, risk perception, stage of change, goal attainment, and levels of general and specific self-efficacy of the participants through self-reporting, The Brief Situational Confidence Questionnaire, and The General Self-Efficacy Scale.Results: The results obtained showed in general an increase in the values of the variables related with the change in the participants with the passage of the intervention sessions. Most of the findings pointed to positive and statistically significant correlations between the implementation of brief counseling competencies by the advisers and the levels of change factors of the participants: (total of competencies and general self-efficacy r = 0.450, p = 0.050, general skills and risk perception r = 0.567, p = 0.011, total of attitudes and general self-efficacy r = 0.513; p = 0.025).Conclusions: These results suggest evidence of the relationship between the health professional's competencies and the effectiveness of brief counseling.P8 Efficacy of brief intervention for hazardous and harmful alcohol use in patients with mood disorders: a randomized controlled trialAnkit Sinha, Adarsh Kohli, Debasish Basu, Abhishek GhoshDepartment of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Examination and Research, Chandigarh, IndiaAddiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P8Background: Alcohol use disorders and mood disorders are highly co-morbid and individuals are at increased risk of treatment non-compliance and relapse of alcohol use as well as mood episode. Screening and treating alcohol problem is hence very important.Methods: The sample consisted of 84 participants from outpatient of the Department of Psychiatry, PGIMER, Chandigarh, who had hazardous or harmful drinking with Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score of 8 to 19, and an additional diagnosis of mood disorder. Permuted block randomization was used for treatment allocation, with an allocation ratio of 1:1. In addition to usual outpatient care, Intervention group received a brief intervention of 15–20 min and the Control group received general advice only. Outcome was assessed 3 months after the intervention with self-rated Hindi version of the AUDIT and Readiness To Change Questionnaire (RCQ).Results: There was a significant decrease in the mean AUDIT score at the end of follow up in the Intervention group (p = 0.001). Time had a significant effect on the mean AUDIT score (p = 0.005). The change in the AUDIT score remained significant even in the Group X Time interaction (p = 0.001). The effect size was 0.140. A significant difference in the total number of drinking days (Z = − 2.889, p = 0.004), the total number of drinks per drinking day (Z = −2.496, p = 0.013) and the total number of heavy drinking days were observed in the Intervention group (Z = − 2.714, p = 0.007). The mean action score at the end of follow up was significantly more among the Intervention group compared to the Control group (p = 0.032).Conclusions: The present study showed that Brief Intervention is acceptable and feasible in psychiatric out-patient. Future studies should be done in a larger sample, from multiple centres, in both men and women with longer duration and in other psychiatric disorder along with the alcohol issues.P9 Integrating Mobile Phone Technology with a Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) to Prevent Substance Use Dependence during the COVID-19 PandemicQuynh Vo1*, Natalie Martinez1, Stephanie Sumstine1, Efren Aguilar2, Whitney Akabike2, Dallas Swendeman1, Lillian Gelberg2 1Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, USA; 2Department of Family Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, USACorrespondence: Quynh Vo (quynhtvo@mednet.ucla.edu)Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P9Background: The uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has seen over 13% of Americans reporting starting or increasing use of illicit substances as a coping mechanism. The Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT) screening and brief intervention (SBI) reduced risky drug use among low-income primary care clinics patients over 3 months.Methods: A new SBI trial, QUIT-Mobile, augments the QUIT intervention by adding mobile phone self-monitoring, weekly automated feedback messages, and dashboards to support telephone coach monitoring of patients' self-monitoring data during coaching sessions. Reduced in-person clinic capacities due to the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced clinic waiting room times led to expansion of telehealth services, which required the QUIT-Mobile team to adapt from in-person screening in clinic waiting rooms to online clinic visit pre-screening and remote patient recruitment, enrollment and assessment. Patients will be randomized into three groups: QUIT-Mobile, Standard-QUIT, and usual care. All participants will receive brief advice from their Primary Care Provider, a video doctor, and health education resources. Patients in the QUIT or QUIT-Mobile arm will be assigned a health coach to monitor patient responses to questionnaires and lead telephone coaching sessions that use motivational interviewing techniques. The QUIT-Mobile arm will receive self-monitoring text-message surveys on a biweekly basis for 6 weeks and on a weekly basis from 6 weeks to 12 months following the brief intervention. Surveys consist of 10 questions regarding drug and alcohol use and cravings, and quality of life. Automated feedback text-messages will use positive reinforcement hypothesized to enhance and sustain the impacts the physician brief advise and telephone health coaching. Participants' experiences will be assessed at 3, 6, and 12-month follow-ups. We hypothesize that those in the QUIT-Mobile group will experience the greatest reduction in drug use.P10 Implementing brief intervention in a primary care unit for problems relating to alcohol consumption and other drugsAngela M. Abreu*, Riany MR Brites, Marcia P. César, Juliana R. Dias, Larissa R. Mattos, Débora S. Dias, Angela M. Barros, Reginaldo F. GuimarãesFederal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilCorrespondence: Angela M. Abreu (angelabreu@globo.com)Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P10Background: The consumption of alcohol and other drugs is a problem that presents itself to societies around the world and health professionals are not always trained to deal with it, in an appropriate way with the user. The World Health Organization has recommended the application of Brief Interventions, which have shown their effectiveness in this context, in order to reduce problematic substances consumption, especially in Primary Care. Objective: to describe the socio-demographic profile of the users registered at the Service and the adherence to the consultation, by using the Brief Intervention technique.Methods: This is a descriptive research, which brings practical contributions to attend the implementation of the Brief Intervention in a Primary Care Unit, for patients with Problems Related to Alcohol and Other Drugs, in a University Hospital, in Rio de Janeiro / Brazil, applying ASSIST and AUDIT. The sample consisted of 35 patients seen between March and September 2019, based on descriptive statistics with simple frequencies, performed in Excel. It was considered as adherence, patients over three consecutive consultations.Results: In the sample profile there was a higher frequency for males 82.9%, singles 46.0%, age group 40 to 50 years 37.1%, basic education 48.4%, and incomes between 1 to 2 minimum wages 48.4%. Substances used with a higher prevalence in the last three months were alcohol 26.0%, cocaine 23.0%, tobacco 16.0%. Adherence to consultations was 65.7%.Conclusions: The profile is of a population with predominance of males, vulnerable, with low education and income, who use psychoactive substances. There was a good adhesion to the consultation using the protocol of the Brief Intervention. The implementation of a protocol based on Brief Intervention became the guideline for all care in the Service. The study is in progress at the moment.P11 Implementing screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for drug use in FQHC primary care clinics in the COVID-19 eraLillian Gelberg1*, Geoffrey Curran2, Stephanie Sumstine3, Whitney Akabike1, Efren Aguilar1, Natalie Martinez3, Quynh Vo3, Dallas Swendeman3 1Department of Family Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, USA; 2Departments of Pharmacy Practice and Psychiatry, University of Arkansas Medical Sciences, Arkansas, USA; 3Department of Psychiatry, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, USACorrespondence: Lillian Gelberg (lgelberg@mednet.ucla.edu)Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P11Background: The Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT)-Mobile study is a NIDA-funded Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation SBIRT aimed at reducing moderate risk drug use in primary care patients in Los Angeles and includes a 12-month follow-up to reflect a model for implementation where patients will be re-screened routinely in annual visits. The study team deployed implementation methods at the formative stages of the study to inform how the intervention might need to be adapted for optimal uptake and sustainability in primary care clinics during the COVID-19 era, especially with telehealth visits.Methods: Weekly Community Advisory Board (CAB) meetings are held with clinic partners. The CAB works collaboratively to adapt the full QUIT-Mobile protocol for telehealth and implementation. Researchers used thematic content analysis of team meeting notes using Dedoose to code for quality improvement, early clues of what QUIT-Mobile investigators and clinicians think about the protocol and how the team is adapting SBIRT for telehealth.Results: Preliminary results include: 1) patients to self-administer computerized drug use screening to become part of the clinic's mandated pre-visit clinic screeners; 2) implementation implications of offering Zoom due to telehealth reimbursement currently only for telephone visits for FQHCs; 3) planning for a Medical Assistant to \"hand\" PCPs the Clinician Brief Advice Script and Intervention Plan, and exploring cost implications; 4) building in reimbursable screeners to make SUD screening scalable for clinic implementation; and 5) navigating validity of mail-based urine drug screening (UDS).Conclusion: Findings from this analysis show the challenges inherent in shifting procedures to telehealth for patient visits, health education sessions, and mail-based UDS for risky drug users, while navigating clinic challenges during COVID-19. If effective, this study will be integrated into routine primary care as part of behavioral health efforts following recommendations of the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity Act.P12 Patients undergoing treatment for tuberculosis, users of psychoactive substances, who underwent a Brief Intervention from the perspective of adherence to treatmentSonia S. D. E. Santo1*, Angela M. Abreu2, Luciana F. Portela3 1Municipal Hospital Raphael De Paula Souza, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 2Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Fundação Osvaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilCorrespondence: Sonia S. D. E. Santo (sucessonia@gmail.com)Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2022,17(Suppl 1): P12Background: The consumption of psychoactive substances by tuberculosis patients results in a public health problem nowadays. The increase in morbidity and mortality, due to tuberculosis and the consumption of psychoactive substances, has a negative impact on the health of society. The objectives are to identify the profile and pattern of consumption of psychoactive substances in tuberculosis patients in the Primary Health Care Unit; to analyze adherence to the treatment of these patients who use psychoactive substances; to carry out the Brief Intervention in these users from the perspective of adherence to the treatment of tuberculosis.Methods: Sectional study, carried out in Primary Care units in the modality of the Family Health Strategy in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in 114 tuberculosis patients, using ASSIST. All patients undergoing tuberculosis treatment were included in the sample. The exposure variable was the consumption of psychoactive substances and the outcome of treatment adherence. The analyzes were treated in the SPSS program, based on chi-square and Fisher's tests, with a value of p ≤ 0.05 being considered.Results: The sample showed the majority of men (71.1%). The mean age was 39.8 years, skin color: 42.1% brown, followed by 31.6% black. They needed to receive a brief intervention for tobacco 33.3%, alcoholic drinks 16.7% cocaine/crack 13.2%. Need to refer for treatment regarding tobacco use 7.9%, followed by 5.3% for alcoholic beverages. Regarding adherence to treatment, there was a prevalence of males (85.0%), forty years of age or older (87.5%), medium/higher education (84.8%), married (86.8%), white (20%), family income up to 1 minimum wage (84.2%).Conclusion: These results demonstrate the importance of a brief intervention in tuberculosis patients who use psychoactive substances, as a care protocol, in order to direct a greater adherence to treatment, in a population with a vulnerable profile.P13 Risk perception towards exposure to second-hand smoke from tobacco among antenatal clinic attendees in Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities in Calabar, NigeriaUchechi C.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic and consequent public health response may have undermined key responses to the protracted drug poisoning crisis, including reduced access to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) among people with opioid use disorder. Our study objectives were to estimate the prevalence of and identify factors associated with inability to contact OAT prescribers when in need among people on OAT in a Canadian setting during the dual public health crises. Methods Survey data were collected from three prospective cohort studies of community-recruited people who use drugs between July and November 2020, in Vancouver, Canada. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential factors associated with inability to contact OAT prescribers among patients who accessed OAT in the past 6 months. Results Among 448 respondents who reported accessing OAT in the past 6 months, including 231 (54.9%) men, 85 (19.0%) reported having been unable to contact OAT prescribers when needed, whereas 268 (59.8%) reported being able to talk to their prescriber when needed, and 95 (21.2%) reported that they did not want to talk to their medication prescriber in the previous 6 months. Among those who reported inability to contact prescribers, 45 (53.6%) reported that their overall ability to contact prescribers decreased since the start of the pandemic. In multivariable analyses, factors independently associated with inability to talk to OAT prescribers included: chronic pain (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.82; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.02, 3.27), moderate to severe symptoms of depression or anxiety (AOR = 4.74; 95% CI 2.30, 9.76), inability to access health/social services (AOR = 2.66; 95% CI 1.41, 5.02), and inability to self-isolate or socially distance most or all of the time (AOR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.10, 4.14). Conclusions Overall, approximately one fifth of the sample reported inability to contact their OAT prescribers when needed, and those people were more likely to have co-occurring vulnerabilities (i.e., co-morbidities, inability to access health/social services) and higher vulnerability to COVID-19. Interventions are needed to ensure optimal access to OAT and mitigate the deepening health inequities resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the escalating drug poisoning crisis.",
