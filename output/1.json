    "abstract": "Membranes prepared from layers of graphene oxide (GO) offer substantial advantages over conventional materials for water treatment (e.g. greater flux), but the stability of GO membranes in water has not been achieved until now. In this study the behavior of GO membranes prepared with different quantities and species of cations has been investigated to establish the feasibility of their application in water treatment. A range of cation-modified GO membranes were prepared and exposed to aqueous solutions containing specific chemical constituents. In pure water, unmodified and Na-modified GO membranes were highly unstable, while GO membranes modified with multivalent cations were stable provided there were sufficient quantities of cations present; their relative capability to achieve GO stability was as follows: Al3+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+. It is believed that the mechanism of cross-linking, and membrane stability, is via metal-carboxylate chelates and cation-graphite surface interactions (cation-π interaction), and that the latter appears to increase with increasing cation valency. The instability of cation (Ca or Al)-modified GO membranes by NaCl solutions during permeation occurred as Na+ exchanged with the incorporated multivalent cations, but a high content of Al3+ in the GO membrane impeded Al3+/Na+ exchange and thus retained membrane stability. In solutions containing biopolymers representative of surface waters or seawater (protein and polysaccharide solutions), Ca-GO membranes (even with high Ca2+ content) were not stable, while Al-GO membranes were stable if the Al3+ content was sufficiently high; Al-formed membranes also had a greater flux than Ca-GO membranes.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of graphene's electrical transport properties due to processing with the polymer polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and heat are examined in this study. The use of stencil (shadow mask) lithography enables fabrication of graphene devices without the usage of polymers, chemicals or heat, allowing us to measure the evolution of the electrical transport properties during individual processing steps from the initial as-exfoliated to the PMMA-processed graphene. Heating generally promotes the conformation of graphene to SiO2 and is found to play a major role for the electrical properties of graphene while PMMA residues are found to be surprisingly benign. In accordance with this picture, graphene devices with initially high carrier mobility tend to suffer a decrease in carrier mobility, while in contrast an improvement is observed for low carrier mobility devices. We explain this by noting that flakes conforming poorly to the substrate will have a higher carrier mobility which will however be reduced as heat treatment enhance the conformation. We finally show the electrical properties of graphene to be reversible upon heat treatments in air up to 200°C.",

Due to the atomically thin nature of two-dimensional (2D) materials, surface adsorption of gas molecules can effectively modulate the band alignment at the junction interface, making the device a highly sensitive detector for chemical adsorptions. Compared to sensors made of homogeneous nanomaterials, the hetero-junction demonstrates considerably lower detection limit and higher sensitivity toward nitrogen dioxide. Kelvin probe force microscopy and finite element simulations have provided experimental and theoretical explanations for the enhanced performance, proving that chemical adsorption can induce significant changes in band alignment and carrier transport behaviors. The study demonstrates the potential of van der Waals hetero-junction as a new platform for sensing applications, and provides more insights into the interaction between gaseous molecules and 2D hetero-structures.",

Consequently, enhancement strategies can introduce significant advances to these atomically thick materials and devices. Here we demonstrate enhanced absorption and photoluminescence generation from MoS2 monolayers coupled with a planar nanocavity. This nanocavity consists of an alumina nanolayer spacer sandwiched between monolayer MoS2 and an aluminum reflector, and can strongly enhance the light–matter interaction within the MoS2, increasing the exclusive absorption of monolayer MoS2 to nearly 70% at a wavelength of 450 nm. The nanocavity also modifies the spontaneous emission rate, providing an additional design freedom to control the interaction between light and 2D materials.",

However, current TMDs synthesis by chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy is in an early stage of development, where much of the understanding of the process-property relationships is highly empirical. In this work, we use a kinetic Monte Carlo coupled with first principles calculations to study one specific case of the deposition of monolayer WSe2 on graphene, which can be expanded to the entire TMD family. Monolayer WSe2 domains are investigated as a function of incident flux, temperature and precursor ratio. The quality of the grown WSe2 domains is analyzed by the stoichiometry and defect density. A phase diagram of domain morphology is developed in the space of flux and the precursor stoichiometry, in which the triangular compact, fractal and dendritic domains are identified. The phase diagram has inspired a new synthesis strategy for large TMD domains with improved quality.",

    "abstract": "An increasing demand for nonvolatile memory has driven extensive research on resistive switching memory because it uses simple structures with high density, fast switching speed, and low power consumption. To improve the storage density, the application of multilevel cells is among the most promising solutions, including three-dimensional cross-point array architectures. Two-dimensional nanomaterials have several advantages as resistive switching media, including flexibility, low cost, and simple fabrication processes. However, few reports exist on multilevel nonvolatile memory and its switching mechanism. We herein present a multilevel resistive switching memory based on graphene oxide (GO) and MoS2 fabricated by a simple spin-coating process. Metallic 1T-MoS2 nanosheets, chemically exfoliated by Li intercalation, were successfully embedded between two GO layers as charge-trapping sites. The resulting stacks of GO/MoS2/GO exhibited excellent nonvolatile memory performance with at least four resistance states, >102 endurance cycles, and >104 s retention time. Furthermore, the charge transport mechanism was systematically investigated through the analysis of low-frequency 1/f noise in various resistance states, which could be modulated by the input voltage bias in the negative differential resistance region. Accordingly, we propose a strategy to achieve multilevel nonvolatile memory in which the stacked layers of two-dimensional nanosheets are utilized as resistive and charge-storage materials.",

    "abstract": "Graphene-based materials (GBMs) have ignited a revolution in material science and technology, with electronic, optical and mechanical properties that are of relevant interest for a wide range of applications. To support the development of these enabling technologies, a global research effort has been invested to assess their hazard and biocompatibility. Different production methods have however generated a diverse collection of GBMs with different physicochemical properties, leading to a variety of biological outcomes that are still not fully understood. To better understand the biological interactions of GBMs with biological systems and allow the design of safer materials, a thorough physicochemical characterisation is therefore highly recommended. The aim of the present work was to produce a blueprint for the synthesis and characterisation of non-pyrogenic graphene oxide (GO) flakes with three different controlled lateral dimensions, which could be further used for either hazard assessment or biomedical proof-of-concept studies. A battery of techniques used to characterise the physicochemical properties of the GO samples included atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transformed infra-red spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The combination of these different techniques confirmed that only the lateral dimension varied among the GO materials produced, without significant change in any other of their fundamental physicochemical properties, such as the thickness or surface chemistry. The proposed systematic approach in GO batch production for biology will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of the material properties that govern their interactions with biological systems and offer a blueprint towards standardisation of biologically relevant 2D materials.",

We also observe spontaneous delamination of hBN films from the substrate when immersed in a water bath and attribute this to be due to relaxation of compressive stress in the films, which was further corroborated using Raman spectroscopy. Carbon is identified as a major impurity which gets incorporated as boron carbide under FM growth and results in large sub-bandgap fluorescence in the range of 1.77–2.25 eV. Overall, hBN films deposited using the FM scheme at low growth rate (~2–3 nm h−1) exhibited the best characteristics in the present study, which will be suitable for applications such as van der Waals epitaxy and 2D hetero-structure devices.",

In this work we show that previous models describing high-shear exfoliation of graphene apply to MoS2 and WS2. However, we find the minimum shear rate required to exfoliate MoS2 and WS2 to be ~3 × 104 s−1, somewhat higher than the value for graphene. We also demonstrate the scalability of shear exfoliation of WS2. By measuring and then optimising the scaling parameters, shear exfoliation of WS2 is shown to be capable of reaching concentrations of 1.82 g l−1 in 6 h and demonstrating a maximum production rate of 0.95 g h−1.",

    "abstract": "The idea of combining different two-dimensional (2D) crystals in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) has led to a new paradigm for band structure engineering with atomic precision. Due to the weak interlayer couplings, the band structures of the individual 2D crystals are largely preserved upon formation of the heterostructure. However, regardless of the details of the interlayer hybridisation, the size of the 2D crystal band gaps are always reduced due to the enhanced dielectric screening provided by the surrounding layers. The effect can be significant (on the order of electron volts) but its precise magnitude is non-trivial to predict because of the non-local nature of the screening in quasi-2D crystals. Moreover, the effect is not captured by effective single-particle methods such as density functional theory. Here we present an efficient and general method for calculating the band gap renormalization of a 2D material embedded in an arbitrary vdWH. The method evaluates the change in the GW self-energy of the 2D material from the change in the screened Coulomb interaction. The latter is obtained using the quantum-electrostatic heterostructure (QEH) model. We benchmark the GΔW method against full first-principles GW calculations and use it to unravel the importance of screening-induced band structure renormalisation in various vdWHs. A main result is the observation that the size of the band gap reduction of a given 2D material when inserted into a heterostructure scales inversely with the polarisability of the 2D material. Our work demonstrates that dielectric engineering via van der Waals heterostructuring represents a promising strategy for tailoring the band structure of 2D materials.",

    "abstract": "Clean hydrogen split from water by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is significant for sustainability, environmental emissions, and energy security. So far, it is still a big challenge to develop highly efficient noble metal-free electrocatalysts with comparable HER efficiency to platinum-based catalysts, which are mainly hindered by the intrinsic electrocatalytic property and particularly the reasonable nanostructure design of the electrocatalyst. Here we report a newly-designed three-dimensional hierarchical MoSe2 nanoarchitecture (3D-MoSe2) with outstanding HER performance. The 3D-MoSe2 is grown by chemical vapor deposition method with using perylene-3, 4, 9, 10-tetracarboxylic acid tetrapotassium salt as a seeding promoter. The as-grown 3D-MoSe2 nanoarchitecture is highly crystalline and constructed with curly few-layered vertical nanosheets onto the horizontal layer, which has much larger (~12 times) electrochemically active area and much smaller (only 2%) charge transfer resistance compared to conventional horizontal MoSe2 layer. With these advantages, the Tafel slope of 3D-MoSe2 can be as small as 47.3 mV/dev, which is the smallest record ever reported for pure MoSe2, even for pure two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) catalysts. Furthermore, when 3D-MoSe2 is grown on the multiwall carbon nanotube film, its Tafel slope can be further reduced down to 32.5 mV/dec, which is close to the theoretical limit (29 mV/dec) of HER, and comparable to platinum-based electrocatalysts, making it promising as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.",

Controlled growth of large-scale and high-quality TMDC nanostructures is highly desirable but remains challenging. In the present work, large-scale monolayer, bilayer and few-layer MoSe2 films have been controllably synthesized by ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD). Hydrogen flow rate, growth temperature as well as selenium–metal flux ratio have been systematically investigated, which were demonstrated to play a key role in the synthesis of MoSe2 nanostructures. We have also reported the successful growth of MoSe2 nanoribbons with controlled width and length on diverse substrates by APCVD with the assistance of sodium chloride and corresponding growth mechanism was proposed. Our findings highlight the prospects for the controlled growth of novel 1D and 2D TMDC nanostructures for nanoelectronic devices and the development of mixed-dimensional heterostructures.",

Current microelectrode technologies for recording electrical activity, however, evidence important shortcomings, e.g. challenging high density integration. Solution-gated field-effect transistors (SGFETs), on the other hand, could overcome these shortcomings if a suitable transistor material were available. Graphene is particularly attractive due to its biocompatibility, chemical stability, flexibility, low intrinsic electronic noise and high charge carrier mobilities. Here, we report on the use of an array of flexible graphene SGFETs for recording spontaneous slow waves, as well as visually evoked and also pre-epileptic activity in vivo in rats. The flexible array of graphene SGFETs allows mapping brain electrical activity with excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), suggesting that this technology could lay the foundation for a future generation of in vivo recording implants.",

    "abstract": "Grain boundaries, inevitably present in chemical vapor deposited graphene, are expected to have considerable impact on the development of graphene-based hybrid materials with tailored material properties. We demonstrate here the critical role of polycrystallinity on the chemical functionalization of graphene comparing ozone-induced oxidation with remote plasma hydrogenation. We show that graphene oxidation and hydrogenation occur in two consecutive stages upon increasing defect density: an initial step in which surface-bound functional groups are generated, followed by the creation of vacancies. Remarkably, we find that hydrogenation yields homogeneously distributed defects while ozone-induced defects are preferentially accumulated at the grain boundaries eventually provoking local cracking of the structure. Supported by quantum simulations, our experimental findings reveal distinct electronic transport regimes depending on the density and distribution of induced defects on the polycrystalline graphene films. Our findings highlight the key role played by grain boundaries during graphene functionalization, and at the same time provide a novel perspective to tailor the properties of polycrystalline graphene.",

In agreement with recent study reported by G. Froehlicher et al, (2015 $Nano$ $Lett.$ 15 6481) we observe a complex structure of the out-of-plane vibrational modes (A$_{1g}$/A$^{'}_{1}$), which can be explained in terms of interlayer interactions between single atomic planes of MoTe$_{2}$. In the case of low-energy shear and breathing modes of rigid interlayer vibrations it is shown that their energy evolution with the number of layers can be well reproduced within a linear chain model with only the nearest neighbor interaction taken into account. Based on this model the corresponding in-plane and out-of-plane force constants are determined. We also show that the Raman scattering in MoTe$_{2}$ measured using 514.5 nm (2.41 eV) laser light excitation results in much simpler spectra. We argue that the rich structure of the out-of-plane vibrational modes observed in Raman scattering spectra excited with the use of 632.8 nm laser light results from its resonance with the electronic transition at the M or K points of the MoTe$_{2}$ first Brillouin zone.",

Our calculations show that: (1) edge states appear in the band gap in all kinds of MPQDs regardless of their shapes and edge configurations due to the anisotropic electron hopping in monolayer phosphorene (MLP). The charge density of any edge state is only localized in specific edges of a MPQD, which is distinct from that in graphene quantum dots; (2) the magnetic levels of MPQDs exhibit a Hofstadter-butterfly spectrum and approach the Landau levels of MLP as the magnetic field increases. A 'flat band' appears in the magneto-energy spectrum which is totally different from that of MLP; (3) the electronic and optical properties can be tuned by the dot size, the types of boundary edges and the external magnetic field.",

Scalable and controllable powder vapor transport (PVT) methods have been developed to synthesize 2D MoS2 with controllable morphologies (i.e. horizontal and vertical), yet the growth mechanism for the transition from horizontal to vertical orientation is not clearly understood. Here, we combined experimental and numerical modeling studies to investigate the key growth parameters that govern the morphology of 2D materials. The transition from vertical to horizontal growth is achieved by controlling the magnitude and distribution of the precursor concentration by placing the substrate at different orientations and locations relative to the source. We have also shown that the density of as-grown nanostructures can be controlled by the local precursor-containing gas flow rate. This study demonstrates the possibility for engineering the morphology of 2D materials by controlling the concentration of precursors and flow profiles, and provides a new path for controllable growth of 2D TMDs for various applications.",

    "abstract": "The two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper type perovskites have attracted intensive interest for their great environmental stability and various potential optoelectronic applications. Fundamental understanding of the photophysical and electronic properties of the 2D perovskites with pure single phase is essential for improving the performance of the optoelectronic devices and designing devices with new architectures. Investigating the optical and electronic properties of these materials with pure single phase is required to obtain pure single phase 2D perovskites. Here, we report on an alternative approach to fabricate (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 microplates with pure single n-number perovskite phase for n > 2 by mechanical exfoliation. Micro-photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy studies reveal that the as-synthesized 2D perovskite plates for n > 2 are comprised by dominant n-number phase and small inclusions of hybrid perovskite phases with different n values, which is supported by excitation power dependent photoluminescence. By mechanical exfoliation method, 2D perovskite microplates with the thickness of around 20 nm are obtained, which surprisingly have single n-number perovskite phase for n = 2–5. In addition, we have demonstrated that the exfoliated 2D perovskite microplates can be integrated with other 2D layered materials such as boron nitride, and are able to be transferred to prefabricated electrodes for photodetections. Our studies not only provide a strategy to prepare 2D perovskites with a single n-number perovskite phase allowing us to extract the basic optical and electronic parameters of pure phase perovskites, but also demonstrate the possibility to integrate the 2D perovskites with other 2D layered materials to extend the device's functionalities.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we show unusual effects of strong interlayer coupling on low-frequency (LF) Raman scattering in exfoliated PdSe2 crystals with different number of layers. Unlike many other layered materials, it is found that the measured frequencies of the breathing modes cannot be simply described by a conventional linear chain model (LCM) that treats each layer as a single rigid object. By using first-principles calculations, we show that strong deviations from layer rigidity can occur for the LF breathing vibrations of PdSe2, which accounts for the observed disagreement with the conventional LCM. The layer non-rigidity and strong interlayer coupling could also explain the unusual strong intensities of the LF breathing modes that are comparable with those of the high-frequency Raman modes. These strong intensities allowed us to use a set of the measured LF Raman lines as unique fingerprints for a precise assignment of the layer numbers. The assignment of the layer numbers was further confirmed using second harmonic generation that appeared only in the noncentrosymmetric even-layer PdSe2 crystals. This work thus demonstrates a simple and fast approach for the determination of the number of layers in 2D materials with strong interlayer coupling and non-rigid interlayer vibrations.",

Here, an efficient exfoliation and functionalization of bulk h-BN was carried out by a ball-milling method using boric acid (BA) as a lubricant and modifier. A series of boric-acid-functionalized boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) was successfully produced using this approach. The obtained BNNS thermo-stable suspension can be easily condensed into a jelly-like dispersion with ultra-high concentration, up to 90 mg ml−1. The eco-friendly BA was readily and easily recyclable and remarkably reusable during the BNNS exfoliation. Interestingly, by means of a differential-centrifugation technique, the BNNSs could be easily separated and screened with different sizes and thicknesses. These screened BNNS samples also exhibited different levels of functionalization. As a result, filtration membranes made of various well-screened BNNSs exhibited an obviously different rejection rate for pollutant in water. In addition, the different screened BNNS products show a variable ability to dielectric behavior due to their different-level functionalization. We believe that our created boric-acid-functionalized BNNSs, combined with the smartly screened separation by differential centrifugation, can broaden the future practical applications of BNNS materials.",

The emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials with atomic thickness have attracted intense interests for their exotic properties. However, the presence of the Schottky barrier limits their applications, which is difficult to control over due to the Fermi level pinning effect. Therefore, searching for low resistance metal contact to 2D semiconductors becomes one of the most important topics. Here, we report that Ohmic contact can be realized in a monolayer InSe–Cu system. Based on the density functional theory combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions, the geometry, overlapping states, tunneling barrier, Schottky barrier, and band alignment at the interface of group-IB (Cu, Ag, and Au) with InSe monolayer are discussed in details. Our results reveal that Cu, the most common electrode used in the industry, shows great potential to form favorable contact with single layer InSe due to the strong interaction and high orbital overlapping. The calculated drain-source current versus bias voltage (I − V) curve exhibits linear behavior, indicating good Ohmic contact between the Cu electrodes and InSe channel. Our work may pave the way for design of next-generation ultrathin and flexible devices.",

The high sensitivity of graphene to the local environment has shown to be both advantageous but also problematic for graphene-based devices, such as transistors and sensors, where the graphene carrier concentration and mobility change due to ambient humidity variations. In this review, recent progress in understanding the effects of water on different types of graphene, grown epitaxially and quasi-free standing on SiC, by chemical vapour deposition on SiO2, as well as exfoliated flakes, are presented. It is demonstrated that water withdraws electrons from graphene, but the graphene-water interaction highly depends on the thickness, layer stacking, underlying substrate and substrate-induced doping. Moreover, we highlight the importance of clear and unambiguous description of the environmental conditions (i.e. relative humidity) whenever a routine characterisation for carrier concentration and mobility is reported (often presented as a simple figure-of-merit), as these electrical characteristics are highly dependent on the adsorbed molecules and the surrounding environment.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a systematic study of 2D optical models for the response of thin layers of material under excitation by normally incident light. The treatment, within the framework of classical optics, analyzes a thin film supported by a semi-infinite substrate, with both the thin layer and the substrate assumed to exhibit local, isotropic linear response. Starting from the conventional three-dimensional (3D) slab model of the system, we derive a two-dimensional (2D) sheet model for the thin film in which the optical response is described by a sheet optical conductivity. We develop criteria for the applicability of this 2D sheet model for a layer with an optical thickness far smaller than the wavelength of the light. We examine in detail atomically thin semi-metallic and semiconductor van-der-Waals layers and ultrathin metal films as representative examples. Excellent agreement of the 2D sheet model with the 3D slab model is demonstrated over a broad spectral range from the radio frequency limit to the near ultraviolet. A linearized version of system response for the 2D model is also presented for the case where the influence of the optically thin layer is sufficiently weak. Analytical expressions for the applicability and accuracy of the different optical models are derived, and the appropriateness of the linearized treatment for the materials is considered. We discuss the advantages, as well as limitations, of these models for the purpose of deducing the optical response function of the thin layer from experiment. We generalize the theory to take into account in-plane anisotropy, layered thin film structures, and more general substrates.

    "abstract": "Abstract Chromium triiodide, CrI 3 , is emerging as a promising magnetic two-dimensional semiconductor where spins are ferromagnetically aligned within a single layer. Potential applications in spintronics arise from an antiferromagnetic ordering between adjacent layers that gives rise to spin filtering and a large magnetoresistance in tunnelling devices. This key feature appears only in thin multilayers and it is not inherited from bulk crystals, where instead neighbouring layers share the same ferromagnetic spin orientation. This discrepancy between bulk and thin samples is unexpected, as magnetic ordering between layers arises from exchange interactions that are local in nature and should not depend strongly on thickness. Here we solve this controversy and show through polarization resolved Raman spectroscopy that thin multilayers do not undergo a structural phase transition typical of bulk crystals. As a consequence, a different stacking pattern is present in thin and bulk samples at the temperatures at which magnetism sets in and, according to previous first-principles simulations, this results in a different interlayer magnetic ordering. Our experimental findings provide evidence for the strong interplay between stacking order and magnetism in CrI 3 , opening interesting perspectives to design the magnetic state of van der Waals multilayers.",

    "abstract": "The optical response of traditional semiconductors depends on the laser excitation power used in experiments. For two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, laser excitation effects are anticipated to be vastly different due to complexity added by their ultimate thinness, high surface to volume ratio, and laser-membrane interaction effects. We show in this article that under laser excitation the optical properties of 2D materials undergo irreversible changes in vacuum. Most surprisingly these effects take place even at low steady state excitation, which is commonly thought to be non-intrusive. In low temperature photoluminescence (PL) we show for monolayer (ML) MoSe2 samples grown by different techniques that laser treatment increases significantly the trion (i.e. charged exciton) contribution to the emission compared to the neutral exciton emission. Comparison between samples exfoliated onto different substrates shows that laser induced doping is more efficient for ML MoSe2 on SiO2/Si compared to h-BN and gold. For ML MoS2 we show that exposure to laser radiation with an average power in the μW μm−2 range does not just increase the trion-to-exciton PL emission ratio, but may result in the irreversible disappearance of the neutral exciton PL emission and a shift of the main PL peak to lower energy.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion of protons and hydrogen atoms in representative two-dimensional materials is investigated. Specifically, density functional calculations were performed on graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), phosphorene, silicene, and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayers to study the surface interaction and penetration barriers for protons and hydrogen atoms employing finite cluster models. The calculated barrier heights correlate approximately with the size of the opening formed by the three-fold open sites in the monolayers considered. They range from 1.56 eV (proton) and 4.61 eV (H) for graphene to 0.12 eV (proton) and 0.20 eV (H) for silicene. The results indicate that only graphene and h-BN monolayers have the potential for membranes with high selective permeability. The MoS2 monolayer behaves differently: protons and H atoms become trapped between the outer S layers in the Mo plane in a well with a depth of 1.56 eV (proton) and 1.5 eV (H atom), possibly explaining why no proton transport was detected, suggesting MoS2 as a hydrogen storage material instead. For graphene and h-BN, off-center proton penetration reduces the barrier to 1.38 eV for graphene and 0.11 eV for h-BN. Furthermore, Pt acting as a substrate was found to have a negligible effect on the barrier height. In defective graphene, the smallest barrier for proton diffusion (1.05 eV) is found for an oxygen-terminated defect. Therefore, it seems more likely that thermal protons can penetrate a monolayer of h-BN but not graphene and defects are necessary to facilitate the proton transport in graphene.",

    "abstract": "It has been recently claimed that bulk crystals of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) ReS2 are direct band gap semiconductors, which would make this material an ideal candidate, among all TMDs, for the realization of efficient opto-electronic devices. The situation is however unclear, because even more recently an indirect transition in the PL spectra of this material has been detected, whose energy is smaller than the supposed direct gap. To address this issue we exploit the properties of ionic liquid gated field-effect transistors (FETs) to investigate the gap structure of bulk ReS2. Using these devices, whose high quality is demonstrated by a record high electron FET mobility of 1100 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 4 K, we can induce hole transport at the surface of the material and determine quantitatively the smallest band gap present in the material, irrespective of its direct or indirect nature. The value of the band gap is found to be 1.41 eV, smaller than the 1.5 eV direct optical transition but in good agreement with the energy of the indirect optical transition, providing an independent confirmation that bulk ReS2 is an indirect band gap semiconductor. Nevertheless, contrary to the case of more commonly studied semiconducting TMDs (e.g., MoS2, WS2, etc) in their bulk form, we also find that ReS2 FETs fabricated on bulk crystals do exhibit electroluminescence when driven in the ambipolar injection regime, likely because the difference between direct and indirect gap is only 100 meV. We conclude that ReS2 does deserve more in-depth investigations in relation to possible opto-electronic applications.",

For this purpose, we have functionalized the surface of GO with two well-known substrates of HRP namely coumarin and catechol. The biodegradation of all conjugates has been followed by Raman, dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. Molecular docking and gel electrophoresis have been carried out to gain more insights into the interaction between GO conjugates and HRP. Our studies have revealed better binding when GO is functionalized with coumarin or catechol compared to control GOs. All results prove that GO functionalized with coumarin and catechol moieties display a faster and more efficient biodegradation over GO.",

The MoS2 field effect transistors fabricated using the plasma-etched MoS2 displayed a higher n-type doping concentration than that of pristine MoS2. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to analyze chemical composition to demonstrate the minimum level of chemical reactions occurred upon plasma treatment. Moreover, Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements were conducted to probe the changes in the work function that could be attributed to the changes in the surface potential. The measured work functions suggest the modification of a band structure and n-doping effect after plasma treatments that depended on the number of MoS2 layers.

The tensile strain can result in efficient bandgap engineering. Besides, the proposed critical condition for favored direct energy gaps would have a guiding significance on the subsequent works.

Polaritons in semiconductor microcavities have recently emerged as an extraordinary photonic platform to emulate 1D and 2D Hamiltonians, allowing the direct visualization of the wavefunctions in both real- and momentum-space as well as of the energy dispersion of eigenstates via photoluminescence experiments.

The obtained exchange-splitting in graphene varies from tens to hundreds of meV depending on substrates. We find an electron doping to graphene induced by YIG and europium chalcogenides substrates, that shift the Fermi level above the Dirac cone up to 0.78 eV and 1.3 eV respectively, whereas hole doping shifts the Fermi level down below the Dirac cone about 0.5 eV in graphene/CFO. Furthermore, we study the variation of the extracted exchange and tight-binding parameters as a function of the EuO and EuS thicknesses. We show that those parameters are robust to thickness variation such that a single monolayer of magnetic insulator can induce a strong magnetic proximity effect on graphene.

    "abstract": "The structural polymorphism in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provides exciting opportunities for developing advanced electronics. For example, MoTe2 crystallizes in the 2H semiconducting phase at ambient temperature and pressure, but transitions into the 1T' semimetallic phase at high temperatures. Alloying MoTe2 with WTe2 reduces the energy barrier between these two phases, while also allowing access to the Td Weyl semimetal phase. The WxTe2 alloy system is therefore promising for developing phase change memory technology. However, achieving this goal necessitates a detailed understanding of the phase composition in the MoTe2-WTe2 system. We combine polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy with x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to study bulk WxTe2 alloys over the full compositional range x from 0 to 1. We identify Raman and XRD signatures characteristic of the 2H, 1T', and Td structural phases that agree with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, and use them to identify phase fields in the MoTe2–WTe2 system, including single-phase 2H, 1T', and Td regions, as well as a two-phase 1T' + Td region. Disorder arising from compositional fluctuations in WxTe2 alloys breaks inversion and translational symmetry, leading to the activation of an infrared 1T'-MoTe2 mode and the enhancement of a double-resonance Raman process in WxTe2 alloys. Compositional fluctuations limit the phonon correlation length, which we estimate by fitting the observed asymmetric Raman lineshapes with a phonon confinement model. These observations reveal the important role of disorder in WxTe2 alloys, clarify the structural phase boundaries, and provide a foundation for future explorations of phase transitions and electronic phenomena in this system.",

    "abstract": "Chemical transformation of existing two-dimensional (2D) materials can be crucial in further expanding the 2D crystal palette required to realize various functional heterostructures. In this work, we demonstrate a 2D 'on-stack' chemical conversion of single-layer crystalline MoS2 into MoO3 with a precise layer control that enables truly 2D MoO3 and MoO3/MoS2 heterostructures. To minimize perturbation of the 2D morphology, a nonthermal oxidation using O2 plasma was employed. The early stage of the reaction was characterized by a defect-induced Raman peak, drastic quenching of photoluminescence (PL) signals and sub-nm protrusions in atomic force microscopy images. As the reaction proceeded from the uppermost layer to the buried layers, PL and optical second harmonic generation signals showed characteristic modulations revealing a layer-by-layer conversion. The plasma-generated 2D oxides, confirmed as MoO3 by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, were found to be amorphous but extremely flat with a surface roughness of 0.18 nm, comparable to that of 1L MoS2. The rate of oxidation quantified by Raman spectroscopy decreased very rapidly for buried sulfide layers due to protection by the surface 2D oxides, exhibiting a pseudo-self-limiting behavior. As exemplified in this work, various on-stack chemical transformations can be applied to other 2D materials in forming otherwise unobtainable materials and complex heterostructures, thus expanding the palette of 2D material building blocks.",

    "abstract": "The performance of MoS2 transistors is strongly affected by charge trapping in oxide traps with very broad distributions of time constants. These defects degrade the mobility and additionally lead to the hysteresis of the gate transfer characteristics, which presents a crucial performance and reliability issue for these new technologies. Here we perform a detailed study of the hysteresis in double-gated MoS2 FETs and show that this issue is nothing else than a combination of threshold voltage shifts resulting from positive and negative bias-temperature instabilities. While these instabilities are well known from silicon devices, they are even more important in 2D devices given the considerably larger defect densities. Most importantly, the magnitudes of these threshold voltage shifts depend strongly on the density and energetic alignment of the active oxide traps. Based on this, we introduce the incremental hysteresis sweep method which allows for an accurate mapping of these defects and extract their energy distributions from simulations. By applying our method to analyze the impact of oxide traps situated in the Al2O3 top gate of several devices, we confirm its versatility. Since all 2D devices investigated so far suffer from a similar hysteresis behavior, the incremental hysteresis sweep method provides a unique and powerful way for the detailed characterization of their defect bands.",

Our results show the optimized configuration was 48 nm Au film coated with 4-layer BP crystal to produce the sharpest phase variation (up to 89.8975°), and lowest minimum reflectivity (1.9119 × 10−7). Detection sensitivity up to 7.4914 × 104 degree/refractive index unit is almost 4.5 times enhanced compared to monolayer graphene-based SPR sensors with 48 nm Au film.

    "abstract": "Atomically thin black phosphorus (called phosphorene) holds great promise as an alternative to graphene and other two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, bulk black phosphorus (BP) suffers from rapid capacity fading and poor rechargeable performance. This work reports for the first time the use of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to construct nanoscale phosphorene LIBs. This enables direct visualization of the mechanisms underlying capacity fading in thick multilayer phosphorene through real-time capture of delithiation-induced structural decomposition, which serves to reduce electrical conductivity thus causing irreversibility of the lithiated phases. We further demonstrate that few-layer-thick phosphorene successfully circumvents the structural decomposition and holds superior structural restorability, even when subject to multi-cycle lithiation/delithiation processes and concomitant huge volume expansion. This finding provides breakthrough insights into thickness-dependent lithium diffusion kinetics in phosphorene. More importantly, a scalable liquid-phase shear exfoliation route has been developed to produce high-quality ultrathin phosphorene using simple means such as a high-speed shear mixer or even a household kitchen blender with the shear rate threshold of ∼1.25 × 104 s−1. The results reported here will pave the way for industrial-scale applications of rechargeable phosphorene LIBs.",

In a magnetic system with time inversion symmetry breaking, phonon can have nonzero angular momentum, which makes a correction to the gyromagnetic ratio measured in the Einstein–de Haas effect. Though total phonon angular momentum is zero in a nonmagnetic two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal system with space inversion symmetry breaking, phonons at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone can have nonzero phonon angular momentum, which means they are chiral phonons. Chiral phonons decide selection rules in the electronic intervalley scattering, which has been experimentally verified in tungsten-diselenide monolayers very recently (Zhu et al 2018 Science 359 579). In this review, after a brief introduction of related background and some basic concepts, we mainly report recent progress of phonon angular momentum in magnetic systems and chiral phonon in nonmagnetic systems. We also review known experiments in verifications of the phonon chirality and finally conclude with an outlook of future developments.",

The 'anti-ambipolar' behavior under dark condition and the 'on' state I under light illumination is originating from the in series of p-channel in WSe2 and n-channel in SnS2, while the 'on' state II can be attributed to the gate-controlled Schottky barrier modulation between the heterostructure and the Au electrodes. The heterostructure also shows self-driven photoswitching performance under 532 nm laser, which can be attributed to the type-II band alignment and the build-in potential of p–n heterostructure.",

Ti3C2Tx showed high (~2 × 1021 cm−3) intrinsic charge carrier density and relatively high (~34 cm2 V−1 s−1) mobility of carriers with an exceptionally large, ~46 000 cm−1 absorption in the THz range, which suggests that Ti3C2Tx is well suited for THz detection. We also demonstrate that Ti3C2Tx conductivity and THz transmission can be manipulated by photoexcitation, as absorption of near-infrared, 800 nm pulses is found to cause transient suppression of the conductivity that recovers over hundreds of picoseconds. The possibility of control over THz transmission and conductivity by photoexcitation suggests the promise for application of Ti3C2Tx Mxenes in THz modulation devices and variable electromagnetic shielding.",

We show that, in the single layer, the CDW barely affects the Fermi surface of the system, thus ruling out a nesting mechanism as the driving force for the modulation. The CDW stabilizes levels lying around 1.35 eV below the Fermi level within the Se-based valence band but having a substantial Nb–Nb bonding character. The absence of interlayer interactions leads to the suppression of the pancake-like portion of the bulk Fermi surface in the single-layer. We perform scanning tunneling microscopy simulations and find that the images noticeably change with the sign and magnitude of the voltage bias. The atomic corrugation of the Se sublayer induced by the modulation plays a primary role in leading to these images, but the electronic reorganization also has an important contribution. The analysis of the variation of these images with the bias voltage does not support a Fermi surface nesting mechanism for the CDW. It is also shown that underlying graphene layers (present in some of the recent experimental work) do not modify the conduction band, but do affect the shape of the valence band of NbSe2 single-layers. The relevance of these results in understanding recent physical measurements for NbSe2 single-layers is discussed.",

Field-effect transistor devices fabricated on individual single-layer rectangular SnSe flakes using gold electrodes exhibited p-doped ambipolar behavior and a hole mobility of about 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1.

By probing the disorder dependent vibrational response we deduce the interdefect distance by applying a phonon confinement model. We show that the increasing interdefect distance correlates with disorder-related luminescence arising 180 meV below the neutral exciton emission. We perform ab-initio density functional theory of a variety of defect related morphologies, which yield first indications on the origin of the observed additional luminescence. Remarkably, no significant reduction of free exciton valley polarization is observed until the interdefect distance approaches a few nanometers, namely the size of the free exciton Bohr radius. Our findings pave the way for direct writing of sub-10 nm nanoscale valleytronic devices and circuits using focused helium ions.",

These range from chains of nano-hillocks in bulk-like MoS2, and foldings in single and bilayer MoS2, to unique nano-incisions in supported and freestanding single layers of MoS2. Our data reveals that the primary mechanism responsible for the incisions in the ultrathin supported samples is the indirect heating by the SiO2 substrate. We thus conclude that an energy of less than 2 keV per nm track length is sufficient to fabricate nano-incisions in MoS2 which is compatible with the use of the smallest accelerators.",

We have studied the two found in nature stackings of CrI3 bilayers and found that indeed the magnetic phase of one of them can be tuned by an external electric field while the other remains ferromagnetic. We simulate those results with ab initio calculations and explain them with a simple model based on a rigid shift of the bands associated with different spins. The model can be applied to similar van der Waal stacked insulating bilayer anti-ferromagnets.",

However, a comprehensive study of the thickness dependence and of potential extrinsic effects are paramount to harness the electronic properties of such atomic foils. One striking example is the charge density wave (CDW) transition temperature in layered dichalcogenides whose thickness dependence remains unclear in the ultrathin limit. Here we present a detailed study of the thickness and temperature dependences of the CDW in VSe$_2$ by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). We show that mapping the real-space CDW periodicity over a broad thickness range unique to STM provides essential insight. We introduce a robust derivation of the local order parameter and transition temperature based on the real space charge modulation amplitude. Both quantities exhibit a striking non-monotonic thickness dependence that we explain in terms of a 3D to 2D dimensional crossover in the FS topology. This finding highlights thickness as a true tuning parameter of the electronic ground state and reconciles seemingly contradicting thickness dependencies determined in independent transport studies.",

Large MA thus comprises a key ingredient in the search for magnetic 2D materials that retains the magnetic order above room temperature. Magnetic interactions are typically modeled in terms of Heisenberg models and the temperature dependence on magnetic properties can be obtained with the random phase approximation (RPA), which treats magnon interactions at the mean-field level. In the present work we show that large MA gives rise to strong magnon magnon interactions that leads to a drastic failure of the RPA. We then demonstrate that classical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations correctly describe the critical temperatures in the large MA limit and agree with RPA when the MA becomes small. A fit of the MC results leads to a simple expression for the critical temperatures as a function of MA and exchange coupling constants, which significantly simplifies the theoretical search for new 2D magnetic materials with high critical temperatures. The expression is tested on a monolayer of CrI3, which were recently observed to exhibit ferromagnetic order below 45 K and we find excellent agreement with the experimental value.",

    "abstract": "Excitons, bound electron–hole pairs in a 2D plane, dominate the optical properties of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). A large exciton binding energy on the order of 0.5 eV was theoretically predicted and experimentally determined recently. These ultrastable excitons thus open an avenue to explore the exciton physics such as Bose–Einstein condensation and superfluidity at room temperature (Kasprzak et al 2006 Nature 443 409; Plumhof et al 2014 Nat. Mater. 13 247; Fogler et al 2014 Nat. Commun. 5 4555; Jiang and John 2014 Sci. Rep. 4 7432). Recent experiments further demonstrated the concept of Coulomb engineering via dielectric environments based on either solutions or few-layer graphene. However, the conducting nature of these dielectrics can lead to quenching of optical transitions. Thus, in order to utilize 'dielectric tuning' of the exciton binding energy and quasiparticle band gaps, one must use insulating dielectrics. Here, we investigate the impact of insulating dielectric environments on the exciton binding energy of monolayer WS2 and WSe2 by exciton Rydberg spectroscopy, in which the dielectric environment is systematically varied from κ = 1.49 to 3.82. We found that, with increasing κ value, the exciton binding energy and quasiparticle bandgap exhibit significant reductions. Quantitatively, our result follows the prediction of nonlocally-screened Keldysh potential very well. The fitted 2D polarizability, , agrees rather well with previous density function theory calculations. Their close agreement validates the nonlocally screened Keldysh model which can be used to quantitatively predict the exciton binding energy for monolayer TMDs (and possibly other 2D materials) in different dielectric environments. Such a predictive model will play an important role for the design of van der Waals heterostructures and TMD-based optoelectronic devices.",

We present herein the experimental observations of thickness-dependent conductivity and photoconductive-responsivity spectrum in multilayer InSe as well as optically enhanced transconductance gain in the multilayer InSe metal-semiconductor-field-effect transistor (MESFET) illuminated by a halogen lamp. The voltage-current (V-I) measurement result shows multilayer InSe belongs to a p-type semiconductor, which can form a p-channel FET device. Thickness (t) dependent conductivity (σ) of multilayer InSe reveals about six-order variation from 5076 (Ω-cm)−1 (t = 5 nm) to 2.56 × 10−3 (Ω-cm)−1 (t = 184 μm, bulk) following a relationship of σ ∝ t−1.38. The highest conductivity in a thin InSe (e.g. t = 5 nm) is due to the increase of carrier density when the thickness is decreased. The photoresponsivity spectrum of a Ag-InSe-Ag multilayer photoconductor demonstrates a prominent peak absorption at 1.1 ∼ 1.3 eV, matches well with the direct-free-exciton energy of the InSe. A multilayer p-InSe MESFET was tested by V-I measurement. The transconductance was measured and determined to be The gm value will enhance about three times when the MESFET was placed under the illumination of a tungsten halogen lamp of a lower power density ∼0.5 mW · cm−2.

Surprisingly, the optical transition dipole of the spin-triplet exciton is found to be in the same order of magnitude to that of the spin-singlet exciton, in sharp contrast to the monolayer excitons where the spin triplet species is considered as dark compared to the singlet. Unlike the monolayer excitons whose spin-conserved (spin-flip) transition dipole can only couple to light of in-plane (out-of-plane) polarization, such restriction is removed for the interlayer excitons due to the breaking of the out-of-plane mirror symmetry. We find that as the interlayer atomic registry changes, the optical transition dipole of interlayer exciton crosses between in-plane ones of opposite circular polarization and the out-of-plane one for both the spin-triplet and spin-singlet species. As a result, excitons of both species have non-negligible coupling into photon modes of both in-plane and out-of-plane propagations, another sharp difference from the monolayers where the exciton couples predominantly into the out-of-plane propagation channel. At given atomic registry, the spin-triplet and spin-singlet excitons have distinct valley polarization selection rules, allowing the selective optical addressing of both the valley configuration and the spin singlet/triplet configuration of interlayer excitons.",

However, the magnitude of the detected electric signals at room temperature in metallic systems has been so far underwhelming. Here, we demonstrate a two-order of magnitude enhancement of the signal in monolayer graphene/Pt devices when compared to their fully metallic counterparts. The enhancement stems in part from efficient spin injection and the large spin resistance of graphene but we also observe 100% spin absorption in Pt and find an unusually large effective spin Hall angle of up to 0.15. The large spin-to-charge conversion allows us to characterise spin precession in graphene under the presence of a magnetic field. Furthermore, by developing an analytical model based on the 1D diffusive spin-transport, we demonstrate that the effective spin-relaxation time in graphene can be accurately determined using the (inverse) spin Hall effect as a means of detection. This is a necessary step to gather full understanding of the consequences of spin absorption in spin Hall devices, which is known to suppress effective spin lifetimes in both metallic and graphene systems.",

Herein, we report the potential impact of the microbial inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) by delaminating (water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and isopropylamine) and intercalating (hydrazine monohydrate (HMH), sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide) of MXene (Ti3C2Tx), and its bactericidal mechanism was interpreted. The delaminations and intercalations all significantly increased the colloidal stability and bactericidal effect of Ti3C2Tx suspensions via unpacking of stacked MXene layers, among which the HMH intercalation showed the best performance. Our experimental results reveal that the mechanism of bacterial killing was primarily because of surface wrapping followed by extracellular reactive oxygen species independent oxidative stress. This study also shows that the stacked layer separation along with the surface moiety is an essential and decisive factor that determines the lethal bacterial potency of Ti3C2Tx. The application of Ti3C2Tx-coated polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes effectively inactivates E. coli; importantly, it prevents biofilm formation on the active membrane surfaces and thus has high potential for antibiofouling. This study provides useful guidelines for the future development of Ti3C2Tx-based antimicrobial surface coatings and increases their bioapplication potential.",

It has recently been found that the band gap in 2D crystals of InSe more than doubles in the monolayer compared to thick multilayer crystals, while the high mobility of conduction band electrons is promoted by their light in-plane mass. Here, we use Raman and PL measurements of encapsulated few layer samples, coupled with accurate atomic force and transmission electron microscope structural characterisation to reveal new optical properties of atomically thin GaSe preserved by hBN encapsulation. The band gaps we observe complement the spectral range provided by InSe films, so that optical activity of these two almost lattice-matched PTMC films and their heterostructures densely cover the spectrum of photons from violet to infrared. We demonstrate the realisation of the latter by the first observation of interlayer excitonic photoluminescence in few-layer InSe-GaSe heterostructures.

We study the magnetic phase diagram upon the strain of the antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer with C2/m symmetry. We found that strain can be an efficient tool to tune the magnetic phase of the structure. A tensile strain stabilizes the antiferromagnetic phase, while a compressive strain turns the system ferromagnetic. We associate that behavior to the relative displacement between layers induced by the strain.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) verify that phosphorus (P) is doped in GDY framework via the forms of P–O, P = O and P–C bonds. Raman spectra and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) results reveal that the P doping creates numerous heteroatomic defects and active sites, causes more hierarchical micro-mesoporous, which provide more storage sites of Li and transmission paths for corresponding ions. Besides, DFT results imply that the most stable geometries can be obtained when the P-containing groups are doped at the benzene in GDY structure, and the doping P = O bonds are beneficial to Li storage. As a result, for P-GDY, enhanced electrochemical performances for lithium-ion batteries are obtained compared with pristine GDY, including higher reversible capacity, improved rate performance, and superior cycling stability.",

For applications exploiting radiative recombination of bright excitons or long lifetime dark excitons, it is essential to understand the radiative character of the exciton ground state and establish the energy separation between the lowest energy bright and dark excitons. Here, we report a direct spectroscopic measure of dark excitons in monolayer MoSe2 encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. By applying strong in-plane magnetic field, we induce mixing and splitting of bright and dark exciton branches, which enables an accurate spectroscopic determination of their energies. We confirm the bright character of the exciton ground state separated by a 1.5 meV gap from the higher energy dark exciton state, much smaller compared to the previous theoretical expectations.

The excellent p-type conduction is also beneficial from enhancing the ratio of ions in oxygen plasma by the TMF.

However, the majority of these materials have Curie temperatures that are well below room temperature, making it challenging to incorporate them into device applications. In this work, we synthesized a room-temperature vdW magnetic crystal Fe5GeTe2 with a Curie temperature T K, and studied its magnetic properties by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. The experiments were performed with external magnetic fields applied along the c-axis (Hc) and the ab-plane (Hab), with temperatures ranging from 300 to 10 K. We have found a sizable Landé g-factor difference between the Hc and Hab cases. In both cases, the Landé g-factor values deviated from g = 2. This indicates contribution of orbital angular momentum to the magnetic moment. The FMR measurements reveal that Fe5GeTe2 has a damping constant comparable to Permalloy. With reducing temperature, the linewidth was broadened. Together with the VSM data, our measurements indicate that Fe5GeTe2 transitions from ferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic at lower temperatures. Our experiments highlight key information regarding the magnetic state and spin scattering processes in Fe5GeTe2, which promote the understanding of magnetism in Fe5GeTe2, leading to implementations of Fe5GeTe2 based room-temperature spintronic devices.",

We propose a theory for magnons in CrI3 monolayers based on an itinerant fermion picture, with a Hamiltonian derived from first principles. We obtain the magnon dispersion for 2D CrI3 with a gap at the Dirac points with the same Berry curvature in both valleys. For CrI3 ribbons, we find chiral in-gap edge states. Analysis of the magnon wave functions in momentum space confirms their topological nature.

As temperature decreases, the Li+ desolvation energy and electrode polarization increase, which lead to Li dendrite formation and battery performance fading. Herein, we report a new material surface engineering strategy to enhance Li-storage performance at LT in MXene-(Ti3C2Tx) by substituting O selectively for F termination. The pristine MXene was processed calculation at 300 °C in different atmospheres to control the partial O substitutions. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) have been used to disclose the surface element state and fine structure. Investigated as anode of LIBs, the Ti3C2Tx(O) sample displays an improved capacity and cycle life both at −20 °C and room temperature. A discharge capacity of 226 mAh g−1 (the 10th cycle) is observed and still keep 193.9 mAh g−1 even after 1000 cycles. This is far better than that of graphite anode. Furthermore, the discharge capacity is 405 mAh g−1 (the 10th cycle) at room temperature (100 mA g−1). Even after 500 cycles, it remains 403 mAh g−1, which is much better than Ti3C2Tx(F/OH). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the Li ion migration barrier could be greatly decreased with O terminal group, rationalizing the improved electrochemical performance. The O-rich surface enhance the electrolyte wettability, facilitate the Li ion desolvation and speed up the Li insertion into layered Ti3C2Tx(O). The present result demonstrates that the surface engineering strategy could promote the Li storage performance in MXene especially at LT.",

Tungsten disulphide (WS 2 ), as a typical example of TMDs, has considerable potential in applications such as strain engineered devices and the next generation multifunctional polymer nanocomposites. However, controlling the strain, or more practically, monitoring the strain in WS 2 and the associated micromechanics have not been so well studied. Both photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy have been proved to be effective but PL cannot be employed to characterise multilayer TMDs while it is difficult for Raman spectroscopy to reveal the band structure. In this present study, PL and Raman spectroscopy have been combined to monitor the strain distribution and stress transfer of monolayer WS 2 on a flexible polymer substrate and in polymer nanocomposites. It is demonstrated that WS 2 still follows continuum mechanics on the microscale and that strain generates a non-uniform bandgap distribution even in a single WS 2 flake through a simple strain engineering. It is shown that these flakes could be useful in optoelectronic applications as they become micron-sized PL emitters with a band gap that can be tuned by the application of external strain to the substrate. The analysis of strain distributions using Raman spectroscopy is further extended to thin-film few-layer WS 2 polymer nanocomposites where it is demonstrated that the stress can be transferred effectively to WS 2 flakes. The relationship between the mechanical behaviour of single monolayer WS 2 flakes and that of few-layer flakes in bulk composites is investigated.",

Considering the scarcity of NIR-fluorescing biocompatible nanostructures, we have for the first-time synthesized nanometer-sized reduced graphene oxide-derived graphene quantum dots (RGQDs) with NIR (950 nm) emission highly biocompatible in vitro with no preliminary toxic response in vivo. RGQDs are obtained in a high-yield (∼90%) top-down sodium hypochlorite/ultraviolet-driven synthetic process from non-emissive micron-sized reduced graphene oxide (RGO) flakes. This oxidation of RGO yields quantum dots with an average size of 3.54 ± 0.05 nm and a highly crystalline graphitic lattice structure with distinguishable lattice fringes. RGQDs exhibit excitation-independent emission in the visible and NIR-I region with a maximum NIR quantum yield of ∼7%. Unlike their parent material, RGQDs show substantial biocompatibility with ∼75%–80% cell viability up to high (1 mg ml −1 ) concentrations verified via both MTT and luminescence-based cytotoxicity assays. Tracked in vitro via their NIR fluorescence, RGQDs exhibit efficient internalization in HeLa cells maximized at 12 h with further anticipated excretion. In vivo, RGQDs introduced intravenously to NCr nude mice allow for fluorescence imaging in live sedated animals without the need in sacrificing those at imaging time points. Their distribution in spleen, kidneys, liver, and intestine assessed from NIR fluorescence in live mice, is further confirmed by excised organ analysis and microscopy of organ tissue slices. This outlines the potential of novel RGQDs as NIR imaging probes suitable for tracking therapeutic delivery in live animal models. A combination of smaller size, water-solubility, bright NIR emission, simple/scalable synthesis, and high biocompatibility gives RGQDs a critical advantage over a number of existing nanomaterials-based imaging platforms.",

Our classical analog of twisted bilayer graphene shows much of the same behavior as its quantum counterpart, including mode localization at a magic angle of about 1.1 degrees. By tuning the thickness of the interlayer membrane, we reach a regime of strong interactions more than three times higher than the feasible range of twisted bilayer graphene under pressure. In this regime, we find the magic angle as high as 6.01 degrees, corresponding to a far denser array of localized modes in real space and further increasing their interaction strength.

This sensor demonstrated limits of detection that are considerably lower than most commercial SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests (22.91 ± 4.72 pg ml −1 for spike RBD and 110.38 ± 9.00 pg ml −1 for spike S1) as well as fast response time (∼30 min), which was facilitated by the functionalization of printed graphene electrodes in a single-step with SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal antibody through the carbodiimide reaction without the need for nanoparticle functionalization or secondary antibody or metallic nanoparticle labels. This immunosensor presents a wide linear sensing range from 1 to 1000 ng ml −1 and does not react with other coexisting influenza viruses such as H1N1 hemagglutinin. By combining high-yield graphene ink synthesis, automated printing, high antigen selectivity, and rapid testing capability, this work offers a promising alternative to current SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As a new kind of two-dimensional (2D) layered carbon allotrope, graphdiyne (GDY) is rarely studied in the application field of photocatalytic hydrogen production. In addition, the efficient construction of photocatalyst heterostructure is a promising strategy to improve the yield of hydrogen production from photocatalytic split of water. Therefore, it is an excellent method to construct heterostructure photocatalytic system by introducing GDY into semiconductor photocatalytic materials. Herein, it is an excellent method to construct heterostructure photocatalytic system by introducing the cuprous iodide based 2D layered carbon allotrope (GDY) into metallic oxide semiconductor (NiO). Thus, a ternary hybrid photocatalyst (GDY/CuI/NiO) was prepared by in situ ultrasonic agitation method. X-ray diffraction, SEM, transmission electron microscope and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results showed that NiO nanosheets were successfully adsorbed by GDY/CuI. In addition, the composite catalyst (GDY/CuI/NiO) showed excellent photocatalytic performance, which performed a high hydrogen production activity of 5955 μ mol g −1 and good stability in the 20 h hydrogen production experiment. Amorphous GDY provides more active sites for the process of hydrogen evolution in this photocatalytic system. Most importantly, the construction of S-scheme heterojunction promotes electron transfer and plays an important role in enhancing the hydrogen production activity. These findings provide new ideas for realizing efficient solar hydrogen production system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transition metal carbides and nitrides, generally known as MXenes have emerged as an alternative to improve photocatalytic performance in renewable energy and environmental remediation applications because of their high surface area, tunable chemistry, and easily adjustable elemental compositions. MXenes have many interlayer groups, surface group operations, and a flexible layer spacing that makes them ideal catalysts. Over 30 different members of the MXenes family have been explored and successfully utilized as catalysts. Particularly, MXenes have achieved success as a photocatalyst for carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen evolution, and photochemical degradation. The structure of MXenes and the presence of hydrophilic functional groups on the surface results in excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In addition, MXenes’ surface defects provide abundant CO 2 adsorption sites. Moreover, their highly efficient catalytic oxidation activity is a result of their excellent two-dimensional nanomaterial structure and high-speed electron transport channels. This article comprehensively discusses the structure, synthesis techniques, photocatalytic applications (i.e. H 2 evolution, N 2 fixation, CO 2 reduction, and degradation of pollutants), and recyclability of MXenes. This review also critically evaluates the MXene-based heterostructure and composites photocatalyst synthesis process and their performance for organic pollutant degradation. Finally, a prospect for further research is presented in environmental and energy sciences.",

Chitosan/lignosulfonate nanospheres were stabilized on the surface of MXne sheets, endowing them with a variety of surface functionalities, high specific surface area, and antioxidant characteristics. The competitive adsorption of multi-metal systems revealed that MCL had a preferential adsorption affinity toward various heavy metal ions; the MCL removal efficiency for the quinary-metal ions adsorption followed a trend of Pb(II) &gt; Cr(VI) ≈ Cu(II) &gt; Ni(II) ≈ Co(II) in neutral pH conditions. A moderate reduction was observed for Cu(II) and Cr(VI) ions. For all metals, the kinetics data fitted well with the pseudo-second-order model, and the adsorption equilibrium was best described by the Langmuir model. The adsorption mechanism is suggested to be a synergic combination of electrostatic interaction, surface complexation, and ion exchange.

In addition, it exhibits an excellent photothermal performance, rising surface temperature to 70 °C within 60 s under 1 sun irradiation, that can drastically reduce the crude oil absorption time from 60 min to 60 s, saving 98% of absorption time and reaching a crude oil absorption capacity of 21 g g −1 . More interestingly, the designed solar evaporation device with the obtained composite aerogel can achieve an evaporation rate of 1.15 kg m −2 h −1 and evaporation efficiency of 74%.

However, the relationship and charge storage mechanism of a so-called ‘synergistic effect’ between those doped atoms including oxygen-, nitrogen-, and sulphur-doping on supercapacitor performances remain inscrutable. In this study, machine learning models are used to predict the capacitance of heteroatom-doped graphene-based supercapacitors and establish the effects of heteroatom-doping. Trained artificial neural network can accurately predict the capacitance of the electrode, drawing the best synthesis conditions for the heteroatom-doped graphene. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate the synergistic effect that arises from co-doping nitrogen, sulphur, and locate the optimised region for N/S-co-doping with high capacitance, and high retention rate. Machine learning methods allow us to consider a much larger space of heteroatom-doping combinations to maximise the supercapacitor performances and provide a useful guideline for co-doping graphene-based supercapacitors.",

Such spin spirals break the rotational symmetry of the lattice and lead to polar ground states where the axis of polarization is strongly coupled to the magnetic order (type II multiferroics). We apply the generalized Bloch theorem in conjunction with non-collinear density functional theory calculations to find the spiralling vector that minimizes the energy and then include spin-orbit coupling to calculate the preferred orientation of the spin plane with respect to the spiral vector. We find a wide variety of magnetic orders ranging from ferromagnetic, stripy anti-ferromagnetic, 120$^\\circ$ non-collinear structures and incommensurate spin spirals. The latter two introduce polar axes and are found in the majority of materials considered here. The spontaneous polarization is calculated for the incommensurate spin spirals by performing full supercell relaxation including spinorbit coupling and the induced polarization is shown to be strongly dependent on the orientation of the spiral planes. We also test the effect of Hubbard corrections on the results and find that for most materials LDA+U results agree qualitatively with LDA. An exception is the Mn halides, which are found to exhibit incommensurate spin spiral ground states if Hubbard corrections are included whereas bare LDA yields a 120$^\\circ$ non-collinear ground state.",

Here, we show that the superacid bis-(triuoromethane)sulfonimide (TFSI) treatment of monolayer WS 2 -LEDs boosts EL quantum efficiency by over one order of magnitude at room temperature. Non-treated devices emit light mainly from negatively charged excitons, while the emission in treated ones predominantly involves radiative recombination of neutral excitons.

By applying an electric displacement field, the system can be tuned across a spectrum wherein electronic correlation, SOC, or a combination of both dominates. Our investigations reveal an intricate phase diagram of proximity-induced SOC-selective BLG. Not only does this phase diagram include those correlated phases reminiscent of SOC-free doped BLG, but it also hosts unique SOC-induced states allowing a compelling measurement of valley g-factor and a correlated insulator at charge neutrality, thereby showcasing the remarkable tunability of the interplay between interaction and SOC in WSe2 enriched BLG.",

The dielectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, added to their excellent chemical stability, mechanical and thermal properties, make them promising dielectrics. Here we show that liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) in water by using low-cost commercial organic dyes as dispersant agents can efficiently produce defect-free 2D nanosheets, including mono-layers, in suspensions. We further show that these suspensions can be easily incorporated into current practical graphene-based devices. In particular, it is found that boron nitride thin films made by LPE are excellent dielectrics that are highly compatible with graphene-based electronics.",

For pristine graphene, the intrinsic spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is only in the order of few μeV, which makes it almost impossible to be used as an active element in future electric field controlled spintronics devices. This stimulates the development of a systematic method for extrinsically enhancing the SOC of graphene. In this letter, we study the strength of SOC in weakly fluorinated graphene devices. We observe high non-local signals even without applying any external magnetic field. The magnitude of the signal increases with increasing fluorine adatom coverage. From the length dependence of the non-local transport measurements, we obtain SOC values of ∼5.1 meV and ∼9.1 meV for the devices with ∼0.005% and ∼0.06% fluorination, respectively. Such a large enhancement, together with the high charge mobility of fluorinated samples (μ ∼ 4300 cm2 V−1 s−1–2700 cm2 V−1 s−1), enables the detection of the spin Hall effect even at room temperature.",

Recently, transformation of the 1H form to the 1T form with metallic electronic structure at high temperatures was demonstrated in MoS2 with Re substitution and electron irradiation by Lin et al (2014 Nat.

Here, we use first-principles calculations to determine the energy landscape associated with the 1H to 1T phase transition, predict novel 1T structures and relate the observed by Lin et al (2014 Nat.

We show that the metallic centrosymmetric 1T (c 1T ) structure of these compounds is unstable with respect to dimerization or trimerization of metal atoms, leading to a competing metallic 1T form and ferroelectric semiconducting 1T form respectively. While the former is a more stable 1T form of MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, the latter is a more stable 1T form of MoS2 exhibiting rich ferroelectric dipolar domain structure. In the vicinity of metal-semiconductor transitions, their semiconducting forms are shown to exhibit an anomalous response to electric fields. To facilitate the experimental verification of these subtle features of the 1T forms of MX2 monolayers, we present comparative analysis of their vibrational properties, and identify their Raman and infra-red spectroscopic signatures.",

Due to the narrow band-gap and unpinned Fermi level of BP, this heterojunction could be tuned to either p–n or n–n by the electrostatic gating. The current rectification behaviors were observed in both p–n and n–n junctions. The current rectification of the MoS2–BP n–n junction was attributed to the energy barrier formed at the interface of wide band-gap MoS2 and narrow band-gap BP. The gate dependence of forward current, reverse current and current rectification properties of the heterojunction at different thickness scale were systematically studied, suggesting the electrical properties of the heterojunction could be controlled by designing the thickness of MoS2 and BP flake.",

Comparison between the orientation of the islands and the local crystallographic orientation of the polycrystalline copper foil reveals an epitaxial relation between the copper and h-BN, even on Cu(100) and Cu(110) regions whose symmetry is not matched to the h-BN. However, the growth rate is faster and the islands more uniformly oriented on Cu(111) grains. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal a well-defined band structure for the h-BN, consistent with a band gap of 6 eV, that is decoupled from the copper surface beneath. These results indicate that, despite a weak interaction between h-BN and copper, van der Waals epitaxy defines the long range ordering of h-BN even on polycrystalline copper foils and suggest that large area, single crystal, monolayer h-BN could be readily and cheaply produced.",

Comparing the spatial dependence of the Kerr rotation signal and the photoluminescence reveals a correlation with neutral exciton emission, which is likely due to the transfer of angular momentum to resident conduction electrons with long spin/valley lifetimes. In addition, we observe an unexpected anticorrelation between the Kerr rotation and trion emission, which provides evidence for the presence of long-lived spin/valley-polarized dark trions. We also find that the spin/valley polarization in WS2 is robust to magnetic fields up to 700 mT, indicative of spins and valleys that are stabilized with strong spin–orbit fields.",

A total of 19 GBs are predicted and found to be energetically stable with formation energies much lower than those in graphene. These GBs do not severely affect the electronic properties of phosphorene: the band gap of perfect phosphorene is preserved, and the electron mobilities are only moderately reduced in these defective systems.

    "abstract": "We have investigated the electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), namely trilayer WSe2 and monolayer MoSe2, deposited on epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide, by using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) in ultra-high vacuum. Depending on the number of graphene layers below the TMD flakes, we identified variations in the electronic dI/dV(V) spectra measured by the STM tip: the most salient feature is a rigid shift of the TMD spectra (i.e. of the different band onset positions) towards occupied states by about 120 mV when passing from bilayer to monolayer underlying graphene. Since both graphene phases are metallic and present a work function difference in the same energy range, our measurements point towards the absence of Fermi-level pinning for such van der Waals 2D TMD/Metal heterojunctions, following the prediction of the Schottky-Mott model.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research, the ultimate goal of nanotechnology--top-down manipulation of individual atoms--has been directly achieved with only one technique: scanning probe microscopy. In this Review, we demonstrate that scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is emerging as an alternative method for the direct assembly of nanostructures, with possible applications in plasmonics, quantum technologies, and materials science. Atomically precise manipulation with STEM relies on recent advances in instrumentation that have enabled non-destructive atomic-resolution imaging at lower electron energies. While momentum transfer from highly energetic electrons often leads to atom ejection, interesting dynamics can be induced when the transferable kinetic energies are comparable to bond strengths in the material. Operating in this regime, very recent experiments have revealed the potential for single-atom manipulation using the Angstrom-sized electron beam. To truly enable control, however, it is vital to understand the relevant atomic-scale phenomena through accurate dynamical simulations. Although excellent agreement between experiment and theory for the specific case of atomic displacements from graphene has been recently achieved using density functional theory molecular dynamics, in many other cases quantitative accuracy remains a challenge. We provide a comprehensive reanalysis of available experimental data on beam-driven dynamics in light of the state-of-the-art in simulations, and identify important targets for improvement. Overall, the modern electron microscope has great potential to become an atom-scale fabrication platform, especially for covalently bonded 2D nanostructures. We review the developments that have made this possible, argue that graphene is an ideal starting material, and assess the main challenges moving forward.",

By means of numerical simulations and modeling we show that the GNR interior is structurally lubric ('superlubric') so that the static friction is dominated by the front/tail regions of the GNR, where the residual uncompensated lateral forces arising from the interaction with the underneath gold surface opposes the free sliding. As a result of this edge pinning the static friction does not grow with the GNR length, but oscillates around a fairly constant mean value. These friction oscillations are explained in terms of the GNR-Au(111) lattice mismatch: at certain GNR lengths close to an integer number of the beat (or moiré) length there is good force compensation and superlubric sliding; whereas close to half odd-integer periods there is significant pinning of the edge with larger friction. These results make qualitative contact with recent state-of-the-art atomic force microscopy experiment, as well as with the sliding of other different incommensurate systems.",

In this work, we investigate the evolution of the lowest lying excitonic transition, the so-called A-valley exciton, with temperature. We find a strong, phonon-induced temperature broadening of the resonance, and more importantly, a reduction of the oscillator strength for increased temperatures. Based on these experimentally extracted, temperature dependent parameters, we apply a coupled oscillator model to elucidate the possibility to observe the strong coupling regime between the A-exciton and a microcavity resonance in three prototypical photonic architectures with varying mode volumes. We find that the formation of exciton-polaritons up to ambient conditions in short, monolithic dielectric and Tamm-based structures seems feasible. In contrast, a temperature-induced transition into the weak coupling regime can be expected for structures with extended effective cavity length. Based on these findings, we calculate and draw the phase diagram of polariton Bosonic condensation in a MoSe2 cavity.",

In situ monitoring of the MoS2 Raman spectra during oxidation revealed a decrease in the intensity of peaks following sigmoidal decay kinetics, which was initiated at temperatures as low as 300 °C. Ex situ resonance Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron and atomic force microscopy analysis indicated breaking up and thinning of the MoS2 films down to p-doped mono- and bi-layer regions.

However, the bottleneck of generation large size atomic thin two-dimensional (2D) α-MoO3 crystals remain challenging this field (normally several micrometers size). Herein, we developed a facile vapor–solid (VS) process for controllable growth of large-size 2D α-MoO3 single crystals with a few nanometers thick and over 300 μm in lateral size. High-performance solar-blind photodetectors were fabricated based on individual 2D α-MoO3 single crystal. The detectors demonstrate outstanding optoelectronic properties under solar-blind UV light (254 nm), with a photoresponsivity of 67.9 A W−1, external quantum efficiency of 3.3 × 104%. More important, the devices showed strong in-plane anisotropy in optoelectronic response and transport properties, e.g. the photocurrent along b-axis was found to be 5 times higher than the values along c-axis under 254 nm UV light, and current ON/OFF ratio and mobility anisotropy is about 2 times high. Our work suggests an optimized synthesis routine for 2D crystals, and the great potential of 2D oxides in functional optoelectronics.",

Band structures and atom-projected densities of states for each system and with differing oxide terminations were calculated, as well as those for the defect-free MoS2-dielectrics system and for isolated dielectric layers for reference.

Here, we characterize these superconductors by extracting the absolute values of the London penetration depth, the superconducting energy gap, and the relative jump in specific heat at the transition temperature from their self-field critical currents. Our central finding is that the enhancement in transition temperature for these materials arises from the opening of an additional superconducting gap, while retaining a largely unchanged bulk superconducting gap. Literature data reveals that ultrathin niobium films similarly develop a second superconducting gap. Based on the available data, it seems that, for type-II superconductors, a new superconducting band appears when the film thickness becomes smaller than the out-of-plane coherence length. The same mechanism may also be the cause of enhanced interface superconductivity.",

In particular, p-n-p transistors in the ballistic regime give access to Klein tunneling physics and allow the realization of devices exploiting the optics-like behavior of Dirac Fermions (DFs) as in the Veselago lens or the Fabry–Perot cavity. Here we propose a Klein tunneling transistor based on the geometrical optics of DFs. We consider the case of a prismatic active region delimited by a triangular gate, where total internal reflection may occur, which leads to the tunable suppression of transistor transmission. We calculate the transmission and the current by means of scattering theory and the finite bias properties using non-equilibrium Greenʼs function (NEGF) simulation.",

However, it was not clear if mass produced flakes of hBN would allow one to achieve an industrially-relevant value of thermal conductivity. Here we demonstrate that laminates of hBN exhibit thermal conductivity of up to 20 W/m·K, which is significantly larger than that currently used in thermal management. We also show that the thermal conductivity of laminates increases with the increasing volumetric mass density, which creates a way of fine tuning its thermal properties.",

Strong in-plane piezoelectricity is their unique property owing to non-centrosymmetric structure, differing from other two dimension (2D) materials, such as graphene and black phosphorus. In this work, we develop a flexible photodiode based on monolayer MoS2 lateral p-n homojunction with significant enhancement in photoresponsivity and detectivity. Piezo-phototronic effect is used to achieve this enhancement by adjusting the barrier height and broadening depletion zone at p-n junction interface under external strain. The wider depletion zone benefits the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, thus enhancing the photocurrent. When a 0.51% external static tensile strain was applied, the photoresponsivity and detectivity are improved up to 1162 A W−1 and 1.72 × 1012 Jones, with about 619% and 319% enhancement compared with strain-free state, respectively. Consequently, this work provides an effective strategy to utilize unavoidable external strain to improve TMDCs-based optoelectronic devices performance. At the same time, it has reference meaning to achieve flexible, low-consumption and high-performance 2D devices without electric gate-control.",

The magnitude of the buckling was found to be 0.94 Å, and the spacing between the germanene and the Al(111) substrate to be 2.51 Å.

The morphology of 2D materials is known vary depending on experimental conditions. For the case of MoS2, the morphology has been shown to vary from rounded (molybdenum rich) domains to equilateral triangular (sulfur rich) domains. These different morphologies can result in drastically different properties, which can be exploited for applications in catalytic reactions, digital electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage. Powder vaporization (PV) synthesis of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can yield vertical domains, however, these domains are often ignored when the morphology evolution of MoS2 is discussed, thereby completely omitting a major part of the impact of the Mo:S ratio to the growth mode of MoS2 during PV. Combining experimental and numerical simulation methods, we reveal a vertical-to-horizontal growth mode transition for MoS2 that occurs in the presence of a molybdenum oxide partial pressure gradient. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the growth of vertical MoS2 results from initial seeding of single crystalline molybdenum dioxide, followed by sulfurization from the substrate upward to form vertically oriented MoS2 domains.",

    "abstract": "Because of unusual properties and fascinating prospects for next-generation device applications, two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted enormous attention since graphene was discovered in 2004. Among the 2D materials beyond graphene, group-IIIA metal-monochalcogenide (MX) monolayers (MLs), are receiving increasing interests because their excellent applications on electronics and optoelectronics. Recently, ferromagnetism and half-metallicity have been predicted in hole-doped GaS and GaSe MLs, which promise exciting potentials for semiconductor spintronics. Detection and measurement of spontaneous magnetization in these 2D materials will be essential for their spintronic applications. The magneto-optical (MO) effects not only are a powerful probe of magnetism in 2D materials but also have valuable applications in high-density data-storage technology. Furthermore, anomalous Hall effect is not only an ideal transport probe of itinerant magnetism but also of considerable current interest because of its topological nature. Here we perform a systematic first-principles density functional study on the MO Kerr and Faraday effects as well as such important magnetic and transport properties as magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) and anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of all hole-doped MX (M = Ga, In; X = S, Se, Te) MLs. In this paper, we report the following important findings: (a) gate-tunable MO effects in MX MLs in a broad range of hole concentration; (b) large Kerr and Faraday rotation angles with Kerr angles comparable to well-known MO 3d-transition-metal multilayers and Faraday angles being among the largest ones reported; (c) tunable MAE and large AHC, making MX MLs suitable for magnetic memory devices current-driven via spin-transfer torque and also promising materials for magnetic field nanosensors with high sensitivity. Superior MO characteristics, together with the other interesting properties, would make MX MLs an excellent family of 2D materials for semiconductor MO and spintronic nanodevices.",

Defects in 2D TMDs are ubiquitous and play crucial roles in understanding and tuning electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. Here we investigate intrinsic point defects in ultrathin 1T-PtSe2 layers grown on mica through the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method, using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) and first-principles calculations. We observed five types of distinct defects from STM topography images and obtained the local density of states (LDOS) of the defects. By combining the STM results with the first-principles calculations, we identified the types and characteristics of these defects, which are Pt vacancies at the topmost and next monolayers, Se vacancies in the topmost monolayer, and Se antisites at Pt sites within the topmost monolayer. Our study shows that the Se antisite defects are the most abundant with the lowest formation energy in a Se-rich growth condition, in contrast to cases of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) family. Our findings would provide critical insight into tuning of carrier mobility, charge carrier relaxation, and electron-hole recombination rates by defect engineering or varying growth condition in few-layer 1T-PtSe2 and other related 2D materials.",

The anisotropy of κ is attributed to the in-plane linear acoustic phonon branches, while the out-of-plane quadratic acoustic phonon branch is almost isotropic.

    "abstract": "A generalized analytical approach is presented to derive closed-form formulae for the elastic moduli of hexagonal multiplanar nano-structures. Hexagonal nano-structural forms are common for various materials. Four different classes of materials (single layer) from a structural point of view are proposed to demonstrate the validity and prospective application of the developed formulae. For example, graphene, an allotrope of carbon, consists of only carbon atoms to form a honeycomb like hexagonal lattice in a single plane, while hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) consists of boron and nitrogen atoms to form the hexagonal lattice in a single plane. Unlike graphene and hBN, there are plenty of other materials with hexagonal nano-structures that have the atoms placed in multiple planes such as stanene (consists of only Sn atoms) and molybdenum disulfide (consists of two different atoms: Mo and S). The physics based high-fidelity analytical model developed in this article are capable of obtaining the elastic properties in a computationally efficient manner for wide range of such materials with hexagonal nano-structures that are broadly classified in four classes from structural viewpoint. Results are provided for materials belonging to all the four classes, wherein a good agreement between the elastic moduli obtained using the proposed formulae and available scientific literature is observed.",

In addition, the inverter has voltage gain greater than unity for VDD ≥ 0.5 V, has open butterfly curves for VDD ≥ 1 V, and achieves static noise margin over 500 mV at VDD = 2.5 V. The voltage gain was found to be insensitive to temperature between 270 and 340 K, and AC large and small-signal operation was demonstrated at frequencies up to 100 kHz.

    "abstract": "By using first-principles simulations, we investigate the interaction of a 2D silicon layer with two classes of chalcogenide-layered compounds, namely MoX2 and GaX (X = S, Se, Te). A rather weak (van der Waals) interaction between the silicene layers and the chalcogenide layers is predicted. We found that the buckling of the silicene layer is correlated to the lattice mismatch between the silicene layer and the MoX2 or GaX template. The electronic properties of silicene on these different templates largely depend on the buckling of the silicene layer: highly buckled silicene on MoS2 is predicted to be metallic, while low buckled silicene on GaS and GaSe is predicted to be semi-metallic, with preserved Dirac cones at the K points. These results indicate new routes for artificially engineering silicene nanosheets, providing tailored electronic properties of this 2D layer on non-metallic substrates. These non-metallic templates also open the way to the possible integration of silicene in future nanoelectronic devices.",

Due to the binding forces induced by functional groups on GO and the interconnected nanoscale channels provided by o-CNT, the thus fabricated Li–S batteries show dramatically improved specific discharge capacities of up to 750 mAh g−1 at 1 C even after 100 cycles, more than twice those of batteries without barrier coatings.",

    "abstract": "Through intercalation of metals and gases the Dirac cone of graphene on Ir(111) can be shifted with respect to the Fermi level without becoming destroyed by strong hybridization. Here, we use x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to measure the C 1s core level shift (CLS) of graphene in contact with a number of structurally well-defined intercalation layers (O, H, Eu, and Cs). By analysis of our own and additional literature data for decoupled graphene, the C 1s CLS is found to be a non-monotonic function of the doping level. For small doping levels the shifts are well described by a rigid band model. However, at larger doping levels, a second effect comes into play which is proportional to the transferred charge and counteracts the rigid band shift. Moreover, not only the position, but also the C 1s peak shape displays a unique evolution as a function of doping level. Our conclusions are supported by intercalation experiments with Li, with which, due to the absence of phase separation, the doping level of graphene can be continuously tuned.",

Herein, atomically thin Co3O4 nanosheets are successfully synthesized and grown directly on the stainless steel mesh as an anode material for SIBs. This anode delivers a high average capacity of 509.2 mAh g−1 for the initial 20 cycles (excluding the first cycle) at 50 mA g−1, presents excellent rate capability with an average capacity of 427.0 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1, and exhibits high cycling stability, which significantly outperforms the electrode prepared from conventional Co3O4 nanostructures, the electrode prepared by conventional casting method, and previously reported Co3O4 electrodes. The superior electrochemical performance is mainly attributable to the atomic thickness of the Co3O4 nanosheets and the direct growth method in electrode processing, which lead to remarkably enhanced surface redox pseudocapacitance and interfacial double layer capacitance. This Na+ capacitive storage mechanism provides a promising strategy for the development of electrode materials with high energy and power densities and ultralong cycle life for SIBs.",

Herein, an atomic-scale microscopic and spectroscopic study is performed to characterize the thermal degradation and re-deposition of solution-exfoliated BP. The in situ decomposition temperature of the BP is observed to be greater than 400 °C. The residual gaseous BP would be re-deposited to form amorphous phosphorus when the chamber was cooled down to room temperature. Moreover, the thickness of the BP flakes can be moderately controlled through thermal thinning process.

Moreover, analytical tools capable of describing and predicting the behavior of the devices (which are necessary before facing mass production) are very scarce. In this work we synthesize a resistive random access memory (RRAM) using graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene (G/h-BN/G) van der Waals structures, and we develop a compact model that accurately describes its functioning. The devices were fabricated using scalable methods (i.e. CVD for material growth and shadow mask for electrode patterning), and they show reproducible resistive switching (RS). The measured characteristics during the forming, set and reset processes were fitted using the model developed. The model is based on the nonlinear Landauer approach for mesoscopic conductors, in this case atomic-sized filaments formed within the 2D materials system. Besides providing excellent overall fitting results (which have been corroborated in log–log, log–linear and linear–linear plots), the model is able to explain the dispersion of the data obtained from cycle-to-cycle in terms of the particular features of the filamentary paths, mainly their confinement potential barrier height.",

Scanning tunneling microscopy shows structural details of WSe2 edges and scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the metallic nature of the oxidized edges. Photoemission demonstrates that the formation of metallic sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxide (WO2.7) is responsible for the high conductivity measured along the edges. Ab initio calculations validate the susceptibility of WSe2 nanoribbon edges to oxidation.

We find that thicker devices (>100 nm) operating in the elastic plate regime exhibit pronounced signatures of mechanical anisotropy, and can lead to new multimode resonant characteristics in terms of mode sequences, shapes, and orientational preferences that are unavailable in nanomechanical resonators made of isotropic materials. In addition, through investigating devices with different geometries, we identify the resonant responses' dependence on crystal orientation in asymmetric devices, and evaluate the effects from the degree of anisotropy. The results suggest a pathway towards harnessing the mechanical anisotropy in black P for building novel 2D nanomechanical devices and resonant transducers with engineerable multimode functions.",

Most low-temperature synthesis utilizes alkali salts, oxide-based metals, and methyl-group based chalcogen precursors which do not meet current BEOL requirements for contaminant-free manufacturing and process scalability. In this study, we benchmark a carbon and alkali salt-free synthesis of fully coalesced, stoichiometric 2D WSe2 films on amorphous SiO2/Si substrates at BEOL- compatible temperatures (475 °C) via gas-source metal-organic chemical deposition. This work highlights the necessity of a Se-rich environment in a kinetically limited growth regime for successful integration of low-temperature 2D WSe2. Atomic-scale characterization reveals that BEOL WSe2 is polycrystalline with domain size of ~200 nm and band gap of 1.8 eV. Back-gated and electrolyte double layer gated field-effect transistors (FETs) exhibit increased ON currents as high as 4 µA µm−1 and ON/OFF ratios of ~106, demonstrating a 100× improvement compared to previously reported BEOL compatible TMDs.",

Correlations of atomic-force microscope and hyperspectral photoluminescence images reveal that the origin of quantum emitters and trion disorder is extrinsic and related to 10 nm tall nanobubbles and 70 nm tall wrinkles, respectively.

However, we find that this mechanism also introduces an energy splitting due to a local field effect, and the whole oscillator strength is contained in the higher-energy component, while the lowest-energy state remains dark and needs an extrinsic spin-flip mechanism for the decay. Rashba effect due to a perpendicular electric field or a dielectric substrate, gives a negligible radiative decay rate (about $10^7$ times slower than that of bright excitons). Spin flip due to Zeeman effect in a sufficiently strong in-plane magnetic field can give a decay rate comparable to that due to the intrinsic interband spin-flip dipole.",

We describe a mild LPE method to produce luminescent suspensions of MoS2 and WS2 in N-methylpyrrolidone or isopropanol/water mixtures, without the need for a purification step. The key differences in our experimental procedure compared to previously reported LPE methods are the use of mild bath sonication at controlled temperature and the low initial concentration of the parent TMDC. Spectroscopic and AFM data confirm that an overwhelming majority of the sample is composed of ultrathin nanosheets. HREM data support the formation of the luminescent 2H polytype. The ultrathin nanosheets can be transferred to pure water and cell culture medium.

Also, as a higher order bulk boundary correspondence is involved here, a three-dimensional (3D) TCI can support one-dimensional (1D) helical edge states. Using first-principles band structure calculations, we identify the van der Waals material -Bi 4 Br 4 as a purely rotation symmetry protected TCI. We show that the surface of Bi 4 Br 4 exhibits a pair of unpinned topological Dirac fermions which are related to the presence of a two-fold rotation axis. These unpinned Dirac fermions possess an exotic spin texture which will be highly favorable for spin transport, and a band structure that consists of van Hove singularities due to a Lifshitz transition. We also identify 1D topological hinge states along the edges of an -Bi 4 Br 4 rod. We comment on how the predicted topological features in -Bi 4 Br 4 could be accessed experimentally.",

The graphene channel is modeled as a parallel resistive–capacitive network with a frequency dependence identical to that of the Drude conductivity with momentum relaxation time ∼2.1 ps, highlighting the influence of AC electron transport on the electromagnetic properties of graphene.

    "abstract": "The growth of two-dimensional (2D) materials is a topic of very high scientific and technological interest. While chemical vapour deposition on catalytic metals has become a well developed approach for the growth of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (BN), very few alternative approaches for synthesis on non-reactive supports have been explored so far. Here we report the growth of BN on gold, using magnetron sputtering of B in N2/Ar atmosphere, a scalable method using only non-toxic reagents. Scanning tunnelling microscopy at low coverage shows primarily triangular monolayer BN islands exhibiting two 'magic' orientations on the Au(111) surface. Such rotational alignment of BN on Au(111) is surprising, given the expected weak binding and the high lattice mismatch (∼14%) between BN and Au. Our observations are consistent with a strong coupling between the edges of BN flakes and the substrate, which leads to the selection of BN orientations that maximize the orbital overlap between edge atoms and Au surface atoms. Diverse flake morphologies resembling the shape of butterflies, six-apex stars and diamonds, implying alternating B- and N- terminated edges, are observed as well. Our results provide insight into the growth mechanisms of 2D materials on weakly interacting and chemically inert substrates, and provide the basis for integrating other 2D materials with atomically precise graphene nanostructures synthesized from molecular precursors on Au.",

    "abstract": "Graphene is hailed as an ideal material for spintronics due to weak intrinsic spin-orbit interaction that facilitates lateral spin transport and tunability of its electronic properties, including a possibility to induce magnetism in graphene. Another promising application of graphene is related to its use as a spacer separating ferromagnetic metals (FMs) in vertical magnetoresistive devices, the most prominent class of spintronic devices widely used as magnetic sensors. In particular, few-layer graphene was predicted to act as a perfect spin filter. Here we show that the role of graphene in such devices (at least in the absence of epitaxial alignment between graphene and the FMs) is different and determined by proximity-induced spin splitting and charge transfer with adjacent ferromagnetic metals, making graphene a weak FM electrode rather than a spin filter. To this end, we report observations of magnetoresistance (MR) in vertical Co-graphene-NiFe junctions with 1 to 4 graphene layers separating the ferromagnets, and demonstrate that the dependence of the MR sign on the number of layers and its inversion at relatively small bias voltages is consistent with spin transport between weakly doped and differently spin-polarized layers of graphene. The proposed interpretation is supported by the observation of an MR sign reversal in biased Co-graphene-hBN-NiFe devices and by comprehensive structural characterization. Our results suggest a new architecture for vertical devices with electrically controlled MR.",

Although interesting scientifically and promising technologically, this process is unattainable in ambient environment, because graphene quickly oxidises at high temperatures. Here, we take the performance of graphene-based incandescent devices to the next level by encapsulating graphene with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Remarkably, we found that the hBN encapsulation provides an excellent protection for hot graphene filaments even at temperatures well above 2000 K. Unrivalled oxidation resistance of hBN combined with atomically clean graphene/hBN interface allows for a stable light emission from our devices in atmosphere for many hours of continuous operation. Furthermore, when confined in a simple photonic cavity, the thermal emission spectrum is modified by a cavity mode, shifting the emission to the visible range spectrum. We believe our results demonstrate that hBN/graphene heterostructures can be used to conveniently explore the technologically important high-temperature regime and to pave the way for future optoelectronic applications of graphene-based systems.",

As a result, we obtained high photo responsivity at zero volt without any electric power, and it appears comparable to those of commercially-optimized Si PN diode. Photo-voltage output of 0.3 V was easily obtained from our vdW PN diode as open circuit voltage, and can be doubled up to 0.6 V by using two PN diodes. These beneficial photovoltaic results from vdW PN diode were directly applied to PV switching dynamics and transistor photo gating, for the first time. We regard that our vdW n-MoS2/p-WSe2 heterojunction diode could maximize its photovoltaic energy benefits with optimized TMDC thicknesses.",

Pure oxygen exposure can dramatically decrease the electron mobility of black phosphorus by over three orders of magnitudes without degrading the hole transport. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization reveals the physisorption nature of oxygen on black phosphorus. Density functional theory calculations identify the unoccupied states of molecular oxygen physisorbed on few-layer black phosphorus, that serves as electron trap but not as hole trap, consistent with the aforementioned mobility modulation. In contrast, oxygen exposure upon light illumination exhibits a significant attenuation for both electron and hole transport, originating from the photoactivated oxidation of black phosphorus, as corroborated by in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Our findings clarify the predominant role of oxygen in modulating transport properties of black phosphorus, thereby providing deeper insight to the design of black phosphorus based complementary electronics.",

These 2D-Te films have unique atomic structures: the Te atoms form trigonal helical chains and are then stacked into hexagonal lattice by van der Waals force, which brings up distinctive transport behaviors. Here we report anisotropic thermal conductivity of suspended 2D-Te films measured by micro-Raman thermometry and the time-domain thermal reflectance (TDTR) method. The in-plane along-chain and cross-chain thermal conductivities are found to be around 2.5 and 1.7 W m−1 K−1, respectively, for thicker films (>100 nm), and reduced to 1.6 and 0.64 W m−1 K−1 for the thinner films (<20 nm). The measured anisotropy is >1.3 for all the films studied. The cross-plane (also across-chain) thermal conductivity is found to be around 0.8 to 1.2 W m−1 K−1 for thicker films, slightly lower than that along the in-plane across-chain direction due to the stronger suppression by the thin film boundary. Theoretical modeling reveals that the anisotropy mainly originates from anisotropic phonon dispersion. The long mean-free-path phonons in Te are also shown to be strongly suppressed by boundary scattering. The large reduction of anisotropic thermal conductivity from the bulk makes it the best single-element thermoelectric material and enables potential thermoelectric generation or cooling devices at room temperature. Our results also provide critical information for thermal management of 2D-Te electronic devices.",

These calculations indicate that despite of their low thermal conductivity, the present TMDs can exhibit large hydrodynamic effects, being comparable to those of graphene, especially for WSe2 at high temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Pressure sensing is one of the key functions for smart electronics. Considerably more effort is required to achieve the fabrication of pressure sensors that can imitate and overcome the sophisticated pressure sensing characteristics in nature and industry, especially in the innovation of materials and structures. Almost all of the pressure sensors reported until now have a high sensitivity at a low-pressure detection limit (<10 kPa). While the exploration of a pressure sensor with a high sensitivity and a high responsivity at a high-pressure is challenging, it is required for next generation smart electronics. Here, we report an exotic heterostructure pressure sensor based on ZnO/chlorine radical-trap doped bilayer graphene (ZGClG) as an ideal channel for pressure sensors. Using this ZGClG as the channel, this study shows the possibility of forming a pressure sensor with a high sensitivity (0.19 kPa−1) and a high responsivity (0.575 s) at V = 1 V on glass substrate. Further, the pressure detection limit of this device was as high as 98 kPa. The investigation of the sensing mechanism under pressure has revealed that the significant improved sensing effect is related to the heavy p-type chlorine trap doping in the channel graphene with chlorine radicals without damaging the graphene. This work indicates that the ZGClG channel used for the pressure sensing device could also provide a simple and essential sensing platform for chemical-, medical-, and biological-sensing for future smart electronics.",

Growth is performed at 450 °C, at which temperature PI is still insulating and flexible. A Flexible photodetector was built directly on the MoS2/PI and showed strong photoresponse.

Key challenges still need to be overcome to ensure effective dispersion and distribution of 2D graphitic fillers throughout the epoxy matrix. 2D filler type, morphology, surface chemistry and dimensions are all important factors in determining filler thermal conductivity and de facto the thermal conductivity of the composite material. To achieve significant enhancement in the thermal conductivity of epoxy composites, different strategies are required to minimise phonon scattering at the interface between the nano-filler and epoxy matrix, including chemical functionalisation of the filler surfaces such that interactions between filler and matrix are promoted and interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) reduced. The combination of graphitic fillers with dimensions on different length scales can potentially form an interconnected multi-dimensional filler network and, thus contribute to enhanced thermal conduction. In this review, we describe the relevant properties of different 2D nano-structured graphitic materials and the factors which determine the translation of the intrinsic thermal conductivity of these 2D materials to epoxy resins. The key challenges and perspectives with regard achieving epoxy composites with significantly enhanced thermal conductivity on addition of 2D graphitic materials are presented.",

Hexagonal boron nitride is used to encapsulate the graphene crystals—without taking part to their detachment from the growth catalyst—and study their intrinsic properties in field-effect devices.

For M3C12S12, their band structures exhibit double Dirac cones with different Fermi velocities that are n and p type, respectively, which are switchable by few-percent strain. The crossing of two cones are symmetry-protected to be non-hybridizing, leading to two independent channels in 2D node-line semimetals at the same k-point akin to spin-channels in spintronics, rendering conetronics device possible. The node line rings right at their crossing, which are both electron and hole pockets at the Fermi level, can give rise to magnetoresistance that will not saturate when the magnetic field is infinitely large, due to perfect n-p compensation. For M3C12O12, together with conjugated metal-tricatecholate polymers M3(HHTP)2, the spin-polarized slow Dirac cone center is pinned precisely at the Fermi level, making the systems conducting in only one spin or cone channel. Quantum anomalous Hall effect can arise in MOFs with non-negligible spin-orbit coupling like Cu3C12O12.

In addition to high sensitivity, the ReS2 sensors exhibit fast response/recovery time and excellent reversibility with minimal hysteresis. Moreover, our fabrication approach involving the direct (1-step) growth of the ReS2 films on an interdigitated electrode (without any transfer using wet chemistry or lithography) greatly simplifies the device architecture and has important practical benefits for the low-cost and scalable deployment of such sensor devices.",

    "abstract": "Corrosion, the degradation of metals and alloys by chemical and/or electrochemical means, is a great challenge to society, its industries and its citizens, both in terms of economics, safety and health. Corrosion barrier technology can be regarded as a special case of the more general problem of preventing the transport of matter towards a certain target. For instance, many electronic devices based on organic compounds, such as OLEDs and organic solar cells, deteriorate rapidly in air due to reactions with oxygen and water vapour. Likewise, air exposure will cause food to alter its taste, colour and/or texture. A common solution for this type of problem is to use a barrier layer that limits or blocks the transport of corrosive or oxidative species from the environment to the target. Graphene and several other 2D materials have excellent impermeability, high mechanical properties, and chemical and thermal stability. While graphene has been proposed as a barrier coating for a range of scenarios, graphene-based barrier layers face a number of limitations and challenges that must be considered, depending on the application. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of these potential roadblocks for graphene-based coatings- A nd related 2D materials-to aid research in this direction, and promote the development of ubiquitous, cheap and powerful barrier technologies based on such ultrathin materials.",

For determination of the crystallographic orientation, the polarization dependence of the A1 modes, measured with the 632.8 nm excitation, turns out to be the most reliable.

The high chemical reactivity of these oxygenated groups makes functionalization difficult to control as different reactions can occur concomitantly. In this study we have investigated the reactivity of GO towards orthogonal reactions to selectively functionalize the hydroxyl groups, which are present in a high amount. We explored both the esterification and the Williamson reaction. Our strategies present the main advantage to occur in mild conditions, thus preserving the intrinsic properties of GO, whereas most reactions reported in literature require relatively harsh conditions, leading to (partial) reduction, and/or are not chemoselective. We have also extended our study to the ketones and examined their derivatization by the Wittig reaction. This work has allowed developing two facile methods for the covalent derivatization of the hydroxyl groups in mild conditions, while GO was not reactive towards the Wittig reaction, probably due to the low amount of ketones. Overall, this work leads to a better understanding of the reactivity of GO for controlled derivatization. This opens promising perspectives for multi-functionalization of GO in order to design graphene-based nanomaterials endowed of multiple properties.",

However, the ability to fully utilize and understand these materials using surface science techniques such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) requires low defect, large area, epitaxial coverage with ultra-clean interfaces. We have developed a chemical vapor deposition van der Waals epitaxy growth process where the metal and chalcogen sources are separated such that growth times can be extended significantly to yield high coverage while minimizing surface contamination. We demonstrate the growth of high quality 2D WS2 over large areas on graphene. The as-grown vertical heterostructures are exceptionally clean as demonstrated by ARPES, STM and spatially resolved photoluminescence mapping. With these correlated techniques we are able to relate defect density to electronic band structure and, ultimately, optical properties. We find that our synthetic approach provides ultra-clean, low defect density (~1012 cm-2), ~10 μm large WS2 monolayer crystals, with an electronic band structure and valence band effective masses that perfectly match the theoretical prediction for pristine WS2.",

    "abstract": "Graphene bioelectronics is a groundbreaking field which emerged roughly 8 years ago offering important opportunities for developing new kinds of sensors capable of establishing an outstanding interface with soft tissue. Graphene-based transistors, as well as electrode arrays, have emerged as a special group of biosensors with their own peculiarities, advantages and drawbacks. In this review, we show the progress of the field from single device measurements to in vivo neuroprosthetic devices. First, the general architectures of device fabrication and their implementation for extracellular recordings are discussed, along with the basic sensing mechanisms essential for their use as sensors. Then state-of-the-art approaches are introduced with a discussion of advantages and drawbacks in the design/measurement architectures. As a whole, the review highlights the results from the ever-growing discipline of graphene bioelectronics and draws reasonable conclusions for future research directions. The possibility of using other device architectures or other 2D materials such as MoS2 and MXenes for the same goal are assessed at the end of this review in order to highlight future challenges and directions towards an efficient 2D materials-to-brain interface.",

    "abstract": "Transistors based on two-dimensional (2D) materials often exhibit hysteresis in their electrical measurements, i.e. a dependence of measured current on voltage sweep direction due to charge trapping. Here we demonstrate a simple pulsed measurement technique which reduces this hysteretic behavior, enabling more accurate characterization of 2D transistors. We compare hysteresis and charge trapping in four types of devices fabricated from both exfoliated and synthetic MoS2, with SiO2 and HfO2 insulators, using DC and pulsed voltage measurements at different temperatures. Applying modest voltage pulses (~1 ms) on the gate significantly reduces charge trapping and results in the elimination of over 80% of hysteresis for all devices. At shorter pulse widths (~1 µs), up to 99% of hysteresis is reduced for some devices. Our measurements enable the extraction of a unique value of field-effect mobility, regardless of voltage sweep direction, unlike measurements that rely on forward or backward DC measurements. This simple and reproducible technique is useful for studying the intrinsic properties of 2D transistors, and can be similarly applied to other nanoscale and emerging devices where charge trapping is of concern.",

However, it is still challenging to fabricate large-area ultrathin 2D films. Herein, we successfully fabricate wafer-size 2D SnSe films on Si substrate by magnetron sputtering technique, enabling the formation of SnSe/Si van der Waals (vdWs) heterojunction device. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy is employed to character the structure of SnSe film and SnSe/Si heterojunction with ideal orthorhombic structure and atomically abrupt interface, respectively. The energy diagram of SnSe/Si heterojunction is constructed, exhibiting similar barrier heights for electron and hole carrier. The SnSe/Si heterojunction shows obvious diode behavior with rectification ratio of ∼1.6 ×10 4 , forward current of ∼194.5 mA cm -2 at ±1.0 V. Furthermore, owing to the high crystalline orientation, specific energy-band alignment, as well as the strong built-in electrical field, the SnSe/Si heterojunction illustrates a broadband photodetecting properties with the wavelength ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared light, showing a high detectivity of 4.4 ×10 12 cmHz 1/2 W -1 , a high responsivity of 566.4 mA mW -1 and an ultrafast response/recovery time of ∼1.6/47.7 s under zero external bias.

    "abstract": "Black phosphorus captures enormous research attention on the anisotropic properties due to its orthorhombic crystal structure. Here the in-plane anisotropic thermoelectric behaviors of bulk black phosphorus crystals in the temperature range from 300 K to 600 K are reported for the first time. Based on the home-grown big size and high-quality black phosphorus crystals, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are simultaneously measured by a ZEM-3 instrument system, and the thermal conductivity is measured by time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR). For each individual parameter, the values along the zigzag and armchair directions show the same temperature-dependent trend. However, the electrical conductivity along the armchair direction is ~ two times of that along the zigzag direction, while the thermal conductivity along the armchair direction is only ~ one third of that along the zigzag direction. Furthermore, the Seebeck coefficients show almost isotropic behavior. As a result, the figure of merit ZT along the armchair direction is as large as ~5.5 times of that along the zigzag direction, exhibiting high anisotropy. The results of intrinsic, orientation-dependent thermoelectric behaviors not only shed light on the fundamental physical properties of black phosphorus but also provide guidelines in the device design for potential thermoelectric applications.",

They can be passivated through charge-transfer doping by laser irradiation in air. Here we perform a systematic in situ study to elucidate the passivation mechanism upon laser irradiation and show a way to controllably n-dope CVD-grown monolayer MoS2 on SiO2 substrates. By combining resonance Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy we show that an increase in defect density correlates with a redshifted PL emission and hence an increase in electron density. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify chalcogen vacancies to be facilitators (not the source) of n-doping, and population of mid-gap levels upon doping lowers the activation barrier for O2 adsorption from 0.3 to 0.03 eV. Laser irradiation aids in the oxygen-passivation of chalcogen vacancies, manifested by an increase in PL intensity and blueshifted emission, and this blueshift is determined by the laser power density. The passivation occurs on two timescales, with the removal of surface adsorbates first, followed by oxygen adsorption at the sulfur vacancy sites.",

Although a general consensus was immediately reached in the former case, in the latter, the mere existence of multilayer silicene was questioned and strongly debated. Here, we demonstrate by means of a comprehensive x-ray crystallographic study that multilayer silicene is effectively realized upon growth at rather low growth temperatures (∼200 °C), while three-dimensional growth of silicon crystallites takes place at higher temperatures, (∼300 °C). This transition to bulk-like silicon perfectly explains the various data presented and discussed in the literature and solves their conflicting interpretations.",

    "abstract": "The thermoelectric figures of merit of pristine two-dimensional materials are predicted to be significantly less than unity, making them uncompetitive as thermoelectric materials. Here we elucidate a new strategy that overcomes this limitation by creating multi-layer nanoribbons of two different materials and allowing thermal and electrical currents to flow perpendicular to their planes. To demonstrate this enhancement of thermoelectric efficiency ZT, we analyse the thermoelectric performance of monolayer molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) sandwiched between two graphene monolayers and demonstrate that the cross-plane (CP) ZT is significantly enhanced compared with the pristine parent materials. For the parent monolayer of MoS2, we find that ZT can be as high as approximately 0.3, whereas monolayer graphene has a negligibly small ZT. In contrast for the graphene/MoS2/graphene heterostructure, we find that the CP ZT can be as large as 2.8. One contribution to this enhancement is a reduction of the thermal conductance of the van der Waals heterostructure compared with the parent materials, caused by a combination of boundary scattering at the MoS2/graphene interface which suppresses the phonons transmission and the lower Debye frequency of monolayer MoS2, which filters phonons from the monolayer graphene. A second contribution is an increase in the electrical conductance and Seebeck coefficient associated with molybdenum atoms at the edges of the nanoribbons.",

To date, SnSe2-based optoelectronic devices have been focused on the visible and infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with efficiency sharply decreasing at longer wavelength. Here, we present SnSe2 photodetectors with exfoliated SnSe2 nanosheets extended in the range of THz frequency, exhibiting high responsivity (170 V W−1), fast speed (2.2 μs), as well as room-temperature operation, based on efficient production of hotelectrons under deep-subwavelength electromagnetic focus, which outperform thermal-based photodetectors. Our SnSe2-based detectors show high-contrast imaging from terahertz (THz) up to visible. The outstanding ambient stability of our broadband photodetectors in a timescale of months is due to the chemical inertness of stoichiometric SnSe2 crystals, validated by surface-science experiments. Our results demonstrate the suitability of SnSe2for multispectral sensing and real-time imaging.",

The inter- and intralayer character of the reported excitonic resonances is fingerprinted with the magneto-optical measurements: excitonic g-factors of opposite sign and of different amplitude are revealed for these two types of resonances.

    "abstract": "MXenes are a rapidly-expanding family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides that have attracted attention due to their excellent performance in applications ranging from energy storage to electromagnetic interference shielding. Numerous other electronic and magnetic properties have been computationally predicted, but not yet realized due to the experimental difficulty in obtaining uniform surface terminations (Tx), necessitating new design approaches for MXenes that are independent of surface terminations. In this study, we distinguished the contributions of surface and sub-surface Ti atoms to the electronic structure of four Ti-containing MXenes (Ti2CTx, Ti3C2Tx, Cr2TiC2Tx, and Mo2TiC2Tx) using soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy. For MXenes with no Ti atoms on the surface transition metal layers, such as Mo2TiC2Tx and Cr2TiC2Tx, our results show minimal changes in the spectral features between the parent MAX phase and its MXene. In contrast, for MXenes with surface Ti atoms, here Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx, the Ti L-edge spectra are significantly modified compared to their parent MAX phase compounds. First principles calculations provide similar trends in the partial density of states derived from surface and sub-surface Ti atoms, corroborating the spectroscopic measurements. These results reveal that electronic states derived from sub-surface M-site layers are largely unperturbed by the surface terminations, indicating a relatively short length scale over which the Tx terminations alter the nominal electron count associated with Ti atoms and suggesting that desired band features should be hosted by sub-surface M-sites that are electronically more robust than their surface M-site counterparts.",

The present issue of Graphene Roadmap Briefs compiles results on the status and prospects of GRM industrialization gathered by several innovation interface investigations (3I) that we conducted throughout the past 3 years. Each 3I study focussed a unique prospective value chain that GRM innovation promises to enable or advance in the future. While individual roadmaps mainly cover the peculiarities of the specific GRM supply chain under investigation, we combine all results regarding the primary material supply sector and it is rapidly evolving innovation context in Europe and beyond here. We introduce both the initial 2018 graphene industrialization roadmap and its thorough 2020 revision and extension. Our conclusions cover both crucial factors hampering the diffusion GRM today and opportunities to overcome these bottlenecks in the future.

    "abstract": "Strong optoelectronic response in the binary van der Waals heterostructures of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is an emerging route towards high-sensitivity light sensing. While the high sensitivity is an effect of photogating of graphene due to inter-layer transfer of photo-excited carriers, the impact of intrinisic defects, such as traps and mid-gap states in the chalcogen layer remain largely unexplored. Here we employ graphene/hBN (hexagonal boron nitride)/MoS2 (molybdenum disulphide) trilayer heterostructures to explore the photogating mechanism, where the hBN layer acts as interfacial barrier to tune the charge transfer timescale. We find two new features in the photoresponse: First, an unexpected positive component in photoconductance upon illumination at short times that preceeds the conventional negative photoconductance due to charge transfer, and second, a strong negative photoresponse at infrared wavelengths (up to 1720 nm) well-below the band gap of single layer MoS2. Detailed time and gate voltage-dependence of the photoconductance indicates optically-driven charging of trap states as possible origin of these observations. The responsivity of the trilayer structure in the infrared regime was found to be extremely large (> 108 A/W at 1550 nm using 20 mV source drain bias at 180 K temperature and ≈ −30 V back gate voltage). Our experiment demonstrates that interface engineering in the optically sensitive van der Waals heterostructures may cast crucial insight onto both inter- and intra-layer charge reorganization processes in graphene/TMDC heterostructures.",

A new field, expected to grow in the near future, focuses on the non-linear electrical and optical responses of topological materials, where fundamental questions are once more being asked about the intertwining roles of the Berry curvature and disorder scattering.

    "abstract": "Inhibiting the polysulfide shuttle while maintaining high sulfur loading of sulfur cathode has been regarded as the major barriers to the practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries. To address these issues, a sandwich composite of hollow porous carbon spheres (HPCSs) and conductive delaminated-MXene nanosheets (d-Ti3C2) is designed by an electrostatic self-assembly approach as the sulfur hosts (denoted as HPCSs@d-Ti3C2). The hollow and porous merits of HPCSs can provide sufficient space for sulfur loading, while the conductive and polar MXene can chemisorb or bond polysulfides to inhibit the shuttle effect. Optimized packing of zero-dimensional (0D) HPCSs on 2D MXene nanosheets can not only accommodate volume expansion during polysulfide adsorption and conversion, but also prevent the aggregation of HPCSs to extend the lifetime of Li-S batteries. Consequently, the HPCSs@d-Ti3C2/S cathode with a high sulfur content of 76.5% has a strong physical and chemical co-adsorbing and/or chemical bonding with polysulfides to suppress the shuttle effect, and thus delivers satisfied sulfur utilization, rate capacities and cycling stability (only a capacity decay ratio of 0.069% per cycle on average). Such proposed design based on synergistic effects via nanoengineering is expected to be applicable to a large amount of MXene derived materials for various energy storage devices.",

We have observed peculiar magnetic Meissner effect in 2D Nb2C MXene leading to signatures of superconductivity in the material with an onset transition temperature of 12.5 K. Systematically optimized chemical etching process of bulk Nb2AlC MAX phase led to the formation of 2D Nb2C MXene as confirmed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) indicating a significant increase in the c-lattice parameter from 13.83 Å to 22.72 Å. The Meissner effect and its unusual magnetic nature is observed using superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID: Quantum Design). Fittings of experimentally obtained lower and upper critical fields as a function of temperature to the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory confirms possibility of presence of type-II superconductivity in our Nb2C samples. This peculiar magnetic behaviour, observed in as-synthesized Nb2C MXene in powder form is intrinsic property of our sample. It is to be noted that we have tried to measure the transport properties of our sample but due to its powdered nature, this was not possible.

Two dimensional MoS 2 crystals fabricated by chemical vapor deposition or micromechanical exfoliation are transferred onto flexible substrates and subjected to biaxial tension on a carefully designed and assessed loading stage with high accuracy and control. The successful stress transfer from substrate to the overlying 2D crystal is identified by in-situ monitoring of the strain-induced phonon frequency and photoluminescence peak shifts. Reliable values for the mode Grüneisen parameters and exciton deformation potentials were obtained by studying a significant number of crystals. The experimental results are backed by density functional theory calculations and are in good agreement with the experiments.

In room-temperature LFRS experiments on both, twisted MoSe 2 homobilayers and twisted MoSe 2 –WSe 2 heterobilayers, we observe moiré phonons, i.e. folded acoustic phonon modes due to the moiré superlattice. In the heterobilayers, we can identify moiré phonons of both materials, MoSe 2 and WSe 2 . While the twist angles for the homobilayers are relatively precisely known from the applied tear-and-stack preparation method, the twist angles of the heterobilayers have to be determined via second-harmonic-generation microscopy on monolayer regions of the samples, which has significant uncertainties. We show that by the moiré phonons of the heterobilayers, the relative twist angles can be determined on a local scale with much higher precision. We apply our technique for the investigation of a large area H-type (twist angle θ = 60 ∘ + δ ) MoSe 2 –WSe 2 heterobilayer. These investigations show that spatial regions, which can be identified to be atomically reconstructed (i.e. δ = 0 ∘ ) by the observation of an interlayer shear mode in LFRS experiments, exhibit a strong, momentum-allowed interlayer-exciton signal in low-temperature µ PL.

For MoSe 2 /WSe 2 heterostructures, strong hybridization of both single particle and excitonic states can occur via single particle tunnelling.

    "abstract": "Abstract Magnetic anisotropy is an important characteristic of magnetic materials. Particularly, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is superior for the design of spintronic devices, with the advantages of scalability, endurance, thermal stability, and low switching current density. Although a series of two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-2D layered ferromagnets have been demonstrated, the room temperature intrinsic ferromagnets with PMA is rarely found. Here, we report PMA in a room-temperature layered ferromagnet of Cr-intercalated CrTe 2 . By self-intercalation of the native Cr atoms, the in-plane anisotropy of CrTe 2 can be switched to PMA. Meanwhile, the Cr-intercalated CrTe 2 crystal can be easily exfoliated into thin flakes with thickness ∼10 nm. Besides the robust PMA at room temperature, Cr-intercalated CrTe 2 also exhibits high saturation magnetization (208 emu cm −3 at 300 K), large anomalous Hall angle (2.23% at 300 K) and giant anomalous Hall factor (∼0.18 at 300 K). These excellent properties are highly desired for applications, and make Cr-intercalated CrTe 2 a distinguished candidate among all existing magnetic materials. Our work reveals a promising platform for spintronic devices and offers a new route for controlling the magnetic anisotropy in layered materials.",

When the chemical potential is close to Dirac points, oppositely moving electrons on the Fermi surface undergo an interference phenomenon in which the Berry phase converts a repulsive electron-electron interaction into an effective attraction. The topology of the superconducting phase manifests as gapped edge modes in the quasiparticle spectrum and Majorana Kramers pairs at the corners. We present symmetry arguments which constrain the possible form of the electron-electron interactions in these systems and classify the possible superconducting phases which result. Exact diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian confirms the existence of gapped edge states and Majorana corner states, which strongly depend on the spatial structure of the gap.

    "abstract": "MXenes are technologically interesting 2D materials that show potential in numerous applications. The properties of the MXenes depend at large extent on the selection of elements that build the 2D MX-layer. Another key parameter for tuning the attractive material properties is the species that terminate the surfaces of the MX-layers. Although being an important parameter, experimental studies on the bonding between the MX-layers and the termination species are few and thus an interesting subject of investigation. Here we show that the termination species fluorine (F) bonds to the Ti3C2-surface mainly through Ti 3p - F 2p hybridization and that oxygen (O) bonds through Ti 3p - O 2p hybridization with a significant contribution of Ti 3d and Ti 4p. The study further shows that the Ti3C2-surface is not only terminated by F and O on the threefold hollow face-centered-cubic (fcc) site. A significant amount of O sits on a bridge site bonded to two Ti surface atoms on the Ti3C2-surface. In addition, the results provide no support for hydroxide (OH) termination on the Ti3C2-surface. On the contrary, the comparison of the valence band intensity distribution obtained through ultraviolet- and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with computed spectra by density of states, weighed by matrix elements and sensitivity factors, reveals that OH cannot be considered as an inherent termination species in Ti3C2Tx. The results from this study have implications for correct modeling of the structure of MXenes and the corresponding materials properties. Especially in applications where surface composition and charge are important, such as supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, electrocatalysis, and fuel- and solar cells, where intercalation processes are essential.",

We decouple defects, doping and carbonaceous contamination using control (hBN covered and encapsulated MoS 2 ) samples. We observe cryogenic photoluminescence quenching and defect peaks, and find that carbonaceous contamination does not affect defect creation.

    "abstract": "Abstract Layered transition metal carbides or nitrides (MXenes), as a novel two-dimensional material, are widely used in the field of electromagnetic (EM) functions and devices due to their unique EM properties. However, the excessive conductivity of MXenes nanosheets often causes impedance mismatch, resulting in a single EM function. Moreover, original MXenes nanosheets are too small in size and needed to be dispersed in the matrix during application, resulting in inconvenience and unstable performance. Architecture strategy is an effective way to handle these problems. Assembling MXenes nanosheets into hierarchical structures, on the one hand, can effectively tailor conductivity, optimize impedance, and tune the EM response of MXenes, achieving multiple EM functions, on the other hand, can obtain directly usable macro assemblies. Herein, we systematically summarize various methods for fabricating MXenes hierarchical architectures, gaining deep insight into the EM response mechanism. Subsequently, the multiple EM functions including EM absorption and EM interference shielding were concluded. More importantly, rich progress has been made in EM functional devices based on MXene, but there is no review in this regard. We have provided a comprehensive summary of relevant excellent work in this review. Ultimately, we have provided insightful commentary on the challenges in this area and predicted the future direction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The energy landscape of optical excitations in mono- and few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is dominated by optically bright and dark excitons. These excitons can be fully localized within a single TMD layer, or the electron- and the hole-component of the exciton can be charge-separated over multiple TMD layers. Such intra- or interlayer excitons have been characterized in detail using all-optical spectroscopies, and, more recently, photoemission spectroscopy. In addition, there are so-called hybrid excitons whose electron- and/or hole-component are delocalized over two or more TMD layers, and therefore provide a promising pathway to mediate charge-transfer processes across the TMD interface. Hence, an in-situ characterization of their energy landscape and dynamics is of vital interest. In this work, using femtosecond momentum microscopy combined with many-particle modeling, we quantitatively compare the dynamics of momentum-indirect intralayer excitons in monolayer WSe 2 with the dynamics of momentum-indirect hybrid excitons in heterobilayer WSe 2 /MoS 2 , and draw three key conclusions: First, we find that the energy of hybrid excitons is reduced when compared to excitons with pure intralayer character. Second, we show that the momentum-indirect intralayer and hybrid excitons are formed via exciton-phonon scattering from optically excited bright excitons. And third, we demonstrate that the efficiency for phonon absorption and emission processes in the mono- and the heterobilayer is strongly dependent on the energy alignment of the intralayer and hybrid excitons with respect to the optically excited bright exciton. Overall, our work provides microscopic insights into exciton dynamics in TMD mono- and bilayers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Manipulating the interlayer twist angle is a powerful tool to tailor the properties of layered two-dimensional crystals. The twist angle has a determinant impact on these systems’ atomistic structure and electronic properties. This includes the corrugation of individual layers, formation of stacking domains and other structural elements, and electronic structure changes due to the atomic reconstruction and superlattice effects. However, how these properties change with the twist angle, θ , is not yet well understood. Here, we monitor the change of twisted bilayer (tBL) MoS 2 characteristics as a function of θ . We identify distinct structural regimes, each with particular structural and electronic properties. We employ a hierarchical approach ranging from a reactive force field through the density-functional-based tight-binding approach and density-functional theory.

Our results show at which range of θ the characteristic features of the reconstruction, namely extended stacking domains, the soliton network, and superlattice, emerge and give rise to exciting electronics.

    "abstract": "Abstract The substrate is one of the key components that determines the quality of the epitaxial layers. However, the implications of growing two-dimensional layers on three-dimensional bulk substrates have not yet been fully understood, and these implications need to be studied for different combinations of materials and substrates. Here, we present a study that addresses the influence of the sapphire substrate off-cut angle on the final growth of two-dimensional layers of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). A two-step wafer-scale process was used in one epitaxial MOVPE procedure. The main process starts with a self-limiting continuous growth of a BN buffer followed by flow-modulated epitaxy in the second step, and is used to study substrates with different off-cuts angles, pre-growth nitridation steps, and post-growth annealing. An initial nitridation step at the growth temperature allowed for the growth of an AlN sublayer. This layer is shown to smooth out the underlying sapphire and establishes an ‘effective’ sapphire/AlN substrate. This step is also responsible for enforcing a specific growth of the BN layer in a crystallographic orientation, which is shown to strongly deviate from the substrate for off-cut angles larger than 0.3°. A substrate with off-cut angle of 1° clearly yields the highest quality of h-BN layers as evidenced by the lowest amount of debris on the surface, most intense x-ray diffraction signal, minimal Raman phonon line width and thinnest amorphous BN (a-BN) at the interface with the effective substrate. Our study shows that the off-cut angles of sapphire substrates strongly influence the final epitaxial h-BN, clearly indicating the importance of optimal substrate preparation for the growth of two-dimensional BN layers. Post-growth annealing in N 2 atmosphere at 800 °C improves the top surface morphology of the final stack, as well as suppresses further the presence of a-BN.",

Here, we demonstrate a high-performance photodetector based on high-quality ternary Ta 2 NiSe 5 nanosheets with a narrow bandgap of 0.25 eV. The photodetectors exhibit broadband photodetection capability in the visible-infrared (IR) spectrum (405–2200 nm) at room temperature. The maximum values of responsivity can reach up to 280 A W −1 at the wavelength of 405 nm. Meanwhile, the high responsivity of 63.9 A W −1 and detectivity of 3.8 × 10 9 Jones are achieved at the wavelength of 2200 nm, respectively. In addition, the obtained Ta 2 NiSe 5 -based photodetector shows excellent flexibility and the photodetection performance is almost insignificantly degraded after 1000 bending cycles. These results indicate that the 2D Ta 2 NiSe 5 semiconductor has great potential in future wearable IR optoelectronic devices.",

Here we study spin–orbit coupling and exchange coupling engineering of graphene states in the proximity of 1T-TaS 2 not triggering the twist, but a charge density wave (CDW) in 1T-TaS 2 —a realistic low-temperature phase. Using density functional theory and effective model we found that the emergence of the CDW in 1T-TaS 2 significantly enhances Rashba spin–orbit splitting in graphene and tilts the spin texture by a significant Rashba angle—in a very similar way as in the conventional twist-angle scenarios. Moreover, the partially filled Ta d -band in the CDW phase leads to the spontaneous emergence of the in-plane magnetic order that transgresses via proximity from 1T-TaS 2 to graphene, hence, simultaneously superimposing along the spin–orbit also the exchange coupling proximity effect. To describe this intricate proximity landscape we have developed an effective model Hamiltonian and provided a minimal set of parameters that excellently reproduces all the spectral features predicted by the first-principles calculations. Conceptually, the CDW provides a highly interesting knob to control the fine features of electronic states and to tailor the superimposed proximity effects—a sort of twistronics without twist .",

However, the performance of photodetectors based on monolayer WS 2 is restricted to weak light absorption. Here, AgInGaS quantum dots (AIGS-QDs) with a large absorption coefficient and high quantum efficiency are integrated onto WS 2 atomic layers to achieve excellent photoelectric performance. Notably, the observed photoluminescence (PL) quenching and the reduction of the decay time of PL in the WS 2 /AIGS-QDs heterojunction confirm the interfacial charge transfer from AIGS-QDs to WS 2 layer. The results show that type II energy band arrangement leads to the efficient separation of photoexcited carriers at the interface between WS 2 and AIGS-QDs. This WS 2 /AIGS-QDs photodetector achieves an ultrahigh responsivity ( R ) of 3.3 × 10 3 A W −1 , an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.8 × 10 6 % and a detectivity ( D *) of 1.3 × 10 13 Jones.

For some types of crystals, e.g. crystalline films, surfaces, or planar interfaces, it is more appropriate to assume a two-dimensional (2D) lattice. With this assumption the structure can be classified by one of the 80 layer group types. We have implemented an algorithm to determine the layer group type of a 3D structure with a 2D lattice, and applied it to more than 15 000 monolayer structures in the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB). We compare the classification of monolayers by layer groups and space groups, respectively. The latter is defined as the space group of the 3D bulk structure obtained by repeating the monolayer periodically in the direction perpendicular to the 2D lattice (AA-stacking). By this correspondence, nine pairs of layer group types are mapped to the same space group type due to the inability of the space group to distinguish the in-plane and out-of-plane axes. In total 18% of the monolayers in the C2DB belong to one of these layer group pairs and are thus not properly classified by the space group type. Our results show that symmetry classification of 2D materials should be based on layer groups rather than the commonly used space groups.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Among a huge variety of known two-dimensional (2D) materials, some of them have anisotropic crystal structures; examples include different systems such as a few-layer black phosphorus (phosphorene), beryllium nitride BeN 4 , the van der Waals magnet CrSBr, and rhenium dichalcogenides ReX 2 . As a consequence, their optical and electronic properties are highly anisotropic as well. In some cases, the anisotropy results in not only smooth renormalization of observable properties in comparison with the isotropic case, but in the appearance of dramatically new physics. The examples are hyperbolic plasmons and excitons, strongly anisotropic ordering of adatoms at the surface of 2D or van der Waals materials, and essential changes in transport and superconducting properties. Here, we present a systematic review of the electronic structure, transport, and optical properties of several representative groups of anisotropic 2D materials, including semiconductors, anisotropic Dirac and semi-Dirac materials, and superconductors.",

These compounds have recently been proposed to exhibit coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order leading to a switchable anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). Using both spin-spiral and self-consistent spin-orbit coupled calculations, we predict an in-plane 120° cycloid of trimerized spins as the ground state for Nb 3 Cl 8 . For Nb 3 Br 8 and Nb 3 I 8 we find long period incommensurate helical order. We calculate a number of magnetic properties such as the exchange constants, orbital magnetization, and Curie-Weiss transition temperatures, which are in good agreement with experimental values for the bulk compounds. It is then shown that, despite having both broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, the proposed AVHE and linear ME response are forbidden by the presence of helical order in the ground state. In addition, the computed switching trajectory demonstrates that it is unlikely that the polar state of the monolayers can be switched with a homogeneous electric field due to an unusual equation of state of the out-of-plane dipole moment. Nevertheless, we highlight that in the presence of a strong electric field, the trimerized spins in Nb 3 Cl 8 will exhibit a magnetic phase transition from the 120° cycloid to out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, which restores the symmetry required for both AVHE and linear ME effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) materials have garnered significant attention due to their diverse compositions, pronounced excitonic effects and exceptional optoelectronic properties, providing a compelling platform for assembling the van der Waals heterostructures to explore novel physical phenomena and develop multifunctional applications. The highly tunable band structures of these materials allow for variable band alignments, facilitating detailed studies of charge and energy transfer processes, providing critical insights for the material selection, structural design, performance improvement and device optimization. In this perspective, we put emphasize on the van der Waals stacking of 2D perovskites and monolayer TMDs, specifically focusing the interlayer coupling in hybrid heterostructures exhibiting type II band alignments. We present a comprehensive review of the formation of interlayer excitons (IXs), supported by both theoretical calculations and experimental observations. The chemical tunability of the component layers enables robust and controllable IX characteristics over a broad spectral range, independent of stacking angles or lattice mismatch, and can be further manipulated by external fields, offering additional degrees of control. The unique coupled spin-valley physics of monolayer TMDs, combined with the and chiral-induced spin selectivity effects or Rashba splitting effects in 2D perovskites, can further introduce circular polarization to IXs. Finally, we conclude by outlining key challenges in advancing these material systems and understanding physical mechanisms, offering perspectives on future development for next-generation optoelectronic and valleytronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thermal management in the mid-infrared (MIR) range is gaining critical importance across diverse applications, such as in energy-efficient architecture and sophisticated electronic thermal regulation. However, traditional materials are often constrained by insufficient thermal conductivity, limited spectral flexibility, and susceptibility to degradation under extreme conditions, all of which undermine their effectiveness in the MIR domain. Although two-dimensional (2D) materials, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes), have garnered considerable attention for addressing these limitations, a thorough understanding of their structural advantages specific to MIR thermal management remains scarce. This review seeks to bridge this gap by offering a detailed structural analysis of these 2D materials within the context of MIR applications. Initially, the inherent structural features of graphene, h-BN, and MXenes are examined, illustrating how these enable advanced MIR functionalities, such as efficient radiative heating, cooling, and dynamic modulation. Subsequently, an in-depth evaluation of their performance across various application areas is provided, including thermal radiation control and spectral regulation, with insights into their domain-specific advantages. Finally, also explores the challenges and proposes future directions, highlighting structural design strategies aimed at enhancing their applicability in MIR thermal management. This review not only underscores the unique potential of 2D materials but also provides a strategic framework to inform future research and innovation in MIR thermal management technologies.&amp;#xD;",

    "abstract": "Despite the unique properties of black phosphorus (BP) and phosphorene, including high carrier mobility and in-plane anisotropy, their stability has been hampered by significant crystal deterioration upon exposure to oxygen and water. Herein, we investigate the chemical stability of MoS2-passivated black phosphorus (BP) or bilayer (2L) phosphorene van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures using the field-effect transistor (FET) and phototransistor effects, measuring the persistence of conductivity and carrier mobility upon atmospheric exposure. Four thicknesses of MoS2-passivated BP FETs were studied at 1.5 (assigned to bilayer), 5, 13, and 20 nm to elucidate the effects of the MoS2 passivation layer on the device stability and electrical characteristics under dark and illumination (wavelength, λ = 600 nm) conditions. We find that trilayer MoS2 passivation enhances the photoresponse of a 2L-phosphorene optoelectronic heterojunction by 78% without gate bias. When in contact with a trilayer MoS2 layer, the photoluminescence quantum yield of the phosphorene bilayer crystal apparently decreases 29%. This can be attributed to the difference in absorption in the BP layer induced by the interference color effect generated by the presence of the thin MoS2 layer as well as a built-in electric field that forms at the BP-MoS2 p-n interface helps to dissociate photo-generated electron–hole pairs, thereby reducing the probability of the recombination events. The effectiveness of a trilayer MoS2 as a vdW protection layer is tested by exposing BP-MoS2 vdW vertical heterostructures to the ambient environment for up to 3 weeks as well as annealing at high temperature (350 °C) in an inert Ar environment. We find that the MoS2 passivation layer reduces the dark current of bilayer phosphorene, but this effect decreases with thickness. Thus, we find that 2D MoS2 thin passivation layers provide specific chemical stability and electro-optical enhancement for transparent, flexible BP electronic and optoelectronic devices by acting not only as an atomically thin passivation layer, but also enhancing the photoresponse.",

We obtain theoretical values of monolayer talc breaking strength that are near graphene's record values and its 2D elastic modulus. We also predict that the flexural rigidity of monolayer talc should be more than thirty times larger than that of graphene, but that it could still be bent to very small curvatures without fracturing.",

    "abstract": "The emerging field of valleytronics aims to exploit the valley pseudospin of electrons residing near Bloch band extrema as an information carrier. Recent experiments demonstrating optical generation and manipulation of exciton valley coherence (the superposition of electron-hole pairs at opposite valleys) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a critical step towards control of this quantum degree of freedom. The charged exciton (trion) in TMDs is an intriguing alternative to the neutral exciton for control of valley pseudospin because of its long spontaneous recombination lifetime, its robust valley polarization, and its coupling to residual electronic spin. Trion valley coherence has however been unexplored due to experimental challenges in accessing it spectroscopically. In this work, we employ ultrafast two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy to resonantly generate and detect trion valley coherence in monolayer MoSe2 demonstrating that it persists for a few-hundred femtoseconds. We conclude that the underlying mechanisms limiting trion valley coherence are fundamentally different from those applicable to exciton valley coherence.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received great attentions because of diverse quantum electronic states such as topological insulating (TI), Weyl semimetallic (WSM) and superconducting states. Recently, the superconducting states emerged in pressurized semimetallic TMDs such as MoTe2 and WTe2 have become one of the central issues due to their predicted WSM states. However, the difficulty in synthetic control of chalcogen vacancies and the ambiguous magneto transport properties have hindered the rigorous study on superconducting and WSM states. Here, we report the emergence of superconductivity at 2.1 K in Te-deficient orthorhombic Td-MoTe2−x with an intrinsic electron-doping, while stoichiometric monoclinic 1T'-MoTe2 shows no superconducting state down to 10 mK, but exhibits a large magnetoresistance of 32 000% at 2 K in a magnetic field of 14 T originating from nearly perfect compensation of electron and hole carriers. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and synchrotron x-ray diffraction combined with theoretical calculations clarify that Te vacancies trigger superconductivity via intrinsic electron doping and the evolution of the Td phase from the 1T' phase below 200 K. Unlike the pressure-induced superconducting state of monoclinic MoTe2, this Te vacancy-induced superconductivity is emerged in orthorhombic MoTe2, which is predicted as Weyl semimetal, via electron-doping. This chalcogen vacancy induced-superconductivity provides a new route for cultivating superconducting state together with WSM state in 2D van der Waals materials.",

Optimization in terms of process parameters were done to obtain 2D ZnO over 2D graphene which shows decrease in bandgap and broad absorption range from UV to visible. Under compressive strain piezopotential induced by the atoms displacements in 2D ZnO, 87% enhanced photosensing for UV light was observed under 30% strain. This excellent performance improvement can be attributed to piezopotential induced under compressive strain in 2D ZnO which results in lowering of conduction band energy and raising the schottky barrier height thereby facilitating electron–hole pair separation in 2D Gr/ZnO junction.

Two different types of hybrid systems are considered in detail: (i) graphene/boron nitride/ferromagnetic metal (cobalt or nickel), and (ii) graphene/magnetic insulator (YIG). The main interest is focused on the proximity-induced exchange interaction between graphene and magnetic substrate and on the proximity-enhanced spin–orbit coupling. The proximity effects are shown to have a significant influence on the electronic and spin transport properties of graphene. To find the spin, anomalous and valley Hall conductivities we employ certain effective Hamiltonians which have been proposed recently for the hybrid systems under considerations. Both anomalous and valley Hall conductivities are shown to have universal values when the Fermi level is inside the energy gap in the electronic spectrum.",

Here we investigate how the CDW transition is changed for single to few layers compared to bulk TiSe2. TiSe2 grown by molecular beam epitaxy on HOPG- or MoS2-substrates is characterized by variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We show that the CDW state persists for the monolayer but the transition temperature TCDW is significantly increased compared to the bulk. Furthermore, TCDW is strongly dependent on the substrate material. Within the model of an excitonic insulator phase for TiSe2, the substrate dependence may be associated with variations of the excitonic binding energies by the dielectric properties of the substrate. Interestingly, for single layer TiSe2 on HOPG we also observe peaks in the tunneling spectra below 50 K, which are tentatively assigned to coherence peaks of an excitonic condensate. The peaks are observed below TCDW of ~230 K, suggesting that an excitonic insulator induced CDW can exist without a phase coherent state.",

Bismuth selenide, Bi2Se3, and niobium diselenide, NbSe2, are used to demonstrate this chemistry. Atomic intercalation is performed in solution using decomposition of zero-valent coordination compounds at low temperatures (∼50 °C–170 °C) or reduction with tin chloride. This host of chemical routes is non-destructive, general for chalcogens, and can be used to intercalate some lighter elements as well. These intercalation reactions more than double the current number of atomic intercalants and give access to unique physical properties including heterostructures, charge density waves, and polytypic superlattice structures.",

It is found that the deformation and failure of PNRs are highly anisotropic. For AC PNRs, three stages were identified upon straining: the initial 'linear elastic' stage, which is closely related to the interactions between the adjacent nanoribbon puckers, followed by the 'bond rotation' stage, where the puckered structure of the phosphorene is flattened via bond rotation, and finally the 'bond stretching' stage, where the P–P bonds are strained up to the rupture limit. The failure is caused by the breaking of the most strained bonds, which are located in specific rows. For ZZ PNRs, however, the applied tensile strain leads to direct bond stretching and the final bond breakings are uniformly distributed across ZZ PNRs. It is also found that AC PNRs have a large failure strain ( ≈ 0.5), but a low failure stress (σ ≈ 50 GPa), whereas ZZ PNRs have a low failure strain ( ≈ 0.1), but a high failure stress (σ ≈ 100 GPa). For both AC and ZZ PNRs, their failure strain is insensitive while their failure stress is only moderately sensitive to the width.",

We thus investigate the electronic properties of such new hybrid structures by systematically considering possible interface configurations. Our results obtained with density-functional theorem reveal that interface has significant impact on electronic properties. Specifically, for heterostructures with a zigzag type of interface, electronic states are found to be spin-polarized, and a half-metallic phase is identified when the graphene domain is terminated with zigzag edges. For heterostructures with an armchair type of interface, electronic states display a robust semiconducting behavior.

    "abstract": "It has been known that the crystalline orientation of Cu substrates plays a crucial role in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of high-quality graphene. In particular, Cu (1 1 1) surface showing the minimum lattice mismatch with graphene is expected to provide an ideal catalytic reactivity that can minimize the formation of defects, which also induces larger single-crystalline domain sizes of graphene. Usually, the Cu (1 1 1) substrates can be epitaxially grown on single-crystalline inorganic substrates or can be recrystallized by annealing for more than 12 h, which limits the cost and time-effective synthesis of graphene. Here, we demonstrate a new method to optimize the crystalline orientations of vertically suspended Cu foils by tension control during graphene growth, resulting in large-area recrystallization into Cu (1 1 1) surface as the applied tension activates the grain boundary energy of Cu and promotes its abnormal grain growth to single crystals. In addition, we found a clue that the formation of graphene cooperatively assists the recrystallization into Cu (1 1 1) by minimizing the surface energy of Cu. The domain sizes and charge carrier mobility of graphene grown on the single-crystalline Cu (1 1 1) are 5 times and ~50% increased, respectively, in comparison with those of graphene from Cu (1 0 0), indicating that the less lattice mismatch and the lower interaction energy between Cu (1 1 1) and graphene allows the growth of larger single-crystalline graphene with higher charge carrier mobility. Thus, we believe that our finding provides a crucial idea to design a roll-to-roll (R2R) graphene synthesis system where the tension control is inevitably involved, which would be of great importance for the continuous production of high-quality graphene in the future.",

Lead intercalation between graphene and Ir(1 1 1) reduces the coupling to the metallic substrate in such a way that its corrugation becomes negligible and distortions of the linear dispersion largely disappear, while graphene's sublattice symmetry is maintained and it turns out to be n-doped. Remarkably, the spin–orbit splittings induced by the proximity of the Ir(1 1 1) surface are preserved after Pb intercalation in a wide energy range. We further show that the Pb/Ir(1 1 1) surface induces a complex spin texture with both in-plane and out-of-plane components. Our calculations reveal the origin of the out-of-plane spin components in graphene to trace back to the out-of-plane spin-polarized surface and resonance states of Ir(1 1 1), while the Pb interlayer on its own does not induce any vertical spin polarization in the carbon sheet. However, the Brillouin zone folding imposed by the rectangular symmetry of the intercalated Pb layer plays an instrumental role in the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) transfer to graphene, as well as in the linearization of its bands. Finally, since no sizeable gap is observed at the Dirac point, we suggest that an intrinsic (Kane and Mele type) SOC does not exceed the extrinsic (Rashba) SOC for graphene on Pb/Ir(1 1 1).",

Here, we show that a tilted magnetic field together with a short-range impurity, such as a vacancy, a substitutional defect, or an adatom, can give rise to a coupling between the qubit basis states. This mechanism renders the in-plane g-factor nonzero, and allows to control the qubit with an in-plane ac electric field, akin to electrically driven spin resonance. We evaluate the dependence of the in-plane g-factor and the electrically induced qubit Rabi frequency on the type and position of the impurity. We reveal highly unconventional features of the coupling mechanism, arising from symmetry-forbidden intervalley scattering, in the case when the impurity is located at a S site.

In this connection, it is very important to understand the Fermi level pinning (FLP) which occurs at metal–semiconductor interfaces. It is known that MoS2 has an n-type contact with Au, which is a high work function metal, representing the strong FLP at Au–MoS2 interfaces. However, such FLP can obstruct the attainment of high performance of field effect devices. In this study, we investigate the reduction of FLP at Au–MoS2 interfaces by atomic passivation on Au(111) using first-principles calculations. To reduce the FLP at Au–MoS2 interfaces, we consider sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, and hydrogen atoms that can passivate the surface of Au(111). Calculations show that passivating atoms prevent the direct contact between Au(111) and MoS2, and thus FLP at Au–MoS2 interfaces is reduced by weak interaction between atom-passivated Au(111) and MoS2. Especially, FLP is greatly reduced at sulfur-passivated Au–MoS2 interfaces with the smallest binding energy. Furthermore, fluorine-passivated Au(111) can form ohmic contact with MoS2, representing almost zero Schottky barrier height (SBH). We suggest that SBH can be controlled depending on the passivating atoms on Au(111).",

A favorable thermal performance makes these structures excellent candidates for integrated heat management units. Here we show combined experimental and theoretical studies for MoS2 nanosheets in a nanoscale grain-size limit. We report thermal conductivity measurements on 5 nm thick polycrystalline MoS2 by means of 2-laser Raman thermometry. The free-standing, drum-like MoS2 nanomembranes were fabricated using a novel polymer- and residue-free, wet transfer, in which we took advantage of the difference in the surface energies between MoS2 and the growth substrate to transfer the CVD-grown nanosheets. The measurements revealed a strong reduction in the in-plane thermal conductivity down to about 0.73 ± 0.25 . The results are discussed theoretically using finite elements method simulations for a polycrystalline film, and a scaling trend of the thermally conductivity with grain size is proposed.",

    "abstract": "High quality and stable electrical contact between metal and two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, is a necessary requirement that has yet to be achieved in order to successfully exploit the advantages that these materials offer to electronics and optoelectronics. MoTe2, owing to its phase changing property, can potentially offer a solution. A recent study demonstrated that metallic phase of MoTe2 connects its semiconducting phase with very low resistance. To utilize this property to connect other two-dimensional materials, it is important to achieve efficient charge transfer between MoTe2 and other semiconducting materials. Using MoS2 as an example, we report ultrafast and efficient charge transfer between MoTe2 and MoS2 monolayers. In the transient absorption measurements, an ultrashort pump pulse is used to selectively excite electrons in MoTe2. The appearance of the excited electrons in the conduction band of MoS2 is monitored by using a probe pulse that is tuned to the resonance of MoS2. We found that electrons transfer to MoS2 on a time scale of at most 0.3 ps. The transferred electrons give rise to a large transient absorption signal at both A-exciton and B-exciton resonances due to the screening effect. We also observed ultrafast transfer of holes from MoS2 to MoTe2. Our results suggest the feasibility of using MoTe2 as a bridge material to connect MoS2 and other transition metal dichalcogenides, and demonstrate a new transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure involving MoTe2, which extends the spectral range of such structures to infrared.",

The onset of a valley-polarized Hall current concomitant to a dissipative valley-polarized current flow in the opposite valley is revealed by a Hall conductivity plateau.

It is found that the edge state transport channels can be turned off or kept open by specific edge doping, and different spin channels can be controlled separately. Interestingly, by replacing an edge C atom with a B atom and an edge Si atom with a P atom in the scattering region, a Seebeck thermopower with different signs for different spins and a finite conductance for both spins can be obtained in the linear response regime. The subsequent thermoelectric field drives electrons of different spin channels in opposite directions, which leads unambiguously to a spin current. More importantly, by tuning the chemical potential and working temperature, pure spin current can be achieved. This provides a promising two-dimensional candidate system for producing pure spin current via the spin-dependent Seebeck effect.",

    "abstract": "Since the isolation of graphene, various two-dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively investigated. Nevertheless, only few 2D oxides have been reported to date due to difficulties in their synthesis. However, it is expected that the layered transition-metal oxides (TMOs) could be missing blocks for van der Waals heterostructures and essential elements for 2D electronics. Herein, the crystal structure and band structure of van der Waals epitaxially grown α-MoO3 nanosheets on various 2D growth templates are characterized. Monolayer and multilayer α-MoO3 nanosheets are successfully grown on a 2D substrate by simply evaporating amorphous molybdenum oxide thin film in ambient conditions. A single-crystal α-MoO3 nanosheet without grain boundary is epitaxially grown on various 2D substrates despite a large lattice mismatch. During growth, the quasi-stable monolayer α-MoO3 first covers the 2D substrate, then additional layers are continuously grown on the first monolayer α-MoO3. The band gap of the α-MoO3 increases from 2.9 to 3.2 eV as the thickness decreases. Furthermore, due to oxygen vacancies and surface adsorbates, the synthesized α-MoO3 is highly n-doped with a small work function. Therefore, α-MoO3 field-effect transistors (FETs) exhibit a typical n-type conductance. This work shows the great potential of ultra-thin α-MoO3 in 2D-material-based electronics.",

While recent works ascertained the exotic energetic schemes of exciton complexes in TMDs, we here infer their unusual coherent dynamics occurring on subpicosecond time scale. The dynamics is largely affected by the disorder landscape on the submicron scale, thus can be uncovered using four-wave mixing in the frequency domain, which enables microscopic investigations and imaging. Focusing on a WS2 monolayer, we observe that exciton coherence is lost primarily due to interaction with phonons and relaxation processes towards optically dark excitonic states. Notably, when temperature is low and disorder weak, excitons large coherence volume results in enhanced oscillator strength, allowing to reach the regime of radiatively limited dephasing. Additionally, we observe long valley coherence for the negatively charged exciton complex. We therefore elucidate the crucial role of exciton environment in the TMDs on its dynamics and show that revealed mechanisms are ubiquitous within this family.",

Polarising optical microscopy (POM) was used to determine the phase evolution through the isotropic-biphasic-nematic transitions of the GO LC. We report that the confinement volume and geometry relative to the particle size is critical for the observation of the lyotropic phase, specifically, this determines the low-end concentration limit for the detection of the GO LC. Additionally, a solvent with higher polarisability stabilises the LC phases at lower concentrations and smaller flake sizes. GO LCs have been proposed for a range of applications from display technologies to conductive fibres, and the behaviour of LC phase formation under confinement imposes a limit on miniaturisation of the dimensions of such GO LC systems which could significantly impact on their potential applications.",

However, almost all studied starting materials consist of pure powder or crystals purchased from chemical suppliers. To test the true versatility of this process, we have attempted to process three starting materials with varying degrees of purity and composition. We subjected talcum powder (principle component: the layered compound talc), Fuller's earth cat litter (known to contain layered silicate compounds, most notably palygorskite and montmorillonite/bentonite) and beach sand (suspected to contain small amounts of layered clays) to a standard LPE procedure (sonication in a surfactant solution followed by centrifugation). In all cases, we produced dispersions containing large quantities of nanosheets with almost all non-nanosheet material removed by the centrifugation step. Powder x-ray diffraction identified the nanosheets produced to be talc, a bentonite/palygorskite mixture and mica for the three starting materials respectively. Particularly interesting is the fact that bentonite, palygorskite and mica sheets are charged and are always accompanied by charge balancing counterions. We believe this is the first example of LPE being used to exfoliate and purify charged layered crystals.",

    "abstract": "Photoluminescence (PL) emergence in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as WS2, has been one of the key attractions of such materials. However, there have been many observational contradictions in PL measurements presented in the past literature. This work addresses such issues. Firstly, the observational changes of the flakes' PL patterns under exposure to various intensities of radiant exposure via laser sources are presented. These experiments show that these changes are a function of radiant exposure. Interestingly, it is observed that PL loss is accompanied by a change of the profile height for WS2 monolayers. In order to explore the fundamental mechanism for PL and height variations, laser irradiation was applied to monolayer WS2 flakes with varying radiant exposure to obtain PL maps, under the absence and presence of oxygen, H2O and nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere. It was seen that, after relatively high radiant exposure (>15 mJ µm−2), the PL pattern loss occurs only in the presence of atmospheric H2O molecules (45% humidity) and is also accompanied by an increase in height. Compositional analysis determined that this height increase was due to the substitution of surface S atoms with sulphate groups. This discovery represents an important step forward in understanding the necessary precautions when investigating optical properties of 2D TMDs in atmospheric conditions, and highlights the need for precise evaluation of the thresholds for radiant exposure at which specific reactions begin to occur. This knowledge is crucial for efficient and effective control of ambient operating conditions for optical characterisation of monolayer WS2 and TMDs in general.",

The resonance behaviors of the and A1g modes are examined. Firstly, both the and A1g modes are enhanced near resonances with the exciton states. The A1g mode exhibits Davydov splitting for trilayers or thicker near some of the exciton resonances. The low-frequency Raman spectra show shear and breathing modes involving rigid vibrations of the layers and also exhibit strong dependence on the excitation energy. An unidentified peak at ~19 cm−1 that does not depend on the number of layers appears near resonance with the B exciton state at 1.96 eV (632.8 nm). The strengths of the intra- and inter-layer interactions are estimated by comparing the mode frequencies and Davydov splitting with the linear chain model, and the contribution of the next-nearest-neighbor interaction to the inter-layer interaction turns out to be about 34% of the nearest-neighbor interaction. Fano resonance is observed for 1.58 eV excitation, and its origin is found to be the interplay between two-phonon scattering and indirect band transition.",

Despite the benefits of operating in this regime, generation, detection and manipulation have proven difficult, as few materials have functional interactions with THz radiation. In contrast, graphene supports resonances in the THz regime through structural confinement of surface plasmons, which can lead to enhanced absorption. In prior work, the achievable plasmon resonances in such structures have been limited by multiple electron scattering mechanisms (i.e. large carrier scattering rates) which greatly broaden the resonance (>100 cm−1; 3 THz). We report the narrowest room temperature Drude response to-date, 30 cm−1 (0.87 THz), obtained using quasi-free standing bilayer epitaxial graphene (QFS BLG) synthesized on (0 0 0 1)6H–SiC. This narrow response is due to a 4-fold increase in carrier mobility and improved thickness and electronic uniformity of QFS BLG. Moreover, QFS BLG samples patterned into microribbons targeting 1.8–5.7 THz plasmon resonances also exhibit low scattering rates (37–53 cm−1). Due to the improved THz properties of QFS BLG, the effects of e-beam processing on carrier scattering rates was determined and we found that fabrication conditions can be tuned to minimize the impact on optoelectronic properties. In addition, electrostatic gating of patterned QFS BLG shows narrow band THz amplitude modulation. Taken together, these properties of QFS BLG should facilitate future development of THz optoelectronic devices for monochromatic applications.",

Here, using friction force microscopy (FFM), we report an unusual moiré superlattice-level stick-slip instability on monolayer graphene epitaxially grown on Ru(0 0 0 1) substrate. Instead of smooth friction modulation, a significant long-range stick-slip sawtooth modulation emerges with a period coinciding with the moiré superlattice structure, which is robust against high external loads and leads to an additional channel of energy dissipation. In contrast, the long-range stick-slip instability reduces to smooth friction modulation on graphene/Ir(1 1 1) substrate. The moiré superlattice-level slip instability could be attributed to the large sliding energy barrier, which arises from the morphological corrugation of graphene on Ru(0 0 0 1) surface as indicated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The locally steep humps acting as obstacles opposing the tip sliding, originates from the strong interfacial electronic interaction between graphene and Ru(0 0 0 1). This study opens an avenue for modulating friction by tuning the interfacial atomic interaction between 2D materials and their substrates.",

Initially, after cells adhered on the surface, stem cells migrated and accumulated on the reduced and wrinkled surface. When the local density of the stem cells on the reduced stripes was high, cells started to proliferate and occupy the oxidized/flat area. The designed surfaces morphology guided stem cell orientation and the reduction accelerated differentiation.

As compared to bulk semiconducting materials, the atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials may be one of the potential candidates to fabricate such adaptive photodiodes, since they possess not only excellent but also widely tunable optoelectronic properties. The most extensively applied device structure for the 2D materials based photodiodes is the vertically aligned van der Waals heterostructure. However, fabricating the vertical 2D material heterostructures is usually complicated, involving manually stacking multiple 2D material flakes together, which is undesirable for industry applications. In this work, we developed a vertical MoO3/MoS2 heterojunction for photodetection and photovoltaic applications. The device used MoS2 and its oxidation layer of MoO3 as the n- and p-type regions, respectively, which can greatly simplify the fabrication process of 2D vertical heterojunctions. Moreover, the device exhibited prominent photo-response with photo-responsivity of 670 mA W−1, detectivity of 4.77 × 1010 Jones and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.5% under 0 V bias. The device also presented efficient gate tunability on photocurrent with on/off ratio of 103. This research provides an alternative way to fabricate 2D materials based vertical heterojunctions for optoelectronic applications with tunable photo-responses.",

    "abstract": "Precision and chip contamination-free placement of two-dimensional (2D) materials is expected to accelerate both the study of fundamental properties and novel device functionality. Current deterministic transfer methods of 2D materials onto an arbitrary substrate deploy viscoelastic stamping. However, these methods produce (a) significant cross-contamination of the substrate inherent from typical dense sources of 2D material flakes and (b) are challenged with respect to spatial alignment, and (c) multi-transfer at a single step. Here, we demonstrate a novel method of transferring 2D materials resembling the functionality known from printing; utilizing a combination of a sharp micro-stamper and viscoelastic polymer, we show precise placement of individual 2D materials resulting in vanishing cross-contamination to the substrate. Our 2D printer-method results in an aerial cross-contamination improvement of two to three orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art transfer methods from a source of average area for single flake (~50 µm2). Moreover, we find that the 2D material quality is preserved in this transfer method. Testing this 2D material printer on taped-out integrated Silicon photonic chips, we find that the micro-stamper stamping transfer does not physically harm the underneath Silicon nanophotonic structures such as waveguides or micro-ring resonators receiving the 2D material. We further demonstrate functional devices such as Graphene tunnel junctions and transistors, and TMD-based material tunable microring resonators. Such accurate and substrate-benign transfer method for 2D materials could be industrialized for rapid device prototyping due to its high time-reduction, accuracy, and contamination-free process.",

We apply our findings to graphene as a study case, by combining a tight binding and a valence force-field model to calculate electronic and mechanical properties of graphene nanoribbons under strain. The results show good agreement with the predictions of the Dirac equation coupled to continuum mechanics. For this long wave-limit effective theory, we find that the strain–displacement relations lead to a renormalization correction to the strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields.

BiTeI is a promising candidate for such a 2D crystal. In its bulk form BiTeI consists of loosely coupled three atom thick layers where a layer of high atomic number Bi are sandwiched between Te and I sheets. Despite considerable recent attention to bulk BiTeI due to its giant Rashba spin splitting, the isolation of a single layer remained elusive. In this work we report the first successful isolation and characterization of a single layer of BiTeI using a novel exfoliation technique on stripped gold. Our scanning probe studies and first principles calculations show that the fabricated 100 μm sized BiTeI flakes are stable at ambient conditions. Giant Rashba splitting and spin-momentum locking of this new 2D crystal opens the way towards novel spintronic applications and synthetic topological heterostructures.",

In particular, high density charge accumulation in electric double layer transistor (EDLT), which is a FET device driven by ionic motions, is playing key roles for expanding the functionalities of TMD based 2D crystals. Here, we report several device concepts which were realized by introducing EDLTs in TMDs, taking the advantage of their extremely unique band structures and phase transition phenomena realized simply by thinning to the monolayer level. We address two kinds of TMDs based on group VI and group V transition metals, which basically yield semiconductors and metals, respectively.

The single domain size, coverage on substrate, and thickness of white graphene were taken as targeted parameters of products.

Although various thermal management methods at package-level have been demonstrated, the heat dissipation from non-uniform hotspots at micro/nanoscale still persist in the high power transistors. Here, we develop a method for local thermal management using thermally conductive and electrical insulating few-layer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as heat spreaders and thick counterpart as heat sinks. The electrically insulating characteristic of h-BN nanosheet allows it to be intimately contacted with the hotspot region that is located at the gate electrode edge near the drain side of a high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT). The high thermal conductivity of h-BN nanosheet, which is quantitatively measured by Raman thermography, reduces the temperature of the hotspot by introducing an additional heat transporting pathway. Our DC and radio-frequency characterizations of the HEMT show the improvement of saturation current, cut-off frequency and maximum oscillation frequency. The finite element simulations show a temperature decrease of ∼32 °C at the hotspot with the use of h-BN nanosheet. This method can be further extended for the micro/nanoscale thermal management of other high-power devices.",

We observe both the interlayer breathing modes and shear modes at frequencies below 40 cm−1 for samples of 2–15 layers. Their frequency, Raman activity, and environmental instability depend systematically on the layer number. We account for these results by a combination of linear-chain model, group theory and first-principles calculations. We find that, although NbSe2 has different stacking order from MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, they share the same crystal symmetry groups and exhibit similar Raman selection rules for interlayer phonons. In addition, the interlayer phonon modes evolve smoothly from T = 300 to 8 K, with no observable response to the CDW formation in NbSe2. This finding indicates that the atomic registry between adjacent NbSe2 layers is well preserved in the CDW transition.",

Also, in addition to previous novelty, our technique is fast and easier by using current industrial technology—a hot press and a laminator—with Cu recycling by its mechanical peel-off; it provides high interfacial stability in aqueous media and it is not restricted to a specific material—polyimide and polyamic acids can be used.

Here, taking MoS2 as an example, we demonstrate a layer-by-layer scalable growth of coalesced TMDC films on a moving sapphire substrate by local-feeding atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition. By linear moving of the substrate across the cone-shaped diffusion concentration gradient of Mo-containing species and controlling the moving cycles, continuous MoS2 films with the thickness from a monolayer up to ~30 layers can be obtained. Compared with the growth on a stationary substrate, the monolayer film grown on a moving substrate shows preferable 2D epitaxial growth with much smoother surface morphology. We believe this can be attributed to the spatial separation of the initial nucleation step and the following 2D ripening process during substrate moving, which is the key to promoting the 2D lateral growth. The results shed light on developing new synthetic strategies toward atomic-thickness-controlled growth of 2D TMDC films in a scalable and efficient process that is suitable for large-area device fabrication.",

The STM signatures for various defects in epitaxial silicene on Ag(111) surface are identified. In particular, the formation energies of point defects in Ag(111)-supported silicene sheets show an interesting dependence on the superstructures, which, in turn, may have implications for controlling the defect density during the synthesis of silicene. Through estimating the concentrations of various point defects in different silicene superstructures, the mystery of the defective appearance of and silicene in experiments is revealed, and 4 × 4 silicene sheet is thought to be the most suitable structure for future device applications.",

We provide a critical discussion of patterns and trends in tight binding band structures and we identify specific layered assemblies using low-dispersion electronic bands as indicators of potentially interesting physics like strongly correlated behavior.

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are increasingly being used as active components in nanoscale devices. Many interesting properties of 2D materials stem from the reduced and highly non-local electronic screening in two dimensions. While electronic screening within 2D materials has been studied extensively, the question still remains of how 2D substrates screen charge perturbations or electronic excitations adjacent to them. Thickness-dependent dielectric screening properties have recently been studied using electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) experiments. However, it was suggested that some of the thickness-dependent trends were due to extrinsic effects. Similarly, Kelvin probe measurements (KPM) indicate that charge fluctuations are reduced when BN slabs are placed on SiO$_2$, but it is unclear if this effect is due to intrinsic screening from BN. In this work, we use first principles calculations to study the fully non-local dielectric screening properties of 2D material substrates. Our simulations give results in good qualitative agreement with those from EFM experiments, for hexagonal boron nitride (BN), graphene and MoS$_2$, indicating that the experimentally observed thickness-dependent screening effects are intrinsic to the 2D materials. We further investigate explicitly the role of BN in lowering charge potential fluctuations arising from charge impurities on an underlying SiO$_2$ substrate, as observed in the KPM experiments. 2D material substrates can also dramatically change the HOMO-LUMO gaps of adsorbates, especially for small molecules, such as benzene. We propose a reliable and very quick method to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap of small physisorbed molecules on 2D and 3D substrates, using only the band gap of the substrate and the gas phase gap of the molecule.",

Using first-principles calculations we investigate the modulation of heat transport in MoS2 by lithium intercalation and cross-plane strain. We find that both the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity (kr, kz) of MoS2 are extremely sensitive to both strain and electrochemical intercalation. Combining lithium intercalation and strain, the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity can be tuned over one and two orders of magnitude, respectively. Furthermore, since kr and kz respond in different ways to intercalation and strain, the thermal conductivity anisotropy can be modulated by two orders of magnitude. The underlying mechanisms for such large tunability of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of \\Mos are explored by computing and analyzing the dispersion relations, group velocities, relaxation times and mean free paths of phonons. Since both intercalation and strain can be applied reversibly, their stark effect on thermal conductivity can be exploited to design novel phononic devices, as well as for thermal management in MoS2-based electronic and optoelectronic systems.",

This observation, together with the large luminescence yield which can be obtained from the bilayer, puts forward molybdenum ditelluride as a robust and bright light source in the near infrared range. The scaling of luminescence wavelength and linewidth of the molybdenum ditelluride bilayer differs from the observations in the monolayer by effects that can be traced to symmetry and wellwidth.

For this reason, we build a multi-scale, multi-factor model which is thoroughly verified using a large body of experimental data to provide a significant insight into the chemical and physical processes that determine nucleation, growth and structure formation of vertically aligned graphenes in plasma environments. Roles of chemical and physical processes that cannot be directly characterized using presently available experimental techniques, e.g. surface diffusion of adatoms and radicals, are also studied using this model. The leading role of surface diffusion fluxes, rather than direct influx from the gas phase, is confirmed, with ion bombardment being a key factor in 'switching' the growth modes by generating surface defects and hence, increasing the surface adsorption energy. Thus, the hydrocarbon radicals generated on a substrate as a result of bombardment are shown to diffuse to the nanoflakes and catalyze the reactions, and serve as the primary source of material to build the nanoflakes.",

    "abstract": "Heat dissipation in next-generation electronics based on two-dimensional (2D) materials is a critical issue in their development and implementation. A potential bottleneck for heat removal in 2D-based devices is the thermal pathway from the 2D layer into its supporting substrate. The choice of substrate, its composition and structure, can strongly impact the thermal boundary conductance (TBC). Here we investigate the temperature-dependent TBC of 42 interfaces formed between a group of six 2D materials and seven crystalline and amorphous substrates. We use first-principles density functional perturbation theory to calculate the full phonon dispersion of the 2D layers and substrates and then input them into our model for phonon transport across the 2D–3D interface. Our results show that the TBC depends on the overlap between the vibrational frequencies and can be varied by nearly two orders of magnitude, from as low as ∼0.6 MW · m K−1 (h-BN on diamond) to ∼40 MW · m K−1 (h-BN on SiO2), for the same 2D layer by changing the substrate material. We find that amorphous materials significantly boost the TBC relative to their crystalline counterparts, assuming the two interfaces have the same adhesion, owing to the low-frequency Boson peak feature in their vibrational density of states (vDOS). For crystalline substrates, we further correlate constituent material properties with the calculated TBCs and find that the TBC strongly depends on a combination of the speed of sound, Debye temperature, and density of the substrate as well as the bandwidth of the flexural branch in the 2D material. We conclude that softer substrates with sharp low-frequency features in their vDOS, such as amorphous materials, polymers, and nanoparticles, could have higher TBC, leading to a trade-off between TBC and the thermal conductivity of the substrate.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are currently considered a very promising alternative to Si for channel applications in next-generation field-effect transistors of sub-5 nm designs. However, their huge potential cannot be fully exploited owing to a lack of competitive insulators which are required to effectively separate the channel from the gate, while being scalable down to few nanometers thicknesses. Recently we have made an attempt at addressing this issue by using crystalline CaF2 insulators and demonstrated competitive MoS2 devices with the insulator thickness of only about 2 nm. Here we report a detailed study of the performance, reliability and thermal stability of these devices. We demonstrate that, in contrast to SiO2 and other amorphous oxides, CaF2 has a very low density of insulator defects which are responsible for the hysteresis and long-term drifts of the transistor characteristics. At the same time, CaF2 exhibits smaller leakage currents and higher electric stability compared to hBN. By comparing our MoS2 transistors with CaF2 fabricated using MoS2 films of different quality, we show that the major limitations on the performance and reliability of these devices come from the bare channel rather than from the superior CaF2 insulator. Finally, we perform the first study of degradation mechanisms only observed for tunnel-thin gate insulators in 2D devices. While these degradation mechanisms are similar for hBN and CaF2, they are less pronounced in CaF2. Our results therefore present a solution to a very important roadblock on the way towards fully scalable 2D nanoelectronics with competitive performance and reliability.",

    "abstract": "Because of its large surface area and flexibility, graphene has been explored for various applications such as flexible electronics and energy storage. Topographical undulations are commonly generated in graphene artificially by pre-strain and annealing to allow more tunable properties in hierarchical patterns. It is also possible, however, that strain engineering may induce negative effects, such as inhomogeneous strain distribution and fracturing of graphene. However, the correlation between those negative defects and the interfacial stress transfer in graphene upon strain engineering is still not clear. This is practically crucial as the stress/strain state in graphene is one of the dominant factors in governing other properties such as conductivity and wettability etc. in flexible electronics. In this work, wrinkles/folds (i.e. without/with delamination) have been introduced into graphene by annealing and pre-straining. An interfacial stress transfer efficiency factor ηr, is proposed to quantify the effect of wrinkles/folds by comparing the area under the measured strain distribution curves with the ones calculated theoretically using the 'shear-lag' theory. It is found that the wrinkles, with small amplitudes, do not affect the value of ηr significantly due to good stress transfer being maintained by the graphene still conforming to the substrate, whereas the folds, with high amplitudes, reduce ηr remarkably as a result of the absence of stress transfer due to delamination. The effect of wrinkling can be predicted by a geometrical model that takes the amplitude and wavelength of the graphene wrinkling into account. The monitoring and evaluation of the interfacial stress transfer and the strain distribution of wrinkled and folded graphene provide insights into its interfacial instability, and will have wide impact and applications in the strain engineering of graphene and other 2D materials for flexible electronics and devices.",

The influence of the growth temperature and film thickness on the electromechanical properties of the PtSe2 layers is investigated. The best-performing strain gauges fabricated have a superior gauge factor to that of commercial metal-based strain gauges. Notably, the strain gauges offer good cyclability and are very robust, surviving repeated peel tests and immersion in water.

Its photoluminescence exhibits linear polarization anisotropy and an emission lifetime of 210 ps. At low temperature, we distinguish two spectral contributions with opposite linear polarizations attributed to excitons and defects. Moreover, the dependence on excitation power and temperature suggests that free and bound excitons dominate the excitonic emission at high and low temperatures, respectively.

Under ambient conditions, antimonene exhibits a high thermodynamic stability and good structural integrity. Some theoretical calculations predicted that antimonene would have a high oxidation tendency. However, it remains poorly investigated from the experimental point of view. In this work, we study the oxidation behavior of antimonene nanosheets (ANS) prepared by ultrasonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation. Using a set of forefront analytical techniques, a clear effect of sonication time on the surface chemistry of prepared ANS is found. A dynamic oxidation behavior has been observed, which upon annealing at moderate temperature (210 °C) resulted in a semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of approximately 1 eV measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. This study yields valuable information for future applications of antimonene and paves the way towards novel modification approaches in order to tailor its properties and complement its limitations.",

    "abstract": "Transition metal dichalcogenides represent an ideal testbed to study excitonic effects, spin-related phenomena and fundamental light-matter coupling in nanoscopic condensed matter systems. In particular, the valley degree of freedom, which is unique to such direct band gap monolayers with broken inversion symmetry, adds fundamental interest in these materials. Here, we implement a Tamm-plasmon structure with an embedded MoSe2 monolayer and study the formation of polaritonic quasi-particles. Strong coupling conditions between the Tamm-mode and the trion resonance of MoSe2 are established, yielding bright luminescence from the polaritonic ground state under non-resonant optical excitation. We demonstrate, that tailoring the electrodynamic environment of the monolayer results in a significantly increased valley polarization. This enhancement can be related to change in recombination dynamics shown in time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. We furthermore observe strong upconversion luminescence from resonantly excited polariton states in the lower polariton branch. This upconverted polariton luminescence is shown to preserve the valley polarization of the trion-polariton, which paves the way towards combining spin-valley physics and exciton scattering experiments.",

Existing calculations of intrinsic phonon-limited electronic transport so far have concentrated on the semicondcucting members of this family. In this paper we extend these studies by investigating the influence of electron–phonon coupling on the electronic transport properties and band renormalization of prototype inherent metallic bulk and monolayer TaS2. Based on density functional perturbation theory and semi-classical Boltzmann transport calculations, promising room temperature mobilities and sheet conductances are found, which can compete with other established 2D materials, leaving TaS2 as promising material candidate for transparent conductors or as atomically thin interconnects. Throughout the paper, the electronic and transport properties of TaS2 are compared to those of its isoelectronic counterpart TaSe2 and additional informations to the latter are given. We furthermore comment on the conventional superconductivity in TaS2, where no phonon-mediated enhancement of TC in the monolayer compared to the bulk state was found.",

In atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, the Coulomb interaction is known to be much stronger than in quantum wells of conventional semiconductors like GaAs, as witnessed by the 50 times larger exciton binding energy. The question arises, whether this directly translates into equivalently faster carrier–carrier Coulomb scattering of excited carriers. Here we show that a combination of ab initio band-structure and many-body theory predicts Coulomb-mediated carrier relaxation on a sub-100 fs time scale for a wide range of excitation densities, which is less than an order of magnitude faster than in quantum wells.",

We propose a new approach to metal organic vapour phase epitaxy of h-BN layers on sapphire substrates. The growth scheme involves an intermediary BN buffer layer grown under self-limiting conditions (continuous flow) followed by the final growth of h-BN with flow modulated epitaxy in one growth run. This scheme can be regarded as homoepitaxial growth of h-BN on a self-limiting buffer. Our studies show that the buffer layer allows to control the nucleation at the crucial early stages of BN layer growth, suppressing unwanted out-of-plane growth. It can also be used to control the density of point-like defects responsible for unwanted luminescence from the h-BN layer. Moreover, our results show that the buffer effectively suppresses the creation of amorphous BN at the sapphire/h-BN interface.",

The carbon atoms experience a lateral potential across the supercell of an estimated value of about 65 meV. The potential leads to strong energy renormalization in the band structure of the graphene layer and the emergence of mini-Dirac cones. The mini-cones' band velocity is reduced to about half of graphene's Fermi velocity. Notably, the ordering of the interfacial Cu atoms can be reversibly blocked by mild annealing.

    "abstract": "Black phosphorus has attracted interest as a material for use in optoelectronic devices due to many favorable properties such as a high carrier mobility, field-effect, and a direct bandgap that can range from 0.3 eV in its bulk crystalline form to 2 eV for a single atomic layer. The low bandgap energy for bulk black phosphorus allows for direct transition photoabsorption that enables detection of light out to mid-infrared frequencies. In this work we characterize the room temperature optical response of a black phosphorus photoconductive detector at wavelengths ranging from 1.56 $\\mu$m to 3.75 $\\mu$m. Pulsed autocorrelation measurements in the near-infrared regime reveal a strong, sub-linear photocurrent nonlinearity with a response time of 1 ns, indicating that gigahertz electrical bandwidth is feasible. Time resolved photoconduction measurements covering near- and mid-infrared frequencies show a fast 65 ps rise time, followed by a carrier relaxation with a time scale that matches the intrinsic limit determined by autocorrelation. The sublinear photoresponse is shown to be caused by a reduction in the carrier relaxation time as more energy is absorbed in the black phosphorus flake and is well described by a carrier recombination model that is nonlinear with excess carrier density. The device exhibits a measured noise-equivalent power of 530 pW/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ which is the expected value for Johnson noise limited performance. The fast and sensitive room temperature photoresponse demonstrates that black phosphorus is a promising new material for mid-infrared optoelectronics.",

Up to now silicene can only be epitaxially synthesized on a supporting substrate such as Ag(111). Even though the structural and electronic properties of these epitaxial silicene layers have been intensively studied, very little is known about its vibrational characteristics. Here, we present a detailed study of epitaxial silicene on Ag(111) using in situ Raman spectroscopy, which is one of the most extensively employed experimental techniques to characterize 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and black phosphorous. The vibrational fingerprint of epitaxial silicene, in contrast to all previous interpretations, is characterized by three distinct phonon modes with A and E symmetries. Both, energies and symmetries of theses modes are confirmed by ab initio theory calculations. The temperature dependent spectral evolution of these modes demonstrates unique thermal properties of epitaxial silicene and a significant electron–phonon coupling. These results unambiguously support the purely two-dimensional character of epitaxial silicene up to about 300 °C, whereupon a 2D-to-3D phase transition takes place. The detailed fingerprint of epitaxial silicene will allow us to identify it in different environments or to study its modifications.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the fabricated MoS2 field effect transistors (FETs) with 1T-MoS2 electrodes exhibit excellent performance with rather low contact resistance, as compared with those with metals deposited directly on 2H-MoS2 (Kappera et al 2014 Nat. Mater. 13 1128), but the reason for that remains elusive. By means of density functional theory calculations, we investigated the carrier injection at the 1T/2H MoS2 interface and found that although the Schottky barrier height (SBH) values of 1T/2H MoS2 interfaces can be tuned by controlling the stacking patterns, the p-type SBH values of 1T/2H MoS2 interfaces with different stackings are lower than their corresponding n-type SBH values, which demonstrated that the metallic 1T phase can be used as an efficient hole injection layer for 2H-MoS2. In addition, as compared to the n-type Au/MoS2 and Pd/MoS2 contacts, the p-type SBH values of 1T/2H MoS2 interfaces are much lower, which stem from the efficient hole injection between 1T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2. This can explain the low contact resistance in the MoS2 FETs with 1T-MoS2 electrodes. Notably, the SBH values can be effectively modulated by an external electric field, and a significantly low p-type SBH value can be achieved under an appropriate electric field. We also demonstrated that this approach is also valid for WS2, WSe2 and MoSe2 systems, which indicates that the method can most likely be extended to other TMDs, and thus may open new promising avenues of contact engineering in these materials.",

    "abstract": "One of the most thrilling developments in the photovoltaic field over recent years has been the use of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite, such as CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), as a promising new material for low-cost and highly efficient solar cells. Despite the impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 22% demonstrated on lab-scale devices, large-area material deposition procedures and automatized device fabrication protocols are still challenging to achieve high-throughput serial manufacturing of modules and panels. In this work, we demonstrate that spray coating is an effective technique for the production of mesoscopic small- and large-area perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In particular, we report a sprayed graphene-doped mesoporous TiO2 (mTiO2) scaffold for mesoscopic PSCs. By successfully combining the spray coating technique with the insertion of graphene additive into the sprayed mTiO2 scaffold, a uniform film deposition and a significant enhancement of the electron transport/injection at the mTiO2/perovskite electrode is achieved. The use of graphene flakes on the sprayed scaffold boosts the PCE of small-area cells up to 17.5% that corresponds to an increase of more than 15% compared to standard cells. For large-area (1.1 cm2) cells, a PCE up to 14.96% is achieved. Moreover, graphene-doped mTiO2 layer enhances the stability of the PSCs compared to standard devices. The feasibility of PSC fabrication by spray coating deposition of the mesoporous film on large-area 21 × 24 cm2 provides a viable and low-cost route to scale up the manufacturing of low-cost, stable and high-efficiency PSCs.",

The ability to consistently select exfoliated nanosheets with desired properties is important for development of applications in all areas. The model presented facilitates determination of centrifugation parameters for production of dispersions with controlled size and thickness for different materials, solvents and exfoliation processes. Importantly, after accounting for the influence of viscosity on exfoliation, comparisons of different solvents are shown to be well described by the surface tension and Hansen parameter matching. This suggests that previous analyses may have overestimated the relative performance of more viscous solvents. This understanding can be extended to develop a model based on the force balance of nanosheets falling under viscous drag during centrifugation. By considering the microscopic aspect ratio relationships, this model can be both calibrated for size selection of nanosheets and compare the exfoliation processes themselves.",

Using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques, we have found out graphitic nitrogen to be the dominant type of the implemented nitrogen species. At the same time, the subsequent GO thermal reduction to graphene appears to result in a transformation of the graphitic nitrogen into pyridines and pyrroles. The mechanisms of the observed GO nitrogen doping and conversion of the nitrogen species are proposed, providing an opportunity to control the type and concentration of the implemented nitrogen within the developed approach. A two-time increase of the graphenes' conductivity is observed due to the performed nitrogen doping. Further comprehensive electrical studies combined with the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and density functional theory (DFT) modeling have allowed us to estimate the conductivity mechanism and the impact of the implemented nitrogen. As a net result, a simple method to synthesize GO and graphene layers doped with specific nitrogen species is developed, which leads to new perspective applications for graphene, i.e. supercapacitors, catalysis, and sensors.",

However, while it is known that mobility and thermal conductivity (TC) of graphene are reduced on a substrate, these effects are much less explored in 2D semiconductors such as MoS 2 . Here, we use molecular dynamics to understand TC changes in monolayer (1L) and bilayer (2L) MoS 2 by comparing suspended, supported, and encased structures. The TC of monolayer MoS 2 is reduced from ∼117 W m −1 K −1 when suspended, to ∼31 W m −1 K −1 when supported by SiO 2 , at 300 K. Encasing 1L MoS 2 in SiO 2 further reduces its TC down to ∼22 W m −1 K −1 . In contrast, the TC of 2L MoS 2 is not as drastically reduced, being &gt;50% higher than 1L both when supported and encased. These effects are due to phonon scattering with remote vibrational modes of the substrate, which are partly screened in 2L MoS 2 . We also examine the TC of 1L MoS 2 across a wide range of temperatures (300 K to 700 K) and defect densities (up to 5 × 10 13 cm −2 ), finding that the substrate reduces the dependence of TC on these factors. Taken together, these are important findings for all applications which will use 2D semiconductors supported or encased by insulators, instead of freely suspended.",

The broken octahedral and trigonal prismatic symmetries lead to different crystal and ligand field splittings of the d electron states, resulting in distinct electronic properties. In this work, we quantify the crystal and ligand field parameters of 2D TMDs using a Wannier-function approach. We adopt the methodology proposed by Scaramucci et al (2015 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 27 175503) that allows to separate various contributions to the ligand field by choosing different manifolds in the construction of the Wannier functions. We discuss the relevance of the crystal and ligand fields in determining the relative stability of the two polymorphs as a function of the filling of the d-shell. Based on the calculated parameters, we conclude that the ligand field, while leading to a small stabilizing factor for the 1H polymorph in the d1 and d2 TMDs, plays mostly an indirect role and that hybridization between different d orbitals is the dominant feature. We investigate trends across the periodic table and interpret the variations of the calculated crystal and ligand fields in terms of the change of charge-transfer energy, which allows developing simple chemical intuition.",

The optical properties of these two-dimensional materials, however, vary from flake to flake, or even across individual flakes, and change over time, all of which makes control of the optoelectronic properties challenging. There are many different perturbations that can alter the optical properties, including charge doping, defects, strain, oxidation, adsorbed molecules and water intercalation. Identifying which perturbations are present is usually not straightforward and requires multiple measurements using multiple experimental modalities, which presents barriers when attempting to optimise preparation of these materials. Here, we apply high-resolution photoluminescence and differential reflectance hyperspectral imaging in situ to CVD-grown WS2 monolayers. By combining these two optical measurements and using a statistical correlation analysis we are able to disentangle three contributions modulating optoelectronic properties of these materials: electron doping, strain and disorder arising from adsorbates, substrate fluctuations and/or defects. In separating these contributions, we also observe that the B-exciton energy is less sensitive to variations in doping density than A-excitons. Our approach is not limited to monolayers of WS2 and is also applicable to other 2D materials with optical transitions, and the general approach could be extended to other characterization modalities.",

The high mobility is attributed to low-resistance contacts of scandium/gold (Sc/Au), with a low Schottky barrier height and reduced charge scattering platform of h-BN. Further, we elucidated the Schottky-barrier-height dependent high photoresponsivity (~3.2 × 106 A W−1) of few-layer ReSe2 (FL-ReSe2) at 532 nm-wavelength laser light on an h-BN substrate with Sc/Au contacts. Moreover, broadband light detection of undoped and Co-doped few-layer (FL) ReSe2 was performed under different laser wavelengths (400–1100 nm). After the deposition of Co nanoparticles, the photocurrent of FL-ReSe2 increased due to n-doping, as confirmed by the transfer curves of the FL-ReSe2-based undoped and co-doped FETs. Further, the work function decreased from 4.856 to 4.791 eV in FL-ReSe2, as measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy. No light signal was observed at 1100 nm for the undoped ReSe2 (1050 nm < λcut-off < 1100 nm); however, after doping with Co nanoparticles, the cut-off wavelength exceeded to (λcut-off > 1100 nm), due to the additional trap states generated in the energy band gap of ReSe2 after Co doping. Further, the transient response of ReSe2 and Co + ReSe2 FETs was estimated so that the rise and decay times are decreased from 1.9 s & 2.7 s to 1.1 s & 1.8 s, respectively. ReSe2 is therefore a promising semiconducting material for electrical and optoelectrical applications.",

The unique structure and properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially the extraordinary electronic and optical properties of 2D Bi 2 O 2 Se, have given rise to significant research interests for the exploration of 2D bismuth-based ternary compounds. In this review, we will comprehensively discuss the properties of three important families of bismuth-based ternary compounds, including Bi 2 O 2 X (X = S, Se, Te), BiTeX (X = Cl, Br, I), and BiOX (X = Cl, Br, I). In particular, we have placed emphasis on the latest progress in their 2D forms, including their novel properties and applications.

We determine a defect concentration of the order of 1013 cm−2 for our samples with HRTEM. To have access to the intrinsic optical quality of the MLs, we remove the MLs from the SiO2 growth substrate and encapsulate them in hBN flakes with low defect density, to reduce the detrimental impact of dielectric disorder. We show optical transition linewidth of 5 meV at low temperature (T = 4 K) for the free excitons in emission and absorption. This is comparable to the best ML samples obtained by mechanical exfoliation of bulk material. The CVD grown MoS2 ML photoluminescence is dominated by free excitons and not defects even at low temperature. High optical quality of the samples is further confirmed by the observation of excited exciton states of the Rydberg series. We optically generate valley coherence and valley polarization in our CVD grown MoS2 layers, showing the possibility for studying spin and valley physics in CVD samples of large surface area.",

Here, few-layer stanene films have been epitaxially grown on Sb-terminated InSb (1 1 1) surface and their structural and electrical properties are characterized. Scanning tunneling spectrum results reveal a large bulk bandgap in single-layer stanene (over 0.2 eV). Moreover, spectroscopy evidence for a filled edge state near the steps was observed. The gap decreases dramatically with increasing number of layers, and multilayer stanene should become a Dirac semimetal in the bulk limit. The changeover may involve nontrivial topological phase transitions. Clear and reproducible Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations were observed on the single-layer stanene films that were exposed to atmospheric conditions for an extended period of time, showing the possibility for device experiments using nanofabrication and magneto-transport. Our results demonstrate that the single-layer stanene is a promising topological material for exploring fundamental physics and quantum applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The intrinsic magnetism has long been pursued in two-dimensional (2D) materials down to one-atomic layer thickness. But only very recently, the intrinsic magnetism of monolayer CrI 3 , Fe 3 GeTe 2 , FePS 3 , VSe 2 and bilayer Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 are verified in experiment by optical measurement, Raman spectrum and conventional magnetism measurement. Among them, the intralayer exchange interaction of FePS 3 is antiferromagnetic while all the others are ferromagnetic. Most of the ferromagnetic orders in these materials are induce by super exchange interaction. Monolayer Fe 3 GeTe 2 and VSe 2 exhibit metallic character while all the others are semiconductor or insulator. Stable spontaneous magnetization can exist in these monolayer 2D materials because of their strong anisotropy. The anisotropy is mostly from the strong spin–orbit coupling of heavy atoms (CrI 3 , Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 , Fe 3 GeTe 2 ). Asymmetric lattice distortion (FePS 3 ) or the increased density of state near Fermi level (VSe 2 ) may also contribute to the anisotropy. The relationship between anisotropy and stable spontaneous magnetization are discussed based on spin wave theory and Mermin-Wagner theorem. About the application, spintronics may be the most direct benefitted field. Considering the relationship between conductance and magnetic structure, the applications related with the transport property are also widely investigated. Similarly, as the coupling between spin, phonon and photon are prominent in these magnetic 2D materials, the applications based on the magnetocaloric effect and magneto-optic effect are promising. And these magnetic 2D materials may be also applied as catalyst in water-splitting or electrode of supercapacitor.",

First, the n = 1 peak of the Rydberg series of the IPS spectrum of germanene has two contributions, labelled n = 1 - and n = 1 + , respectively. The peak at the lower energy side is weaker and is associated to the mirror-symmetric state with opposite parity. The appearance of this peak indicates that the interaction between the germanene layer and the substrate is very weak. Second, the work function of germanene is about 0.75 eV lower in energy than the work function of Ge(001). This large difference in work function of germanene and pristine Ge(001) is in agreement with first-principles calculations.",

Lattice deformations give rise to different energy shifts for bright and dark excitons changing the excitonic landscape, the efficiency of intervalley scattering channels and the weight of single exciton species to the overall exciton diffusion. We predict a minimal diffusion coefficient in unstrained WS 2 followed by a steep speed-up by a factor of 3 for tensile biaxial strain at about 0.6% strain—in excellent agreement with our experiments.

Finally, we explore the performance of Gaussian process-based regression for efficient prediction of mechanical and electronic materials properties. The combination of open access, detailed documentation, and extremely rich materials property data sets make the C2DB a unique resource that will advance the science of atomically thin materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Van der Waals (vdW) material Fe 5 GeTe 2 , with its long-range ferromagnetic ordering near room temperature, has significant potential to become an enabling platform for implementing novel spintronic and quantum devices. To pave the way for applications, it is crucial to determine the magnetic properties when the thickness of Fe 5 GeTe 2 reaches the few-layers regime. However, this is highly challenging due to the need for a characterization technique that is local, highly sensitive, artifact-free, and operational with minimal fabrication. Prior studies have indicated that Curie temperature T C can reach up to close to room temperature for exfoliated Fe 5 GeTe 2 flakes, as measured via electrical transport; there is a need to validate these results with a measurement that reveals magnetism more directly. In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of exfoliated thin flakes of vdW magnet Fe 5 GeTe 2 via quantum magnetic imaging technique based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. Through imaging the stray fields, we confirm room-temperature magnetic order in Fe 5 GeTe 2 thin flakes with thickness down to 7 units cell. The stray field patterns and their response to magnetizing fields with different polarities is consistent with previously reported perpendicular easy-axis anisotropy. Furthermore, we perform imaging at different temperatures and determine the Curie temperature of the flakes at ≈300 K. These results provide the basis for realizing a room-temperature monolayer ferromagnet with Fe 5 GeTe 2 . This work also demonstrates that the imaging technique enables rapid screening of multiple flakes simultaneously as well as time-resolved imaging for monitoring time-dependent magnetic behaviors, thereby paving the way towards high throughput characterization of potential two-dimensional (2D) magnets near room temperature and providing critical insights into the evolution of domain behaviors in 2D magnets due to degradation.",

In this study, we demonstrate efficient implantation of individual gold atoms into graphene up to a concentration of 1.7 × 10 11 atoms cm −2 via a two-step low-energy ion implantation technique that overcomes the limitation posed by momentum conservation on the mass of the implanted species. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveal gold atoms occupying double vacancy sites in the graphene lattice. The covalently bound gold atoms can sustain intense electron irradiation at 60 kV during the microscopy experiments. At best, only limited indication of plasmonic enhancement is observed. The method demonstrated here can be used to introduce a controlled concentration of gold atoms into graphene, and should also work for other heavier elements with similar electronic structure.",

In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been widely applied in designing the electrodes of aqueous ZIBs since they generally possess the characteristics of large surface areas, plentiful ion transport channels and abundant active sites. Thus, they can not only act as the active materials and conductive additives in cathodes, but also be employed as the artificial interface layers or conductive substrates of Zn anodes. In this review, the issues of aqueous ZIBs and the unique properties of 2D materials are discussed briefly. Then we highlight the recent advances of the applications of various 2D materials, mainly including transition metal oxides, transition metal dichalcogenide, graphene and MXenes, in the design of the cathodes and anodes of aqueous ZIBs. Finally, we present the challenges and perspectives of 2D materials in aqueous ZIBs.",

In this work, by using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that, different from its orthorhombic phases of GeSe, the γ -GeSe shows a small spatial anisotropic dependence and a strikingly thickness-dependent behavior with transition from semimetal (bulk, 0.04 eV) to semiconductor (1L, 0.99 eV), and this dual conducting characteristic realized simply with thickness control in γ -GeSe has not been found in other two-dimensional materials before. The lacking of d-orbital allows charge carrier with small effective mass (0.16 m 0 for electron and 0.23 m 0 for hole) which is comparable to phosphorene. Meanwhile, 1L γ -GeSe shows a superior flexibility with Young’s modulus of 86.59 N m −1 , only one-quarter of that of graphene and three-quarters of that of MoS 2 , and Poisson’s ratio of 0.26, suggesting a highly flexible lattice. Interestingly, 1L γ -GeSe shows an in-plane isotropic elastic modulus inherent with hexagonal symmetry while an anisotropic in-plane effective mass owing to shifted valleys around the band edges. We demonstrate the feasibility of strain engineering in inducing indirect–direct and semiconductor–metal transitions resulting from competing bands at the band edges. Our work shows that the free 1L γ -GeSe shows a strong light absorption (∼10 6 cm −1 ) and an indirect bandgap with rich valleys at band edges, enabling high carrier concentration and a low rate of direct electron–hole recombination which would be promising for nanoelectronics and solar cell applications.",

When the annealed temperature reaches 450 °C, the maximum reflection loss of Ti 3 C 2 T x /TiO 2 is −30.4 dB at 5.67 GHz due to the enhanced interfacial polarization and optimized impedance matching.

In this work, based on the experimental FeCl 2 flakes and the predicted in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) and lower Curie temperature of FeCl 2 monolayer, we use first-principles and Monte Carlo simulation to explore the strain and carrier-doping effects on the electronic and magnetic properties of Janus FeClF monolayer. The structure is stable within −10% to 2% biaxial strain. Janus FeClF monolayer can experience transitions from a half-semiconductor to a spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) around the −6% compressive strain, and from the IMA to the PMA at the −7% compressive strain. The super-exchange Fe–F/Cl–Fe interaction induces the ferromagnetic coupling, and the Curie temperature can be considerably enhanced from 56 K to 281 K at the −10% compressive strain. The half-metallicity can be achieved whether under electron doping or hole doping. The Fe- d orbitals and the spin–orbit coupling interaction between occupied and unoccupied intraorbital states are responsible for the electronic phase transition and the magnetic anisotropy, respectively. Remarkably, the compressive −10% strain and the 0.02 e doping collectively increase the Curie temperature to near room temperature (286 K). The high spin polarization (exhibiting SGS and half-metal), the PMA and the near-room-temperature ferromagnetism induced by strain and doping make Janus FeClF a promising candidate for 2D spintronic applications, which will stimulate experimental and theoretical broad studies on this class of Janus monolayers FeXY (X,Y = F, Cl, Br, and X ≠ Y).",

Amongst them, transition-metal dichalcogenides, especially WSe 2 , have been one of the subjects of intensive studies. Yet, their single-photon purity and photon indistinguishability remain the most significant challenges to compete with mature semiconducting systems such as self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots. In this work, we explore the emission properties of quantum emitters in a WSe 2 monolayer which are induced by metallic nanoparticles. Under quasi-resonant pulsed excitation, we verify clean single-photon emission with a g (2) (0) = 0.036 ± 0.004. Furthermore, we determine the temperature dependent coherence time via Michelson interferometry, where a value of (13.5 ± 1.0) ps is extracted for the zero-phonon line at 4 K, which reduces to (9 ± 2) ps at 8 K. Associated time-resolved photoluminescence experiments reveal a decrease of the decay time from (2.4 ± 0.1) ns to (0.42 ± 0.05) ns. This change in decay time is explained by a model which considers a Förster-type resonant energy transfer process which yields a strong temperature induced energy loss from the single-photon emitters to the nearby Ag nanoparticle.",

These conflicting interpretations of the deep versus shallow nature of the chalcogen vacancies are due in part to shortcomings in prior first-principles calculations of defects in the semiconducting two-dimensional TMDs that have been used to explain experimental observations. Here we report results of hybrid density functional calculations for the chalcogen vacancy in a series of monolayer TMDs, correctly referencing the thermodynamic charge transition levels to the fundamental band gap (as opposed to the optical band gap). We find that the chalcogen vacancies are deep acceptors and cannot lead to n-type or p-type conductivity.

A modification of the mechanical exfoliation method, which provides higher yield of atomically thin flakes than conventional mechanical exfoliation, has been developed. We present general guidelines to determine the number of layers using optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in a fast and reliable way. Moreover, we demonstrate that the exfoliated flakes are highly crystalline and that they are stable even in free-standing form through Raman spectroscopy and TEM measurements. A strong thickness dependence of the band structure is found by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The exciton binding energy, within an effective mass approximation, is also calculated for different number of layers. Our computational results for the optical gap are consistent with preliminary photoluminescence results on thin flakes. Finally, we study the environmental stability of black phosphorus flakes finding that the flakes are very hydrophilic and that long term exposure to air moisture etches black phosphorus away. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the aging of the flakes is slow enough to allow fabrication of field-effect transistors with strong ambipolar behavior. DFT calculations also give us insight into the water-induced changes of the structural and electronic properties of black phosphorus.",

BP's strong affinity for water greatly modifies the performance of fabricated field-effect transistors (FETs) measured in ambient conditions. Upon exposure to air, we differentiate between two timescales for changes in BP FET transfer characteristics: a short timescale (minutes) in which a shift in the threshold voltage occurs due to physisorbed oxygen and nitrogen, and a long timescale (hours) in which strong p-type doping occurs from water absorption. Continuous measurements of BP FETs in air reveal eventual degradation and break-down of the channel material after several days due to the layer-by-layer etching process.",

Here we study the origin of magnetic anisotropy, a necessary ingredient to have magnetic order in two dimensions, combining two levels of modeling, density functional calculations and spin model Hamiltonians. We find two different contributions to the magnetic anisotropy of the material, both favoring off-plane magnetization and contributing to open a gap in the spin wave spectrum. First, ferromagnetic super-exchange across the $\\simeq $ 90 degree Cr-I-Cr bonds, are anisotropic, due to the spin orbit interaction of the ligand I atoms. Second, a much smaller contribution that comes from the single ion anisotropy of the $S=3/2$ Cr atom. Our results permit to establish the XXZ Hamiltonian, with a very small single ion anisotropy, as the adequate spin model for this system. Using spin wave theory we estimate the Curie temperature and we highlight the essential role played by the gap that magnetic anisotropy induces on the magnon spectrum.",

    "abstract": "We present an overview of the main techniques for production and processing of graphene and related materials (GRMs), as well as the key characterization procedures. We adopt a ‘hands-on’ approach, providing practical details and procedures as derived from literature as well as from the authors’ experience, in order to enable the reader to reproduce the results. Section I is devoted to ‘bottom up’ approaches, whereby individual constituents are pieced together into more complex structures. We consider graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) produced either by solution processing or by on-surface synthesis in ultra high vacuum (UHV), as well carbon nanomembranes (CNM). Production of a variety of GNRs with tailored band gaps and edge shapes is now possible. CNMs can be tuned in terms of porosity, crystallinity and electronic behaviour. Section II covers ‘top down’ techniques. These rely on breaking down of a layered precursor, in the graphene case usually natural crystals like graphite or artificially synthesized materials, such as highly oriented pyrolythic graphite, monolayers or few layers (FL) flakes. The main focus of this section is on various exfoliation techniques in a liquid media, either intercalation or liquid phase exfoliation (LPE). The choice of precursor, exfoliation method, medium as well as the control of parameters such as time or temperature are crucial. A definite choice of parameters and conditions yields a particular material with specific properties that makes it more suitable for a targeted application. We cover protocols for the graphitic precursors to graphene oxide (GO). This is an important material for a range of applications in biomedicine, energy storage, nanocomposites, etc. Hummers’ and modified Hummers’ methods are used to make GO that subsequently can be reduced to obtain reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with a variety of strategies. GO flakes are also employed to prepare three-dimensional (3d) low density structures, such as sponges, foams, hydro- or aerogels. The assembly of flakes into 3d structures can provide improved mechanical properties. Aerogels with a highly open structure, with interconnected hierarchical pores, can enhance the accessibility to the whole surface area, as relevant for a number of applications, such as energy storage. The main recipes to yield graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are also discussed. GICs are suitable precursors for covalent functionalization of graphene, but can also be used for the synthesis of uncharged graphene in solution. Degradation of the molecules intercalated in GICs can be triggered by high temperature treatment or microwave irradiation, creating a gas pressure surge in graphite and exfoliation. Electrochemical exfoliation by applying a voltage in an electrolyte to a graphite electrode can be tuned by varying precursors, electrolytes and potential. Graphite electrodes can be either negatively or positively intercalated to obtain GICs that are subsequently exfoliated. We also discuss the materials that can be amenable to exfoliation, by employing a theoretical data-mining approach. The exfoliation of LMs usually results in a heterogeneous dispersion of flakes with different lateral size and thickness. This is a critical bottleneck for applications, and hinders the full exploitation of GRMs produced by solution processing. The establishment of procedures to control the morphological properties of exfoliated GRMs, which also need to be industrially scalable, is one of the key needs. Section III deals with the processing of flakes. (Ultra)centrifugation techniques have thus far been the most investigated to sort GRMs following ultrasonication, shear mixing, ball milling, microfluidization, and wet-jet milling. It allows sorting by size and thickness. Inks formulated from GRM dispersions can be printed using a number of processes, from inkjet to screen printing. Each technique has specific rheological requirements, as well as geometrical constraints. The solvent choice is critical, not only for the GRM stability, but also in terms of optimizing printing on different substrates, such as glass, Si, plastic, paper, etc, all with different surface energies. Chemical modifications of such substrates is also a key step. Sections IV–VII are devoted to the growth of GRMs on various substrates and their processing after growth to place them on the surface of choice for specific applications. The substrate for graphene growth is a key determinant of the nature and quality of the resultant film. The lattice mismatch between graphene and substrate influences the resulting crystallinity. Growth on insulators, such as SiO2, typically results in films with small crystallites, whereas growth on the close-packed surfaces of metals yields highly crystalline films. Section IV outlines the growth of graphene on SiC substrates. This satisfies the requirements for electronic applications, with well-defined graphene-substrate interface, low trapped impurities and no need for transfer. It also allows graphene structures and devices to be measured directly on the growth substrate. The flatness of the substrate results in graphene with minimal strain and ripples on large areas, allowing spectroscopies and surface science to be performed. We also discuss the surface engineering by intercalation of the resulting graphene, its integration with Si-wafers and the production of nanostructures with the desired shape, with no need for patterning. Section V deals with chemical vapour deposition (CVD) onto various transition metals and on insulators. Growth on Ni results in graphitized polycrystalline films. While the thickness of these films can be optimized by controlling the deposition parameters, such as the type of hydrocarbon precursor and temperature, it is difficult to attain single layer graphene (SLG) across large areas, owing to the simultaneous nucleation/growth and solution/precipitation mechanisms. The differing characteristics of polycrystalline Ni films facilitate the growth of graphitic layers at different rates, resulting in regions with differing numbers of graphitic layers. High-quality films can be grown on Cu. Cu is available in a variety of shapes and forms, such as foils, bulks, foams, thin films on other materials and powders, making it attractive for industrial production of large area graphene films. The push to use CVD graphene in applications has also triggered a research line for the direct growth on insulators. The quality of the resulting films is lower than possible to date on metals, but enough, in terms of transmittance and resistivity, for many applications as described in section V. Transfer technologies are the focus of section VI. CVD synthesis of graphene on metals and bottom up molecular approaches require SLG to be transferred to the final target substrates. To have technological impact, the advances in production of high-quality large-area CVD graphene must be commensurate with those on transfer and placement on the final substrates. This is a prerequisite for most applications, such as touch panels, anticorrosion coatings, transparent electrodes and gas sensors etc. New strategies have improved the transferred graphene quality, making CVD graphene a feasible option for CMOS foundries. Methods based on complete etching of the metal substrate in suitable etchants, typically iron chloride, ammonium persulfate, or hydrogen chloride although reliable, are time- and resource-consuming, with damage to graphene and production of metal and etchant residues. Electrochemical delamination in a low-concentration aqueous solution is an alternative. In this case metallic substrates can be reused. Dry transfer is less detrimental for the SLG quality, enabling a deterministic transfer. There is a large range of layered materials (LMs) beyond graphite. Only few of them have been already exfoliated and fully characterized. Section VII deals with the growth of some of these materials. Amongst them, h-BN, transition metal tri- and di-chalcogenides are of paramount importance. The growth of h-BN is at present considered essential for the development of graphene in (opto) electronic applications, as h-BN is ideal as capping layer or substrate. The interesting optical and electronic properties of TMDs also require the development of scalable methods for their production. Large scale growth using chemical/physical vapour deposition or thermal assisted conversion has been thus far limited to a small set, such as h-BN or some TMDs. Heterostructures could also be directly grown. Section VIII discusses advances in GRM functionalization. A broad range of organic molecules can be anchored to the sp 2 basal plane by reductive functionalization. Negatively charged graphene can be prepared in liquid phase (e.g. via intercalation chemistry or electrochemically) and can react with electrophiles. This can be achieved both in dispersion or on substrate. The functional groups of GO can be further derivatized. Graphene can also be noncovalently functionalized, in particular with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that assemble on the sp 2 carbon network by π–π stacking. In the liquid phase, this can enhance the colloidal stability of SLG/FLG. Approaches to achieve noncovalent on-substrate functionalization are also discussed, which can chemically dope graphene. Research efforts to derivatize CNMs are also summarized, as well as novel routes to selectively address defect sites. In dispersion, edges are the most dominant defects and can be covalently modified. This enhances colloidal stability without modifying the graphene basal plane. Basal plane point defects can also be modified, passivated and healed in ultra-high vacuum. The decoration of graphene with metal nanoparticles (NPs) has also received considerable attention, as it allows to exploit synergistic effects between NPs and graphene. Decoration can be either achieved chemically or in the gas phase. All LMs, can be functionalized and we summarize emerging approaches to covalently and noncovalently functionalize MoS2 both in the liquid and on substrate. Section IX describes some of the most popular characterization techniques, ranging from optical detection to the measurement of the electronic structure. Microscopies play an important role, although macroscopic techniques are also used for the measurement of the properties of these materials and their devices. Raman spectroscopy is paramount for GRMs, while PL is more adequate for non-graphene LMs (see section IX.2). Liquid based methods result in flakes with different thicknesses and dimensions. The qualification of size and thickness can be achieved using imaging techniques, like scanning probe microscopy (SPM) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or spectroscopic techniques. Optical microscopy enables the detection of flakes on suitable surfaces as well as the measurement of optical properties. Characterization of exfoliated materials is essential to improve the GRM metrology for applications and quality control. For grown GRMs, SPM can be used to probe morphological properties, as well as to study growth mechanisms and quality of transfer. More generally, SPM combined with smart measurement protocols in various modes allows one to get obtain information on mechanical properties, surface potential, work functions, electrical properties, or effectiveness of functionalization. Some of the techniques described are suitable for ‘in situ’ characterization, and can be hosted within the growth chambers. If the diagnosis is made ‘ex situ’, consideration should be given to the preparation of the samples to avoid contamination. Occasionally cleaning methods have to be used prior to measurement.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), which organises a variety of structural, thermodynamic, elastic, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of around 1500 two-dimensional materials distributed over more than 30 different crystal structures. Material properties are systematically calculated by state-of-the-art density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory ( and the Bethe–Salpeter equation for ∼250 materials) following a semi-automated workflow for maximal consistency and transparency. The C2DB is fully open and can be browsed online (http://c2db.fysik.dtu.dk) or downloaded in its entirety. In this paper, we describe the workflow behind the database, present an overview of the properties and materials currently available, and explore trends and correlations in the data. Moreover, we identify a large number of new potentially synthesisable 2D materials with interesting properties targeting applications within spintronics, (opto-)electronics, and plasmonics. The C2DB offers a comprehensive and easily accessible overview of the rapidly expanding family of 2D materials and forms an ideal platform for computational modeling and design of new 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures.",

Layer-number and temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy suggests a magnetic persistence in FePS3 even down to monolayer regime through the spin–phonon coupling, while the Néel temperature decreases from 117 K in bulk to 104 K in monolayer sample.

Here, using first-principles theory we predict that two-dimensional (2D) monolayer Group IV monochalcogenides including GeS, GeSe, SnS, and SnSe are a class of 2D semiconducting multiferroics with strongly coupled giant in-plane spontaneous ferroelectric polarization and spontaneous ferroelastic lattice strain that are thermodynamically stable at room temperature and beyond, and can be effectively modulated by elastic strain engineering. Their optical absorption spectra exhibit strong in-plane anisotropy with visible-spectrum excitonic gaps and sizable exciton binding energies, rendering the unique characteristics of low-dimensional semiconductors. More importantly, the predicted low domain wall energy and small migration barrier together with the coupled multiferroic order and anisotropic electronic structures suggest their great potentials for tunable multiferroic functional devices by manipulating external electrical, mechanical, and optical field to control the internal responses, and enable the development of four device concepts including 2D ferroelectric memory, 2D ferroelastic memory, and 2D ferroelastoelectric nonvolatile photonic memory as well as 2D ferroelectric excitonic photovoltaics.",

Their intrinsic properties can, however, be obscured due to the influence of inhomogeneity in the external environment. Here we report methods for fabricating high quality TMDC monolayers with narrow photoluminescence (PL) linewidth approaching the intrinsic limit. We find that encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) sharply reduces the PL linewidth, and that passivation of the oxide substrate by an alkyl monolayer further decreases the linewidth and also minimizes the charged exciton (trion) peak. The combination of these sample preparation methods results in much reduced spatial variation in the PL emission, with a full-width-at-half-maximum as low as 1.7 meV. Analysis of the PL line shape yields a homogeneous width of 1.43 ± 0.08 meV and inhomogeneous broadening of 1.1 ± 0.3 meV.",

The coordination and thermal properties of these surface groups has, to date, not been investigated at the atomic level, despite strong variations in the MXene properties that are predicted from different coordinations and from the identity of the functional groups. To alleviate this deficiency, and to characterize the functionalized surfaces of single MXene sheets, the present investigation combines atomically resolved in situ heating in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and STEM simulations with temperature-programmed x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (TP-XPS) in the room temperature to 750 °C range. Using these techniques, we follow the surface group coordination at the atomic level. It is concluded that the F and O atoms compete for the DFT-predicted thermodynamically preferred site and that at room temperature that site is mostly occupied by F. At higher temperatures, F desorbs and is replaced by O. Depending on the O/F ratio, the surface bare MXene is exposed as F desorbs, which enables a route for tailored surface functionalization.",

Herein, we experimentally investigated the broadband nonlinear optical response of highly stable few-layer antimonene (FLA) by performing an open-aperture Z-scan laser measurement. Thanks to the direct bandgap and resonant absorption at the telecommunication band, we demonstrated the feasibility of FLA-decorated microfiber not only as an optical saturable absorber for ultrafast photonics operation, but also as a stable all-optical pulse thresholder that can effectively suppress the transmission noise, boost the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and reshape the deteriorated input signal. Our findings, as the first prototypic device of absorption of antimonene, might facilitate the development of antimonene-based optical communication technologies towards high stability and practical applications in the future.",

The general context of spintronics is first discussed together with open issues and recent advances achieved by the Graphene Spintronics Work Package consortium within the Graphene Flagship project. Based on such progress, which establishes the state of the art, several novel opportunities for spin manipulation such as the generation of pure spin current (through spin Hall effect) and the control of magnetization through the spin torque phenomena appear on the horizon. Practical applications are within reach, but will require the demonstration of wafer-scale graphene device integration, and the realization of functional prototypes employed for determined applications such as magnetic sensors or nano-oscillators.

A significant focus of the last decade's research in this field has been 2D semiconductors, whose electronic properties can be tuned through manipulation of dimensionality, substrate engineering, strain, and doping (Mak et al 2010 Phys. Rev. Lett. 105 136805; Zhang et al 2017 Sci. Rep. 7 16938; Conley et al 2013 Nano Lett. 13 3626–30; Li et al 2016 Adv.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten diselenide (WSe2) have dominated recent interest for potential integration in electronic technologies, due to their intrinsic and tunable properties, atomic-scale thicknesses, and relative ease of stacking to create new and custom structures. However, to go 'beyond the bench', advances in large-scale, 2D layer synthesis and engineering must lead to 'exfoliation-quality' 2D layers at the wafer scale. This roadmap aims to address this grand challenge by identifying key technology drivers where 2D layers can have an impact, and to discuss synthesis and layer engineering for the realization of electronic-grade, 2D materials. We focus on three fundamental areas of research that must be heavily pursued in both experiment and computation to achieve high-quality materials for electronic and optoelectronic applications.",

Carbide-based MXenes possess larger lattice constants and monolayer thicknesses than nitride-based MXenes. The in-plane Young's moduli of Tin+1Nn are larger than those of Tin+1Cn, whereas in both systems they decrease with the increase of the monolayer thickness. Cohesive energy calculations indicate that MXenes with a larger monolayer thickness have a better structural stability. Adsorption energy calculations imply that Tin+1Nn have stronger preference to adhere to the terminal groups, which suggests more active surfaces for nitride-based MXenes. More importantly, nearly free electron states are observed to exist outside the surfaces of -OH functionalized carbide/nitride based MXenes, especially in Tin+1Nn(OH)2, which provide almost perfect transmission channels without nuclear scattering for electron transport. The overall electrical conductivity of nitride-based MXenes is determined to be higher than that of carbide-based MXenes. The exceptional properties of titanium nitride-based MXenes, including strong surface adsorption, high elastic constant and Young's modulus, and good metallic conductivity, make them promising materials for catalysis and energy storage applications.",

Since the advent of two-dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (which is known as phosphorene due to its resembling graphene sheets) in early 2014, research interest in the arena of black phosphorus was reignited in the scientific and technological communities. Henceforth, a myriad of research studies on this new member of the 2D world have been extensively emerged. Fascinatingly, 2D black phosphorus exhibits a distinctive wrinkled structure with the high hole mobility up to 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1, excellent mechanical properties, tunable band structures, anisotropic thermal, electrical and optical properties, thus leading to its marvelous prospects in device applications. This review firstly introduces the state-of-the-art development, structural properties and preparation routes of black phosphorus. In particular, anisotropy involved in mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, carrier transport as well as optical properties is comprehensively discussed. Apart from discussing the recent progress in black phosphorus which is applied to devices (i.e. field effect transistors and optoelectronic), the review also highlights the bottlenecks encountered by the society and finally casts an invigorating perspective and insightful outlook on the future direction of the next-generation 2D black phosphorus by harnessing its remarkable characteristics for energy production.",

However, many relevant properties of Cr2Ge2Te6 still remain poorly understood, especially the spin-phonon coupling crucial to spintronic, multiferrioc, thermal conductivity, magnetic proximity and the establishment of long range order on the nanoscale. We explore the interplay between the lattice and magnetism through high resolution micro-Raman scattering measurements over the temperature range from 10 to 325 K. Strong spin-phonon coupling effects are confirmed from multiple aspects: two low energy modes splits in the ferromagnetic phase, magnetic quasielastic scattering in the paramagnetic phase, the phonon energies of three modes show clear upturn below TC, and the phonon linewidths change dramatically below TC as well. Our results provide the first demonstration of spin-phonon coupling in a potential two-dimensional atomic crystal.",

    "abstract": "An interplay of spin–orbit coupling and intrinsic magnetism is known to give rise to the quantum anomalous Hall and topological magnetoelectric effects under certain conditions. Their realization could open access to low power consumption electronics as well as many fundamental phenomena like image magnetic monopoles, Majorana fermions and others. Unfortunately, being realized very recently, these effects are only accessible at extremely low temperatures and the lack of appropriate materials that would enable the temperature increase is a most severe challenge. Here, we propose a novel material platform with unique combination of properties making it perfectly suitable for the realization of both effects at elevated temperatures. The key element of the computational material design is an extension of a topological insulator (TI) surface by a thin film of ferromagnetic insulator, which is both structurally and compositionally compatible with the TI. Following this proposal we suggest a variety of specific systems and discuss their numerous advantages, in particular wide band gaps with the Fermi level located in the gap.",

Here we report fabrication and transport measurements of phosphorene-hexagonal BN (hBN) heterostructures with one-dimensional edge contacts. These transistors are stable in ambient conditions for >300 h, and display ambipolar behavior, a gate-dependent metal–insulator transition, and mobility up to 4000 cm2 V−1 s−1. At low temperatures, we observe gate-tunable Shubnikov de Haas magneto-oscillations and Zeeman splitting in magnetic field with an estimated g-factor ∼2. The cyclotron mass of few-layer phosphorene (FLP) holes is determined to increase from 0.25 to 0.31 me as the Fermi level moves towards the valence band edge.

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic chips refer to an unconventional computing architecture that is modelled on biological brains. They are increasingly employed for processing sensory data for machine vision, context cognition, and decision making. Despite rapid advances, neuromorphic computing has remained largely an electronic technology, making it a challenge to access the superior computing features provided by photons, or to directly process vision data that has increasing importance to artificial intelligence. Here we report a novel light-stimulated synaptic device based on a graphene-carbon nanotube hybrid phototransistor. Significantly, the device can respond to optical stimuli in a highly neuron-like fashion and exhibits flexible tuning of both short- and long-term plasticity. These features combined with the spatiotemporal processability make our device a capable counterpart to today's electrically-driven artificial synapses, with superior reconfigurable capabilities. In addition, our device allows for generic optical spike processing, which provides a foundation for more sophisticated computing. The silicon-compatible, multifunctional photosensitive synapse opens up a new opportunity for neural networks enabled by photonics and extends current neuromorphic systems in terms of system complexities and functionalities.",

    "abstract": "The transition from graphene to a fully disordered sp2 carbon material can be idealized by either cutting graphene into smaller and smaller pieces, or adding more and more point defects. In other words, from the dimensionality standpoint, defects in two-dimensional (2D) systems can be either one- (1D) or zero-dimensional (0D). From an application point of view, both in terms of bottom-up as well as top-down approaches, the discrimination between these two structural disorder in two-dimensional systems is urgently desired. In graphene, both types of defects produce changes in the Raman spectrum, but identifying separately the contribution from each defect-type has not yet been achieved. Here we show that a diagram can be built for disentangling contributions of point-like and line-like defects to the Raman spectra of graphene-related materials embracing, from the topology point of view, all possible structures from perfect to fully disordered sp2 bonded carbons. Two sets of graphene-related samples, produced by well-established protocols that generate either 0D or 1D defects in a controlled way, are analysed with our model and used to parameterize the limiting values of the phase space. We then discuss the limitations and apply our new methodology to analyse the structure of two-dimensional nanocarbons generated from renewable gas, used to produce inks and conducting coatings.",

This Topical Review focuses on the theory and computation of excitons, plasmons and quasiparticle band structures in 2D materials and their heterostructures. The general theory is illustrated by applications to various types of 2D materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, graphene, phosphorene, and hexagonal boron nitride. The weak and highly non-local dielectric function of atomically thin crystals is shown to be responsible for many of the unique properties exhibited by the 2D materials such as the formation of strongly bound, non-Hydrogenic excitons, large band gap renormalization effects, and the different signatures of excitons and plasmons in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Among other topics covered are spin-orbit coupling, trions, interlayer excitons, exciton dissociation, and environmental screening. Technical issues associated with the application of the many-body GW method and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to 2D materials are also discussed. A combined quantum/classical method is introduced and used throughout to account for dielectric screening and self-energy effects from substrates and van der Waals heterostructures including the difficult case of non-matching lattices.",

We use single-layer MoS2 FETs with SiO2 and hBN insulators and demonstrate that both phenomena are indeed due to traps in the gate insulator with time constants distributed over wide timescales, where the faster ones lead to hysteresis and the slower ones to bias-temperature instabilities. Our data show that the use of hBN as a gate insulator considerably reduces the number of accessible slow traps and thus improves the reliability. However, the reliability of hBN insulators deteriorates with increasing temperature due to the thermally activated nature of charge trapping.",

The measurements were performed using Au/Ti leads in a two terminal configuration on CVD-grown MoS2 on a SiO2/Si substrate. The device was operated in air at room temperature at low bias voltages ranging from −2 V to 2 V and its sensing capabilities were tested for two different excitation wavelengths (514.5 nm and 488 nm). The responsivity reached 1.1 mA W−1 when excited with a 514.5 nm laser at a bias of 1.5 V. This responsivity is one order of magnitude larger than that reported from photo devices fabricated using CVD-grown multilayered WS2. A rectifying-effect was observed for the optically excited current, which was four times larger in the direct polarization bias when compared to the reverse bias photocurrent. Such rectifying behavior can be attributed to the asymmetric electrode placement on the triangular MoS2 monocrystal. It is envisioned that these components could eventually be used as efficient and low cost photosensors based on CVD-grown transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.",

Recently, 2D layered semiconductors such as MoS2 and SnSe2 have already demonstrated excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties due to their high electron mobility and unique band structures. Such combination of SnSe2 with MoS2 may provide a novel platform for the applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Thus, we constructed SnSe2/MoS2 based van der Waals heterostructures using MoS2 as templates, which may enrich the family of 2D van der Waals heterostructures. We demonstrate that the vdW heterostructures with high symmetry crystallographic directions show efficient interlayer charge transfer due to the strong coupling. This strong coupling is confirmed by theory calculations, low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and electrical transport properties. High performance photodetector based on the vdW heterostructure has been demonstrated with a high responsivity of up to 9.1 × 103 A W−1 which is higher by two orders of magnitude than those MoS2-only devices. The improved performance can be attributed to the efficient charge transfer from MoS2 to SnSe2 at the interface.",

While uniaxial strain can be easily applied in a controlled way, e.g., by bending of a flexible substrate with the atomically thin MoS2 layer on top, experimental realization of biaxial strain is more challenging. Here, we exploit the large mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients of MoS2 and a silicone-based substrate to apply a controllable biaxial tensile strain by heating the substrate with a focused laser. The effect of this biaxial strain is directly observable in optical spectroscopy as a redshift of the MoS2 photoluminescence. We also demonstrate the potential of this method to engineer more complex strain patterns by employing highly absorptive features on the substrate to achieve non-uniform heat profiles. By comparison of the observed redshift to strain-dependent band structure calculations, we estimate the biaxial strain applied by the silicone-based substrate to be up to 0.2 percent, corresponding to a band gap modulation of 105 meV per percentage of biaxial tensile strain.",

The atomic thinness of 2D materials enables highly scaled field-effect transistors (FETs) with reduced short-channel effects while maintaining high carrier mobility, essential for high-performance, low-voltage device operations. The richness of their electronic band structure opens up the possibility of using these materials in novel electronic and optoelectronic devices. These applications are strongly dependent on the electrical properties of 2D materials-based FETs. Thus, accurate characterization of important properties such as conductivity, carrier density, mobility, contact resistance, interface trap density, etc is vital for progress in the field. However, electrical characterization methods for 2D devices, particularly FET-related measurement techniques, must be revisited since conventional characterization methods for bulk semiconductor materials often fail in the limit of ultrathin 2D materials. In this paper, we review the common electrical characterization techniques for 2D FETs and the related issues arising from adapting the techniques for use on 2D materials.",

The ion implantation technique can be used to gradually introduce defects in semiconductor to obtain nanocrystallites (NCs) with different domain sizes. Here, we present a detailed study on the Raman and photoluminescence spectra of 2D NCs of monolayer WS2 (1L WS2) and 1L WSe2 prepared by ion implantation. With increasing ion dosages, both and modes of 1L WS2 exhibit a downshift in frequency and an asymmetrical broadening toward lower frequency, while the mode in 1L WSe2 NCs exhibits an opposite behavior, showing asymmetrical broadening and peak shift toward higher frequency. This behavior is well understood by phonon quantum confinement of the out-of-plane optical branch whose frequency displays a minimum at Γ in pristine 1L WSe2. After the ion implantation, phonons from the Brillouin zone boundary are revealed in the Raman spectra, and the corresponding assignments are identified by resonant Raman spectra at low temperature. The defects can act as trapping centers of free carriers, which result in a sharp decrease of photoluminescence (PL) emission from A exciton with increasing ion dosage. The PL peak from A-exciton in both 1L WS2 and 1L WSe2 NCs blueshifts with increasing the ion dosage due to the quantum confinement effect of smaller NC size. The ion-implantation results in a new emission peak of defect-bound neutral excitons below the A-exciton peak in both 1L WS2 and 1L WSe2 NCs. Its relative intensity to the A exciton increases with increasing the ion dosage and finally vanishes along with the A exciton. These results offer a route toward tailoring the optical properties of 2D materials by controlling the size of 2D NCs.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorene is a promising two dimensional (2D) material with a direct band gap, high carrier mobility, and anisotropic electronic properties. Phosphorene-based electronic devices, however, are found to degrade upon exposure to air. In this paper, we provide an atomic level understanding of stability of phosphorene in terms of its interaction with O2 and H2O. The results based on density functional theory together with first principles molecular dynamics calculations show that O2 could spontaneously dissociate on phosphorene at room temperature. H2O will not strongly interact with pristine phosphorene, however, an exothermic reaction could occur if phosphorene is first oxidized. The pathway of oxidation first followed by exothermic reaction with water is the most likely route for the chemical degradation of the phosphorene-based devices in air.",

    "abstract": "Although theoretical calculations predict vanadium carbide (V2C) MXene may possess superior performances as electrodes of supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries, a milder synthesis process of high-purity V2C MXene undoubtedly becomes one of the greatest hindrances for extending its applications. Herein, we report a hydrofluoric acid (HF)-free synthesis of 2D V2C MXene by milder etching V2AlC powders in the mixture of lithium fluoride and hydrochloric acid. The etching time plays vital roles on the structure and morphology of V2C MXene. The as-synthesized V2C MXene etched for 120 h displays a uniform multilayered structure and higher purity (>90%). All that matter is it exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 164 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, good cycling stability and high specific capacitance retention (~90% after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g−1) in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, other fluorides, including potassium fluoride, sodium fluoride and ammonium hydrogen fluoride, are also testified to be effective to obtain highly pure V2C MXene. This work provides the certainty for synthesizing MXenes besides Ti3C2 via a HF-free etching process to beneficially expand their promising application.",

With continued explorations expanding to include other layered materials with unique attributes, it is becoming clear that no one material will fill all the post-silicon era requirements. Here we review the properties and applications of layered, quasi-1D transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs) as novel materials for next generation electronics and optoelectronics. The TMTCs present a unique chain-like structure which gives the materials their quasi-1D properties such as high anisotropy ratios in conductivity and linear dichroism. The range of band gaps spanned by this class of materials (0.2 eV–2 eV) makes them suitable for a wide variety of applications including field-effect transistors, infrared, visible and ultraviolet photodetectors, and unique applications related to their anisotropic properties which opens another degree of freedom in the development of next generation electronics. In this review we survey the historical development of these remarkable materials with an emphasis on the recent activity generated by the isolation and characterization of atomically thin titanium trisulfide (TiS3).",

    "abstract": "Silicene is sometimes thought of as the Si alter ego of graphene. However, experimental evidence indicates that silicene is substantially different from graphene in terms of its stability, atomic structure, electronic properties, and device process issues. Some of these aspects hamper the feasibility of silicene for practical application, but at the same time they may offer routes to engineer or functionalize silicene as a complementary material to graphene if a good control of the material can be achieved. As such, the research on silicene runs along the cutting edge between unsurmountable limitation and pioneering opportunities. In the present review, we examine the issues that are representative of this dual edge and try to make a preliminary balance of the state-of-the-art features of this material. Each relevant topic will be explored in a dedicated section. We start with the introduction of 'experimental' silicene in the so-called 'flatland' from the point of view of technology drivers and of its conceptual precursor, freestanding silicene. We then explore the following: specific aspects of the silicene on substrates; the tendency of silicene to have multiple structural forms (what we call the polymorphic nature of silicene) the role of the strong hybridization with the substrate in the electronic band structure of silicene; the Raman spectrum of silicene, and silicene processing and integration into a transistor. Finally we conclude by proposing an investigation into silicene's emerging contemporaries in the realm of elementary two-dimensional materials. Mindful of ongoing discussions and current issues, we try to go to the heart of the problems by treating each topic objectively and scientifically and we then provide our personal views in the discussion.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical behavior of high quality two-dimensional (2D) crystals offers exciting opportunities for new material design, such as the combination of extremely high in-plane stiffness and bending flexibility, compared to existing three-dimensional (3D) material forms. By combining different 2D crystals vertically or by in-plane stitching, unusual properties can arise due to nonlinear mechanical interactions between them. Van der Waals forces between vertically stacked crystals give rise to a wide range of useful phenomena such as layer-number dependent friction, superlubricity, creasing, and spatial modulation of elastic properties through Moiré structures. In the present article, we review and explain the mechanical behavior of 2D materials and heterostructures (graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides). Linear elastic properties of these 2D crystalline monolayers are well-studied using membrane nanoindentation towards their application in nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) devices. On the other hand, a more thorough understanding of friction, fracture and stress transfer mechanisms between 2D layers and with the substrate or matrix is still lacking. More in-depth understanding of geometry-dependent behavior could enable the application of these materials in multi-functional composites. We discuss emerging opportunities achievable by assembling 2D heterostructures to tailor their mechanical behavior, and perhaps even break the traditional bounds limiting the properties of the bulk homostructures. Furthermore, to accelerate the design and discovery of the infinite combinations of new 2D heterostructures, we construct a crowd-sourced searchable online database to record and exploit the studies reporting on the complex arrangements of these crystals.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the excitonic nature of excited states in two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is of key importance to make use of their optical and charge transport properties in optoelectronic applications. We contribute to this by the direct experimental determination of the exciton binding energy (Eb,exc) of monolayer MoS2 and WSe2 on two fundamentally different substrates, i.e. the insulator sapphire and the metal gold. By combining angle-resolved direct and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy we measure the electronic band gap (Eg), and by reflectance measurements the optical excitonic band gap (Eexc). The difference of these two energies is Eb,exc. The values of Eg and Eb,exc are 2.11 eV and 240 meV for MoS2 on sapphire, and 1.89 eV and 240 meV for WSe2 on sapphire. On Au Eb,exc is decreased to 90 meV and 140 meV for MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. The significant Eb,exc reduction is primarily due to a reduction of Eg resulting from enhanced screening by the metal, while Eexc is barely decreased for the metal support. Energy level diagrams determined at the K-point of the 2D TMDCs Brillouin zone show that MoS2 has more p-type character on Au as compared to sapphire, while WSe2 appears close to intrinsic on both. These results demonstrate that the impact of the dielectric environment of 2D TMDCs is more pronounced for individual charge carriers than for a correlated electron–hole pair, i.e. the exciton. A proper dielectric surrounding design for such 2D semiconductors can therefore be used to facilitate superior optoelectronic device function.",

Several approaches have been pursued so far, such as introduction of defects, functionalization with adatoms, and shaping of graphene into nanoribbons with well-defined zigzag edges. A more robust and less invasive method utilizes the introduction of an exchange interaction by a ferromagnetic insulator in proximity with graphene. Here we present a direct measurement of the exchange interaction in room temperature ferromagnetic graphene. We study the spin transport in exfoliated graphene on a yttrium-iron-garnet substrate where the observed spin precession clearly indicates the presence and strength of an exchange field that is an unambiguous evidence of induced ferromagnetism. We describe the results with a modified Bloch diffusion equation and extract an average exchange field of the order of 0.2 T. Further, we demonstrate that a proximity induced 2D ferromagnet can efficiently modulate a spin current by controlling the direction of the exchange field. These results can create a building block for magnetic-gate tuneable spin transport in one-atom-thick spintronic devices.",

However, most 2D nanomaterial sensors suffer very long recovery time due to slow molecular desorption at room temperature. Here, we report a highly sensitive molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) gas sensor for NO2 and NH3 detection with greatly enhanced recovery rate. The effects of gate bias on sensing performance have been systematically studied. It is found that the recovery kinetics can be effectively adjusted by biasing the sensor to different gate voltages. Under the optimum biasing potential, the MoTe2 sensor can achieve more than 90% recovery after each sensing cycle well within 10 min at room temperature. The results demonstrate the potential of MoTe2 as a promising candidate for high-performance chemical sensors. The idea of exploiting gate bias to adjust molecular desorption kinetics can be readily applied to much wider sensing platforms based on 2D nanomaterials.",

While very recently, the presence of dark excitonic states has been experimentally demonstrated, the origin of these states, their formation, and dynamics have not been revealed yet. Here, we present a microscopic study shedding light on time- and energy-resolved formation and thermalization of bright and dark intra- and intervalley excitons as well as their impact on the photoluminescence in different TMD materials.

There is a well-demonstrated global need for high sensitivity, low cost and low energy consumption miniaturised gas sensors to be deployed in a dense network and to be used in an attempt to pinpoint and avoid high pollution hot spots. The high sensitivity of graphene to the local environment has shown to be highly advantageous in sensing applications, where ultralow concentrations of adsorbed molecules induce a significant response on the electronic properties of graphene. This is commonly attributed to the π electrons of graphene, being directly exposed to the surrounding environment. The unique electronic structure makes graphene the 'ultimate' sensing material for applications in environmental monitoring and air quality. In this review, we present the frontiers of graphene-based sensors considering both electrical and optical methods of detection and discuss the topical progress in an attempt to establish whether graphene can be considered as the ideal sensing material. We pay special attention to the optimization of the sensor performance, using various graphene hybrids and doping mechanisms. Furthermore, we present the recent developments in other 2D material-based sensors that have followed in the wake of graphene.

The inherent but unfavorable formation of high SiC surface terrace steps during high temperature sublimation growth is suppressed by rapid formation of the graphene buffer layer which stabilizes the SiC surface. The enhanced nucleation is enforced by decomposition of polymer adsorbates which act as a carbon source. With most of the steps well below 0.75 nm pure monolayer graphene without bilayer inclusions is formed with lateral dimensions only limited by the size of the substrate. This makes the polymer assisted sublimation growth technique the most promising method for commercial wafer scale epitaxial graphene fabrication.

Beyond the prototypical case of graphene, other 2D materials have recently come to the fore. Of particular technological interest are 2D semiconductors, of which the family of materials known as the group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted much attention. The presence of a bandgap allows for the fabrication of high on–off ratio transistors and optoelectronic devices, as well as valley/spin polarized transport. The technique of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has produced high-quality and contiguous wafer-scale 2D films, however, they often need to be transferred to arbitrary substrates for further investigation. In this review, the various transfer techniques developed for transferring 2D films will be outlined and compared, with particular emphasis given to CVD-grown TMDs. Each technique suffers undesirable process-related drawbacks such as bubbles, residue or wrinkles, which can degrade device performance by for instance reducing electron mobility. This review aims to address these problems and provide a systematic overview of key methods to characterize and improve the quality of the transferred films and heterostructures.

We here develop a microscopic theory and analyze necessary conditions for this zero-field superconducting diode effect. Taking into account the spin-orbit coupling induced in trilayer graphene via the proximity effect, we classify the pairing instabilities and normal-state orders and derive which combinations are consistent with the observed diode effect, in particular, its field trainability. We perform explicit calculations of the diode effect in several different models, including the full continuum model for the system, and illuminate the relation between the diode effect and finite-momentum pairing. Our theory also provides a natural explanation of the observed sign change of the current asymmetry with doping, which can be related to an approximate chiral symmetry of the system, and of the enhanced transverse resistance above the superconducting transition. Our findings not only elucidate the rich physics of trilayer graphene on WSe$_2$, but also establish a means to distinguish between various candidate interaction-induced orders in spin-orbit-coupled graphene moir\\'e systems, and could therefore serve as a guide for future experiments as well.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demands of bioassay and biomedical applications have significantly promoted the rational design and fabrication of a wide range of functional nanomaterials. Coupling these advanced nanomaterials with biomolecule recognition events leads to novel sensing and diagnostic platforms. Because of their unique structures and multifunctionalities, two-dimensional nanomaterials, such as graphene and graphene-like materials (e.g., graphitic carbon nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides, boron nitride, and transition metal oxides), have stimulated great interest in the field of optical biosensors and imaging because of their innovative mechanical, physicochemical and optical properties. Depending on the different applications, the graphene and graphene-like nanomaterials can be tailored to form either fluorescent emitters or efficient fluorescence quenchers, making them powerful platforms for fabricating a series of optical biosensors to sensitively detect various targets including ions, small biomolecules, DNA/RNA and proteins. This review highlights the recent progress in optical biosensors based on graphene and graphene-like 2D materials and their imaging applications. Finally, the opportunities and some critical challenges in this field are also addressed.",

    "abstract": "Nanomaterials based on two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals are considered to be very promising for various life-science and medical applications, from drug delivery to tissue modification. One of the most suitable materials for these purposes is graphene oxide (GO), thanks to a well-developed methods of production and water solubility. At the same time, its biological effect is still debated. Here we demonstrate that highly purified and thoroughly washed GO neither inhibited nor stimulated the growth of E.coli, ATCC25922; E.coli NCIMB11943 and S.aureus ATCC25923 at concentrations of up to 1 mg ml−1. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of GO exposed bacteria did not reveal any differences between GO exposed and not exposed populations. In contrast, a suspension of insufficiently purified GO behaved as an antibacterial material due to the presence of soluble acidic impurities, that could be removed by extended purification or neutralisation by alkaline substrates. A standardised protocol is proposed for the generation of clean GO, so it becomes suitable for biological experiments. Our findings emphasise the importance of GO purification status when dealing with biological systems as the true effect of material can be masked by the impact of impurities.",

Most research has so far focused on sulfur and selenium compounds, while tellurium-based materials have attracted little attention so far. As a first step in the investigation of Te-based semiconducting TMDs in this context, we have studied MoTe2 crystals with thicknesses above 4 nm, focusing on surface transport and a quantitative determination of the gap structure. Using ionic-liquid gated transistors, we show that ambipolar transport at the surface of the material is reproducibly achieved, with hole and electron mobility values between 10 and 30 cm2 V−1s−1 at room temperature. The gap structure is determined through three different techniques: ionic-liquid gated transistors and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, which allow the measurement of the indirect gap (Eind), and optical transmission spectroscopy on crystals of different thickness, which enables the determination of both the direct (Edir) and the indirect gap. We find that at room temperature Eind = 0.88 eV and Edir = 1.02 eV. Our results suggest that thin MoTe2 layers may exhibit a transition to a direct gap before mono-layer thickness. They should also drastically extend the range of direct gaps accessible in 2D semiconducting TMDs.",

The optimization of these techniques requires a complete understanding of the response of 2D TMDs to ion irradiation, which is affected by the reduced dimensionality of the system. By combining analytical potential molecular dynamics with first-principles calculations, we study the production of defects in free-standing MoS 2 sheets under noble gas ion irradiation for a wide range of ion energies when nuclear stopping dominates, and assess the probabilities for different defects to appear. We show that depending on the incident angle, ion type and energy, sulfur atoms can be sputtered away predominantly from the top or bottom layers, creating unique opportunities for engineering mixed MoSX compounds where X are chemical elements from group V or VII. We study the electronic structure of such systems, demonstrate that they can be metals, and finally discuss how metal/semiconductor/metal junctions, which exhibit negative differential resistance, can be designed using focused ion beams combined with the exposure of the system to fluorine.",

They have chair-like buckled structures similar to other layered materials such as silicene and germanene but with a square unit cell rather than a hexagonal one. This special structure gives rise to anisotropic band dispersions near the Fermi level that can be described by a generalized semi-Dirac Hamiltonian. We show that the considerably large band gap (∼0.1 eV) opened by spin-orbit coupling makes square selenene and tellurene topological insulators, hosting non-trivial edge states. Therefore, square selenene and tellurene are promising materials for novel electronic and spintronic applications.

An essential yet undeveloped ingredient for many photonic applications is the manipulation of its light emission. Here we demonstrate the control of excitonic light emission from monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) in an integrated photonic structure, achieved by transferring one monolayer onto a photonic crystal (PhC) with a cavity. In addition to the observation of greatly enhanced (~60 times) photoluminescence of WSe2 and an effectively coupled cavity-mode emission, we are able to redistribute the emitted photons both polarly and azimuthally in the far field through designing PhC structures, as revealed by momentum-resolved microscopy. A 2D optical antenna is thus constructed. Our work suggests a new way of manipulating photons in hybrid 2D photonics, important for future energy efficient optoelectronics and 2D nano-lasers.",

In its closed-packed triangular form, borophene is expected to exhibit anisotropic metallic character with relatively high electron velocities. At the same time, very low optical conductivities in the infrared-visible light region were predicted. Based on its promising electronic transport properties and its high transparency, borophene could become a genuine lego piece in the 2D materials assembling game known as the van der Waals heterocrystal approach. However, borophene is naturally degraded in ambient conditions and it is therefore important to assess the mechanisms and the effects of oxidation on borophene monolayers. Optical and electronic properties of pristine and oxidized borophene are here investigated by first-principles approaches. The transparent and conductive properties of borophene are elucidated by analyzing the electronic structure and its interplay with light. Optical response of borophene is found to be strongly affected by oxidation, suggesting that optical measurements can serve as an efficient probe for borophene surface contamination.",

However, growths of monolayer (ML) and bilayer (BL) WSe2—an important member of the TMD family—by the MBE method remain uncharted, probably because of the difficulty in generating tungsten fluxes from the elemental source. In this work, we present a scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) study of MBE-grown WSe2 ML and BL, showing atomically flat epifilm with no domain boundary (DB) defect. This contrasts epitaxial MoSe2 films grown by the same method, where a dense network of the DB defects is present. The STS measurements of ML and BL WSe2 domains of the same sample reveal not only the bandgap narrowing upon increasing the film thickness from ML to BL, but also a band-bending effect across the boundary (step) between ML and BL domains. This band-bending appears to be dictated by the edge states at steps of the BL islands. Finally, comparison is made between the STS-measured electronic bandgaps with the exciton emission energies measured by photoluminescence, and the exciton binding energies in ML and BL WSe2 (and MoSe2) are thus estimated.",

Related changes in Raman spectroscopy are also reported. The p-doping caused by Au on WSe2 monolayers lowers the channel resistance by orders of magnitude. The effective hole mobility is ∼100 (cm2/Vs) and the near ideal subthreshold swing of ∼60 mV/decade and high on/off current ratio of >106 are observed. The Au deposited on the WSe2 also serves as a protection layer to prevent a reaction between the WSe2 and the environment, making the doping stable and promising for future scalable fabrication.",

In this work, we present a fully dry PMMA transfer of graphene onto h-BN using a heating/cooling system which allows identification of clean interface area for high quality graphene/h-BN heterostructure fabrication. The mechanism lies in the utilization of the large difference in thermal expansion coefficients between polymers (PMMA/PDMS) and inorganic materials (graphene/h-BN substrate) to mechanically peel off PMMA from graphene by the thermal shrinkage of polymers, leaving no PMMA residue on the graphene surface. This method can be applied to all types of 2D layered materials.",

    "abstract": "While two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials are promising channel materials for wearable electronics and energy-efficient field-effect transistors (FETs), large hysteresis and large subthreshold swing induced by either dangling bonds at gate oxide dielectrics and/or trap molecules in bubbles at vdW interface are a serious drawback, hampering implementation of the 2D-material based FETs in real electronics. Here, we report a monolayer MoS2 FET with near-zero hysteresis reaching 0.15% of the sweeping range of the gate bias, a record-value observed so far in 2D FETs. This was realized by squeezing the MoS2 channel between top h-BN layer and bottom h-BN gate dielectrics and further removing the trap molecules in bubbles at the vdW interfaces via post-annealing. By segregating the bubbles out to the edge of the channel, we also obtain excellent switching characteristics with a minimum subthreshold swing of 63 mV/dec, an average subthreshold slope of 69 mV/dec for a current range of four orders of magnitude at room temperature, and a high on/off current ratio of 108 at a small operating voltage (<1 V). Such a near-zero hysteresis and a near-ideal subthreshold limit originate from the reduced trap density of ~5.2 × 109 cm−2 eV−1, a thousand times smaller than previously reported values.",

Recently, the discovery of single-photon emission from localized excitons has put monolayer WSe2 in the spotlight. The localized light emitters might be related to local strain potentials in the monolayer. Here, we measure strain-dependent energy shifts for the A, B, C, and D excitons for uniaxial tensile strain up to 1.4% in monolayer WSe2 by performing absorption measurements. A gauge factor of and is derived for the A, B, C, and D exciton, respectively. These values are in good agreement with ab initio GW-BSE calculations.

Although graphene has a high thermoelectric power factor, its overall ZT value is quite low as it possesses extremely high thermal conductivity. Phonons are the main heat carrier in graphene, and therefore propagation of heat in the material may be modulated by introducing defects into the structure, resulting in reduced thermal conductivity. In this study, we investigate the effect of graphene defect density on the thermoelectric performance of graphene. The defects introduced into graphene by oxygen plasma treatment reduce its Seebeck coefficient as well as its electrical conductivity; as a result, the thermoelectric power factor declines with increasing defect density. However, at higher defect densities, the reduction in thermal conductivity dominates over the reduction in electrical conductivity and, consequently, graphene treated in this way is observed to possess ZT values of up to three times that of pristine graphene. Therefore, it may be concluded that introducing controlled amount of defects into graphene is an effective way of reducing its thermal conductivity, thereby enhancing the performance of graphene-based thermoelectric devices.",

In this work, the fundamental nucleation and growth behavior of WSe2 is investigated through a detailed experimental design combined with on-lattice, diffusion-based first principles kinetic modeling to enable large area TMD growth. A three-stage adsorption-diffusion-attachment mechanism is identified and the adatom stage is revealed to play a significant role in the nucleation behavior. To limit the nucleation density and promote 2D layered growth, it is necessary to have a low metal flux in conjunction with an elevated substrate temperature. At the same time, providing a Se-rich environment further limits the formation of W-rich nuclei which suppresses vertical growth and promotes 2D growth. The fundamental understanding gained through this investigation has enabled an increase of over one order of magnitude in grain size for WSe2 thus far, and provides valuable insight into improving the growth of other TMD compounds by MBE and other growth techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD).",

When the inversion symmetry is breaking but the the time-reversal symmetry is preserved, a second-order Hall effect called the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NLAHE) emerges owing to the nonzero Berry curvature on the nonequilibrium Fermi surface. We reveal a strong NLAHE with a Hall-voltage that is quadratic with respect to the longitudinal current. The optimal current direction is normal to the mirror plane in these two-dimensional (2D) materials. The NLAHE can be sensitively tuned by an out-of-plane electric field, which induces a transition from a topological insulator to a normal insulator. Crossing the critical transition point, the magnitude of the NLAHE increases, and its sign is reversed.

    "abstract": "The significant progress in terms of fabricating large-area graphene films for transparent electrodes, barriers, electronics, telecommunication and other applications has not yet been accompanied by efficient methods for characterizing the electrical properties of large-area graphene. While in the early prototyping as well as research and development phases, electrical test devices created by conventional lithography have provided adequate insights, this approach is becoming increasingly problematic due to complications such as irreversible damage to the original graphene film, contamination, and a high measurement effort per device. In this topical review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the issues that need to be addressed by any large-area characterisation method for electrical key performance indicators, with emphasis on electrical uniformity and on how this can be used to provide a more accurate analysis of the graphene film. We review and compare three different, but complementary approaches that rely either on fixed contacts (dry laser lithography), movable contacts (micro four point probes) and non-contact (terahertz time-domain spectroscopy) between the probe and the graphene film, all of which have been optimized for maximal throughput and accuracy, and minimal damage to the graphene film. Of these three, the main emphasis is on THz time-domain spectroscopy, which is non-destructive, highly accurate and allows both conductivity, carrier density and carrier mobility to be mapped across arbitrarily large areas at rates that by far exceed any other known method. We also detail how the THz conductivity spectra give insights on the scattering mechanisms, and through that, the microstructure of graphene films subject to different growth and transfer processes. The perspectives for upscaling to realistic production environments are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The properties of graphene depend sensitively on strain and doping affecting its behavior in devices and allowing an advanced tailoring of this material. A knowledge of the strain configuration, i.e. the relative magnitude of the components of the strain tensor, is particularly crucial, because it governs effects like band-gap opening, pseudo-magnetic fields, and induced superconductivity. It also enters critically in the analysis of the doping level. We propose a method for evaluating unknown strain configurations and simultaneous doping in graphene using Raman spectroscopy. In our analysis we first extract the bare peak shift of the G and 2D modes by eliminating their splitting due to shear strain. The shifts from hydrostatic strain and doping are separated by a correlation analysis of the 2D and G frequencies, where we find for pure hydrostatic strain. We obtain the local hydrostatic strain, shear strain and doping without any assumption on the strain configuration prior to the analysis, as we demonstrate for two model cases: Graphene under uniaxial stress and graphene suspended on nanostructures that induce strain. Raman scattering with circular corotating polarization is ideal for analyzing frequency shifts, especially for weak strain when the peak splitting by shear strain cannot be resolved.",

    "abstract": "In order to deepen the knowledge of the vibrational properties of two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 atomic layers, a complete and systematic Raman scattering analysis has been performed using both bulk single-crystal MoS2 samples and atomically thin MoS2 layers. Raman spectra have been measured under non-resonant and resonant conditions using seven different excitation wavelengths from near-infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV). These measurements have allowed us to observe and identify 41 peaks, among which 22 have not been previously experimentally observed for this compound, and characterize the existence of different resonant excitation conditions for the different excitation wavelengths. This has also included the first analysis of resonant Raman spectra that are achieved using UV excitation conditions. In addition, the analysis of atomically thin MoS2 layers has corroborated the higher potential of UV resonant Raman scattering measurements for the non-destructive assessment of 2D MoS2 samples. Analysis of the relative integral intensity of the additional first- and second-order peaks measured under UV resonant excitation conditions is proposed for the non-destructive characterization of the thickness of the layers, complementing previous studies based on the changes of the peak frequencies.",

However, lack of ambient stability is hampering its incorporation in practical devices as it demands for an inert operating environment. Here, we study the individual effects of key environmental factors, such as temperature, light and humidity on the deterioration of BP. It is shown that humidity on its own does not cause material degradation. In fact, few-layer BP is employed as a recoverable humidity sensor. This study eliminates humidity as an active parameter in BP degradation. Hence, by simply isolating BP from light, its lifetime can be prolonged even in the presence of O2. As such, this study opens the pathway for devising new strategies for the practical implementation of BP.",

We found the co-existence of different stacking sequence (β- and γ-InSe) in the same flake with a sharp grain boundary in few-layered InSe. Edge reconstruction is also observed in monolayer InSe, which has a distinct atomic structure from the bulk lattice. Moreover, we discovered that the second-harmonic generation (SHG) signal from monolayer InSe shows large optical second-order susceptibility that is 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than MoS2, and even 3 times of the largest value reported in monolayer GaSe.

Micro-channels of chemically modified multi-layer epitaxial graphene (MLEG) have been used to provide a repeatable and reliable response to nano-molar (nM) concentrations of the cancer risk (oxidative stress) biomarker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy are used to characterize the functionalized MLEG. Confocal fluorescence microscopy using fluorescent-labelled antibodies indicates that the anti-8-OHdG antibody selectively binds to the phenyl amine-functionalized MLEG's channel. Current–voltage measurements on functionalized channels showed repeatable current responses from antibody–biomarker binding events. This technique is scalable, reliable, and capable of providing a rapid, quantitative, label-free assessment of biomarkers at nano-molar (<20 nM) concentrations in analyte solutions. The sensitivity of the sensor device was investigated using varying concentrations of 8-OHdG, with changes in the sensor's channel resistance observed upon exposure to 8-OHdG. Detection of 8-OHdG concentrations as low as 0.1 ng ml−1 (0.35 nM) has been demonstrated. This is five times more sensitive than reported enzyme linked immunosorbent assay tests (0.5 ng ml−1).",

    "abstract": "Flexible supercapacitors have emerged as one of the more promising and efficient space-saving energy storage system for portable and wearable electronics. Laser-induced graphenization has been recently proposed as a powerful and scalable method to directly convert a polymeric substrate into a 3D network of few layer graphene as high-performance supercapacitor electrode. Unfortunately this outstanding process has been reported to be feasible only for few thermoplastic polymers, strongly limiting its future developments. Here we show that laser induced graphenization of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) can be obtained and the mechanism of this novel process is proposed. The resulting material can act at the same time as binder-free electrode and current collector. Moreover SPEEK is also used both as separator and polymeric electrolyte allowing the assembling of an all-SPEEK flexible supercapacitor. Chemico-physical characterization provides deep understanding of the laser-induced graphenization process, reported on this polymer for the first time, while the device performance studied by cyclic voltammetry, charging–discharging, and impedance spectroscopy prove the enormous potential of the proposed approach.",

The film morphology, the thermally induced transformation of structural and compositional phases, as well as the chemical stability upon exposure to atmosphere are investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy. Predominantly, semiconducting α-MoTe2 islands are obtained under tellurium rich growth conditions and a substrate temperature of 200 °C. Under less tellurium-rich conditions, elongated and meandering MoTe2−x strands are formed rather than compact islands. Similarly, annealing of initial α-MoTe2 islands to above 500 °C causes the loss of tellurium and possibly transformation into the same MoTe2−x strands. Consequently, under vacuum conditions the the transformation of α-MoTe2 monolayers into the semimetallic β -MoTe2 high temperature phase is accompanied by a loss of Te and formation of MoTe2−x phase. The obtained tellurium deficient MoTe2−x phase is almost metallic but a small band gap of a few tens meV remains. The as-grown α-MoTe2 islands exhibit a moiré structure with ∼2.6 nm periodicity. This periodicity implies a rotation of ∼56° between the MoTe2 and MoS2. We assign the observation of a specific rotation angle for the grown MoTe2 islands with respect to the MoS2 substrate to the lowest energy adsorption configuration for MoTe2 monolayers on MoS2 substrates. Exposure of the as grown films to atmosphere results in oxidation of the MoTe2 film. The oxidized film maintains the two-dimensional island morphology of the initial film and thus is a candidate for a 2D (amorphous) oxide layer on MoS2.",

    "abstract": "The poor structural stability of phosphorene in air was commonly ascribed to humidity and oxygen molecules. Recent exfoliation of phosphorene in deoxygenated water promotes the need to re-examine the role of H2O and O2 molecules. Considering the presence of high population of vacancies in phosphorene, we investigate the interaction of H2O and O2 molecules with vacancy-contained phosphorene using first-principles calculations. In contrast to the common notion that physisorbed molecules tend to have a stronger adsorption at vacancy sites, we show that H2O has nearly the same adsorption energy at the vacancy site as that at the perfect one. Charge transfer analysis shows that O2 is a strong electron scavenger, which transfers the lone-pair electrons of the phosphorus atoms to the 2{\\pi}* antibonding orbital of O2. As a result, the barrier for the O-O bond splitting to form O-P bonds is reduced from 0.81 eV at the perfect site to 0.59 eV at the defect site, leading to an about 5000 faster oxidizing rate at the defect site than at the perfect site at room temperature. Hence, our work reveals that the vacancy in phosphorene shows a stronger oxygen affinity than the perfect phosphorene lattice site. Structural degradation of phosphorene due to oxidization may occur rapidly at edges and grain boundaries where vacancies tend to agglomerate.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we accurately revisit the mechanical exfoliation and layer number determination of MoS2. By modelling the exfoliation itself as a random vertical (lateral) exfoliation (fragmentation) phenomenon, a rationale is given to optimise the number of iterations in the scotch-tape peeling technique and we rigorously demonstrate that since the second cleavage the occurrence of monolayers is the most likely. For the unambiguous layer number identification, experiments have been carried out with a unified complementary approach based on optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, resonant and non resonant Raman spectroscopy, and photo-luminescence spectroscopy. The experimental analysis has been carried out on a statistically significant set of few-layer MoS2 flakes (from one to five layers). The work stresses the strong need of such complementary multi-technique approach to really unambiguously determine the layer number of flakes (that neither optical microscopy, nor AFM alone can give). Optical microscopy contrast analysis experiments (carried out on flakes deposited onto 270 nm SiO2/Si(1 0 0) substrates) demonstrate that for few-layer MoS2 (from the mono to the epta-layer) the optical contrast is weakly depending on the radiation wavelength and is a non-monotonic function of the layer number. Thus, flakes from ten to twelve layers exhibit the same contrast of monolayers, as demonstrated by parallel AFM analysis. AFM clearly shows that the stacking between the silicon oxide substrate and the first MoS2 layer is strongly unpredictable and likely depending on the degree of surface contamination of the substrate. A parallel systematic resonant Raman study is performed ranging from one to five layers clearly exhibiting systematic layer dependent spectral features in the one-five layers range. For the first time a layer estimation number based on a quantitative analysis of resonant Raman and PL spectra is proposed.",

The similarities and differences between these nanostructured materials have been examined using a combination of optical microscopy, scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy have also been used to distinguish between monolayer and few-layer material. Strain induced phonon shifts have been followed from the changes in the positions of the A1g and Raman bands during uniaxial deformation. This has been modelled for monolayer using density functional theory with excellent agreement between the measured and predicted behaviour. It has been found that as the number of WS2 layers increases for few-layer crystals or nanotubes, the A1g mode hardens whereas the mode softens. This is believed to be due to the A1g mode, which involves out of plane atomic movements, being constrained by the increasing number of WS2 layers whereas easy sliding reduces stress transfer to the individual layers for the mode, involving only in-plane vibrations. This finding has enabled the anomalous phonon shift behaviour in earlier pressure measurements on WS2 to be resolved, as well as similar effects in other transition metal dichalcogenides, such as molybdenum disulfide, to be explained.",

Here, we demonstrate an effective method to establish low-temperature Ohmic contacts in boron nitride encapsulated TMDC devices based on selective etching and conventional electron-beam evaporation of metal electrodes. This method works for most extensively studied TMDCs in recent years, including MoS2, MoSe2, WSe2, WS2, and 2H-MoTe2. Low electrical contact resistance is achieved at 2 K. All of the few-layer TMDC devices studied show excellent performance with remarkably improved field-effect mobilities ranging from 2300 to 16 000 cm2 V−1 s−1, as verified by the high carrier mobilities extracted from Hall effect measurements. Moreover, both high-mobility n-type and p-type TMDC channels can be realized by simply using appropriate contact metals. Prominent Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations have been observed and investigated in these high-quality TMDC devices.",

Three different GO thin sheets were synthesised from three starting graphite material: flakes (GO-f), ground (GO-g) and powder (GO-p) using a modified Hummers' method. The synthetic yield of this methodology was found to differ according to type of starting material, with GO-p resulting in most efficient yields. Structural and morphological comparison of the three GO sheet types were carried out using transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Optical properties were measured using UV/visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. Surface characteristics and chemistry were determined using a battery of techniques. Exposure to human cells was studied using the human A549 lung epithelial cultures. Our results revealed that all three GO samples were composed of few-layer sheets with similar physicochemical and surface characteristics. However, significant differences were observed in terms of their lateral dimensions with GO-p, prepared from graphite powder, being the largest among the GOs. No cytotoxicity was detected for any of the GO samples following exposure onto A549 cells up to 48 h. In conclusion, the form and type of the starting graphite material is shown to be an important factor that can determine the synthetic yield and the structural characteristics of the resulting GO sheets.",

    "abstract": "Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are being considered as a promising alternative channel material in ultra-thin and low power nanoelectronics, due to the significant tunability of their electronic properties via mechanisms such as mechanical strain, control of the material thickness, application of an external field, impurities, doping, alloying, or altering the substrate nature. Initially, monolayer TMDs as counterparts to graphene captured the attention of the scientific community owing to their semiconductor nature with sizable band gaps. However, certain physical and chemical properties of TMDs, such as their oxygen reactivity and stability in air need to be more completely understood in order to crystallize the promising superior performance of TMD-based electronic devices. Here, a comparative analysis of the stability of various TMDs (MX2: , W; , Se) in air is performed using density-functional theory (DFT) as well as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We find that the surface chemistry of the basal plane of sulfides and selenides is relatively stable in air although for completely different reasons, which can be explained by investigating oxygen dissociative adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics. On the contrary, the edge of MX2 nanoribbons shows strong driving forces towards O2 dissociation and chemisorption. Our combined theoretical and experimental investigation reveals that the air stability of TMDs should not be placed in the same footing that other 2D materials, like graphene. Thus, this work highlights the importance of having controlled oxygen environment during crystal exfoliation/growth and defect passivation in order to provide high quality uniform materials for TMD-based device fabrication.",

Here, using first-principles calculations, we investigate the electronic structure and interface characteristics of a newly synthesized GaSe/graphene (GaSe/g) vdW heterostructure. We show that the intrinsic electronic properties of GaSe and graphene are both well preserved in the heterostructure, with a Schottky barrier formed at the GaSe/g interface. More interestingly, the band alignment between graphene and GaSe can be effectively modulated by tuning the interfacial distance or applying an external electric filed. This makes the Schottky barrier height (SBH) controllable, which is highly desirable in the electronic and optoelectronic devices based on vdW heterostructures. In particular, the tunability of the interface dipole and potential step is further uncovered to be the underlying mechanism that ensures this controllable tuning of SBH.",

Studies on preparation of 2D metals have so far been limited, and this is in stark contrast to the situation of 2D semiconductors, where various layered semiconductors, including MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2, have been isolated in its monolayer form. In this work, we have developed a facile method to prepare 2D metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, where direct growth of few-layered NbS2 (3R phase) on atomically flat hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been demonstrated. Structural characterization of the so-grown NbS2 was performed with atomic force microscopy, optical microscopy, electron microscopy and optical spectroscopy, revealing that the utilization of hBN as growth substrates is a key factor for the first successful CVD growth of 2D metallic TMDCs with large single-domain size (several μm). Electrical transport measurements have clearly shown that NbS2 atomic layers down to few-layer-thickness are metal. The current study opens up a new synthetic route for controllable growth of 2D layered metallic materials, which is of great importance in study of rich physics in 2D metals, as well as in search for novel 2D superconductors.",

The original layout, where nano-sized graphene/Si heterojunctions alternate to graphene areas exposed to the electric field of the Si substrate, which acts both as diode cathode and transistor gate, results in a two-terminal barristor with single-bias control of the Schottky barrier. The nanotip patterning favors light absorption, and the enhancement of the electric field at the tip apex improves photo-charge separation and enables internal gain by impact ionization. These features render the device a photodetector with responsivity ( for white LED light at intensity) almost an order of magnitude higher than commercial photodiodes. We extensively characterize the voltage and the temperature dependence of the device parameters, and prove that the multi-junction approach does not add extra-inhomogeneity to the Schottky barrier height distribution. We also introduce a new phenomenological graphene/semiconductor diode equation, which well describes the experimental I–V characteristics both in forward and reverse bias.",

In the present work we have used the computational 2D materials database (C2DB) to search for new ferromagnetic 2D materials using the spinwave gap as a simple descriptor that accounts for the role of magnetic anisotropy. In addition to known compounds we find 17 novel insulating materials that exhibit magnetic order at finite temperatures. For these we evaluate the critical temperatures from classical Monte Carlo simulations of a Heisenberg model with exchange and anisotropy parameters obtained from first principles. Starting from 150 stable ferromagnetic 2D materials we find ten candidates that are predicted to have critical temperatures exceeding that of CrI3. We also study the effect of Hubbard corrections in the framework of DFT + U and find that the value of U can have a crucial influence on the prediction of magnetic properties.

In this study we employ ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW/BSE approximation to describe the entire Q-resolved exciton band structure for mono- and bilayers of the MX2 (M = Mo, W and X = Se, S) TMDCs. We find that the strong excitonic effects, i.e. strong electron-hole interactions, are present throughout the entire Q-space. While the exciton binding energies of the lowest excitons do not vary significantly with Q, we find a strong variation in their coupling strength. In particular, the latter are strongly peaked for excitons at Q = 0 and Q = Λ. For MoX2 monolayers the K → K' excitons constitutes the exciton ground state, while in WX2 monolayers direct transitions at K are lowest in energy. Our calculations further show that the exciton landscape is highly sensitive to strain and interlayer hybridization. For all four bilayers the exciton ground state is shifted to Γ → Λ or K → Λ transitions closely following the trends of the single-particle band structures.",

The conventional gate dielectric of FETs was replaced by a ferroelectric thin film that provides a ferroelectric polarization electric field, and therefore defined as an Fe-FET where the poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) was used as the gate dielectric. Among the devices with MoSe2 channels of different thicknesses, the device with a single layer of MoSe2 exhibited a large hysteresis of electronic transport with an over 105 write/erase ratio, and displayed excellent retention and endurance performance. The possible mechanism of the device's good properties was qualitatively analyzed using band theory. Additionally, a comprehensive study comparing the memory properties of MoSe2 channels of different thicknesses is presented. Increasing the numbers of MoSe2 layers was found to cause a reduced memory window. However, MoSe2 thickness of 5 nm yielded a write/erase ratio of more than 103. The results indicate that, based on a Fe-FET structure, the combination of two-dimensional semiconductors and organic ferroelectric gate dielectrics shows good promise for future applications in nonvolatile ferroelectric memory.",

BP5 monolayer is a multiferroic material with coupled ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity. The predicted reversible strain is up to 41.41%, which is the largest one among all reported ferroelastic materials. Due to the non-centrosymmetric structure and electronegativity differences between boron and phosphorus atoms, an in-plane spontaneous polarization of 1.63 × 10−10 C m−1 occurs in BP5. Moreover, the recently hunted negative Poisson's ratio property, is also observed in BP5. As an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 1.34 eV, BP5 displays outstanding optical and electronic properties, for instance strongly anisotropic visible-light absorption and high carrier mobility. Finally, we demonstrate that AlN (0 1 0) surface could be a suitable substrate for epitaxy growth of BP5 monolayer.

    "abstract": "One of the main characteristics of the new family of two-dimensional crystals of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is the strong spin–orbit interaction, which makes them very promising for future applications in spintronics and valleytronics devices. Here we present a detailed study of the effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) on the band structure of single-layer and bulk TMDs, including explicitly the role of the chalcogen orbitals and their hybridization with the transition metal atoms. To this aim, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a Slater–Koster tight-binding (TB) model. Whereas most of the previous TB models have been restricted to the K and K' points of the Brillouin zone (BZ), here we consider the effect of SOC in the whole BZ, and the results are compared to the band structure obtained by DFT methods. The TB model is used to analyze the effect of SOC in the band structure, considering separately the contributions from the transition metal and the chalcogen atoms. Finally, we present a scenario where, in the case of strong SOC, the spin/orbital/valley entanglement at the minimum of the conduction band at Q can be probed and be of experimental interest in the most common cases of electron-doping reported for this family of compounds.",

We introduce a simple semi-phenomenological description of the magnetic field evolution of individual electronic states in fundamental sub-bands by considering three additive components: valley, spin and orbital terms. We corroborate the validity of the proposed description by inspecting the Zeeman-like splitting of neutral and charged excitonic resonances in absorption-type spectra. The values of all three terms are estimated based on the experimental data, demonstrating the significance of the valley term for a consistent description of magnetic field evolution of optical resonances, particularly those corresponding to charged states. The established model is further exploited for discussion of magneto-luminescence data. We propose an interpretation of the observed large g-factor values of low energy emission lines, due to so-called bound/localized excitons in tungsten based compounds, based on the brightening mechanisms of dark excitonic states.",

We use simulations, in which we combine a recently presented semi-empirical potential for single-layer graphene, with a new term for out-of-plane deformations, [Jain et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 119, 2015] and an often-used interlayer potential [Kolmogorov et al., Phys. Rev. B, 71, 2005]. This combination of potentials is computationally cheap but accurate and precise at the same time, allowing us to study very large samples, which is necessary to reach very small mismatch angles in periodic samples. By performing large scale atomistic simulations, we show that the vortices appearing in the Moir\\'e pattern in the twisted bilayer graphene samples converge to a constant size in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the well known sinusoidal behavior of energy no longer persists once the misorientation angle becomes very small ($\\theta<1^0$). We also show that there is a significant buckling after the relaxation in the samples, with the buckling height proportional to the system size. These structural properties have direct consequences on the electronic and optical properties of bilayer graphene.",

The temperature dependence of the Raman scattering in hBN is investigated first such as to define appropriate measurements conditions suitable for thin layers avoiding undesirable heating induced effects. We further focus on the low frequency Raman mode corresponding to the rigid shearing oscillation between adjacent layers, found to be equal to 52.5 cm-1 in bulk hBN. For hBN sheets with thicknesses below typically 4 nm, the frequency of this mode presents discrete values, which are found to decrease down to 46.0(5) cm-1 for a three-layer hBN, in good agreement with the linear-chain model.

At lower temperatures, the rGO sample showed a conduction mechanism consistent with Mott's two-dimensional variable range hopping (2D-VRH).

However, there are still many problems impeding the practical use of lithium-sulfur batteries, including the 'shuttle effect' and irreversible loss of active materials. Enhancing the interfacial interaction between the carbon hosts and the sulfur-containing guests by rational nitrogen doping is an effective route. First principle calculations were performed to illustrate the adsorption behavior between sulfur/lithium (poly)sulfides and pristine/nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbons with different edge structures. N-dopants on doped graphene nanoribbon in pyrrolic and pyridinic forms donated extra binding energies of 1.12 ∼ 1.41 eV and 0.55 ∼ 1.07 eV, respectively. Quaternary nitrogen enriched on the edge can benefit from the adsorption of active materials. Compared with pristine graphene nanoribbon, nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbons exhibited strong-couple interactions for anchoring sulfur-containing species, achieving high stability and reversibility, which was consistent with experimental findings. These results shed light on the cathode design of lithium-sulfur batteries and on the potential to understand host--guest interactions in other energy storage systems.",

The superconducting property has not been unambiguously observed, which is unexpected because light element boron should have strong electron–phonon coupling. To resolve this puzzle, we show that the superconducting transition temperature Tc of β12 borophene is effectively suppressed by the substrate-induced tensile strain and electron doping via first principles calculations. The biaxial tensile strain of 2% induced by Ag(1 1 1) significantly reduces Tc from 14 K to 2.95 K; electron doping of 0.1 e− per boron atom further shrinks Tc to 0.09 K. We also predict that the superconducting transition temperature in β12 can be enhanced to 22.82 K with proper compressive strain (−1%) and 18.97 K with hole doping (0.1 h+ per boron). Further studies indicate that the variation of Tc is closely related to the density of states of σ bands near the Fermi surface.

    "abstract": "Abstract Second harmonic generation (SHG) of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials has attracted immense research interests due to the abilities of photon generation, manipulation, transmission, detection, and imaging for the applications of modern on-chip nanophotonic devices. Some layered materials with broken inversion symmetry associated with their 2D nature enable the development of nanophotonic and nanooptoelectronic devices based on the second harmonic generation effect. Recently, many 2D materials with broken inversion symmetry have been discovered, which not only exhibit SHG quantum effects but also greatly promote the development of nanophotonics. In this review, we review the recent developments of all 2D SHG materials, including the graphene-like family, transition metal dichalcogenides, IIIA-VIA compounds and others. We focus on their fabrication, structural characteristics, and generating mechanism and basic characteristics of SHG, associated with the main strategies to tune, modulate, and enhance the SHG of 2D materials. Additionally, several practical applications and possible future research directions of 2D material-based SHG are discussed.",

The device, fabricated by transfer of commercial graphene on low-doped n-type Si substrate, achieves a photoresponse as high as and a normalized detectivity higher than in the visible range. It exhibits a photocurrent exceeding the forward current because photo-generated minority carriers, accumulated at Si/SiO2 interface of the Gr/SiO2/Si capacitor, diffuse to the Gr/Si junction. We show that the same mechanism, when due to thermally generated carriers, although usually neglected or disregarded, causes the increased leakage often measured in Gr/Si heterojunctions. We perform extensive I–V and C-V characterization at different temperatures and we measure a zero-bias Schottky barrier height of 0.52 eV at room temperature, as well as an effective Richardson constant A** = and an ideality factor , explained by a thin (<1 nm) oxide layer at the Gr/Si interface.",

By pumping the device with ultrafast laser pulses near the cavity mode at the telecommunication wavelength, we observe a near visible SHG with a narrow linewidth and near unity linear polarization, originated from the coupling of the pump photon to the cavity mode. The observed SHG is enhanced by factor of ∼200 compared to a bare monolayer on silicon.

Using first-principles density functional theory and quasiparticle GW calculations, we demonstrate how uniaxial tensile strain can be utilized to optimize the electronic and optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenide lateral (in-plane) heterostructures such as MoX2/WX2 (X = S, Se, Te). We find that these lateral-type heterostructures may facilitate efficient electron–hole separation for light detection/harvesting and preserve their type II characteristic up to 12% of uniaxial strain. Based on the strain-dependent bandgap and band offset, we show that uniaxial tensile strain can significantly increase the power conversion efficiency of these lateral heterostructures. Our results suggest that these strain-engineered lateral heterostructures are promising for optimizing optoelectronic device performance by selectively tuning the energetics of the bandgap.",

Since 521-MOF nanosheets displayed good electrochemical activity, high surface area, and strong affinity interaction between the MOF and the oligonucleotides sequences, they can impel the immobilization of large amounts of aptamer strands when applied as a platform of biosensor. As a result, the developed aptasensor exhibited sensitive bio-recognition for the cancer determination marker protein, mucin 1 (MUC1). The combination of electrochemical techniques and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR) was performed to probe the kinetic processes of the aptamer immobilization and the MUC1 detection. The consistency between different determination approaches was observed, in which the developed aptasensor based on 521-MOF nanosheets exhibits pretty high sensitivity for detecting MUC1 with a low detect limit of 0.12 and 0.65 pg·ml−1 deduced from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and SPR, respectively, within the broad concentration range of MUC1 from 0.001 to 0.5 ng·ml−1. Simultaneously, a comparable affinity constant, Ka, was derived from EIS and SPR, which also demonstrates that this new biosensing strategy has high selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and good applicability for the MUC1 detection in the human serum. The present finding indicates that the synthesized 521-MOF nanosheets can be employed in the fields of the biosensing or biomedical diagnosis and explored for different kinds of biosensors.",

    "abstract": "Monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides such as WSe2 have become increasingly attractive due to their potential in electrical and optical applications. Because the properties of these 2D systems are known to be affected by their surroundings, we report how the choice of the substrate material affects the optical properties of monolayer WSe2. To accomplish this study, pump-density-dependent micro-photoluminescence measurements are performed with time-integrating and time-resolving acquisition techniques. Spectral information and power-dependent mode intensities are compared at 290 K and 10 K for exfoliated WSe2 on SiO2/Si, sapphire (Al2O3), hBN/Si3N4/Si, and MgF2, indicating substrate-dependent appearance and strength of exciton, trion, and biexciton modes. Additionally, one CVD-grown WSe2 monolayer on sapphire is included in this study for direct comparison with its exfoliated counterpart. Time-resolved micro-photoluminescence shows how radiative decay times strongly differ for different substrate materials. Our data indicates exciton–exciton annihilation as a shortening mechanism at room temperature, and subtle trends in the decay rates in correlation to the dielectric environment at cryogenic temperatures. On the measureable time scales, trends are also related to the extent of the respective 2D-excitonic modes' appearance. This result highlights the importance of further detailed characterization of exciton features in 2D materials, particularly with respect to the choice of substrate.",

Although the gas adsorption does not modify the conduction type, we demonstrate a correlation between hysteresis width and adsorption energy onto the MoS2 surface. We show that hysteresis is controllable by pressure and/or gas type.

Here, we fabricate a vertical GaTe–InSe van der Waals (vdWs) p–n heterojunction by a PDMS-assisted transfer technique without etching. The fabricated p–n heterojunction shows gate-tunable current-rectifying behavior with a rectification factor reaching 1000. In addition, it features fast photodetection under zero bias as well as a high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Under 405 nm laser excitation, the zero-biased photodetector shows a high responsivity of 13.8 mA W−1 as well as a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.2%. Long-term stability is also observed and a response time of 20 µs is achieved due to stable and fast carrier transit through the built-in electric field in the depletion region. Fast and efficient charge separation in the vertical 2D p–n junction paves the way for developing 2D photodetectors with zero dark current, high speed and low power consumption.",

Here, the broadband nonlinear optical properties of zero-gap 2D Ti2CTx MXene—a class of 2D transition metal carbides that exhibit high laser damage threshold—is discussed. Using the open aperture Z-scan method, for the first time the broadband saturable absorption properties of Ti2CTx in the 800–1560 nm spectral range are demonstrated. Specifically, it is shown that the high absorption and low saturation intensity of Ti2CTx make it an ideal saturable absorber for mode-locked fiber lasers operating at 1565 and 1051 nm, which exhibited pulse widths of 5.3 ps and 164 ps, respectively. Additionally, a Ti2CTx saturable absorber was used as a Q-switcher to realize a pulsed fiber laser operating at 2.8 µm, which showed excellent nonlinear absorption performance in the mid-infrared regime. This study significantly broadens the scope of materials available for non-linear optical applications in the near and mid-infrared regimes.",

Impressively, the separation of the electron–hole pairs (excitons) extends onto the whole 1L–2L WSe2 junction surface. The responsivity of the WSe2 junction photodetector is over 3200 times higher than that of a monolayer WSe2 device and leads to a highest external quantum efficiency of 256% due to the efficient carrier extraction.

Here we measure in a quantitative, objective way the size and shape of 2D monoatomic nanosheets using a combination of optical, electronic and scanning probe techniques. We measure, one by one, the size and shape of thousands of sheets of graphene oxide as they undergo a standard ultrasonication treatment. Using automatic image processing and statistical modelling we identify two different fragmentation processes in 2D at the nanoscale, related to two populations of nanosheets described by gamma and exponential size distributions respectively. The two populations of sheets coexist during the fragmentation process, each one retaining its average size and shape. Our results explain the size reduction commonly observed in nanosheets upon sonication as an effect of changes in the respective weights of the two populations of nanosheets present in the material.",

For similar purposes, heteroatoms have been introduced into carbon nanomaterials both during growth and using post-growth methods. However, due to the nature of the samples, it has been challenging to determine whether the heteroatoms have been incorporated into the lattice as intended, with direct observations so far being limited to N and B dopants, and incidental Si impurities. Furthermore, ion implantation of these materials is more challenging due to the requirement of very low ion energies and atomically clean surfaces. Here, we provide the first atomic-resolution imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) evidence of phosphorus atoms incorporated into the graphene lattice by low-energy ion irradiation. The measured P L-edge response of an single-atom EELS spectrum map shows excellent agreement with an ab initio spectrum simulation, conclusively identifying the P in a buckled substitutional configuration.

    "abstract": "Here we report on technology developments implemented into the Graphene Flagship European project for the integration of graphene and graphene-related materials (GRMs) into energy application devices. Many of the technologies investigated so far aim at producing composite materials associating graphene or GRMs with either metal or semiconducting nanocrystals or other carbon nanostructures (e.g., CNT, graphite). These composites can be used favourably as hydrogen storage materials or solar cell absorbers. They can also provide better performing electrodes for fuel cells, batteries, or supercapacitors. For photovoltaic (PV) electrodes, where thin layers and interface engineering are required, surface technologies are preferred. We are using conventional vacuum processes to integrate graphene as well as radically new approaches based on laser irradiation strategies. For each application, the potential of implemented technologies is then presented on the basis of selected experimental and modelling results. It is shown in particular how some of these technologies can maximize the benefit taken from GRM integration. The technical challenges still to be addressed are highlighted and perspectives derived from the running works emphasized.",

Au forms a van der Waals interface with WSe2 regardless of deposition chamber ambient. In contrast, Ir and Cr form a covalent interface by reducing WSe2 to form interfacial metal selenides. When Cr is deposited under HV conditions, significant oxygen incorporation is observed resulting in the thermodynamically favorable formation of tungsten oxyselenide and a substantial concentration of CrxOy. Regardless of contact metal, WOx (2.63 < x < 2.92) forms during deposition under HV conditions which may positively affect interface transport properties. Cr and Ir form unexpectedly large electron and hole Schottky barriers, respectively, when deposited under UHV conditions due to interfacial reactions that contribute to anomalous band alignment. These results reveal the true interface chemistry formed between metals and WSe2 under UHV and HV conditions and demonstrate the impact on the Fermi level position following contact formation on WSe2.",

On the other hand, the existence of a stable oxide at room temperature can offer prospects for several applications. Here we report on the chemical reactivity of γ-InSe, a recent addition to the family of 2D vdW crystals. We demonstrate that, unlike other 2D materials, InSe nanolayers can be chemically stable under ambient conditions. However, both thermal- and photo-annealing in air induces the oxidation of the InSe surface, which converts a few surface layers of InSe into In2O3, thus forming an InSe/In2O3 heterostructure with distinct and interesting electronic properties. The oxidation can be activated in selected areas of the flake by laser writing or prevented by capping the InSe surface with an exfoliated flake of hexagonal boron nitride. We exploit the controlled oxidation of p-InSe to fabricate p-InSe/n-In2O3 junction diodes with room temperature electroluminescence and spectral response from the near-infrared to the visible and near-ultraviolet ranges. These findings reveal the limits and potential of thermal- and photo-oxidation of InSe in future technologies.",

Here, we show that a wide range of lateral 2D heterostructures could have a prominent advantage over the traditional three-dimensional (3D) heterostructures, because their band alignments are insensitive to the interfacial conditions. They should be at the Schottky–Mott limits for semiconductor–metal junctions and at the Anderson limits for semiconductor junctions, respectively. This fundamental difference from the 3D heterostructures is rooted in the fact that, in the asymptotic limit of large distance, the effect of the interfacial dipole vanishes for 2D systems. Due to the slow decay of the dipole field and the dependence on the vacuum thickness, however, studies based on first-principles calculations often failed to reach such a conclusion. Taking graphene/hexagonal-BN and MoS2/WS2 lateral heterostructures as the respective prototypes, we show that the converged junction width can be order of magnitude longer than that for 3D junctions. The present results provide vital guidance to high-quality transport devices wherever a lateral 2D heterostructure is involved.",

In particular, a band separated by ∼55 meV from the A exciton, referred to as the C band, shows the same linear dependence on excitation intensity as the band edge excitons. A band similar to the C band has been previously ascribed to a trion, a charged, three-particle exciton. However, in our study the C band does not show the 3/2 power dependence on excitation intensity as would be expected for a three-particle exciton. Further, the PL from the MoS2 monolayer in a bilayer WS2/MoS2 heterostructure, under resonant excitation conditions where only the MoS2 absorbs the laser energy, also revealed a linear dependence on excitation intensity for the C band, confirming that its origin is not due to a trion but instead a bound exciton, presumably of an unintentional impurity or a native point defect such as a sulfur vacancy. The PL from the WS2/MoS2 heterostructure, under resonant excitation conditions also showed additional features which are suggested to arise from the interface states at the heteroboundary. Further studies are required to clearly identify the origin of these features.",

We describe how the inter-layer interaction as well as the variation in electronic screening as a function of layer number N affects the electronic and optical properties. Using both ab initio calculations and a tight-binding model for an effective Hamiltonian describing the excitons, we characterize in detail the symmetry of the excitonic wavefunctions and the selection rules for their coupling to incoming light. We show that for N > 2, one can distinguish between surface excitons that are mostly localized on the outer layers and inner excitons, leading to an asymmetry in the energy separation between split excitonic states. In particular, the bound surface excitons lie lower in energy than their inner counterparts. Additionally, this enables us to show how the layer thickness affects the shape of the absorption spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite intensive research on the application of two-dimensional (2D) materials, including MXenes, in nanomedicine, the knowledge concerning the mechanisms responsible for their observed bio-effects is far from being understood. Here we present insight into the mechanism of toxicity in vitro of the 2D Ti 3 C 2 MXene. The most important results of this work are that using simple, inexpensive, post-delamination treatments, such as ultrasonication or mild thermal oxidation it is possible to ‘tune’ the cytotoxicity of the Ti 3 C 2 T z flakes. Sonication of Ti 3 C 2 T z flakes, or sonication followed by mild oxidation in the water at 60 °C, renders them selectively toxic to cancer cells as compared to non-malignant ones. It relates to the appearance of superficial titanium (III) oxide (Ti 2 O 3 ) layer corresponding to the type of post-treatment. The presence of surface-Ti 2 O 3 results in a noticeably higher generation of oxidative stress compared to pristine 2D Ti 3 C 2 . Our findings give evidence that the sonication and thermal treatments were successful in changing the nature of the surface terminations on the Ti 3 C 2 T z surfaces. This study makes a significant contribution to the future rationalized surface-management of 2D Ti 3 C 2 MXene as well as encourages new rationalized applications in biotechnology and nanomedicine. Bullet points: 1. First study on 2D Ti 3 C 2 MXene superficially oxidized to titanium (III) oxide i.e. Ti 2 O 3 . 2. By sonication Ti 3 C 2 Tz MXene flakes followed by mild thermal oxidation in the water at 60 °C for 24 h, it is possible to ‘tune’ the toxicity of the flakes to cancerous cell lines. 3. Decreases in cell viabilities were dose-dependent. 4. Highest cytotoxic effect was observed for thermally oxidized samples. 5. The thermally oxidized samples were also selectively toxic towards all cancerous cell lines up to 375 mg l −1 . 6. Reactive oxygen species generation was identified as a mechanism of toxicity.",

Here, the optical properties of chemical vapor deposition-grown PtSe2 films with different thicknesses were characterized with nondestructive spectroscopic ellipsometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The polarized optical microscopy reveals the isotropic in-plane optical response of the continuous PtSe2 films in a scale size of at least as small as 143 × 108 µm2. The electrical transport characterization and UV-mid infrared absorption spectra reveal the coexistence of both semiconducting and metallic contents in these PtSe2 films, making PtSe2 quite different among the 2D material family. The effective refractive index (n) and the extinction coefficient (k) over a spectra range of 360–1700 nm were obtained. In contrast to other TMDs, the values of n and k of PtSe2 were found to have a strong dependence on the thickness and they decrease as the reduction of thickness. This work is conducive to provide vital parameters for further study on PtSe2 and could facilitate its application in optoelectronic devices.",

These light emitters appear with a wide range of transition energies ranging over the entire visible spectrum, which renders the identification of the underlying atomic structure challenging. In addition to their eminent properties as quantum light emitters, the coupling to phonons is remarkable. Their photoluminescence exhibits significant side band emission well separated from the zero phonon line (ZPL) and an asymmetric broadening of the ZPL itself. In this combined theoretical and experimental study we show that the phonon side bands can be well described in terms of the coupling to bulk longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. To describe the ZPL asymmetry we show that in addition to the coupling to longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons also the coupling to local mode oscillations of the defect center with respect to the entire host crystal has to be considered. By studying the influence of the emitter's wave function dimensions on the phonon side bands we find reasonable values for the size of the wave function and the deformation potentials. We perform photoluminescence excitation measurements to demonstrate that the excitation of the emitters is most efficient by LO-phonon assisted absorption.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanomaterials such as graphene exhibit unique material properties including high electrical conductivity, surface area, and biocompatibility that have the potential to significantly improve the performance of electrochemical sensors. Since in-field electrochemical sensors are typically disposable, they require materials that are amenable to low-cost, high-throughput, and scalable manufacturing. Conventional graphene devices based on low-yield chemical vapor deposition techniques are too expensive for such applications, while low-cost alternatives such as screen and inkjet printing do not possess sufficient control over electrode geometry to achieve favorable electrochemical sensor performance. In this work, aerosol jet printing (AJP) is used to create high-resolution (∼40 μm line width) interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) on flexible substrates, which are then converted into histamine sensors by covalently linking monoclonal antibodies to oxygen moieties created on the graphene surface through a CO2 thermal annealing process. The resulting electrochemical sensors exhibit a wide histamine sensing range of 6.25–200 ppm (56.25 μM–1.8 mM) and a low detection limit of 3.41 ppm (30.7 μM) within actual tuna broth samples. These sensor metrics are significant since histamine levels over 50 ppm in fish induce adverse health effects including severe allergic reactions (e.g. Scombroid food poisoning). Beyond the histamine case study presented here, the AJP and functionalization process can likely be generalized to a diverse range of sensing applications including environmental toxin detection, foodborne pathogen detection, wearable health monitoring, and health diagnostics.",

In this work, we study the electronic structure of twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homo- and heterobilayers that are obtained by combining MoS 2 , WS 2 , MoSe 2 and WSe 2 monolayers, and show how flat band properties depend on the chemical composition of the bilayer as well as its twist angle. We determine the relaxed atomic structure of the twisted bilayers using classical force fields and calculate the electronic band structure using a tight-binding model parametrized from first-principles density-functional theory.

In this review, we present the current state-of-the-art in the experimental study of the dynamics of 2D membranes. The focus will be both on the experimental measurement techniques and on the interpretation of the physical phenomena exhibited by atomically thin membranes in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We will show that resonant 2D membranes have emerged both as sensitive probes of condensed matter physics in ultrathin layers, and as sensitive elements to monitor small external forces or other changes in the environment. New directions for utilizing suspended 2D membranes for material characterization, thermal transport, and gas interactions will be discussed and we conclude by outlining the challenges and opportunities in this upcoming field.",

However, as soon as material development reaches enough maturity for production to be scaled up and to enter the market within products, it is crucial to place the technology in the context of possible risks to economic well-being, social equity and environmental harm. This review aims at highlighting the current state of art on sustainable development of graphene-related materials and related environmental impact assessment studies using life cycle assessment (LCA). We show that sustainable development has focused mostly on the use of waste or low cost materials as precursors. However, the findings from relevant LCA studies reveals the limits of this approach, which does not take into account that waste recycling is often very energy intensive. We provide an overview on the life cycle environmental impact assessment, with a focus on global warming potential and energy demand, carried out on different graphene productions methods for specific applications, ranging from composites to electronics. Finally, an outlook is given focussing on the comparison of the different production routes and the results from the LCA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rechargeable batteries can effectively mitigate the increasing crisis associated with clean energy storage technologies. The alkali metal-ion based rechargeable batteries require a low diffusion barrier, a low average open-circuit voltage (OCV), and a high storage capacity for their superior performance. Using comprehensive first-principle calculations, we demonstrate that calcium carbide monolayer (Ca 2 C-ML) MXene meets all the aforementioned criteria and is a superior anode material for lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) metal-ion batteries. By first-principles calculations, the structural and electronic properties of Ca 2 C-ML and its extensive ion battery applications are studied. The adsorption properties of Li, Na, and K alkali ions on the Ca 2 C-ML sheet confirm excellent charge transfer and electrical conductivity. The ultra-low diffusion barriers of 0.027, 0.059, and 0.028 eV for Li, Na, and K alkali ions, respectively, indicate the superior mobility and fast cycling caliber (metal adsorption and desorption) of the Ca 2 C-ML. The OCV of the Ca 2 C-ML is 0.10, 0.24, and 0.28 V for Li, Na, and K-ions, respectively, ensuring a better battery performance. The specific capacity of 582 mAh g −1 is achieved for all three cases, which is much higher than that of a traditional graphite anode with Li, Na, and K ions. The volume expansion during the intercalation is negligible for all three cases, indicating long term structural integrity of the anode using Ca 2 C-ML. Our investigations suggest that the newly designed 2D Ca 2 C-ML is a suitable anode candidate for use in the next-generation of high-performance Li, Na, and K-ion batteries.",

To enable such applications, it is mandatory to reach a better understanding of the electronic and optical properties of h-BN and the impact of various structural defects. Despite the large efforts in the last years, aspects such as the electronic band gap value, the exciton binding energy and the effect of point defects remained elusive, particularly when considering a single monolayer. Here, we directly measured the density of states of a single monolayer of h-BN epitaxially grown on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, by performing low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS). The observed h-BN electronic band gap on defect-free regions is (6.8 ± 0.2) eV. Using optical spectroscopy to obtain the h-BN optical band gap, the exciton binding energy is determined as being of (0.7 ± 0.2) eV. In addition, the locally excited cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence show complex spectra that are typically associated to intragap states related to carbon defects. Moreover, in some regions of the monolayer h-BN we identify, using STM, point defects which have intragap electronic levels around 2.0 eV below the Fermi level.",

With this technique we can directly engineer MoS2 strain magnitude by changing deposited thin film stress, therefore allowing variable strain to be applied on a flake-to-flake level. These thin film stressors are analogous to SiNx based stressors implemented in industrial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes to enhance Si mobility, suggesting that our concept is highly scalable and may be applied for large-scale integration of strain engineered TMDC devices. We choose optically transparent stressors to allow us to probe MoS2 strain through Raman spectroscopy. Combining thickness dependent analyses of Raman peak shifts in MoS2 with atomistic simulations, we can explore layer-by-layer strain transfer. MoS2 on conventional substrates (SiO2, MgO) show strain transfer into the top two layers of multilayer flakes with limited strain transfer to monolayers due to substrate adhesion. To mitigate this limitation, we also explore stressors on van der Waals heterostructures constructed of monolayer (1L) MoS2 on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). This concept frees the 1L-MoS2 allowing for a 0.85% strain to be applied to the monolayer with a corresponding strain induced bandgap change of 75 meV. By using thin films with higher stress, strain may be engineered to be even higher. Various stressors and deposition methods are considered, showing a stressor material independent transfer of strain that only depends on stressor film force with negligible defects induced into MoS2 when thermal evaporation is used.",

However, the microscopic origin of multiferroic order in NiI 2 monolayer has not been established, and in particular, the role of non-collinear magnetism and spin–orbit coupling in this compound remains an open problem. Here we reveal the origin of the two-dimensional multiferroicity in NiI 2 using first-principles electronic structure methods. We show that the helimagnetic state appears as a consequence of the long-range magnetic exchange interactions, featuring sizable magnetic moments in the iodine atoms. We demonstrate that the electronic density reconstruction accounting for the ferroelectric order emerges from the interplay of non-collinear magnetism and spin–orbit coupling. We demonstrate that the ferroelectric order is controlled by the iodine spin–orbit coupling, and leads to an associated electronically-driven distortion in the lattice. Our results establish the microscopic origin of the multiferroic behavior in monolayer NiI 2 , putting forward the coexistence of helical magnetic order and ligand spin–orbit coupling as driving forces for multiferroic behavior in two-dimensional materials.",

An electric polarization arises associated with such a non-collinear magnetic state due to the spin–orbit coupling, leading to the emergence of a local ferroelectric order following the moiré.

Disentanglement of the altermagnetic and spin–orbit coupling induced spin splitting uncovers to which extent the altermagnetic properties are affected by the spin–orbit coupling.

Binary MeX 2 and MeXY (Me—transition element, X and Y–Cr, Br, I, where X ≠ Y) 2D structures in two structural polymorphic modifications, which are 1T-phase and 1H-phase, have been studied. The main structural stability criteria, such as heat formation energy, elasticity constants, and phonon spectra and the following ab initio molecular dynamics simulations have been used to determine the stability of studied compounds. It has been shown that 35 MeX 2 and 32 MeXY 2D structures comply with given stability criteria. Photocatalytic properties of these stable 2D MeX 2 and 2D MeXY have been investigated. Based on the calculated band gap size E g , work function Ф and electron affinity χ , it has been found that among all stable compounds 13 MeX 2 and 16 MeXY 2D structures are promising photocatalysts for water splitting. However, only 7 compounds have solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency overcome the 10% threshold, which is a critical parameter for solar hydrogen generation to be an economically viable resource. Among MeX 2 2D structures 1T-CdI 2 and 1H-VBr 2 possess a STH efficiency of 11.58% and 17.23%. In the case of 2D MeXY, STH efficiencies are 22.79% (1T-ZnClI), 15.20% (1T-CdClI), 22.13% (1T-ZnBrI), 12.11% (1T-CdBrI) and 19.76% (1H-VClBr). Moreover, as a result of this work, a comprehensive publicly available database, containing detailed calculation parameters and fundamental properties of the discovered 2D transition metal halides, has been created.",

Unfortunately, their development often requires special conditions and strict protocols, making it challenging to integrate them directly into devices. Some of the requirements include high temperatures, precursors, and special catalytic substrates with specific lattice parameters. Consequently, methods have been developed to transfer these materials from the growth substrates onto target substrates. These transfer techniques aim to minimize intermediate steps and minimize defects introduced into the 2D material during the process. This review focuses on the transfer techniques directly from the development substrates of 2D materials, which play a crucial role in their utilization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hydrogen-rich structures have recently gained attention as a candidate for room-temperature superconductors. Hydrogen has high phonon frequencies and can be an ideal component for superconductors if it also exhibits strong electron–phonon coupling. In bulk materials, this has been achieved only under very high pressure. Two-dimensional hydrogen-decorated materials can also be expected to become superconductors. Recently, it was shown that a Janus MoSH monolayer can be synthesized (Lu et al 2017 Nat. Nanotechnol. 12 744–9), and a theoretical investigation of this MoSH monolayer claimed that T c = 28.58 K at atmospheric pressure (Liu et al 2022 Phys. Rev. B 105 245420).

Historically, our understanding of 2D materials emanated from studies employing dielectric substrates or suspended samples. However, integrating metals in the exfoliation and growth processes of 2D materials has opened up new avenues, unveiling various shades of interactions ranging from dispersive forces to covalent bonding. The resulting modifications in 2D materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), offer more than a theoretical intrigue. They bear substantial implications for (opto)electronics, altering Schottky barrier heights and contact resistances in devices. We explore metal-mediated methods for TMDC exfoliation, elucidating the mechanisms and their impact on TMDC-metal interactions. Delving deeper, we scrutinize the fundamentals of these interactions, focusing primarily on MoS 2 and Au. Despite the recent surge of interest and extensive studies, critical gaps remain in our understanding of these intricate interfaces. We discuss controversies, such as the changes in Raman or photoemission signatures of MoS 2 on Au, and propose potential explanations. The interplay between charge redistribution, substrate-induced bond length variations, and interface charge transfer processes are examined. Finally, we address the intriguing prospect of TMDC phase transitions induced by strongly interacting substrates and their implications for contact design.",

    "abstract": "In this review we discuss the multifaceted problem of spin transport in hydrogenated graphene from a theoretical perspective. The current experimental findings suggest that hydrogenation can either increase or decrease spin lifetimes, which calls for clarification. We first discuss the spin–orbit coupling induced by local re-hybridization and C–H defect formation together with the formation of a local magnetic moment. First-principles calculations of hydrogenated graphene unravel the strong interplay of spin–orbit and exchange couplings. The concept of magnetic scattering resonances, recently introduced by Kochan et al (2014 Phys. Rev. Lett. 112 116602) is revisited by describing the local magnetism through the self-consistent Hubbard model in the mean field approximation in the dilute limit, while spin relaxation lengths and transport times are computed using an efficient real space order N wavepacket propagation method. Typical spin lifetimes on the order of 1 ns are obtained for 1 ppm of hydrogen impurities (corresponding to a transport time of about 50 ps), and the scaling of spin lifetimes with impurity density is described by the Elliott–Yafet mechanism. This reinforces the statement that local defect-induced magnetism can be at the origin of the substantial spin polarization loss in the clean graphene limit.",

The higher part, previously attributed exclusively to the A 2u (Γ) phonon, is mostly due to the LA and LA' phonons at M. For the monolayer MoS 2 the second-order phonon processes from the M and Γ Brillouin zone points are also analyzed and are discussed within similar framework to that of the bulk.",

Among all methods to synthesize 2D materials, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most attractive in the field of solid-state microelectronics because it can produce high quality 2D material in a scalable manner. However, the high temperatures (>900 °C) required during the CVD growth of the 2D materials impede their direct synthesis on metal-coated wafers due to prohibitive metal diffusion and de-wetting. This makes necessary carrying out the 2D materials CVD growth independently on metallic foils, and transfer them on the wafers using polymer scaffolds. However, this process is slower, more expensive, and can lead to abundant contamination and cracks in the 2D material. Here we present a facile method to allow the direct growth of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on Ni-coated Si wafers, which consists on placing a protective cover 30 μm above the Ni surface. The resulting h-BN stacks have been used to fabricate Au/Ti/h-BN/Ni memristors with low cycle-to-cycle variability.

This paper summarizes and extends the authors' work on the bifurcation of topologically protected edge states in continuous two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb structures. We consider a family of Schrödinger Hamiltonians consisting of a bulk honeycomb potential and a perturbing edge potential. The edge potential interpolates between two different periodic structures via a domain wall. We begin by reviewing our recent bifurcation theory of edge states for continuous 2D honeycomb structures (http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06111). The topologically protected edge state bifurcation is seeded by the zero-energy eigenstate of a one-dimensional Dirac operator. We contrast these protected bifurcations with (more common) non-protected bifurcations from spectral band edges, which are induced by bound states of an effective Schrödinger operator. Numerical simulations for honeycomb structures of varying contrasts and 'rational edges' (zigzag, armchair and others), support the following scenario: (a) for low contrast, under a sign condition on a distinguished Fourier coefficient of the bulk honeycomb potential, there exist topologically protected edge states localized transverse to zigzag edges. Otherwise, and for general edges, we expect long lived edge quasi-modes which slowly leak energy into the bulk. (b) For an arbitrary rational edge, there is a threshold in the medium-contrast (depending on the choice of edge) above which there exist topologically protected edge states. In the special case of the armchair edge, there are two families of protected edge states; for each parallel quasimomentum (the quantum number associated with translation invariance) there are edge states which propagate in opposite directions along the armchair edge.",

Early diagnosis of Lyme disease could prevent patients from developing serious side effects such as chronic arthritis and permanent neurological disorders. Lyme disease diagnosis is currently held back by a lack of reliable tools that are sufficiently sensitive and specific to allow early stage detection. Here, we demonstrate all electronic nano-biosensors for multiplexed detection of antigens of B. burgdorferi at concentrations as low as 2 pg ml−1. The sensors are based on graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) coupled with genetically engineered antibody fragments. Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies are used to obtain a closer proximity of the target-binding event to the graphene sensor surface and for higher immobilization density. When compared to GFET nano-biosensors that use the parental immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, scFv GFET nano-biosensors achieve approximately a 4000 × improvement to the limit of detection. We also demonstrate multiplexed detection of B. burgdorferi antigens through site-specific immobilization of scFvs on GFET arrays, which can potentially reduce the false-positive diagnosis ratio of Lyme disease.

Here we identify a charged carbon-hydrogen complex at a chalcogen site (CH X ) as a common, charged impurity in synthetically grown transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). This conclusion is drawn by comparing high resolution scanning probe microscopy measurements of nominally undoped and intentionally carbon doped TMD samples. While CH impurity densities in undoped CVD-grown WS 2 and MOCVD-grown WSe 2 can range anywhere from parts per million to parts per thousand, CH densities in the percentage levels were selectively generated by a post-synthetic methane plasma treatment. Our study indicates that methane plasma treatment is a selective and clean method for the controlled introduction of a charged carbon-hydrogen complex at a surface chalcogen site, a defect that is commonly present in synthetic TMDs.",

    "abstract": "The propensity of many 2D materials to oxidize in ambient conditions can complicate production and limit applications potential. Here we describe ambient liquid phase exfoliation of GeS, a layered material known for its chemical instability. Ambient exfoliation in organic solvents such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone yields good quality multi-layer GeS nanosheets. Although oxidation appears to occur with a time constant of ∼10 d, the data suggests it to be limited to nanosheet edges leaving the basal plane intact. The rate of oxidation is slow enough to allow processing of the dispersions. For example, it was possible to size-select GeS nanosheets and characterize the size-dependence of nanosheet optical properties, leading to the observation of significant changes in bandgap with nanosheet thickness. Additionally, we were able to fabricate the nanosheets into lithium ion battery anodes using carbon nanotubes as both binder and conductive additive. These electrodes were relatively stable, showing ∼0.2% capacity decay per cycle, and displayed low-rate capacity of 1523 mAh g−1 which is within 93% of the theoretical value. However, detailed analysis showed relatively poor rate performance, possibly due to nanosheet alignment.",

    "abstract": "Molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and tantalum disulphide (TaS2) are well-known members of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) family. They occur naturally in hexagonal (2H) forms but can also be synthesized in metallic trigonal (1T) phases that are active hydrogen evolution catalysts and exhibit interesting phenomena such as superconductivity and charge density waves. Sparse experimental evidence indicates that 2D crystals of metallic TMDs degrade rapidly in air via an unknown oxidation mechanism. Here we present a computational study on oxidation at the edges and surfaces of 1T-MoS2 and 1T-TaS2 monolayers based on density functional theory calculations. Our results suggest that both 1T-MoS2 and 1T-TaS2 are very susceptible to oxidation because there are negligible energetic barriers to the dissociation of oxygen molecules at edge sites. However, further oxidation requires the substitution of sulphur atoms by oxygen, the rate of which is limited in the case of 1T-TaS2 because the detachment of SO2 groups is disfavored by 1.2 eV. Conversely, oxygen molecules adsorbed on 1T-MoS2 dissociate directly at molybdenum atoms at the edge, forming intermediate S-O-Mo structures that facilitate the subsequent formation and detachment of SO2. Oxidation is not harmful to the catalysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction on 1T-MoS2 but is detrimental to that on 1T-TaS2, which explains some apparently inconsistent experimental results. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of ambient oxidative degradation of metallic TMDs and the effect of oxidation on their catalytic properties.",

    "abstract": "Non-volatile memory devices have been limited to flash architectures that are complex devices. Here, we present a unique photomemory effect in MoS$_2$ transistors. The photomemory is based on a photodoping effect - a controlled way of manipulating the density of free charges in monolayer MoS$_2$ using a combination of laser exposure and gate voltage application. The photodoping promotes changes on the conductance of MoS$_2$ leading to photomemory states with high memory on/off ratio. Such memory states are non-volatile with an expectation of retaining up to 50 % of the information for tens of years. Furthermore, we show that the photodoping is gate-tunable, enabling control of the recorded memory states. Finally, we propose a model to explain the photodoping, and we provide experimental evidence supporting such a phenomenon. In summary, our work includes the MoS$_2$ phototransistors in the non-volatile memory devices and expands the possibilities of memory application beyond conventional memory architectures.",

Yet the definitive detection of this intriguing behavior remains elusive. Until recently, experimental techniques for observing hydrodynamic behavior in solids were based on measuring macroscopic transport properties, such as the \"nonlocal\" (or \"vicinity\") resistance, which may allow alternative interpretation. Earlier this year two breakthrough experiments demonstrated two distinct imaging techniques making it possible to \"observe\" the electronic flow directly. We demonstrate that a hydrodynamic flow in a long Hall bar (in the absence of magnetic field) exhibits a nontrivial vortex structure accompanied by a sign-alternating nonlocal resistance. An experimental observation of such unique flow pattern could serve a definitive proof of electronic hydrodynamics.",

Because of their interesting electrical and optical properties, they are studied for applications in batteries, supercapacitors and electrocatalysis. However, MXenes are rarely used in heterogeneous catalysis and, to our knowledge, there are no reports on the use of oxidized MXenes in catalysis. Here we used Ti3C2Tx-derived materials as supports for platinum nanoparticles and studied their effectiveness for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane, which is a promising hydrogen carrier. Hydrogen can be released from ammonia borane through catalytic hydrolysis. Most heterogeneous catalysts reported for this purpose contain a noble metal supported on a metal oxide support. The interaction between the metal and the support is important in determining the catalytic performance. Our results show that the electronic environment of platinum can be modified by oxidising the surface of MXene, thus providing a new way of developing active catalysts. Oxidising agents such as water and ozone can be used for this purpose. This electronic modification enhances the catalytic activity of platinum for ammonia borane hydrolysis, which is relevant for other reactions related to energy production/storage.",

The combination of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides allows fabrication of electroluminescence (EL) devices, compatible with a wide range of substrates. Here, we demonstrate a full integration of an electroluminescent van der Waals heterostructure in a monolithic optical microcavity made of two high reflectivity dielectric distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). Owing to the presence of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride protecting the WSe2 during the top mirror deposition, we fully preserve the optoelectronic behaviour of the device. Two bright cavity modes appear in the EL spectrum featuring Q-factors of 250 and 580 respectively: the first is attributed directly to the monolayer area, while the second is ascribed to the portion of emission guided outside the WSe2 island. By embedding the EL device inside the microcavity structure, a significant modification of the directionality of the emitted light is achieved, with the peak intensity increasing by nearly two orders of magnitude at the angle of the maximum emission compared with the same EL device without the top DBR. Furthermore, the coupling of the WSe2 EL to the cavity mode with a dispersion allows a tuning of the peak emission wavelength exceeding 35 nm (80 meV) by varying the angle at which the EL is observed from the microcavity. This work provides a route for the development of compact vertical-cavity surface-emitting devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.",

However, whether and to which degree structural disorder occurs in the resulting samples is a crucial issue for prospective applications that remains to be explored. Here, we experimentally identify missing benzene rings at the edges, which we name \"bite\" defects, as the most abundant type of disorder in armchair nanoribbons synthesized by the bottom-up approach. First, we address their density and spatial distribution on the basis of scanning tunnelling microscopy and find that they exhibit a strong tendency to aggregate. Next, we explore their effect on the quantum charge transport from first-principles calculations, revealing that such imperfections substantially disrupt the conduction properties at the band edges. Finally, we generalize our theoretical findings to wider nanoribbons in a systematic manner, hence establishing practical guidelines to minimize the detrimental role of such defects on the charge transport. Overall, our work portrays a detailed picture of \"bite\" defects in bottom-up armchair graphene nanoribbons and assesses their effect on the performance of carbon-based nanoelectronic devices.",

For comparison, polycrystal samples of CrI3 with different grain sizes are also studied. We find that the powder-averaged spin wave spectrum of CrCl3 at T = 2 K can be adequately explained by the two dimensional spin Hamiltonian including in-plane Heisenberg exchanges only. The observed excitation does not exhibit noticeable broadening in energy, which is in remarkable contrast to the substantial broadening observed in CrI3.

    "abstract": "Abstract Shear-assisted liquid exfoliation is a primary candidate for producing defect-free two-dimensional (2D) materials. A range of approaches that delaminate nanosheets from layered precursors in solution have emerged in recent years. Diverse hydrodynamic conditions exist across these methods, and combined with low-throughput, high-cost characterization techniques, strongly contribute to the wide variability in performance and material quality. Nanosheet concentration and production rate are usually correlated against operating parameters unique to each production method, making it difficult to compare, optimize and predict scale-up performance. Here, we reveal the shear exfoliation mechanism from precursor to 2D material and extract the derived hydrodynamic parameters and scaling relationship that are key to nanomaterial output and common to all shear exfoliation processes. Our investigations use conditions created from two different hydrodynamic instabilities—Taylor vortices and interfacial waves—and combine materials characterization, fluid dynamics experiments and numerical simulations. Using graphene as the prototypical 2D material, we find that scaling of concentration of few-layer nanosheets depends on local strain rate distribution, relationship to the critical exfoliation criterion, and precursor residence time. We report a transmission-reflectance method to measure concentration profiles in real-time, using low-cost optoelectronics and without the need to remove the layered precursor material from the dispersion. We show that our high-throughput, in situ approach has broad uses by controlling the number of atomic layers on-the-fly, rapidly optimizing green solvent design to maximize yield, and viewing live production rates. Combining the findings on the hydrodynamics of exfoliation with this monitoring technique, we unlock targeted process intensification, quality control, batch traceability and individually customizable 2D materials on-demand.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Accessing the metastable phases in a controlled fashion can further expand the applications of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Although top-down approaches based on ion intercalation exfoliation have shown to be an effective route to transform 2H phase into 1T and/or 1T′ polytype phases, a bottom-up growth strategy could be more suitable for device integration. Herein, we show that by assisting the atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) growth with a specific alkali metal halide (AMH), it possible to induce the direct synthesis of 1T phase domains coexisting with 2H phase structure in micrometer-sized MoS 2 monolayer flakes. The photoluminescence emission and structural properties of three different AMH (NaCl, KBr and KCl) MoS 2 crystals are compared. Both NaCl and KBr assisted MoS 2 monolayers displayed the semiconducting 2H-phase. On the other hand, we demonstrate that KCl promotes the formation of a 1T–2H phase mixture. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and resonant Raman studies performed on KCl–MoS 2 monolayers show the emergence of a second chemical state and 1T Raman bands compared to the rest of the samples. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscope imaging revealed important changes in the atomic arrangement between 2H and 1T domains, providing clear evidence of the presence of the 1T metastable phase in the lattice. Moreover, the growth 1T domains can also be controlled by modifying the deposition temperature. Our experiments show that the introduction of KCl during the APCVD growth result in stable 1T-MoS 2 domains, providing a simple and reproducible route towards the polymorphism phase engineering of layered TMDs using a direct bottom-up approach.",

Here we performed the complete mapping of magnetic anisotropy for a prototypical Ising vdW magnet FePS 3 for the first time. Combining torque magnetometry measurements with their magnetostatic model analysis and the relativistic density functional total energy calculations, we successfully constructed the three-dimensional mappings of the magnetic anisotropy in terms of magnetic torque and energy. The results not only quantitatively confirm that the easy axis is perpendicular to the ab plane, but also reveal the anisotropies within the ab, ac , and bc planes. Our approach can be applied to the detailed quantitative study of magnetism in vdW materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Stress transfer has been investigated for exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanosheets (BNNSs) through the use of Raman spectroscopy. Single BNNSs of different thicknesses of up to 100 nm (300 layers) were deposited upon a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate and deformed in unixial tension. The Raman spectra from the BNNSs were relatively weak compared to graphene, but the in-plane E 2g Raman mode (the G band) could be distinguished from the spectrum of the PMMA substrate. It was found that G band down-shifted during tensile deformation and that the rate of band shift per unit strain decreased as the thickness of the BNNSs increased, as is found for multi-layer graphene. The efficiency of internal stress transfer between the different hBN layers was found to be of the order of 99% compared to 60%–80% for graphene, as a result of the stronger bonding between the hBN layers in the BNNSs. The reduction in bandshift rate can be related to the effective Young’s modulus of the 2D material in a nanocomposites and the findings show that it would be expected that even 100 layer BNNSs should have a Young’s modulus of more than half that of hBN monolayer. Interfacial stress transfer between a single hBN nanosheet and the PMMA substrate has been evaluated using shear lag theory. It is found that the interfacial shear stress between the BNNS and the substrate is of the order of 10 MPa, a factor of around 4 higher than that for a graphene monolayer. These findings imply that BNNSs should give better mechanical reinforcement than graphene in polymer-based nanocomposites as a result of good internal interlayer stress transfer within the nanosheets and better interfacial stress transfer to the polymer matrix.",

Nevertheless, the observation of intrinsic structures of semiconducting and insulating 2D materials with 60 kV-microscopes has remained problematic due to electron radiation damage. In recent years, ultralow-voltage microscopes have been developed with the prospects of minimizing radiation damage of such 2D materials, however, to date only ultralow-voltage TEM investigations of semiconducting and insulating 2D materials have been reported, but similar results using STEM, despite being more widely adopted, are still missing. Here we report a quantitative analysis of radiation damage and beam-induced defect dynamics in semiconducting 2D WS 2 during 30 kV and 60 kV-STEM imaging, particularly by recording atomic resolution electrostatic potential movies using integrated differential phase contrast to visualize both the light sulfur and heavy tungsten atoms. Our results demonstrate that electron radiation damage of 2D WS 2 aggravates by a factor of two when halving the electron beam energy from 60 keV to 30 keV, from which we conclude electronic excitation and ionization to be the dominant mechanism inducing defects and damage during low-voltage STEM imaging of semiconducting 2D materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a pressing need for reliable, reproducible and accurate measurements of graphene’s properties, through international standards, to facilitate industrial growth. However, trustworthy and verified standards require rigorous metrological studies, determining, quantifying and reducing the sources of measurement uncertainty. Towards this effort, we report the procedure and the results of an international interlaboratory comparison (ILC) study, conducted under Versailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards. This ILC focusses on the comparability of Raman spectroscopy measurements of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) grown graphene using the same measurement protocol across different institutes and laboratories. With data gathered from 17 participants across academia, industry (including instrument manufacturers) and national metrology institutes, this study investigates the measurement uncertainty contributions from both Raman spectroscopy measurements and data analysis procedures, as well as provides solutions for improved accuracy and precision. While many of the reported Raman metrics were relatively consistent, significant and meaningful outliers occurred due to differences in the instruments and data analysis. These variations resulted in inconsistent reports of peak intensity ratios, peak widths and the coverage of graphene. Due to a lack of relative intensity calibration, the relative difference reported in the 2D- and G peak intensity ratios ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>I</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>D</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>I</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>G</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) was up to 200%.

This study has shown that by adopting a relative intensity calibration and consistent peak fitting and data analysis methodologies, these large, and previously unquantified, variations can be significantly reduced, allowing more reproducible and comparable measurements for the graphene community, supporting fundamental research through to the growing graphene industry worldwide.

The synthesis of multiple MXenes, specifically solid-solution MXenes, allows fine tuning of their properties, expands their range of applications, and leads to enhanced performance. The functionality of solid-solution MXenes is closely related to the valence state of their constituents: transition metals, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. However, the impact of changes in the oxidation state of elements in MXenes is not well understood. In this work, three interrelated solid-solution MXene systems (Ti 2− y Nb y CT x , Nb 2− y V y CT x , and Ti 2− y V y CT x ) were investigated with scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy to determine the localized valence states of metals at the nanoscale. The analysis demonstrates changes in the electronic configuration of V upon modification of the overall composition and within individual MXene flakes. These shifts of oxidation state can explain the nonlinear optical and electronic features of solid-solution MXenes. Vanadium appears to be particularly sensitive to modification of the valence state, while titanium maintains the same oxidation state in Ti–Nb and Ti–V MXenes, regardless of stoichiometry. The study also explains Nb’s influential role in the previously observed electronic properties in the Nb–V and Nb–Ti systems.",

Here, we report vacancy-mediated substitution of aluminium into laser-cleaned graphene, and without removal from our ultra-high vacuum apparatus, study their dynamics under 60 keV electron irradiation using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy. Three- and four-coordinated Al sites are identified, showing excellent agreement with ab initio predictions including binding energies and electron energy loss spectrum simulations. We show that the direct exchange of carbon and aluminium atoms predicted earlier occurs under electron irradiation, although unexpectedly it is less probable than the same process for silicon.

    "abstract": "Abstract The anomalous Hall effect in time-reversal symmetry broken systems is underpinned by the concept of Berry curvature in band theory. However, recent experiments reveal that the nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can be observed in non-magnetic systems without applying an external magnetic field. The emergence of NHE under time-reversal symmetric conditions can be explained in terms of non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole (BCD) arising from inversion symmetry breaking. In this work, we availed realistic tight-binding models, first-principles calculations, and symmetry analyses to explore the combined effect of transverse electric field and strain, which leads to a giant BCD in the elemental buckled honeycomb lattices—silicene, germanene, and stanene. The external electric field breaks the inversion symmetry of these systems, while strain helps to attain an asymmetrical distribution of Berry curvature of a single valley. Furthermore, the topology of the electronic wavefunction switches from the band inverted quantum spin Hall state to normal insulating one at the gapless point. This band gap closing at the critical electric field strength is accompanied by an enhanced Berry curvature and concomitantly a giant BCD at the Fermi level. Our results predict the occurrence of an electrically switchable nonlinear electrical and thermal Hall effect in a new class of elemental systems that can be experimentally verified.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two-dimensional transition-metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) have been intensively investigated as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, due to their high capacitance, high-rate capability, and good cycle stability. Although MXenes possess various surface termination groups (e.g., –O, –OH, –F, –Cl, and –Br) that directly interact with adsorbed cations to exhibit charge transfer, the influence of each surface termination group on the electrochemical properties of MXene remains elusive because of difficulty in achieving exclusively modified termination. Herein, we report the electrochemical properties of MXenes with surface termination groups controlled by using fluorine-based aqueous solutions and molten salts as etchants. In aqueous electrolytes, Ti 3 C 2 Cl x and Ti 3 C 2 Br x synthesized using molten salts show no electrochemical activity in contrast to Ti 3 C 2 T x (T = O, OH, F, and Cl). Meanwhile, in a nonaqueous electrolyte, Ti 3 C 2 Cl x and Ti 3 C 2 Br x undergo amorphization upon the initial lithiation. These results suggest that the –O, –OH, and –F terminations play an important role in the electrochemical properties of MXene electrodes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two-dimensional Ferrovalley materials with intrinsic valley polarization are rare but highly promising for valley-based nonvolatile random access memory and valley filter devices. These ferromagnetic materials exhibit valleys at or near the Fermi level with intrinsic magnetism. The strong coupling between magnetism and spin–orbit coupling induces intrinsic valley polarization. Using Kinetically Limited Minimization, an unconstrained crystal structure prediction algorithm, and prototype sampling based on first-principles calculations, we have discovered new Ferrovalley materials, rare-earth iodides RI 2 , where R is a rare-earth element belonging to Sc, Y, or La-Lu, and I is Iodine. The rare-earth iodides are layered and demonstrate either 2H, 1T, or 1T d phase as the ground state in bulk, analogous to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The calculated exfoliation energy of monolayers (MLs) is comparable to that of graphene and TMDCs, suggesting possible experimental synthesis. The MLs in the 2H phase exhibit ferromagnetism due to unpaired electrons in d and f orbitals. Throughout the rare-earth series, d bands have valley polarization at K and <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mover> <mml:mi>K</mml:mi> <mml:mo accent=\"false\">‾</mml:mo> </mml:mover> </mml:math> points in the Brillouin zone in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Large intrinsic valley polarization in the range of 15–143 meV without external stimuli is observed in these Ferrovalley materials, which can be enhanced further by applying an in-plane bi-axial strain. These valleys can selectively be probed and manipulated for information storage and processing, potentially offering superior performance beyond conventional electronics and spintronics. We further show that the 2H ferromagnetic phase of RI 2 MLs possesses non-zero Berry curvature and exhibits anomalous valley Hall effect with considerable anomalous Hall conductivity. Our work will incite exploratory synthesis of the predicted Ferrovalley materials and their application in valleytronics and beyond.",

Therefore, creating low-resistance electrical contacts is one of the most critical challenges in the development of devices based on new materials, particularly in the case of two-dimensional semiconductors. Herein, we report a strategy to reduce the contact resistance of MoS 2 via local pressurization. We fabricated electrical contacts using an atomic force microscopy tip and applied variable pressure ranging from 0 to 25 GPa. By measuring the transverse electronic transport properties, we show that MoS 2 undergoes a reversible semiconducting-metallic transition under pressure. Planar devices in field effect configuration with electrical contacts performed at pressures above ∼15 GPa show up to 30-fold reduced contact resistance and up to 25-fold improved field-effect mobility when compared to those measured at low pressure. Theoretical simulations show that this enhanced performance is due to improved charge injection to the MoS 2 semiconductor channel through the metallic MoS 2 phase obtained by pressurization. Our results suggest a novel strategy for realizing improved contacts to MoS 2 devices by local pressurization and for exploring emergent phenomena under mechano-electric modulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Optical spectroscopy is indispensable for research and development in nanoscience and nanotechnology, microelectronics, energy, and advanced manufacturing. Advanced optical spectroscopy tools often require both specifically designed high-end instrumentation and intricate data analysis techniques. Beyond the common analytical tools, deep learning methods are well suited for interpreting high-dimensional and complicated spectroscopy data. They offer great opportunities to extract subtle and deep information about optical properties of materials with simpler optical setups, which would otherwise require sophisticated instrumentation. In this work, we propose a computational approach based on a conventional tabletop optical microscope and a deep learning model called ReflectoNet . Without any prior knowledge about the multilayer substrates, ReflectoNet can predict the complex refractive indices of thin films and 2D materials on top of these nontrivial substrates from experimentally measured optical reflectance spectra with high accuracies. This task was not feasible previously with traditional reflectometry or ellipsometry methods. Fundamental physical principles, such as the Kramers–Kronig relations, are spontaneously learned by the model without any further training. This approach enables in-operando optical characterization of functional materials and 2D materials within complex photonic structures or optoelectronic devices.",

In this study, we present a straightforward way of introducing multiple nanoscale interfaces into Ti 3 C 2 T x MXenes using insulating graphene oxide (GO) intercalants to enhance internal scattering, resulting in improved EMI shielding effectiveness (SE). The amine-functionalized MXene with positive surface charge and negatively charged GO flakes are electrostatically self-assembled to form a 2D/2D heterostack of MXene/GO nanosheets. The resultant 2D/2D alternating heterostack of MXene/GO bearing multiple internal interfaces with significant impedance mismatch enhances the internal scattering of incident electromagnetic (EM) waves. Interestingly, despite their inferior electrical conductivity, the MXene/GO heterostack films exhibit higher EMI SE values than the randomly mixed hybrid films, and even outperform pristine MXene films. These MXene/GO heterostack films with enhanced absorption of EM waves via the strong internal scattering effect suggest a valuable pathway toward practical EMI shielding with thin and lightweight features.",

While the prevalence of Ti3C2Tx MXene in biomedical research, and in particular bioelectronics, has steadily increased, the long-term stability and degradation of Ti3C2Tx MXene films have not yet been thoroughly investigated, limiting its use for chronic applications. Here, we investigate the stability of Ti3C2Tx films and electrodes under environmental conditions that are relevant to medical and bioelectronic technologies: storage in ambient atmosphere (shelf-life), submersion in saline (akin to the in vivo environment), and storage in a desiccator (low-humidity). Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of the MXene deposition method and thickness on the film stability in the different conditions, we compare thin (25 nm), and thick (1.0 μm) films and electrodes fabricated via spray-coating and blade-coating. Our findings indicate that film processing method and thickness play a significant role in determining the long-term performance of Ti3C2Tx films and electrodes, with highly aligned, thick films from blade coating remarkably retaining their conductivity, electrochemical impedance, and morphological integrity even after 30 days in saline. Our extensive spectroscopic analysis reveals that the degradation of Ti3C2Tx films in high-humidity environments is primarily driven by moisture intercalation, ingress, and film delamination, with evidence of only minimal to moderate oxidation.",

Here, we investigate this system and find the solution in a nanoscale effect. We reveal that the Au largely intercalates as nanoclusters. Our density functional theory calculations show that the graphene is periodically stapled to the Ni substrate, and this attraction presses graphene and Au nanoclusters together. This, in turn, causes a Rashba effect of the giant magnitude observed in experiment.

IPA was the solvent of choice due to its environmentally friendly nature and ease of use for further processing. For the first time, a hybrid of graphene and manganese oxide nanosheets was synthesized using a single-step co-exfoliation process. The two-dimensional (2D) hybrid was synthesized in IPA suspensions with concentrations of up to 0.5 mg ml−1 and demonstrated stability against re-aggregation for up to six months.

The in-plane lattice parameter shows a thermal contraction upto 1300 K and it expands thereafter. Frequency of the bending mode (ZA) becomes imaginary in the quasi-harmonic dispersion at higher temperatures, suggestive of a structural instability. However, the frequency of the ZA mode becomes real in the dispersion obtained from MD. Dynamical stability to the structure is restored by strong anharmonic coupling of phonon modes which is automatically incorporated in the MD simulations, whereas it is ignored in the quasi-harmonic dispersion. The mode resolved phonon spectra at Γ point show a blue-shift of degenerate longitudinal and transverse (LO/TO) optic modes. The blue-shift observed in canonical (NVT) and isobaric–isothermal (NPT) ensembles are more prominent than the shift predicted by quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) due to the additional contribution from phonon–phonon coupling. The out-of-plane optic (ZO) mode frequencies are red-shifted in the QHA due to membrane-effect, whereas MD simulations show that the strong phonon–phonon coupling dominates the membrane effect leading to a blue-shift. The linewidth of LO/TO and ZO modes increases non-monotonically with temperature. The anharmonic coupling of normal modes at high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Wrinkles exist universally in graphene-based structures, yet their controlled fabrication remains challenging; most graphene wrinkles have been produced either in attachment to elastic substrates or limited in small single sheets. Here, we utilize the phenomenon of gel-cracking to generate uniaxial strains locally on solution-precipitated graphene oxide (GO) sheets, thus creating suspended and aligned wrinkles over the trenches between cracked TiO2 islands. In particular, those GO wrinkles are subjected to a high pre-tension, which is important for making stable suspended configuration, as confirmed by theoretical calculations based on the wrinkle geometry and measured spring constants, respectively. As a result, in situ atomic force microscope indentation reveals elastic deformation with tunable spring constants depending on the gap width. We further obtain chemically reduced GO wrinkles with enhanced spring constants and reversible behavior after 1000 indentation cycles. Our suspended and aligned graphene wrinkles have potential applications in many areas such as sensors, actuators, and micro/nano electromechanical systems.",

    "abstract": "Monolayer epitaxial graphene (EG), grown on the Si face of SiC, is an advantageous material for a variety of electronic and optical applications. EG forms as a single crystal over millimeter-scale areas and consequently, the large scale single crystal can be utilized as a template for growth of other materials. In this work, we present the use of EG as a template to form millimeter-scale amorphous and hexagonal boron nitride (a-BN and h-BN) films. The a-BN is formed with pulsed laser deposition and the h-BN is grown with triethylboron (TEB) and NH3 precursors, making it the first metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process of this growth type performed on epitaxial graphene. A variety of optical and non-optical characterization methods are used to determine the optical absorption and dielectric functions of the EG, a-BN, and h-BN within the energy range of 1 eV to 8.5 eV. Furthermore, we report the first ellipsometric observation of high-energy resonant excitons in EG from the 4H polytype of SiC and an analysis on the interactions within the EG and h-BN heterostructure.",

    "abstract": "Manipulation of intrinsic electron degrees of freedom, such as charge and spin, gives rise to electronics and spintronics, respectively. Electrons in monolayer materials with a honeycomb lattice structure, such as the Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides (TMD's), can be distinguished according to the region (valley) of the Brillouin zone to which they belong. Valleytronics, the manipulation of this electron's property, is expected to set up a new era in the realm of electronic devices. In this work, we accurately determine the energy spectrum and lifetimes of exciton (electron–hole) bound-states for different TMD materials, namely WSe2, WS2 and MoS2. For all of them, we obtain a splitting of the order of 170 meV between the exciton energies from different valleys, corresponding to an effective Zeeman magnetic field of 1400 T. Our approach, which employs quantum-field theory (QFT) techniques based on the Bethe–Salpeter equation and the Schwinger–Dyson formalism, takes into account the full electromagnetic interaction among the electrons. The valley selection mechanism operates through the dynamical breakdown of the time-reversal (TR) symmetry, which originally interconnects the two valleys. This symmetry is spontaneously broken whenever the full electromagnetic interaction vertex is used to probe the response of the system to an external field.",

We investigate the ballistic current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of armchair silicene and stanene armchair nanoribbons (AXNRs with X = Si, Sn) using a combination of density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's functions. The impact of out-of-plane electric field and in-plane uniaxial strain on the ribbon geometries, electronic structure, and (I–V)s are considered and contrasted with graphene. Since silicene and stanene are sp2/sp3 buckled layers, the electronic structure can be tuned by an electric field that breaks the sublattice symmetry, an effect absent in graphene. This decreases the current by ∼50% for Sn, since it has the largest buckling. Uniaxial straining of the ballistic channel affects the AXNR electronic structure in multiple ways: it changes the bandgap and associated effective carrier mass, and creates a local buckling distortion at the lead-channel interface which induces a interface dipole. Due to the increasing sp3 hybridization character with increasing element mass, large reconstructions rectify the strained systems, an effect absent in sp2 bonded graphene. This results in a smaller strain effect on the current: a decrease of 20% for Sn at 15% tensile strain compared to a ∼75% decrease for C.",

The line defects tend to be merged at a point and a hole is formed subsequently at the point. Mo atoms tend to be clustered discretely as a nano sheet along the edge of the hole due to difference in displacement threshold energy between Mo and S atoms under electron irradiation. After Mo clusters are nearly separated from MoS2 sheet, the clusters are transformed into body-centered cubic nanocrystal of Mo during prolonged electron beam irradiation. The line defect mediated formation of hole and Mo cluster only occurs within a single grain of monolayer MoS2 sheet.",

On hydrogen-intercalated, quasi-freestanding graphene no unoccupied states are observed. We attribute this to the absence of occupied initial states for direct transitions into image-potential states at photon energies below the work function used in two-photon photoemission. The work function varies between 4.14 and 4.79 eV, but the vacuum level stays ∼4.5 eV above the Dirac point for all surfaces studied. This finding suggests that direct excitation of image-potential states cannot be achieved by doping and the electron dynamics for free-standing graphene is not accessible by two-photon photoemission using photon energies below the work function.",

Tuning interface charge transport between such new 2D materials and metallic electrodes is a key issue in 2D device physics and engineering. Here, we report tunable interface charge transport in bilayer MoSe2 field effect transistors with Ti/Au contacts showing high on/off ratio up to 107 at room temperature. Our experiments reveal a detailed map of transport mechanisms obtained by controlling the interface band bending profile via temperature, gate and source-drain bias voltages. This comprehensive investigation leads to demarcating regimes and tuning in transport mechanisms while controlling the interface barrier profile. The careful analysis allows us to identify thermally activated regime at low carrier density, and Schottky barrier driven mechanisms at higher carrier density demonstrating the transition from low-field direct tunneling/ thermionic emission to high-field Fowler–Nordheim tunneling. Furthermore, we show that the transition voltage Vtrans to Fowler–Nordheim correlates directly to the difference between the chemical potential of the metal electrode and the conduction band minimum in the 2D semiconductor, which opens up opportunities for new theoretical and experimental investigations. Our approach being generic can be extended to other 2D materials, and the possibility of tuning contact transport regimes is promising for designing MoSe2 device applications.",

This astonishing function has inspired scientists to replicate the color changing abilities of animals with artificial skin. Recently, some studies have focused on the smart materials and devices with reversible color changing or light-emitting properties for instantaneous strain visualization. However, most of these works only show eye-detectable appearance change when subjected to large mechanical deformation (100%–500% strain), and conspicuous color change at small strain remains rarely explored. In the present study, we developed a user-interactive electronic skin with human-readable optical output by assembling a highly sensitive resistive strain sensor with a stretchable organic electrochromic device (ECD) together. We explored the substrate effect on the electromechanical behavior of graphene and designed a strategy of modulus-gradient structure to employ graphene as both the highly sensitive strain sensing element and the insensitive stretchable electrode of the ECD layer. Subtle strain (0–10%) was enough to evoke an obvious color change, and the RGB value of the color quantified the magnitude of the applied strain. Such high sensitivity to smaller strains (0–10%) with color changing capability will potentially enhance the function of wearable devices, robots and prosthetics in the future.",

The latter is achieved by inserting a layer of aligned polar molecules between consecutive transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) sheets. As a consequence, collective electrostatic effects induce a shift of as much as 0.3 eV in the band edges of successive TMD layers.

The device structure includes nanoflakes of black phosphorus (BP) and MoS2. The current–voltage characteristics of the common–emitter and common–base configurations are examined. These p-BP/n-MoS2/p-BP bipolar transistors exhibit current–voltage characteristics similar to those of conventional p-n-p bipolar transistors. Devices with thin MoS2 layers show good saturation current–voltage characteristics, and a maximum common–emitter current gain (β = IC/IB) of approximately 10.1 is obtained at room temperature (300 K). Furthermore, the thickness dependence of the base region (n-MoS2) is investigated for the common–emitter output electrical characteristics (VCE − IC) of a double heterojunction bipolar transistor in which the emitter is grounded. The collector current decreases as the thickness of n-MoS2 is increased. This study can pave the way for the application of 2D materials as controllable amplifiers in flexible electronics.",

    "abstract": "Tailoring the properties of two-dimensional (2D) crystals is important for both understanding the material behavior and exploring new functionality. Here we demonstrate the alteration of MoS2 and metal-MoS2 interfaces using a convergent ion beam. Different beam energies, from 60 eV to 600 eV, are shown to have distinct effects on the optical and electrical properties of MoS2. Defects and deformations created across different layers were investigated, revealing an unanticipated improvement in the Raman peak intensity of multilayer MoS2 when exposed to a 60 eV Ar+ ion beam, and attenuation of the MoS2 Raman peaks with a 200 eV ion beam. Using cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), alteration of the crystal structure after a 600 eV ion beam bombardment was observed, including generated defects and voids in the crystal. We show that the 60 eV ion beam yields improvement in the metal-MoS2 interface by decreasing the contact resistance from 17.5 kΩ · µm to 6 kΩ · µm at a carrier concentration of n2D = 5.4 × 1012 cm−2. These results advance the use of low-energy ion beams to modify 2D materials and interfaces for tuning and improving performance in applications of sensors, transistors, optoelectronics, and so forth.",

    "abstract": "The intentional formation of defects in transition-metal dichalcogenides, such as MoS2, is an attractive way to modify the electronic and chemical properties of this class of 2D materials. However, the mechanisms and methods available for selective doping or modification of the basal plane must be improved. Here we investigate the process of O defect formation in epitaxial single-layer MoS2 on Au(1 1 1) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) during oxidation with O2 and H2O gas from low vacuum to the mbar range. Both oxidants result in exchange of S in the upper part of the basal plane with O, in line with air exposure experiments. Temperature-dependent measurements show that this is an activated process with an experimentally estimated reaction barrier of ∼0.79 ± 0.20 eV. We surprisingly find that the morphology of the MoS2 flakes and their edges remain intact in O2, even for relatively high degrees of basal plane O exchange, in contrast to the oxidation behavior of exfoliated single-layer MoS2. From analysis of atom-resolved STM images of the MoS2 edges, we can attribute this unusual stability to a passivating effect of excess edge sulfur species adsorbed under the sulfiding conditions of the MoS2 synthesis in H2S gas. We thus demonstrate that control over pre-sulfidation of the edges, temperature and pressure during oxidation can be used in a fast process to form strongly O doped single-layer MoS2 with no degradation of the initial shape and edge structure of the epitaxial MoS2 sheet.",

The optical properties of TMDs are dominated mostly by the tightly bound excitons and more complex quasiparticles, the biexcitons. Instead of physically exfoliated monolayers, the solvent-mediated chemical exfoliation of these 2D crystals is a cost-effective, large-scale production method suitable for real device applications. We explore the ultrafast excitonic processes in WS$_{2}$ dispersion using broadband femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy at room temperature. We detect the biexcitons experimentally and calculate their binding energies, in excellent agreement with earlier theoretical predictions. Using many-body physics, we show that the excitons act like Weiner-Mott excitons and explain the origin of excitons via first-principles calculations. Our detailed time-resolved investigation provides ultrafast radiative and non-radiative lifetimes of excitons and biexcitons in WS$_{2}$. Indeed, our results demonstrate the potential for excitonic quasiparticle-controlled TMDs-based devices operating at room temperature.",

A characteristic peculiarity of the investigated flake is that it contains a trilayer and bilayer part. The Bernal stacked bilayer was used as a strain sensor aiming to assess the efficiency of the load transfer from the polymer matrix through shear to the individual graphene layers. For the trilayer graphene in tension, both peaks are redshifted and splitting of the G peak is reported for the first time. In compression, the studied sample was an almost isolated trilayer, in which both peaks are blue-shifted up to a critical compressive strain. This critical strain is found to be one fourth of the value found in the case of single layer graphene despite the higher bending rigidity that trilayer exhibits over the much thinner monolayer.",

This has in turn made it a material of interest for many applications, ranging from fundamental physics studies to electronic devices. From a photonics perspective, graphene's ability to support surface plasmon-polaritons with extremely small mode volumes in the infrared spectral regime and beyond renders it an ideal platform for strongly enhanced light–matter interactions at deeply subwavelength size scales. Together with its large bandwidth of operation, as well as intrinsic chemical stability and affinity to organic molecules, graphene serves as a natural candidate for numerous optics-based sensing applications. This article reviews recent works that highlight the various advantages of graphene in an optical sensing context. Specifically, it focuses on how the passive functionalization of graphene can improve the performance of existing optical sensors, and how its use as an active signal transduction element could lead to various novel or hybrid devices that extend the functionalities of traditional sensors.",

    "abstract": "Silicene, a silicon-based homologue of graphene, arouses great interest in nano-electronic devices due to its outstanding electronic properties. However, its promising electronic applications are greatly hindered by lack of understanding in the mechanical strength of silicene. Therefore, in order to design mechanically reliable devices with silicene, it is necessary to thoroughly explore the mechanical properties of silicene. Due to current fabrication methods, graphene is commonly produced in a polycrystalline form; the same may hold for silicene. Here we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanical properties of polycrystalline silicene. First, an annealing process is employed to construct a more realistic modeling structure of polycrystalline silicene. Results indicate that a more stable structure is formed due to the breaking and reformation of bonds between atoms on the grain boundaries. Moreover, as the grain size decreases, the efficiency of the annealing process, which is quantified by the energy change, increases. Subsequently, biaxial tensile tests are performed on the annealed samples in order to explore the relation between grain size and mechanical properties, namely in-plane stiffness, fracture strength and fracture strain etc. Results indicate that as the grain size decreases, the fracture strain increases while the fracture strength shows an inverse trend. The decreasing fracture strength may be partly attributed to the weakening effect from the increasing area density of defects which acts as the reservoir of stress-concentrated sites on the grain boundary. The observed crack localization and propagation and fracture strength are well-explained by a defect-pileup model.",

This structural transition is accompanied by a topological transition in the reciprocal space and by pseudospin texturing. The stacking transition is driven by van der Waals interaction energy of the two graphene layers and is thermally activated by unpinning the microscopic chemical adsorbents which are then removed by the self-cleaning of graphene.",

The energy barriers for rotation and drift of a graphene flake over graphene is found to be smaller than 25 meV/atom which is comparable to thermal energy. We found that small flakes (of about ∼4 nm) are more sensitive to temperature and initial misorientation angles than larger one (beyond 10 nm). The initial stacking configuration of the flake is found to be important for its dynamics and time evolution of misalignment. Large flakes, which are initially in the AA- or AB-stacking state with small misorientation angle, rotate and end up in the AB-stacking configuration. However small flakes can they stay in an incommensurate state specially when the initial misorientation angle is larger than . Our results are in agreement with recent experiments.",

Furthermore, the detection mechanism and size-dependent sensitivity have been investigated by density functional theory (DFT) showing the change in electronic density of states of Mo atoms at edges which lead to the preferred adsorption of H2O2 on Mo edges.

The carrier mobility of the ISBN films exceeded at low temperature, much higher than that of pristine InSe films. It has been puzzling why the relatively inert hBN capping layer could so drastically enhance mobility of the ISBN composite. Using a state-of-the-art first principles method, we have calculated phonon limited carrier mobility of 18 different ISBN films and 6 pristine InSe films with different thicknesses, the largest system containing 2212 atoms. The hBN capping layer significantly alters the elastic stiffness coefficient as compared with pure InSe—thus the acoustic phonons in the ISBN composite—giving rise to the observed large mobility of ISBN films. Of the 18 calculated ISBN films, the ones with no strain at the hBN/InSe interface possess the highest electron mobility, reaching at room temperature, which could easily go over at low temperatures. We conclude that the mechanical properties of the composite 2D vdW ISBN material play the crucial role for inducing the large carrier mobility, a principle that could be applied to many other 2D vdW heterostructures.",

Although several systems based on organic and inorganic materials show high sensitivity to visible light, in general they suffer from slow response times. Here we show that phototransistors fabricated using multilayers of CuIn7Se11 exhibit response times of ~ tens of µs with responsivity (R) values > 10 AW−1 and with external quantum efficiencies reaching beyond 103 % when excited with a 658 nm wavelength laser. These devices also show high specific detectivity (D*) values of ~1012 Jones. The responsivity and detectivity exhibited by these phototransistors are at least an order of magnitude better than commercially available conventional Si-based photodetectors, coupled with response times that are orders of magnitude better than several other families of layered materials investigated so far. The properties of the CuIn7Se11 phototransistor can be further tuned and enhanced by applying a back-gate voltage. Our investigations indicate that such layered ternary compounds can potentially be used as components in opto-electronics-related applications.",

    "abstract": "To understand the optical and transport properties of graphene nanoribbons, an unambiguous determination of their electronic band structure is needed. In this work we demonstrate that the photoemission intensity of each valence sub-band, formed due to the quantum confinement in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) graphene nanoribbons, is a peaked function of the two-dimensional (2D) momentum. We resolve the long-standing discrepancy regarding the valence band effective mass () of armchair graphene nanoribbons with a width of N = 7 carbon atoms (7-AGNRs). In particular, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy report ≈0.2 and ≈0.4 of the free electron mass (me), respectively. ARPES mapping in the full 2D momentum space identifies the experimental conditions for obtaining a large intensity for each of the three highest valence 1D sub-bands. Our detail map reveals that previous ARPES experiments have incorrectly assigned the second sub-band as the frontier one. The correct frontier valence sub-band for 7-AGNRs is only visible in a narrow range of emission angles. For this band we obtain an ARPES derived effective mass of 0.4 me, a charge carrier velocity in the linear part of the band of 0.63 × 106 m s−1 and an energy separation of only ≈60 meV to the second sub-band. Our results are of importance not only for the growing research field of graphene nanoribbons but also for the community, which studies quantum confined systems.",

Nanoscale maps of the topography, surface potential, Raman spectra, and the photocurrent amplitude of the WSe2/metal interfaces reveal striking results. Specifically, correlations between surface potential, resonant Raman signatures and photocurrents that indicate the presence of inhomogeneities within interfacial electronic properties, which we attribute to variations in the local doping of the WSe2 likely caused by intrinsic compositional fluctuations or defects. Our results suggest that local electrostatic variations at a lateral scale of 10–100 nm are present even in the highest quality of TMDC crystals and must be considered towards understanding of all interfacial phenomena, particularly in device applications that rely on the buried metal–semiconductor junction interface.",

    "abstract": "The two-dimensional (2D) materials are naturally suitable for various flexible 2D optoelectronic devices, in which the direct band gap perseverance is crucial because the flexibility deformations often cause a bandgap transition and thus break performance of the devices. Most of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) materials such as monolayer MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2 have been thought to be not suitable for flexible optoelectronic devices due to their direct-to-indirect bandgap transition even under a small strain (~1%–2%) for any flexibility deformations. So far, only 2D phosphorene has been theoretically predicted to be able to keep direct bandgap property under a large strain. Here we report a 2D material lead iodide (PbI2) mutilayer with a direct band gap and find by photoluminescence (PL) measurements that it maintains a direct bandgap nature under a large experimental strain up to 7.69%. Theoretical simulations support and explain well our experimental results.",

Motivated by recent experimental progress, we consider several scenarios, including different spin–orbit splittings in the two dots and including the case when the valley degeneracy is lifted due to an insulating ferromagnetic substrate. Finally, we discuss in which cases it is possible to reduce the low energy subspace to the lowest Kramers pairs. We find that in this case the low energy model is formally identical to the Heisenberg exchange Hamiltonian, indicating that such Kramers pairs may serve as qubit implementations.",

Here, we report the high-throughput synthesis of uniform single-layer highly crystalline graphene on a batch of 3-inch wafers. The production throughput is optimized by using closely-packed vertically-standing wafers instead of placing them flat on a horizontal support. Significantly reducing convective gas transport is found to be essential to minimize the variation of graphene single crystal seeding density and growth rate across individual wafers. Given the very small amount of carbon required to grow an atomically-thin layer, we show that graphene can be grown under static gas flow conditions and that the growth rate does not significantly vary from one wafer to another, even within a large batch (∼25 wafers). These findings constitute an important technological step toward the manufacturing of graphene on an industrial scale and its integration into mainstream electronics or micro-electromechanical devices.",

The exciton-cavity coupling is found to be in the weak regime, resulting in ~15-fold increase in the photoluminescence intensity for interlayer exciton in resonance with the cavity.

Here, we present physisorbed-precursor-assisted atomic layer deposition (pALD) as an extremely robust method for fabricating such films. Using atomic-scale characterisation, it is confirmed that conformal and intact ultrathin Al2O3 films can be synthesised on graphene by pALD. The mechanism underlying the pALD process is identified through first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. Further, this novel deposition technique is used to fabricate two types of wafer-scale devices. It is found that the incorporation of a 5 nm-thick pALD Al2O3 gate dielectric film improves the performance of metal-oxide-graphene field-effect transistors to a greater extent than does the incorporation of a conventional ALD Al2O3 film. We also employ a 5 nm-thick pALD HfO2 film as a highly scalable dielectric layer with a capacitance equivalent oxide thickness of 1 nm in graphene-based tunnelling field-effect transistors fabricated on a glass wafer and achieve a subthreshold swing of 30 mV/dec. This significant improvement in switching allows for the low-voltage operation of an inverter within 0.5 V of both the drain and the gate voltages, thus paving the way for low-power electronics.",

This is the first time that tin sulfide based material is fabricated as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors. The first combination of tin sulfide and polyaniline also evokes synergistic effect to enhance the performance as the polyaniline nanofibers facilitate the growth of tin sulfide flakes in nanosize which is further proved helpful for improving the capacity and stability of the electrode. The as-obtained electrode of tin sulfide nanoflake arrays incorporated on polyaniline nanofibers (365 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1) exhibits superior electrochemical performance compared with micro-scaled tin sulfide (32 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1). The significantly improved pseudocapacitive and diffusive contributions of polyaniline nanofibers incorporated electrode are identified by quantitative kinetics analysis due to greatly decreased particle size and introduced mesopores, nanoclusters, and exposed edges. Profited from effective nanostructure engineering, a Na+ intercalation mechanism is also pointed out in boosting the electrochemical performance.",

    "abstract": "The performance of electronic and spintronic devices based on two-dimensional semiconductors (2D SC) is largely dependent on the quality and resistance of the metal/SC electrical contacts, as well as preservation of the intrinsic properties of the SC channel. Direct metal/SC interaction results in highly resistive contacts due to formation of large Schottky barriers and considerably affects the properties of the 2D SC. In this work, we address these two important issues in monolayer field-effect transistors (FETs). We encapsulate the channel with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), using bilayer h-BN at the metal/SC interface. The bilayer h-BN eliminates the metal/ chemical interactions, preserves the electrical properties of and reduces the contact resistances by prevention of Fermi-level pinning. We investigate electrical transport in the monolayer FETs that yields close to intrinsic electron mobilities (≈ 26 cm2 V−1 s−1) even at room temperature. Moreover, we experimentally study the charge transport through metal/h-BN/ tunnel contacts and we explicitly show that the dielectric bilayer of h-BN provides highly efficient gating (tuning the Fermi energy) of the channel at the contact regions even with small biases. Also we provide a theoretical model that allows to understand and reproduce the experimental I– characteristics of the contacts. These observations give an insight into the electrical behavior of the metal/h-BN/2D SC heterostructure and introduce bilayer h-BN as a suitable choice for high quality tunneling contacts that allows for low energy charge and spin transport.",

EBI at 1 kV energy for 1 min transformed the as-deposited amorphous structure of WS2 film into a two-dimensional (2D) layered crystalline structure with high uniformity over a 50.8 mm diameter wafer. Additionally, EBI enhanced the photoelectrical properties of WS2-based photodetectors. The as-deposited WS2 film yielded a responsivity of 0.10 mA · W−1 under 450 nm laser irradiation, but showed no response under 532 and 635 nm laser wavelengths. However, after 1 kV and 3 kV EBI of the WS2 films, the responsivities under laser irradiation at 450, 532, and 635 nm were 0.36, 1.37, and 0.19 mA · W−1, and 1.68, 2.45, and 1.09 mA · W−1, respectively. The substrate temperatures after 1 min of 1 kV and 3 kV EBI were 102 °C and 591 °C, respectively. The WS2-based photodetectors exhibited high responsivity in the visible light region despite their unique process conditions of low temperature and fast EBI treatment. Such desirable performance of the EBI-treated WS2 films shows significant potential for future large-area and low-temperature photoelectronic applications.

Firstly, when the precursor concentrations for 3D rGO were changed from low to high concentrations, sample rGO-4 with medium GO concentration showed a dual pore size distribution with higher numbers of mesopores as well as the less stacking of the rGO sheets, demonstrated better electrosorption specific capacitance of 236 F g−1 than the low and high GO concentrations.

Herein, a promising anode material for both half/full cells is well prepared by constructing bi-continuous porous structure in Fe2O3 nanosheets (bp-Fe2O3) through a target construction method. Notably, the obtained bp-Fe2O3 exhibits a unique wrinkled layer structure composed by ultrasmall Fe2O3 nanoparticles, which can well shorten the charge diffusion pathway. Furthermore, the wrinkled layer structure and the presence of pores in the bp-Fe2O3 sample are able to accommodate the volume variation during deep lithiation–delithiation processes, and enable electrolyte easy penetration to the whole electrode, thus significantly improving the electrochemical performance. Benefiting from the favorable electrode framing together with fast lithiation dynamics, the prepared bp-Fe2O3 exhibits considerably better electrochemical performance in half/full cells for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), as well as superior low temperature (low-T) performance. In detail, when cycled at 1.5 A g−1, 2D bp-Fe2O3 electrode displays a reversible capacity up to 818.7 mAh g−1 for 350 cycles.

    "abstract": "The growth of WSe(2−x)Tex alloys by molecular beam epitaxy has been demonstrated for the first time to investigate the phase transition from the semiconducting 2H phase to the semi-metallic 1T' phase as a function of Te concentration. Up to 14% Te incorporation, stable alloys in the semiconducting 2H phase are achieved while above 79% Te incorporation, stable alloys in the semi-metallic 1T' phase are obtained. Our results indicate the MBE-grown WSe(2−x)Tex alloys exhibit a miscibility gap from 14% to 79% Te concentrations at a growth temperature of 250 °C, a temperature compatible with direct vertical back-end-of-line integration. This miscibility gap results in phase separation of two different alloys, both with different composition and crystal structure. While the alloying of small Te concentrations does indeed result in a desired reduction of the semiconducting bandgap, the phase separation above 14% Te incorporation prohibits bandgap tuning for a wider range of applications. These results highlight the competing energies and kinetics associated with producing uniform WSe(2−x)Tex alloys.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable mechanical robustness and excellent electrical/thermal properties make graphene a promising candidate for future flexible, stretchable and bio-integrated electronics. In practice, many soft electronics such as the graphene electronic tattoos (GETs) demand the chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene to be supported by a deformable substrate. Moreover, various conductive overlayers need to directly laminate on graphene to make electrical contacts. To investigate the mechanical reliability of CVD graphene in these situations, we fabricated CVD monolayer graphene supported by ultrathin poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate and also placed gold/polyethylene terephthalate (Au/PET) and graphene/PMMA (Gr/PMMA) overlayers on graphene. The stretchability of the Gr/PMMA and the overlayer-Gr/PMMA interface was characterized by electrical resistance change during uniaxial tensile tests. Combined with in situ microstructure and Raman investigation, we identified four deformation/fracture stages of Gr/PMMA—pre-cracking elastic deformation, limited micro-cracking in graphene, extensive cracking in graphene, and macro-cracking in PMMA. While micro-cracks emerged in graphene at very small strain (~0.9%), the electrical conductivity of the Gr/PMMA specimen remained up to tensile strains of ~14.5%. In contrast, 100 nm-thick Au film supported by the same PMMA substrate fully ruptured after tensile strains of ~1%. When laminating Au/PET and Gr/PMMA over Gr/PMMA, we found that the Au/PET- Gr/PMMA interface is very vulnerable but the Gr/PMMA- Gr/PMMA interface behaves very similar to intact Gr/PMMA electromechanically. The cyclic behaviour of Gr/PMMA, the effects of PMMA thickness and adhesion are also briefly discussed. The present experimental study provides fundamental insight into the failure of ultrathin polymer-supported graphene and its electrical contacts, which is critical for designing future graphene-based soft electronics.",

In this work, one-dimensional graphene-based fibers with aligned morphology are fabricated by direct ink extrusion, in which graphene and poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) can be integrated into a conductive network. The graphene-based fibers can respond to multiple deformations such as bending, twisting, compressing, and stretching. The various response amplitude with a reversible electrical resistance change can be obtained from multiple strain cycles, which exhibits high sensitivity and broad range in strain sensing. The ultra-sensitive electromechanical property with a gauge factor of 65 under 6% strain is attributed to the interwoven graphene network and could be cycled 600 times of continuous stretching−releasing process with less than 6.2% attenuation in the response signal. The intrinsic dynamic fracture procedure and mechanism of graphene-based fibers are investigated as a result of the gradual growth of locally generated cracks. The controllable fabrication of graphene-based fibers with high sensitivity shows great potential applications in stretchable wearable sensors for real-time monitoring and distinguishing of human motion and gestures.",

The re-stacking of exfoliated MoS 2 creates nanocapillaries between the layers of MoS 2 nanosheets. These MoS 2 membranes have been shown to possess a unique combination of ionic rejection properties, high water permeation rates, and long-term solvent stability, with no significant swelling when exposed to aqueous or organic solvents. Chemical modification of MoS 2 membranes has been shown to improve their ionic rejection properties, however the mechanism behind this improvement is not well understood. In this work, we elucidate the ion-sieving mechanism by the study of potential-dependent ion transport through functionalized MoS 2 membranes. The ionic permeability of the MoS 2 membrane is transformed by chemical functionalization with a simple naphthalene sulfonate dye (sunset yellow) and with a resultant attenuation of permeability by at least an order of magnitude, compared to the pristine MoS 2 membranes and permeability reported for graphene oxide and Ti 3 C 2 T x (MXene) membranes. The effects of pH, solute concentration, and ionic size/charge on the ionic selectivity of the functionalized MoS 2 membranes are also reported. Understanding the mechanism of ionic sieving within functionalized MoS 2 membranes will enable future applications in electro-dialysis and ion exchange for water treatment technologies.",

Herein, we report a graphene oxide-based multiplexed detection strategy to make the differential diagnosis of Zika and dengue viruses by targeting virus nucleic acid. The fluorometric detection strategy is integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay to further increase sensitivity. In the presence of target virus, fluorescent PNA probes recognize the single-stranded loops of the cauliflower-like-shaped virus amplicon in a sequence-specific manner. Meanwhile, graphene oxide functions to distinguish the valid fluorescence signal as a selective fluorescence quencher for single-stranded PNA probes. The present strategy allows multiplexed detection of closely related viruses for specific discrimination of the virus nucleic acids with simplified molecular diagnostic steps, without requiring any nucleic acid isolation step.",

However, substantial issues with yield during any device fabrication process have severely limited its use to date. We report the successful fabrication of a fully operational prototype of a miniature 9 mm 2 suspended graphene array sensor chip, incorporating 64 graphene sensor devices, each comprising of 180 SUS-G membranes with ever reported 56% fully intact graphene membranes for sensitive and selective gas sensing applications. While a bare sensor chip can operate as a sensitive gas sensor for a variety of gasses such as ammonia, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, down to ppm/ppb concentrations, a tetrafluorohydroquinone functionalized sensor acquires specificity to formaldehyde gas molecules with limited cross-sensitivity for ethanol, toluene and humidity. Unlike an equivalent device with fully supported functionalized graphene sensor, a functionalized SUS-G sensor can be furthermore reset to its baseline by using UV assisted desorption instead of substrate heating. The low power UV irradiation does not show severe damage to the SUS-G structures and loss of functional probes for the formaldehyde gas—a previously unreported feature. A resettable and selective formaldehyde gas sensor array with mass manufacturability, low power consumption and overall dimensions down to 1 mm 2 , would represent a significant technological step forward in the development of an electronic nose, for the simultaneous detection of multiple-target gases, with potential for integration in portable electronic devices and the internet of things.",

Different photo-excited electron-hole states are resolved based on their distinct responses to THz photon and decay lifetimes. The observed transient THz transmission can be fitted with two decay components: a fast component with a decay lifetime of 20 ps, which is attributed to the exciton lifetime, including its formation and subsequent intra-exciton relaxation; a slow component with an extremely long decay lifetime of several ns, possibly due to a long-lived dark exciton state. The relaxation dynamics are further supported by temperature and pump-fluence-dependent studies of the decay time constants. The sign of the transient THz observed in this experiment is the opposite of that measured in a recent parallel transient THz work on MoS2 [1]. The observed decay dynamics are also different, and the possible reasons for these discrepancies are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Ternary two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide compounds exhibit a tunable electronic structure allowing for control of the interlayer and the intralayer atomic displacement to efficiently tune their physical and electronic properties. Using a diamond anvil cell, hydrostatic pressure was applied to Mo0.5W0.5S2 up to 40 GPa in order to study the optical phonon vibrational modes. Analysis of the high-pressure Raman spectra shows that the two in-plane E2g modes resembling that of pristine MoS2 and WS2, as well as disorder-activated longitudinal acoustic phonon mode, are hardened and suppressed as pressure increases. The two A1g modes of the ternary compound that resemble the A1g modes of pristine MoS2 and WS2, displayed similar Raman shifts to the pristine compounds as pressure increases. A Raman peak at 470 cm−1 that is close to A1g peaks emerges at ∼8 GPa, which represents a disorder-activated pressure-induced out-of-plane Raman mode observed only in the ternary compound under high pressure. At pressures above ∼30 GPa, a Raman peak at approximately 340 cm−1 is observed, signifying additional disorder-activated vibration mode. Our results reveal the enhanced interactions in the structural and vibrational behavior of the MoS2 and WS2 domains in the Mo0.5W0.5S2 compound under hydrostatic pressure. These results could have implications in understanding the electronic, optical, and structural properties of the new 2D ternary compound materials under extreme mechanical conditions.",

    "abstract": "We report heat transport measurements on suspended single-layer graphene disks with radius of 150–1600 nm using a high-vacuum scanning thermal microscope. The results of this study revealed a radius-dependent thermal contact resistance between tip and graphene, with values between 1.15 and 1.52 × 108 KW−1. The observed scaling of thermal resistance with radius is interpreted in terms of ballistic phonon transport in suspended graphene discs with radius smaller than 775 nm. In larger suspended graphene discs (radius >775 nm), the thermal resistance increases with radius, which is attributed to in-plane heat transport being limited by phonon–phonon resistive scattering processes, which resulted in a transition from ballistic to diffusive thermal transport. In addition, by simultaneously mapping topography and steady-state heat flux signals between a self-heated scanning probe sensor and graphene with 17 nm thermal spatial resolution, we demonstrated that the surface quality of the suspended graphene and its connectivity with the Si/SiO2 substrate play a determining role in thermal transport. Our approach allows the investigation of heat transport in suspended graphene at sub-micrometre length scales and overcomes major limitations of conventional experimental methods usually caused by extrinsic thermal contact resistances, assumptions on the value of the graphene's optical absorbance and limited thermal spatial resolution.",

In this paper, we propose a fast and green microwave-assisted method to synthetize manganese-nitrogen co-doped rGO, characterized by catalytic activity comparable to Pt-containing materials and improved long-term stability. Theoretical calculations and experimental results showed that our synthetic method produces N-rGO matrices which coordinate Mn2+ ions in porphyrin-like structures. These Mn/N-rGO complexes are responsible for the outstanding performance of the proposed catalyst, being able to weaken O–O molecular bond, thus effectively reducing the activation energy towards oxygen catalytic reaction.

Here, we report a photoconductivity study from FETs built from few-layers of p-WSe2 measured in a multi-terminal configuration under illumination by a 532 nm laser source. The photogenerated current was measured as a function of the incident optical power, of the drain-to-source bias and of the gate voltage. We observe a considerably larger photoconductivity when the phototransistors were measured via a four-terminal configuration when compared to a two-terminal one. For an incident laser power of 248 nW, we extract 18 A W−1 and ∼4000% for the two-terminal responsivity (R) and the concomitant external quantum efficiency (EQE) respectively, when a bias voltage Vds = 1 V and a gate voltage Vbg = 10 V are applied to the sample. R and EQE are observed to increase by 370% to ∼85 A W−1 and ∼20 000% respectively, when using a four-terminal configuration.

The efficacy of atomistic simulations in obtaining a molecular-level insight into aggregation and exfoliation of graphene/graphene oxide (GO) is hindered by length and time scale limitations. In this work, we developed coarse-grained (CG) models of graphene/GO sheets, compatible with the polarizable Martini water model, using molecular dynamics, iterative Boltzmann inversion and umbrella sampling simulations. The new CG models accurately reproduce graphene/GO–water radial distribution functions and sheet–sheet aggregation free energies for small graphene (−316 kJ mol −1 ) and GO (−108 kJ mol −1 ) reference sheets. Deprotonation of carboxylic acid functionalities stabilize the exfoliated state by electrostatic repulsion, providing they are present at sufficiently high surface concentration. The simulations also highlight the pivotal role played by entropy in controlling the propensity for aggregation or exfoliation. The CG models improve the computational efficiency of simulations by an order of magnitude and the framework presented is transferrable to sheets of different sizes and oxygen contents. They can now be used to provide fundamental physical insights into the stability of dispersions and controlled self-assembly, underpinning the computational design of graphene-containing nanomaterials.",

By freezing the out-of-plane atomic motion in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) superlattices and random multilayers, i.e aperiodic superlattices, we are able to completely isolate the effect of the third dimension on phonon scattering and localization in 2D materials. In particular, we find much more prominent phonon heat conduction and localization when atomic motions in the third dimension are frozen. Rigorous spectral phonon transmission and scattering phase space analyses reveal that the phase-breaking anharmonic scatterings can significantly hinder the occurrence of phonon localization. Phonon participation ratio calculations further reveal that the flexural modes—arising from the degree of freedom of the third dimension—are rather extended, in contrast to the vastly localized in-plane modes in graphene/hBN random multilayers. These two factors altogether greatly obstruct the observation of coherent phonon localization in realistic materials. This work will be useful for guiding the search for nanostructures possessing significant phonon localization behaviors.",

MoS 2 field effect transistors fabricated from this scratching lithography show excellent performances, evidenced from a room-temperature on–off ratio exceeding 10 10 and a high field-effect mobility of 50.7 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , due to the cleanness of as-fabricated devices.

Metallic 1 T-TiTe 2 is a remarkable exception as it shows no evidence of charge density wave formation in bulk, but it displays a stable 2 × 2 reconstruction in single-layer form. The mechanism for this 3D-2D crossover of the transition is still unclear, although strain from the substrate and the exchange interaction have been pointed out as possible formation mechanisms. Here, by performing non-perturbative anharmonic calculations with gradient corrected and hybrid functionals, we explain the thickness behaviour of the transition in 1 T-TiTe. We demonstrate that the CDW in single-layer TiTe 2 occurs from the interplay of non-perturbative anharmonicity and an exchange enhancement of the electron-phonon interaction, larger in the single layer than in the bulk. Finally, we study the electronic and structural properties of the single-layer CDW phase and provide a complete description of its electronic structure, phonon dispersion as well as infrared and Raman active phonon modes.",

The hBN monolayers are observed to grow predominantly from step edges on the graphite surface and exhibit a strong dependence of the morphology, including the dominant crystallographic edge, of the hBN monolayers, on the growth temperature, as well as systematic variations in growth rate and coverage, and significant differences in the growth at monolayer and multilayer graphite steps. At graphite monolayer steps hBN grows laterally across the surface on the lower terrace, but hBN growth on the upper side of the graphite step is more limited and is nucleated by three-dimensional clusters. Multilayer graphite steps exhibit a much higher density of non-planar hBN aggregates and growth on both the upper and lower terraces occurs. The results show that the hBN monolayer growth edge type, hBN island shape and the presence of hBN aggregates can be controlled in HT-MBE, with the highest quality layers grown at a substrate temperature of about 1390 °C. Sequential HT-MBE growth of hBN, graphene (G) and a second cycle of hBN growth results in the formation of monolayer thick lateral hBN–G–hBN heterostructures, in which a strip of G is embedded between monolayers of hBN.",

However, during a typical (S)TEM experiment, the sample is subject to a number of effects that can change its atomic structure. Of these, perhaps the least discussed are chemical modifications due to the non-ideal vacuum around the sample. With single-layer graphene, we show that even at relatively low pressures typical for many instruments, these processes can have a significant impact on the sample structure. For example, pore growth becomes up to two orders of magnitude faster at a pressure of ca. 10 −6 mbar as compared to ultra-high vacuum (UHV; 10 −10 mbar). Even more remarkably, the presence of oxygen at the sample also changes the observed atomic structure: When imaged in UHV, nearly 90% of the identifiable graphene edge configurations have the armchair structure, whereas armchair and zigzag structures are nearly equally likely to occur when the oxygen partial pressure in the column is higher. Our results both bring attention to the role of the often neglected vacuum composition of the microscope column, and show that control over it can allow atomic-scale tailoring of the specimen structure.",

Herein, we use a recently literature reported novel biphenylene sheet (BP sheet) for investigating superconductivity-related physical properties. The electronic states of BP sheet that appeared near the Fermi level are composed of p z orbital of carbon due to sp 2 hybridization. Also, an anisotropic Dirac cone is formed just above the Fermi level by crossing two bands comprised of different carbon atoms. One of the two bands is quasi-flat thus leading to a peak of electronic density of states above the Fermi level. In addition, the rotational-vibration phonon mode of the six-membered carbon ring is strongly coupled with electrons. The electron-phonon coupling induces the superconductivity of 6.2 K in BP sheet. Furthermore, both small uniaxial strains and electronic doping can take the Dirac cone and high electronic density of state close to the Fermi level and further raise the superconducting critical temperature to 27.4 K and 21.5 K, respectively. The obtained result suggests that BP sheet with Dirac fermions and superconductivity can be a potential material for the development of future superconducting devices.",

Here we theoretically investigate a series of two-dimensional (2D) twisted bilayer hexagonal materials beyond TBG at fixed angles of 7.34 ∘ and 67.34 ∘ with 22 2D van der Waals layered materials that are commonly studied in experiments. First-principles calculations are employed to systemically study the moiré minibands in these systems. We find that flat bands with narrow bandwidth generally exist in these systems. Some of the systems such as twisted bilayer In 2 Se 3 , InSe, GaSe, GaS and PtS 2 even host ultra-flat bands with bandwidth less than 20 meV even for such large angles, which makes them especially appealing for further experimental investigations. We further analysis the characters of moiré flat bands and provide guidance for further exploration of 2D MSL that could host strong electron correlations.",

We comparatively analyzed the NO 2 gas response of samples with different oxidation levels to study the gas sensing mechanisms. The results show that the samples oxidized at 325 °C are the most sensitive to NO 2 gas molecules, followed by the samples oxidated at 350 °C, 400 °C and 450 °C. The repeatabilities of 350 °C samples are better than that of 325 °C, and there is almost no shift in the baseline. Thus this work systematically analyzed the gas sensing performance of SnO x /SnS-based sensor oxidized at 350 °C. It exhibits a high response of 171% towards 1 ppb NO 2 , a wide detecting range (from 1 ppb to 1 ppm), and an ultra-low theoretical detection limit of 5 ppt, and excellent repeatability at room temperature. The sensor also shows superior gas selectivity to NO 2 in comparison to several other gas molecules, such as NO, H 2 , SO 2 , CO, NH 3 , and H 2 O. After x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, and electron paramagnetic resonance characterizations combining first principle analysis, it is found that the outstanding NO 2 sensing behavior may be attributed to three factors: the Schottky contact between electrodes and SnO x /SnS; active charge transfer in the surface and the interface layer of SnO x /SnS heterostructures; and numerous oxygen vacancies generated during the post-oxidation process, which provides more adsorption sites and superior bandgap modulation. Such a heterostructure-based room-temperature sensor can be fabricated in miniaturized size with low cost, making it possible for large-scale applications.",

The crystalline structure of the films is characterized with electron and x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The comparison with PtSe 2 layers grown on graphene, sapphire, mica, SiO 2 and Pt(111) shows that among insulating substrates, ZnO(0001) yields films of superior structural quality. Hall measurements performed on epitaxial ZnO/PtSe 2 with five monolayers of PtSe 2 show a clear semiconducting behaviour and a high mobility in excess of 200 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature and up to 447 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at low temperature.",

However, it remains a challenge to induce large electronic changes without chemically altering the layer or compromising its two-dimensionality. Here, a non-invasive technique is used to shift the chemical potential of monolayer MoS 2 through p- and n-type doping of graphene (Gr), which remains a well-decoupled 2D substrate. With the intercalation of oxygen (O) under Gr, a nearly rigid Fermi level shift of 0.45 eV in MoS 2 is demonstrated, whereas the intercalation of europium (Eu) induces a metal–insulator transition in MoS 2 , accompanied by a giant band gap reduction of 0.67 eV. Additionally, the effect of the substrate charge on 1D states within MoS 2 mirror-twin boundaries (MTBs) is explored. It is found that the 1D nature of the MTB states is not compromised, even when MoS 2 is made metallic. Furthermore, with the periodicity of the 1D states dependent on substrate-induced charging and depletion, the boundaries serve as chemical potential sensors functional up to room temperature.",

In this work we present an experimental realization of a spin-valve device where the generation of the spin signal is exclusively attributed to the spin-dependent conductivity of the magnetic graphene resulting from the proximity of an interlayer antiferromagnet, CrSBr. We clearly demonstrate that the usage of the conventional 3D magnetic contacts, that are commonly air-sensitive and incompatible with practical technologies, can be fully avoided when graphene/CrSBr heterostructures are employed. Moreover, apart from providing exceptionally long spin relaxation length, the usage of graphene for both generation and transport of the spin allows to automatically avoid the conductivity mismatch between the source and the channel circuits that has to be considered when using conventional low-resistive contacts. Our results address a necessary step in the engineering of spintronic circuitry out of layered materials and precede further developments in the area of complex spin-logic devices. Moreover, we introduce a fabrication procedure where we designed and implemented a recipe for the preparation of electrodes via a damage-free technique that offers an immediate advantage in the fields of air-sensitive and delicate organic materials.",

Ferromagnetic van der Waals materials have garnered much attention over the past few years due to their low dimensionality, excellent magnetic properties, and large response to external stimuli. Nonetheless, their behaviour upon fs laser-pulse excitation remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of a thin flake of Fe 3 GeTe 2 (FGT) and extract its intrinsic magnetic properties using a microscopic framework. We find that our data is well described by our modeling, with FGT undergoing a slow two-step demagnetization, and we experimentally extract the spin-relaxation timescale as a function of temperature, magnetic field and excitation fluence. Our observations indicate a large spin-flip probability in agreement with a theoretically expected large spin–orbit coupling, as well as a weak interlayer exchange coupling. The spin-flip probability is found to increase when the magnetization is pulled away from its quantization axis, opening doors to an external control over the spins in this material. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics van der Waals materials upon fs laser-pulse excitation, paving the way towards two-dimensional materials-based ultrafast spintronics.",

However, current technologies, such as photo- and electron-beam lithography, often employing masking layers, can significantly contaminate the materials. Large-area chemical vapour deposition-grown graphene is known to have non-ideal properties already due to surface contamination resulting from the transferring process. Additional contamination through the lithographic process might thus reduce the performance of any device based on the structured graphene. Here, we demonstrate a contactless chemical-free approach for simultaneous patterning and cleaning of self-supporting graphene membranes in a single step. Using energetic ions passing through a suspended mask with pre-defined nanopatterns, we deterministically structure graphene with demonstrated feature size of 15 nm, approaching the performance of small-area focused ion beam techniques and extreme ultraviolet lithography. Our approach, however, requires only a broad beam, no nanoscale beam positioning and enables large area patterning of 2DMs. Simultaneously, in regions surrounding the exposed areas, contaminations commonly observed on as-grown graphene targets, are effectively removed. This cleaning mechanism is attributed to coupling of surface diffusion and sputtering effects of adsorbed surface contaminants. For applications using 2DMs, this simultaneous patterning and cleaning mechanism may become essential for preparing the nanostructured materials with improved cleanliness and hence, quality.",

These combinations are restricted by imposing charge neutrality and the Pauling test for electronegativities. The structures are then pre-optimized with a specially crafted universal neural-network force-field, before a final step of geometry optimization using density-functional theory is performed. In this way we unveil an unprecedented variety of two-dimensional materials, covering the whole periodic table in more than 30 different stoichiometries of form A n B m or A n B m C k . Among the discovered structures, we find examples that can be built by decorating nearly all Platonic and Archimedean tessellations as well as their dual Laves or Catalan tilings. We also obtain a rich, and unexpected, polymorphism for some specific compounds. We further accelerate the exploration of the chemical space of two-dimensional materials by employing machine-learning-accelerated prototype search, based on the structural types discovered in the systematic search.

MXenes, as the rising star of 2D materials, offer unique combinations of properties including metallic conductivity, hydrophilicity, high specific capacitance, and solution processability, as well as mechanical flexibility and robustness that accentuate them for the fabrication of multifunctional composites. 2D flake structure and abundant surface terminations of MXene facilitate its integration into polymer matrices to develop high-performance composites. Polyimides (PIs) are high-temperature engineering polymers that have rendered their way into aerospace and electronics industries due to their outstanding mechanical strength, high chemical resistance, high thermal stability, excellent electrical and thermal insulation properties. Amalgamating the outstanding characteristics of these two materials, this paper is the first review to summarize advancements in PI/MXene nanocomposites to address the methods of preparation and the effect of MXene loading on the target application e.g. energy conversion and storage, electromagnetic interference shielding, sensing, and fire-retardancy. The review commences with a critical discussion on PI/MXene nanocomposite fabrication methods. Next, a comprehensive review of the properties and applications of PI/MXene nanocomposites is provided. Lastly, based on the current developments of PI/MXene nanocomposites, this paper is concluded with the prominent characteristics of PI/MXene composites regarding the target application and identifying the gaps and challenges to develop multifunctional composites.",

These HSs exhibit unique properties that are not observed in either of the constituent components in isolation. Interlayer excitons (IEs), which are electron–hole pairs separated across the HSs, play a central role in determining these HS properties and are of interest both fundamentally and for device applications. In recent years, a major focus has been on understanding and designing HSs composed of two or more TMDC materials. Less attention has been paid to HSs composed of one TMDC layer and a layer of perovskite material. A central challenge in the understanding of HS properties is that basic measurements such as optical spectroscopic analysis can be misinterpreted due to the complexity of the charge transfer dynamics. Addressing these aspects, this review presents an overview of the most common and insightful optical spectroscopic techniques used to study TMDC/TMDC and TMDC/halide perovskite HSs. Emphasis is placed on the interpretation of these measurements in terms of charge transfer and the formation of IEs. Recent advances have started to uncover highly interesting phenomena, and with improved understanding these HSs offer great potential for device applications such as photodetectors and miniaturized optics.",

According to DFT, the most stable oxide layers are stoichiometric, and derive their energetic stability from the low cost of creating 2D freestanding layers from the orthorhombic bulk phase, good matching to Pd, and the particularly strong adhesion to the substrate. The observed 2D MoO 3 layers are distinguished by well-ordered linear defects, such as domain boundaries in the ML, and misfit dislocations in the bilayer (BL). Applying reactive oxidation preparation conditions results in the formation of ordered arrays of nanostructures, nanowires and nanoclusters, in the MoO 3 BL. The formation of such linear structures is accounted for in the DFT by models of missing row defects of various orientations and stoichiometries. Their relative stability is rationalized in terms of the number of broken Mo–O bonds, the polar character of the nanostructure edges and the interaction strength with the Pd substrate.

Our results indicate that the point-symmetry breaking due to the incompatible mutual symmetry of the twisted monolayers and a strong hybridization has a massive impact on the spin splitting in graphene close to the Dirac point, with the spin splitting values greater than 20 meV. The band structure and spin expectation values of graphene close to the Dirac point can be described using a symmetry-free model, triggering different types of interaction with respect to the threefold symmetric graphene/transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructure. We show that the strong hybridization of the Dirac cone’s right movers with the SnTe band gives rise to a large asymmetric spin splitting in the momentum space. Furthermore, we discover that the ferroelectricity-induced Rashba spin–orbit coupling in graphene is the dominant contribution to the overall Rashba field, with the effective in-plane electric field that is almost aligned with the (in-plane) ferroelectricity direction of the SnTe monolayer. We also predict an anisotropy of the in-plane spin relaxation rates.

    "abstract": "Graphene has been intensively studied due to its outstanding electrical and thermal properties. Recently, it was found that the heat generation by Joule heating of graphene is limited by the conductivity of graphene. Here we suggest an alternative method to generate heat on a large-area graphene film more efficiently by utilizing the unique electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption property of graphene. The EM wave induces an oscillating magnetic moment generated by the orbital motion of moving electrons, which efficiently absorbs the EM energy and dissipate it as a thermal energy. In this case, the mobility of electron is more important than the conductivity, because the EM-induced diamagnetic moment is directly proportional to the speed of electron in an orbital motion. To control the charge carrier mobility of graphene we functionalized substrates with self-assembled monolayers (SAM). As the result, we find that the graphene showing the Dirac voltage close to zero can be more efficiently heated by EM waves. In addition, the temperature gradient also depends on the number of graphene. We expect that the efficient and fast heating of graphene films by EM waves can be utilized for smart heating windows and defogging windshields.",

The development of high-performance materials is a key issue in realizing the grid-scale applications of energy-storage devices. In this work, we describe a simple and scalable method for fabricating hybrids (graphene-pyrrole/carbon nanotube-polyaniline (GPCP)) using graphene foam as the supporting template. Graphene-pyrrole (G-Py) aerogels are prepared via a green hydrothermal route from two-dimensional materials such as graphene sheets, while a carbon nanotube/polyaniline (CNT/PANI) composite dispersion is obtained via the in situ polymerization method. The functional nanohybrid materials of GPCP can be assembled by simply dipping the prepared G-py aerogels into the CNT/PANI dispersion. The morphology of the obtained GPCP is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which revealed that the CNT/PANI was uniformly deposited onto the surfaces of the graphene. The as-synthesized GPCP maintains its original three-dimensional hierarchical porous architecture, which favors the diffusion of the electrolyte ions into the inner region of the active materials. Such hybrid materials exhibit significant specific capacitance of up to 350 F g−1, making them promising in large-scale energy-storage device applications.",

The design of the proposed lysozyme derivative provides this exfoliated 2D-materail with both, hydrophobic groups that interact with the surface of MoS2 and hydrophilic groups exposed to the aqueous medium, which hinders its re-aggregation. This approach, clarified also by molecular docking studies, leads to a stable material (ζ-potential, 27 ± 1 mV) with a yield of up to 430 µg ml−1. The bio-hybrid material was characterized in terms of number of layers and optical properties according to different slots separated by diverse centrifugal forces. Furthermore the obtained material was proved to be biocompatible using human normal keratinocytes and human cancer epithelial cells, whereas the method was demonstrated to be applicable to produce other 2D materials such as graphene. This approach is appealing for the advantageous production of high quality MoS2 flakes and their application in biomedicine and biosensing. Moreover, this method can be applied to different starting materials, making the denatured lysozyme a promising bio-tool for surface functionalization of 2D materials.",

In this work, amino and silane functionalized h-BNNSs were obtained, respectively. The chemical-bonding amino and silane functionalization of h-BNNSs were verified by FTIR, XPS and TG-MS analyses.

The functionalized h-BNNSs have broadband absorption and their doped glasses show high transmittances in the visible and near-infrared regions. The nonlinear optical properties of the functionalized h-BNNSs and their doped glasses were measured using Nd:YAG laser system and the doped glasses show broadband optical limiting responses at 532–1570 nm with the lowest onset threshold of 9 mJ cm−2. The optical limiting mechanisms investigated through Z-scan technique were nonlinear absorption.

    "abstract": "Graphene, the atomically-thin honeycomb carbon lattice, is a highly conducting 2D material whose exposed electronic structure offers an ideal platform for chemical and biological sensing. Its biocompatible, flexible and chemically inert nature associated with the lack of dangling bonds, offers novel perspectives for direct interfacing with biological molecules. Combined with its exceptional electronic and optical properties, this promotes graphene as a unique platform for bioelectronics. Among the successful bio-integrations of graphene, the detection of action potentials in numerous electrogenic cells including neurons has paved the road for the high spatio-temporal and wide-field mapping of neuronal activity. Ultimate resolution of sensing ion channel activity can be achieved with neural interfaces, and it was shown that macroscale electrodes can record extracellular current of individual ion channels in model systems, by charging the quantum capacitance of large graphene monolayer (mm2). Here, we show the field effect detection of ion channel activity within neuron networks, cultured during several weeks above graphene transistor arrays. Dependences upon drugs, reference potential gating and device geometry confirm the field effect detection of individual ion channel and suggest a significant contribution of grain boundaries, which provide highly sensitive nanoscale-sized sensing sites. Our theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the ion gating of a single grain boundary in liquid affects the electronic transmission of the whole transistor channel, resulting in significant conductance variations. Monitoring the ion channels activity is of great interest as most of neurodegenerative diseases relied on channelopathies, which rely on ion channel abnormal activity. Thus, such highly sensitive and biocompatible neuro-electronics which open the way to FET detection at the sub-cell precision should be useful for a wide range of fundamental and applied research areas, including brain-on-chip, pharmacology, and in vivo monitoring or diagnosis.",

Interlayer chemical coupling effects on the electronic structure of C3N are investigated using several bilayer models. The electronic structure of bilayer C3N depends sensitively on the layer stacking pattern with the calculated quasiparticle band gap ranging from 0.87 to 1.35 eV. Finally, we illustrate the effects of interlayer chemical interaction and bulk dielectric screening on the electronic properties of C3N. Depending on the specific bulk stacking, C3N may be metallic or semiconducting with a narrow gap of about 0.6 eV, even though different bulk phases are essentially degenerate energetically. As a result, it may be challenging to prepare single-phase semiconducting bulk C3N unless synthetic kinetics can somehow prefer or prohibit certain stacking patterns.

Here we show an unprecedentedly strong transverse electroabsorption (EA) signal in a monolayer of the two-dimensional semiconductor MoS2. The EA spectrum is dominated by an apparent linewidth broadening of around 15% at a modulated voltage of only Vpp = 0.5 V. Contrary to the conventional QCSE, the signal increases linearly with the applied field strength and arises from a linear variation of the distance between the strongly overlapping exciton and trion resonances. The achievable modulation depths exceeding 0.1 dBnm-1 bear the scope for extremely compact, ultrafast, energy-efficient EAMs for integrated photonics, including on-chip optical communication.",

To utilise these properties for the prospect of electronics in general, and long-wavelength-based photodetectors in particular, the Schottky barriers formed upon contact with a metal and the contact resistance that arises at these interfaces have to be measured and controlled. We present experimental evidence for the formation of Schottky barriers as low as 10 meV between MoTe2 and metal electrodes. By varying the electrode work functions, we demonstrate that Fermi level pinning due to metal induced gap states at the interfaces occurs at 0.14 eV above the valence band maximum.

    "abstract": "We recently reported on the synthesis of 2D α-MoO3 using a scalable liquid-phase exfoliation method, its characterization and preliminary studies of its potential for energy storage applications [1]. The material was examined in a LiClO4/propylene carbonate electrolyte, and in a 1.5–3.5 V versus Li+/Li electrochemical window [1]. The charge storage of 2D α-MoO3 electrodes was negligible and this was attributed to electrical limitations imposed by the semiconducting nature of 2D α-MoO3. Electrical conductivity studies of 2D α-MoO3/SWCNT electrodes, where a fraction of SWCNTs was progressively added, led to finding the SWCNT fraction for which an electrical percolation threshold was reached, i.e. a sharp increase of electrical conductivity. This SWCNT fraction also led to a sharp increase in capacitance confirming the electrical limitation of charge storage. In this work, we examined in detail the energy storage properties of 2D α-MoO3/SWCNT (85 wt%/15 wt%) electrodes. A detailed study of ion-intercalation events, as examined by cyclic voltammetry, is presented. We investigated the contributions to the overall energy storage of capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes and how the performance compares against other nanostructured materials including mesoporous α-MoO3 and α-MoO3 nanobelts. Our main findings showed that 2D α-MoO3/SWCNT (85 wt%/15 wt%) electrodes offer scope for supercapacitors and battery applications in terms of total charge storage (200 F g−1 and 195.2 mAh g−1), which is in the range or superior to that of other nanostructured metal oxides and commercial LiCoO2 cathodes. However, a main drawback is cycling stability.",

    "abstract": "Since graphene, there has been a focus on several two-dimensional material systems (e.g. boron nitride, borocarbon nitride (BCN), transition-metal dichalcogenides) that provide an even wider array of unique chemistries and properties to explore future applications. Specifically, tailoring graphene/boron nitride heterostructures—which can theoretically retain the character of a single-atom thick sheet, withstand large physical strains, are easily functionalized, and have entirely different optical and mechanical properties compared to graphene—can provide the foundation for entirely new research avenues. In recent years, it has been shown that because of the similar crystal structure, carbon, boron, and nitrogen can co-exist as atomic sheets in a layered structure. We have developed a facile method of integrating boron nitride (hBN) and graphene oxide (GO) via chemical exfoliation which we refer to as BCON. The study of the stability of this material at different pH conditions indicates a stable and a uniform solution is achievable at pH 4–8. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy helped to identify the new bonds which indicated the formation of BCON linkage. Further, an in situ XPS technique was used to understand the chemical changes while exposing it to ionization radiation specially focusing on the C/O ratio. It was observed that even with a very low energy source, this material is highly sensitive to ionizing radiation, such as neutron, alpha and beta particles.",

The mechanism for 2D QSH effect originates from an intrinsic d−d band inversion in the process of chemical bonding.

TaCX nanoribbon, which has the single-Dirac-cone edge states crossing the bulk band gap, exhibits a linear dispersion with a high Fermi velocity comparable to that of graphene.

    "abstract": "Topological band structures can be designed by subjecting lattice systems to time-periodic modulations, as was proposed for irradiated graphene, and recently demonstrated in two-dimensional (2D) ultracold gases and photonic crystals. However, changing the topological nature of Floquet Bloch bands from trivial to non-trivial, by progressively launching the time-modulation, is necessarily accompanied with gap-closing processes: this has important consequences for the loading of particles into a target Floquet band with non-trivial topology, and hence, on the subsequent measurements. In this work, we analyse how such loading sequences can be optimized in view of probing the topology of 2D Floquet bands through transport measurements. In particular, we demonstrate the robustness of center-of-mass responses, as compared to current responses, which present important irregularities due to an interplay between the micro-motion of the drive and inter-band interference effects. The results presented in this work illustrate how probing the center-of-mass displacement of atomic clouds offers a reliable method to detect the topology of Floquet bands, after realistic loading sequences.",

    "abstract": "The demand for high-efficiency flexible optoelectronic devices is ever-increasing because next-generation electronic devices that comprise portable or wearable electronic systems are set to play an important role. Graphene has received extensive attention as it is considered to be a promising candidate material for transparent flexible electrode platforms owing to its outstanding electrical, optical, and physical properties. Despite these properties, the inert and hydrophobic nature of graphene surfaces renders it difficult to use in optoelectronic devices. In particular, commonly used charge transporting layer (CTL) materials for organic solar cells (OSCs) cannot uniformly coat a graphene surface, which leads to such devices failing. Herein, this paper proposes an approach that will enable CTL materials to completely cover a graphene electrode; this is done with the assistance of commonly accessible polar solvents. These are successfully applied to various configurations of OSCs, with power conversion efficiencies of 8.17% for graphene electrode-based c-OSCs (OSCs with conventional structures), 8.38% for i-OSCs (OSCs with inverted structures), and 7.53% for flexible solar cells. The proposed approach is expected to bring about significant advances for efficiency enhancements in graphene-based optoelectronic devices, and it is expected that it will open up new possibilities for flexible optoelectronic systems.",

    "abstract": "A promising approach for high speed and high power electronics is to integrate two-dimensional (2D) materials with conventional electronic components such as bulk (3D) semiconductors and metals. In this study we explore a basic integration step of inserting a single monolayer MoS2 (1L-MoS2) inside a Au/p-GaN junction and elucidate how it impacts the structural and electrical properties of the junction. Epitaxial 1L-MoS2 in the form of 1-2 μm triangle domains are grown by powder vaporization on a p-doped GaN substrate, and the Au capping layer is deposited by evaporation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the van der Waals interface indicates that 1L-MoS2 remained distinct and intact between the Au and GaN and that the Au is epitaxial to GaN only when the 1L-MoS2 is present. Quantitative TEM analyses of the van der Waals interfaces are performed and yielded the atomic plane spacings in the heterojunction. Electrical characterization of the all-epitaxial, vertical Au/1L-MoS2/p-GaN heterojunctions enables the derivations of Schottky barrier heights (SBH) and drawing of the band alignment diagram. Notably, 1L-MoS2 appears to be electronically semi-transparent, and thus can be considered as a modifier to the Au contact rather than an independent semiconductor component forming a pn-junction. The I-V analysis and our first principles calculation indicated Fermi level pinning and substantial band bending in GaN at the interface. Lastly, we illustrate how the depletion regions are formed in a bipolar junction with an ultrathin monolayer component using the calculated distribution of the charge density across the Au/1L-MoS2/GaN junction.",

Bernal-stacked layers, in particular, have shown a remarkable even-odd effect with mono- and tri-layers remaining gapless conductors, and bi- and tetra-layers becoming gapped insulators. These observations $-$at odds with the established notion that (Bernal) trilayers and thicker multilayers are semi-metals$-$ have resulted in the proposal of a physical scenario leading to a surprising prediction, namely that even-layered graphene multilayers remain insulating irrespective of their thickness. Here, we present data from two devices that conform ideally to this hypothesis, exhibiting the behavior expected for Bernal-stacked hexa and octalayer graphene. Despite their large thickness, these multilayers are insulating for carrier density |n|<2-3x10$^{10}$cm$^{-2}$, possess an energy gap of approximately 1.5 meV at charge neutrality (in virtually perfect agreement with what is observed in bi and tetra layer graphene) and exhibit the expected integer quantum Hall effect. These findings indicate the soundness of our basic insights on the effect of electron interactions in Bernal graphene multilayers, show that graphene multilayers exhibit unusual and interesting physics that remains to be understood, and pose ever more pressing questions as to the microscopic mechanisms behind the semimetallic behavior of bulk graphite.",

However, obtaining large 2D sheets is very difficult and time consuming. We developed a systematic exfoliation technique for producing sub-millimeter-sized (the largest lateral dimension ever reported) pristine 2D sheets with high throughput. It requires the treatment of both the bulk crystal and receiving substrate. Contrary to the conventional Scotch tape technique that involves the repeated folding and unfolding of an adhesive tape, the flake is stamped onto an adhesive tape to preserve the lateral size of the bulk crystal, to improve the surface flatness, and to reduce the amount of residue on the surface of the samples. When applied to graphene, the method produced monolayer and few layer graphene samples that were several hundreds of microns in length. Surprisingly, the biggest monolayer graphene sample of 367 μm in length was easily produced. The technique was also applied to produce pristine MoS2 and phosphorene sheets of about 45 μm and 95 μm in length, respectively.",

Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that while the electronic structure and indirect band gap of SnS2 do not change significantly with the number of layers, they can be reversibly tuned by applying biaxial tensile (BT), biaxial compressive (BC), and normal compressive (NC) strains. Mono to multilayered SnS2 exhibit a reversible semiconductor to metal (S–M) transition with applied strain. For bilayer (2L) SnS2, the S–M transition occurs at the strain values of 17%, −26%, and −24% under BT, BC, and NC strains, respectively. Due to weaker interlayer coupling, the critical strain value required to achieve the S–M transition in SnS2 under NC strain is much higher than for MoS2. From a stability viewpoint, SnS2 becomes unstable at very low strain values on applying BC (−6.5%) and BT strains (4.9%), while it is stable even up to the transition point (−24%) in the case of NC strain. In addition to the reversible tuning of the electronic properties of SnS2, we also show tunability in the phononic band gap of SnS2, which increases with applied NC strain. This gap increases three times faster than for MoS2. This simultaneous tunability of SnS2 at the electronic and phononic levels with strain, makes it a potential candidate in field effect transistors (FETs) and sensors as well as frequency filter applications.",

Different graphene forms have been applied in several contexts, spreading from energy technologies and electronics to food and agriculture technologies.

In view of the enormous development of graphene-based technologies, a careful assessment of its impact on health and environment is demanded. It is evident how investigating the graphene toxicity is of fundamental importance in the context of medical purposes. On the other hand, the nanomaterial present in the environment, likely to be generated all along the industrial life-cycle, may have harmful effects on living organisms. In the present work, an important contribution on the impact of multi-layer graphene (MLG) on health and environment is given by using a multifaceted approach. For the first purpose, the effect of the material on two mammalian cell models was assessed. Key cytotoxicity parameters were considered such as cell viability and inflammatory response induction. This was combined with an evaluation of MLG toxicity towards Xenopus laevis, used as both in vivo and environmental model organism.",

Charge transfer from the 1T to the 2H phase occurs, but, as expected for a one-dimensional contact, the generated dipole potential decays away from the interface and the naive Schottky-Mott band-alignment picture is recovered away from the interface. The decay length of the dipole potential turns out to be larger for the zigzag interface than for the armchair interface due to the different penetration of the edge states into the bulk. Tight-binding quantum transport calculations aided by the DFT results generically confirm a low contact resistance in the range of ≈200–400 Ωμm, as experimentally reported. Furthermore, the contact resistance is predicted to be smaller at the armchair interface for electron injection and, on the contrary, smaller for hole injection at the zigzag interface.",

These two phases can coexist within the same monolayer microstructure, producing 2H/1T' interfaces. Here we report a systematic investigation of the energetics of the experimentally most important MoS2 heterophase interfaces and edges. The stable interface and edge structures change with chemical potential (these edges/interfaces are usually non-stoichiometric). Stable edges tend to be those of highest atomic density and the stable interfaces correspond to those with local atomic structure very similar to the 2H crystal. The interfacial energies are lower than those of the edges, and the 1T' edges have lower energy than the 2H edges. Because the 1T' edges have much lower energy than the 2H edges, a sufficiently narrow 1T' ribbon will be more stable than the corresponding 2H ribbon (this critical width is much larger in MoTe2 than in MoS2). Similarly, a large 2H flake have an equilibrium strip of 1T' along its edge (again this effect is much larger in MoTe2 than in MoS2). Application of tensile strains can increase the width of the stable 1T' strip or the critical thickness below which a ribbon favors the 1T' structure. These effects provide a means to phase engineer transition metal dichalcogenide microstructures.",

Despite the promise of 2D nanomechanical systems in such applications, full control over the shape of suspended 2D materials, such as graphene, has not been achieved. We present an effective, single-step method to shape pre-suspended graphene into nanomechanical resonators with arbitrary geometries leading to enhanced properties in comparison to conventional drumheads. Our technique employs focused ion beam milling and achieves feature sizes ranging from a few tens of nanometers to several microns, while obtaining near perfect yield. We compare the mechanical properties of the shaped devices to unmodified drumheads, and find that low-tension, singly-clamped graphene cantilevers display a 20 fold increase in the mechanical quality factor (Q) with a factor 100 reduction in the mechanical damping. Importantly, we achieve these results while simultaneously removing mass, which enables state-of-the-art force sensitivity for a graphene mechanical resonator at room temperature. Our approach opens up a unique, currently inaccessible regime in graphene nanomechanics, one characterized by low strain, low frequency, small mass, and high Q, and facilitates tailoring of non-linearity and damping in mechanical structures composed of graphene and other 2D crystals.",

We performed magneto-transport measurements to study the conduction behavior and quantum phase coherence of 1T' MoTe2 as a function of its thickness. We show that due to a unique two-band transport mechanism (synergetic contribution from electron conduction and hole conduction), the conduction behavior of 1T' MoTe2 changes from metallic to p-type unipolar, and finally to ambipolar as the thickness decreases, suggesting that this effect can be used in devices by effectively controlling the thickness. Our transport studies, optical measurements and first-principles electronic structure calculations reveal that 1T' MoTe2 remains gapless down to a few (~2–3) layers.

These problems include, firstly, the widely debated defect- and strain-induced origins of intense low-energy broad luminescence peaks (L-peaks) observed at low temperatures. Secondly, the role of oxygen in tuning the properties via chemisorption and physisorption is intriguing but challenging to understand. Thirdly, our physical understanding of the benefits of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation is inadequate. Using a series of samples, we decouple the contributions of oxygen, defects, adsorbates, and strain on the optical properties of monolayer MoS 2 . The defect origin of the L-peak is confirmed by temperature- and power-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements, with a dramatic redshift of ∼130 meV for oxygen-assisted chemical vapour deposition (O-CVD) samples compared with exfoliated samples. Anomalously, the O-CVD samples show high A-exciton PL at room temperature (cf exfoliated), but reduced PL at low temperatures, attributed to the strain-induced direct-to-indirect bandgap crossover in low-defect O-CVD MoS 2 . These observations are consistent with our density functional theory calculations and are supported by Raman spectroscopy. In the exfoliated samples, the charged O adatoms are identified as thermodynamically favourable defects, and create in-gap states. The beneficial effect of encapsulation originates from the reduction of charged O adatoms and adsorbates. This experimental–theoretical study uncovers the type of defects in each sample, enables an understanding of the combined effect of defects, strain, and oxygen on the band structure, and enriches our understanding of the effects of encapsulation. This work proposes O-CVD as a method for creating high-quality materials for optoelectronics.",

In bilayer structures, the electron and hole may be localized on the same layer or they may be separated forming an interlayer (IL) exciton with a finite out-of-plane dipole moment. Using first principles calculations, we investigate the excitons in a symmetric WS2/MoS2/WS2 heterostructure in the presence of a vertical electric field. The excitons exhibit a quadratic Stark shift for low field strengths and a linear Stark shift for stronger fields. This behavior is traced to the coupling of IL excitons with opposite dipole moments, which lead to the formation of quadrupolar excitons at small fields. The formation of quadrupolar excitons is determined by the relative size of the electric field-induced splitting of the dipolar excitons and the coupling between them given by the hole tunneling across the MoS2 layer. For the inverted structure, MoS2/WS2/MoS2, the dipolar excitons are coupled by electron tunneling across the WS2 layer. Because this effect is much weaker, the resulting quadrupolar excitons are more fragile and break at a weaker electric field.",

However, the production of reproducible devices remains challenging, partly due to variability at the nanometer to atomic scales. Thus, access to chemical, structural, and optical characterization at these lengthscales is essential. While electron microscopy and spectroscopy can provide chemical and structural data, accessing the optical response at the nanoscale through electron spectroscopies has been hindered until recently. This review focuses on the application of two electron spectroscopies in scanning (transmission) electron microscopes, namely cathodoluminescence and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, to study the nano-optics of TMD atomic layers and their vdW heterostructures. How technological advancements that can improve these spectroscopies, many of which are already underway, will make them ideal for studying the physics of vdW heterostructures at the nanoscale will also be discussed.",

Using detailed band structure calculations and tight-binding theory arguments, we demonstrate that this class of layered systems can be tailored to display 3D linear point degeneracies between two photonic bands, without breaking time-reversal symmetry and using a configuration that is readily-accessible experimentally. These results open new prospects for the observation of Weyl points in the near-infrared and optical regimes and for the application of Weyl-physics in integrated photonic devices.",

    "abstract": "Monoclinic group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been extensively studied for their intriguing 2D physics (e.g. spin Hall insulator) as well as for ohmic homojunction contacts in 2D device applications. A critical prerequisite for those applications is thickness control of the monoclinic 2D materials, which allows subtle engineering of the topological states or electronic bandgaps. Local thickness control enables the realization of clean homojunctions between different electronic states, and novel device operation in a single material. However, conventional fabrication processes, including chemical methods, typically produce non-homogeneous and relatively thick monoclinic TMDs, due to their distorted octahedral structures. Here, we report on a post-patterning technique using laser-irradiation to fabricate homojunctions between two different thickness areas in monoclinic MoTe2. A thickness-dependent electronic change from a metallic to semiconducting state, resulting in an electronic homojunction, was realized by the optical patterning of pristine MoTe2 flakes, and a pre-patterned device channel of monoclinic MoTe2 with a thickness-resolution of 5 nm. Our work provides insight on an optical post-process method for controlling thickness, as a promising approach for fabricating impurity-free 2D TMDs homojunction devices.",

Here, we report the first actively Q-switched lasers with a GEOM. In contrast to the previously reported lasers that are passively modulated by two-dimensional layered material-based saturable absorbers, our actively modulated laser concept represents significant advantages, such as electrically tunable output parameters (e.g. output repetition rate, pulse duration and pulse energy) and electro-optical synchronization. Using a single GEOM, we generate broadband Q-switched pulses at ∼1.55 and 2 μm with output energies of up to 123 nJ. This indicates the broadband pulse generation capability of the graphene-based active devices, superior to widely used bulk material-based active modulation approaches.

We show that the abundant 1D boundary states substantially pin the Fermi level in the lateral contact between graphene and MoS2, in close analogy to the effect of 2D interfacial states in the contacts between 3D materials.

Schottky barriers can be reduced by harnessing the polymorphism of 2D metal transition dichalcogenides, since both semiconducting and metallic phases exist. However, high energy, high temperature or chemicals are normally required for phase transformation, or the processes are complex. In this work, stable low-resistance contacts between few layer MoTe2 flakes and gold electrodes are achieved by a simple thermal annealing treatment at low temperature (200–400 °C). The resulting Schottky barrier height of the annealed MoTe2/Au interface is low (~23 meV). A new Raman Ag mode of the 1T' metallic phase of MoTe2 on gold electrode is observed, indicating that the low-resistance contact is due to the phase transition of 2H-MoTe2. The gold substrate plays an important role in the transformation, and a higher gold surface roughness increases the transformation rate. With this method, the mobility and ON-state current of the MoTe2 transistor increase by ~3–4 orders of magnitude, the photocurrent of vertically stacked graphene/MoTe2/Au device increases ~300%, and the response time decreases by ~20%.",

One of this configurations is partially oxidized while the other one remains quite inert to oxidation when exposed to ambient conditions. In this work, the oxidation process of the free-standing and Ag(1 1 1)-supported borophene is modeled using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). On the free-standing case, the oxygen molecule may go through a triplet to singlet transition, followed by a barrierless oxidation process. This transition is not observed upon the presence of the Ag(1 1 1) surface, what accelerates the oxidation process.

The carrier type control of 2D semiconducting materials such as MoTe2, WSe2 and black phosphorus have been studied for this purpose. However, the systematic study on the polarity control of transistors based on ReSe2, a new member of 2D materials, has remained unexplored despite the intriguing anisotropic optical and electrical properties deriving from the exotic crystal structure. Here, we report the electrical characterization of field effect transistors (FETs) of single crystalline ReSe2 grown by a chemical vapor deposition. In contrast to a previous report of unipolar p-type exfoliated crystals, synthesized ReSe2 FETs on SiO2 with Au contact exhibit highly symmetric ambipolar behaviors with the current on/off ratios of ~104 for both of hole and electron injection. The carrier type could be controlled via the metal contact. With Al contacts, ReSe2 FETs display perfect transition to pure n-type unipolar behavior. It is found that carrier type of ReSe2 via thickness variation was hardly modulated because the ReSe2 bandgap has little dependence on its thickness. We successfully achieved the fabrication of a logic inverter by using only ambipolar ReSe2 FETs on SiO2/Si without electrostatic doping or chemical treatments. These results demonstrate that ReSe2 is a promising candidate for future low power logic devices and functional nano electronic applications.",

Compared with other ultra-thin film growth methods, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has the advantages of excellent step coverage, uniformity and thickness controllability. In this work, we synthesized large-scale and thickness-controllable MoS2 films on sapphire substrate by ALD at 150 °C with molybdenum hexcarbonyl and hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDST) as precursors followed by high-temperature annealing in sulfur atmosphere. HMDST is introduced for the first time to enable a toxic-free process without hazardous sulfur precursors such as H2S and CH3SSCH3. The synthesized MoS2 retains the inherent benefits from the ALD process, including thickness controllability, reproducibility, wafer-level thickness uniformity, and high conformity. Finally, field-effect transistor (FET) arrays were fabricated based on the large-area ALD MoS2 films. The top-gate FETs exhibited excellent electrical performance such as high on/off current ratio over 103 and peak room-temperature mobility up to 11.56 cm2 V−1 s−1. This work opens up an attractive approach to realize the application of high-quality 2D materials with wafer scale homogeneity.",

By combining scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory we demonstrate that oxygen intercalated epitaxial graphene on Ir(111) has high structural quality, is quasi free-standing, and shows signatures of many-body interactions. Using this system as a template, we show that pn-interfaces can be patterned by adsorption and intercalation of rubidium, and that the n-doped graphene regions exhibit a reduced Coulomb screening via enhanced electron–plasmon coupling. These findings are central for understanding and tailoring the properties of graphene-metal contacts e.g. for realizing quantum tunneling devices.",

The conception and development of graphene electroactive nanofluids (ENFs) reported here for the first time provides a novel way to 'form' graphene electrodes and demonstrates proof of concept for the use of these liquid electrodes for energy storage in novel flow cells. A stabilized dispersion of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in aqueous sulfuric acid solution was shown to have capacitive energy storage capabilities parallel to those of solid electrode supercapacitors (169 F g−1(rGO)) but working up to much faster rates (from 1 mV s−1 to the highest scan rate of 10 V s−1) in nanofluids with 0.025, 0.1 and 0.4 wt% rGO, featuring viscosities very close to that of water, thus being perfectly suitable for scalable flow cells. Our results provide proof of concept for this technology and include preliminary flow cell performance of rGO nanofluids under static and continuous flow conditions. Graphene nanofluids effectively behave as true liquid electrodes with very fast capacitive storage mechanism and herald the application not only of graphenes but also other 2D materials like MoS2 in nanofluids for energy storage and beyond.",

Here, we grow centimeter-scale monolayer 1T'-MoTe2 on SiO2/Si substrate via chemical vapordeposition and demonstrate dichroism in visible range.

Each flake revealed one dimensional Mo–Mo dimerization feature and anisotropic absorption behavior in visible range (400–600 nm). This allowed us to detect the grain boundary due to stark contrast difference among flakes in different orientations.",

To study fundamental carrier properties, we performed ultrafast femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy on thin film black phosphorus mechanically exfoliated on a glass substrate. Carriers (electrons and holes) were excited to high energy levels and the process of carrier relaxation through phonon emission and recombination was probed. We used a wide range of probing wavelengths up to and across the band gap to study the evolution of the relaxation dynamics at different energy levels. Our experiments revealed a plethora of important physical phenomena. The fast relaxation time constants, associated with carrier-phonon scattering, steadily increase as the energy of the probe beam approaches the band gap energy, which was determined to be 0.31 eV, and the carrier recombination rate was obtained when the probe wavelength was tuned to match the band gap energy. The carrier-phonon scattering rates were found to be similar along the armchair and zigzag directions, therefore, the anisotropic carrier mobility reported in literature is mainly due to the difference in effective mass of carriers along different directions. The ultrafast spectroscopy data further revealed the oxidation induced surface charges. Our results highlight the importance of using the spectroscopy technique, in this case, in the mid-IR range, to uncover useful physical processes.",

However, the development of 2D MoS2-based optoelectronic devices depends upon the existence of a high optical quality and large-area monolayer MoS2 synthesis technique. To address this need, we present a thermal vapor sulfurization (TVS) technique that uses powder MoS2 as a sulfur vapor source. The technique reduces and stabilizes the flow of sulfur vapor, enabling monolayer wafer-scale MoS2 growth. MoS2 thickness is also controlled with great precision; we demonstrate the ability to synthesize MoS2 sheets between 1 and 4 layers thick, while also showing the ability to create films with average thickness intermediate between integer layer numbers. The films exhibit wafer-scale coverage and uniformity, with electrical quality varying depending on the final thickness of the grown MoS2. The direct bandgap of grown monolayer MoS2 is analyzed using internal and external photoluminescence quantum efficiency. The photoluminescence quantum efficiency is shown to be competitive with untreated exfoliated MoS2 monolayer crystals. The ability to consistently grow wafer-scale monolayer MoS2 with high optical quality makes this technique a valuable tool for the development of 2D optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaics, detectors, and light emitters.",

Studying crystallization kinetics of MoS2 with conventional synthesis methods, such as chemical vapor deposition, is challenging because there is a complex set of thermally-activated events happening simultaneously. By combining high-throughput experimentation with in situ Raman spectroscopy we show that the migration-limited crystallization kinetics of MoS2 can be directly observed. During isothermal heating we find that nucleation of MoS2 happens rapidly and that the crystallization rate follows an Arrhenius temperature relationship, yielding an energy barrier of 1.03 eV/atom. The relationship between temperature, crystal quality, and layer orientation is determined with transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, revealing that elevated crystallization temperatures improve crystal quality and reduce defect formation.",

Here, we study the excitons in BP-based heterostructures with encapsulation and spacer 2D layers, using first principles GW and Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) methods. The 2D layers chosen are germanium sulfide (GeS) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), representing respectively strong and weak hybridization with BP. Except for hBN-encapsulated BP, all systems host bright interlayer (or indirect) excitons. In contrast to 2D indirect gap heterostructures, the interlayer excitons here are much brighter. Strong hybridization between GeS and BP increases the effective mass and room temperature exciton lifetimes. In contrast, the hBN spacer layer decouples the BP monolayers in BP/hBN/BP, resulting in the lowest energy exciton being dark. Surprisingly, however, BP/hBN/BP hosts interlayer BP excitons that are even brighter than those in bilayer BP. This lowest energy bright exciton lies very close in energy to the dark state, resulting in an increased effective lifetime. Our work uncovers the interplay between interlayer interactions and the physics of interlayer excitons, and paves the way for the use of bottom-up materials design to optimize the dipole oscillator strengths and lifetimes of interlayer excitons for excitonic device applications.",

Density functional theory and tight-binding calculations reveal a band inversion among the Bi-p orbits driven by the strong intrinsic spin–orbit coupling, producing a large nontrivial band gap, which can be effectively tuned by moderate strains. The helical gapless edge states exhibit a linear dispersion with a high Fermi velocity comparable to that of graphene, and the QSH phase remains robust on a NaCl substrate.

Due to its promises as a coating for medical applications, we investigated graphene transfer onto commercially available titanium implants with different geometries using a vacuum-assisted dry transfer method. A self-standing graphene-polymer tape is obtained by spin coating of a silicone polymer on the graphene, followed by the addition of a support layer, and the electrochemical delimitation of the growth substrate. The tape is then wrapped around the object and placed into a mould to conform to the surface. Using a pressure differential provided via partial vacuum, a uniform force is applied to the surface. Graphene characteristics are assessed by Raman spectroscopy and AFM. 74% and 95% coverage yields are obtained after a single transfer and double transfer respectively, with an observed increase in the number of graphene layers and an overall decrease in defect contributions.

We use first-principles density functional theory (DFT) along with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to study the phonon transport properties of pristine MoSe2 and W doped MoSe2 with and without the presence of Se vacancies. We found that for samples without Se vacancy, the W doping could enhance the thermal transport of monolayer MoSe2 due to reduced three-phonon scattering phase space. For example, we observed that the 16.7% W doping increases the thermal conductivity of the monolayer MoSe2 with 2% Se vacancy by 80% if all vacancies can be suppressed by W-doping. However, the W doping in the defective MoSe2 amplifies the influence of the phonon scattering caused by the Se vacancies, which results in a further decrease in thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSe2 with defects. This is found to be related with higher phonon density of states of Mo0.83W0.17Se2 and larger mass difference between W and Se atoms compared to Mo and Se atoms. This study deciphers the effect of defects and doping on the thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSe2, which helps us understand the mechanism of defect-induced phonon transport, and provides insights into enhancing the heat dissipation in MoSe2-based electronic devices.",

The band-gap extends from the visible to the mid-infrared spectral range, as a function of sample thickness and external parameters such as electric field and pressure. This, combined with the saturable absorption and in-plane anisotropic optical properties, makes BP a versatile platform for realizing polarization-sensitive photodetectors and absorbers. Although its near-equilibrium properties have been intensively studied, the development of efficient ultrafast optical devices requires detailed knowledge of the temporal dynamics of the photoexcited hot-carriers. Here we address the electronic response of BP to an ultrafast laser excitation, by means of time-and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Following the optical excitation, we directly observe a shift of the valence band (VB) position, indicative of band-gap renormalization (BGR). Our data also show that the hole population in the VB relaxes with a characteristic time ps, while the lifetime of the electrons accumulated at the minimum of the conduction band is ps. The experimental results are well reproduced by ab initio calculations of the out-of-equilibrium electronic properties. Our study sets the reference for the ultrafast carrier dynamics in BP and demonstrates the material's ultrafast BGR, which is promising for optoelectronic switches.",

The quasicrystalline order of the 30°-TBG, showing a 12-fold rotational symmetry, was directly visualized in atomic-resolved STM images. In the presence of high magnetic fields, we observed Landau quantization of massless Dirac fermions, demonstrating that the studied 30°-TBG is a relativistic Dirac fermion quasicrystal. Because of a finite interlayer coupling between the adjacent two layers of the 30°-TBG, a suppression of density-of-state (DOS) at the crossing point between the original and mirrored Dirac cones was observed. Moreover, our measurements also observe strong intervalley scattering in the defect-free quasicrystal, indicating that the electronic properties of the 30°-TBG should be quite different from that of its component: the graphene monolayer.",

Then we discuss in detail the shortcomings and developments in using conventional oxide tunnel barriers for spin injection into graphene followed by introducing the recent advancements in using the crystalline single/bi/tri-layer hBN tunnel barriers for an improved spin injection and detection which also can facilitate two-terminal spin valve and Hanle measurements, at room temperature, and are of technological importance.

Recently, however, single and few layers of 1T-NbSe$_2$ with octahedral coordination around the transition metal ion were synthesized. Motivated by these experiments and by using first-principles calculations, we investigate the structural, electronic and dynamical properties of single layer 1T-NbS$_2$. We find that single-layer 1T-NbS$_2$ undergoes a $\\sqrt{13}\\times\\sqrt{13}$ star-of-David charge density wave. Within the generalized gradient approximation, the weak interaction between the stars leads to an ultraflat band at the Fermi level isolated from all other bands. The spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation stabilizes a total spin $1/2$ magnetic state with opening of a $0.15$ eV band gap and a $0.21\\mu_B$ magnetic moment localized on the central Nb in the star. Within GGA+U, the magnetic moment on the central Nb is enhanced to $0.41\\mu_{B}$ and a larger gap occurs. Most important, this approximation gives a small energy difference between the 1T and 1H polytypes (only $+0.5$ mRy/Nb), suggesting that the 1T-polytype can be synthesized in a similar way as done for single layer 1T-NbSe$_2$. Finally we compute first and second nearest neighbors magnetic inter-star exchange interactions finding $J_1$=9.5~K and $J_2$=0.4~K ferromagnetic coupling constants.",

The linear region field effect mobility ranges from 2 to 10 cm2 V−1 s−1, with current on–off ratio exceeding 106.

Here, we report layer-by-layer growth of SnSe2, a layered semiconducting material, via van der Waals epitaxy.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals a polycrystalline film with a grain size of ∼100 nm and clear Moiré patterns from overlapped grains with similar thickness. We also report field effect mobility values of 3.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 11 and 22 nm thick SnSe2, respectively.

In this work, we propose and theoretically analyze two-probe transport junctions that overcome this difficulty so that perfect half-metal quantum transport is realized. When two zigzag SiC nanoribbons are connected by a C–Si–C–Si tetramer where the right ribbon is turned by 180° around the transport direction, 100% spin polarization with nearly perfect transmission is obtained due to perfect momentum k-matching across the transport junction. We show such a transport to be independent of the magnetic configurations of the two ribbons. A concomitant property is that 100% valley polarized charge transport is achieved. In principle, the structure of the proposed transport junction turns SiC nanoribbons into a promising, robust, and essentially perfect spin and valley filter.",

More importantly, our work demonstrates that the unusual magnetic scattering, as compared with bulk, is more obvious in 2D α-RuCl3, indicating that the frustrated magnetic interactions are enhanced strongly.

However, their superior properties are confined to one or two dimensions, thus limiting their utility in interconnects or thermal interface materials that require a 3D structure for efficient electron and/or phonon transport. It is conceivable that a combined CNT-graphene structure would provide new opportunities for realizable applications in these and other fields. In recent years, numerous results on synthesis, structural analyses, theoretical modeling, and potential applications of various CNT-graphene heterostructures have been reported. In this review, we summarize the possible structures that can be formed by connecting CNT and graphene. We then report existing experimental efforts to synthesize the heterostructures based on growth method, catalyst design, and the resulting properties. Also, theoretical studies on various heterostructures are reviewed, with the focus on electron and thermal transport within the heterostructure and across the CNT-graphene interface. Several potential applications are briefly discussed, and a combined theoretical and experimental approach is proposed with the objective of enhancing the understanding of the CNT-graphene heterostructure and attaining a realistic assessment of its feasibility in practical applications.",

We here report on atomic scale characterization of several GBs and on the structural-dependence of the localized electronic states in their vicinity. Using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, together with tight binding and ab initio numerical simulations we explore GBs on the surface of graphite and elucidate the interconnection between the local density of states and their atomic structure. We show that the electronic fingerprints of these GBs consist of pronounced resonances which, depending on the relative orientation of the adjacent crystallites, appear either on the electron side of the spectrum or as an electron-hole symmetric doublet close to the charge neutrality point. These two types of spectral features will impact very differently the transport properties allowing, in the asymmetric case to introduce transport anisotropy which could be utilized to design novel growth and fabrication strategies to control device performance.",

    "abstract": "The information computation through synapse networks in the brain plays a vital role for cognitive behaviors such as image/video recognition, self-learning, and decision-making. Achieving proper synaptic networks by conventional semiconductor and memristive devices has encountered critical issues such as the spatial density requiring a number of transistors for one synapse, reliable filament formation in memristors, or emulating diverse excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity with two-terminal device geometry. Here, we report selective growth of variously doped MoS2 with controllable conductance plasticity, which can be used for emulating diverse synaptic junctions. The conductance plasticity in the monolayer MoS2 was found to originate from resistive-heating near the junctions with electrodes in the two-terminal device geometry and the carrier concentration-dependent metal-insulator transition in the MoS2 channel. A spatiotemporal synaptic summation is demonstrated where the firing of a proper postsynaptic membrane potential can be designed for cognitive processes. Compared with previously reported three terminal synaptic devices with atomically thin materials, our two-terminal devices with flexible synaptic strengths have advantages for integrating three-dimensional neuronal networks. This provides a new insight on two-dimensional materials as a promising arena for integrated synaptic functionalities in artificial neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP), a layered van der Waals material, reportedly has a band gap sensitive to external perturbations and manifests a Dirac-semimetal phase when its band gap is closed. Previous studies were focused on effects of each perturbation, lacking a unified picture for the band-gap closing and the Dirac-semimetal phase. Here, using pseudospins from the glide-reflection symmetry, we study the electronic structures of mono- and bilayer BP and construct the phase diagram of the Dirac-semimetal phase in the parameter space related to pressure, strain, and electric field. We find that the Dirac-semimetal phase in BP layers is singly connected in the phase diagram, indicating the phase is topologically identical regardless of the gap-closing mechanism. Our findings can be generalized to the Dirac semimetal phase in anisotropic layered materials and can play a guiding role in search for a new class of topological materials and devices.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it has been shown that oxide barriers in graphene-based non-local spin-valve structures can be the bottleneck for spin transport. The barriers may cause spin dephasing during or right after electrical spin injection which limit spin transport parameters such as the spin lifetime of the whole device. An important task is to evaluate the quality of the oxide barriers of both spin injection and detection contacts in a fabricated device. To address this issue, we discuss the influence of spatially inhomogeneous oxide barriers and especially conducting pinholes within the barrier on the background signal in non-local measurements of graphene/MgO/Co spin-valve devices. By both simulations and reference measurements on devices with non-ferromagnetic electrodes, we demonstrate that the background signal can be caused by inhomogeneous current flow through the oxide barriers. As a main result, we demonstrate the existence of charge accumulation next to the actual spin accumulation signal in non-local voltage measurements, which can be explained by a redistribution of charge carriers by a perpendicular magnetic field similar to the classical Hall effect. Furthermore, we present systematic studies on the phase of the low frequency non-local ac voltage signal which is measured in non-local spin measurements when applying ac lock-in techniques. This phase has so far widely been neglected in the analysis of non-local spin transport. We demonstrate that this phase is another hallmark of the homogeneity of the MgO spin injection and detection barriers. We link backgate dependent changes of the phase to the interplay between the capacitance of the oxide barrier to the quantum capacitance of graphene.",

Absorption of water vapors in GO layers follows a modified Kelvin equation revealing condensation in an elastic slit, while desorption of water is limited by a few outer GO layers providing bottleneck restrictions to water transport and resulting in classical H2-type isotherms. GO interlayer distances (d) vary in range from 7.2 Å to 11.5 Å depending on partial water pressures in a feed stream and permeate. The permeance of water vapor through GO decreases steadily with decreasing interlayer distance between GO sheets from ~80 000 l/(m2 · atm · h) to ~30 000 l/(m2 · atm · h) falling down to negligible values below d ≈ 9.2 Å. Water transport in GO is described by Poiseuille equation and hopping diffusion depending on the number of water layers between GO planes, and was modelled with semi-empirical methods. It is shown the performance of thin GO membranes is strongly governed by the interstitial water quantity as dictated by water partial pressure.",

The planar symmetry for the electromagnetic boundary conditions is further used to obtain explicit forms for the Casimir energy stored in the stack and the Casimir–Polder energy between an atom above the stack. Our calculations show that these fluctuation induced interactions experience strong thermal effects due to the graphene Dirac-like energy spectrum. The spatial dispersion and temperature dependence in the optical response are also found to be important for enhancing the interactions especially at smaller separations. Analytical expressions for low and high temperature limits and their comparison with corresponding expressions for an infinitely conducting planar stack are further used to expand our understanding of Casimir and Casimir–Polder energies in Dirac materials.

However, existing ECoG technologies still fail to provide the resolution necessary to accurately map highly localized activity across large brain areas, due to the rapidly increasing size of connector footprint with sensor count. This work demonstrates the use of a flexible array of graphene solution-gated field-effect transistors (gSGFET), exploring the concept of multiplexed readout using an external switching matrix. This approach does not only allow for an increased sensor count, but due to the use of active sensing devices (i.e. transistors) over microelectrodes it makes additional buffer transistors redundant, which drastically eases the complexity of device fabrication on flexible substrates. The presented results pave the way for upscaling the gSGFET technology towards large-scale, high-density μECoG–arrays, eventually capable of resolving neural activity down to a single neuron level, while simultaneously mapping large brain regions.",

Here we report rapid and highly sensitive malaria detection with an inexpensive graphene-protected copper surface plasmon resonance biosensor. Using phase sensitive surface plasmon resonance technique and a graphene functionalization protocol for attaching end-tethered DNA probes that were complementary to a malaria specific DNA target, we were able to significantly improve the detection limit of the malarial plasmodium parasite. The phase sensitivity of our graphene-enhanced sensors exceeds by two orders of magnitude the sensitivity of analogous optical biosensors. This enhanced sensitivity could provide means to detect low copy number bacterial infectious agents and to associate dormant bacterial populations with chronic inflammatory diseases using simple label-free optical detection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) on the c -plane sapphire has been a very popular system to study in the two-dimensional (2D) materials community. Bottom-up synthesis of monolayer (ML) MoS 2 with excellent electrical properties has been achieved on sapphire by various methods, making it a very promising candidate to be used in the next generation nano-electronic devices. However, large-area ML MoS 2 with comparable quality as the relatively small size exfoliated ML remains quite a challenge. To overcome this bottle neck, a comprehensive understanding of the structure of the as-grown ML material is an essential first step. Here, we report a detailed structural characterization of wafer-scale continuous epitaxial ML MoS 2 grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on sapphire using an azimuthal reflection high-energy electron diffraction (ARHEED) technique. With ARHEED we can map not only 2D but also 3D reciprocal space structure of the ML statistically. From the oscillation in the ARHEED intensity profile along the vertical direction of the ML, we derived a real space distance of ~3 Å at the interface of ML and sapphire. Quantitative diffraction spot broadening analyses of the 3D reciprocal space map reveals low density defects and a small angular misalignment of orientation domains in ML MoS 2 . Based on atomic force microscopy height distribution analysis, cross-section scanning transmission electron microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we suggest that there exists a passivation layer between MoS 2 ML and sapphire substrate. This ARHEED methodology also has been applied to ML WS 2 and is expected to be applicable to other ML transition metal dichalcogenides on arbitrary crystalline or non-crystalline substrates.",

This allows engineering tunable multi-chromatic superlattices through the interference of moiré potentials from independently configurable heterointerfaces in multilayers. We show examples of bichromatic moiré potentials for valley electrons, holes, and interlayer trions in MX 2 /M’X’ 2 /MX 2 trilayers, which can be strain switched from multi-orbital periodic superlattices to quasi-periodic disordered landscape. The trilayer moiré also hosts two independently configurable triangular superlattices of neutral excitons with opposite electric dipoles. These findings greatly enrich the versatility and controllability of TMDs moiré as a quantum simulation platform.",

Different from the inert graphene only consisted of six-membered rings, all these three carbon allotropes can exhibit the HER catalytic activity, with the net C superior to net W and net Y. It is revealed that the strain in four- or eight-membered ring with the antiaromaticity can play a crucial role in dominating their HER activities. Furthermore, the HER catalytic activities for all of three carbon allotropes can be effectively enhanced by doping N, B, O, P and S atoms with the different electronegativity, and the achievement of their high HER activities can be mainly due to the cooperation of foreign-atom doping with the ring strain effect. The correlative carbon atoms, shared by four-, six- and eight-membered rings, can uniformly serve as the most active site for all these 2D pure or doped carbon systems. Undoubtedly, introducing the correlative rings with the strain or antiaromaticity can be considered as the new and effective strategy to realize the highly efficient and nonprecious HER electrocatalysts, and all these intriguing findings obtained in this work can be advantageous for designing new kind of promising HER electrocatalysts.",

Recently, it was demonstrated that external perturbations such as an electric field close the band gap in few-layer BP, and can even induce a band inversion, resulting in an insulator phase with a finite energy gap or a Dirac semimetal phase characterized by two separate Dirac nodes. At the transition between the two phases, a semi-Dirac state appears in which energy disperses linearly along one direction and quadratically along the other. In this work, we study the optical conductivity of few-layer BP using a lattice model and the corresponding continuum model, incorporating the effects of an external electric field and finite temperature. We find that the low-frequency optical conductivity scales a power law that differs depending on the phase, which can be utilized as an experimental signature of few-layer BP in different phases. We also systematically analyze the evolution of the material parameters as the electric field increases, and the consequence on the power-law behavior of the optical conductivity.",

    "abstract": "Channel length scaling in graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) is key in the pursuit of higher performance in radio frequency electronics for both rigid and flexible substrates. Although two-dimensional (2D) materials provide a superior immunity to Short Channel Effects (SCEs) than bulk materials, they could dominate in scaled GFETs. In this work, we have developed a model that calculates electron and hole transport along the graphene channel in a drift-diffusion basis, while considering the 2D electrostatics. Our model obtains the self-consistent solution of the 2D Poisson's equation coupled to the current continuity equation, the latter embedding an appropriate model for drift velocity saturation. We have studied the role played by the electrostatics and the velocity saturation in GFETs with short channel lengths L. Severe scaling results in a high degradation of GFET output conductance. The extrinsic cutoff frequency follows a 1/L^n scaling trend, where the index n fulfills n < 2. The case n = 2 corresponds to long-channel GFETs with low source/drain series resistance, that is, devices where the channel resistance is controlling the drain current. For high series resistance, n decreases down to n= 1, and it degrades to values of n < 1 because of the SCEs, especially at high drain bias. The model predicts high maximum oscillation frequencies above 1 THz for channel lengths below 100 nm, but, in order to obtain these frequencies, it is very important to minimize the gate series resistance. The model shows very good agreement with experimental current voltage curves obtained from short channel GFETs and also reproduces negative differential resistance, which is due to a reduction of diffusion current.",

    "abstract": "Identifying quantum numbers to label elementary excitations is essential for the correct description of light-matter interaction in solids. In monolayer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoSe$_2$ or WSe$_2$, most optoelectronic phenomena are described well by labelling electron and hole states with the spin projection along the normal to the layer (S$_z$). In contrast, for WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ interfaces recent experiments show that taking S$_z$ as quantum number is not a good approximation, and spin mixing needs to be always considered. Here we argue that the correct quantum number for these systems is not S$_z$, but the $z$-component of the total angular momentum -- J$_z$ = L$_z$ + S$_z$ -- associated to the C$_3$ rotational lattice symmetry, which assumes half-integer values corresponding modulo 3 to distinct states. We validate this conclusion experimentally through the observation of strong intervalley scattering mediated by chiral optical phonons that -- despite carrying angular momentum 1 -- cause resonant intervalley transitions of excitons, with an angular momentum difference of 2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on van der Waals heterostructures without the traditional lattice mismatch constraints are highly promising for electronics. As the devices’ scale decreases, it is crucial to find a dielectric layer with a high dielectric constant to ensure gate capacitance and low leakage current. Herein, a layered insulator VOCl single crystal synthesized by chemical vapor transport is demonstrated as a high-performance gate dielectric. Notably, the dielectric constant of VOCl can reach up to 11.7, estimated through measuring the capacitance of the metal–insulator-metal device. The MoSe 2 FET with VOCl dielectric exhibits a significant decrease in the subthreshold swing from 4906 to 169 mV dec −1 , indicating a low trap density at the interface of MoSe 2 /VOCl. Besides, the threshold voltage ( V th ) of bottom-gated MoSe 2 FET is as low as 0.2 V, further confirming the high potential of VOCl as an ideal two-dimensional gate dielectric.",

The surface lattice constant of PtTe2 derived from the positions of the helium diffraction peaks up to fifth order was found to be , in agreement with STM and x-ray diffraction measurements. This value remains unchanged in the temperature range between 90 and 580 K. These findings suggest that 1T-PtTe2 behaves similarly to graphene on a weakly-interacting substrate, for which the surface thermal expansion coefficient is zero within experimental error. The electron–phonon coupling constant has been determined by recording the thermal attenuation of the elastic diffraction peaks of PtTe2. Based on a recently developed quantum theoretical method adapted to layered degenerate semiconductors we find that lies between 0.38–0.42.",

Progress in 3D printing technologies offers new opportunities for precise bone architecture reproduction during scaffolds construction.

Latest progress in biomaterials research makes the family of bidimensional carbon materials in the spotlight for their excellent bone regeneration and mechanical properties. Graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide can also be 3D printed to obtain patient-tailored scaffolds with controlled feature sizes in the mesoscopic range. In this review, we describe technologies developed for graphene 3D printing focusing on the osteogenic properties of graphene scaffolds. The multiple benefits achievable by a proper design of the graphene surface as well as the concerns on their biocompatibility are also highlighted.

    "abstract": "Abstract Thin films of noble-metal-based transition metal dichalcogenides, such as PtSe 2 , have attracted increasing attention due to their interesting layer-number dependent properties and application potential. While it is difficult to cleave bulk crystals down to mono- and few-layers, a range of growth techniques have been established producing material of varying quality and layer number. However, to date, no reliable high-throughput characterization to assess layer number exists. Here, we use top-down liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) coupled with centrifugation to produce PtSe 2 nanosheets of varying sizes and thicknesses with a low degree of basal plane defectiveness. Measurement of the dimensions by statistical atomic force microscopy allows us to quantitatively link information contained in optical spectra to the dimensions. For LPE nanosheets we establish metrics for lateral size and layer number based on extinction spectroscopy. Further, we compare the Raman spectroscopic response of LPE nanosheets with micromechanically exfoliated PtSe 2 , as well as thin films produced by a range of bottom up techniques. We demonstrate that the E g 1 peak position and the intensity ratio of the E g 1 /A 1g 1 peaks can serve as a robust metric for layer number across all sample types.This will be of importance in future benchmarking of PtSe 2 films.",

Here, we set up a deterministic transfer system for 2D materials within a gloveless anaerobic chamber. Unlike other setups based on over-pressurized gloveboxes, in our system the operator can manipulate the 2D materials within the chamber with bare hands. This experimental setup allows us to exfoliate 2D materials and to deterministically place them at a desired location with accuracy in a controlled O 2 -free and very low humidity (&lt;2% RH) atmosphere.

Besides, the capability to modulate the nature and strength of proximity effects by changing crystalline and interfacial symmetries offers a vast playground to optimize physical properties of relevance for innovative applications. In this work, we use large-scale first principles calculations to demonstrate that strain and twist-angle strongly vary the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene/transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. Such a change results in a modulation of the spin relaxation times by up to two orders of magnitude. Additionally, the relative strengths of valley-Zeeman and Rashba SOC can be tailored upon twisting, which can turn the system into an ideal Dirac–Rashba regime or generate transitions between topological states of matter. These results shed new light on the debated variability of SOC and clarify how lattice deformations can be used as a knob to control spin transport. Our outcomes also suggest complex spin transport in polycrystalline materials, due to the random variation of grain orientation, which could reflect in large spatial fluctuations of SOC fields.",

Often, standard photoluminescence (PL) with microscale lateral resolution is utilized to identify and characterize these excitonic phenomena, including interlayer excitons (IEXs). We studied the local PL signatures of van der Waals heterobilayers composed of exfoliated monolayers of the (Mo, W)(S, Se) 2 TMDC family with high spatial resolution (down to 30 nm) using tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL) with different orders (top/bottom) and on different substrates. We evidence that in MoS 2 –WSe 2 heterobilayers, other PL signals may appear near the reported energy of the IEX transitions, possibly interfering in the interpretation of the results. The extra signals are only observed locally in small areas where the topography looks distorted. We assign those signals to the PL of the individual monolayers, in which the exciton energy is altered by the local strains caused by the formation of blisters and nanobubbles, and the PL is extremely enhanced due to the decoupling of the layers. We prove that even a single nanobubble as small as 60 nm—hence not optically visible—can induce such a suspicious PL feature in the micro-PL spectrum of an otherwise flat heterobilayer. In contrast, a PL peak, which could be assigned to the interlayer exciton in MoS 2 –WSe 2 , is observed at ≈1.0 eV.",

    "abstract": "The properties of MXenes, new generation of 2D materials, are determined by the surface terminations, which depends on flake preparation method. Changing the surface termination chemical groups can significantly modify the MXene flake properties and functionality. However, the common methods of MXene flake surface chemistry tuning require high-energy treatments and often lead to flake damage. In this work, we propose a plasmon-assisted chemical transformation for tuning the surface chemistry and termination of MXene flakes. The plasmon resonance was directly excited on MXene flakes and induced the generation of highly reactive radicals from electrostatically absorbed iodonium salt cations, leading to immediate grafting of the created radicals to the flake edges and basal planes. We used bis-CF3-substituted iodonium salts, and subsequent analysis of the Ti3C2Tx MXene flake surface composition indicated decreases in the total oxygen concentration and oxidized titanium with a simultaneous increase in the fluorine surface concentration, which was related to –C6H3(CF3)2 moiety attachment. The ability to substitute the hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups with hydrophobic and oleophilic –CF3 groups containing functional groups allows us to create a stable suspension of a MXene in nonpolar organic solvents and prepare a superhydrophobic, water-repellent and oxidation-stable conductive MXene coating.",

Sub-ballistic states are found within the narrow-band region around the magic angle. Such states are delocalized in momentum-space and follow non-Poissonian level statistics, in contrast with their ballistic counterparts found for close commensurate angles. Transport results corroborate this picture: for large enough systems, the conductance of samples with fixed width decreases with the system size in the longitudinal direction for incommensurate angles within the sub-ballistic regime. Our results show that incommensurability/quasiperiodicity effects are of crucial importance in the narrow-band regime. The incommensurate nature of a general twist angle must therefore be taken into account for an accurate description of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene.",

This development of artificial synaptic devices is expected to open up a new era for neuromorphic computing. However, the complicated functions in biological synapse are dependent on the dynamic neural activities with modulated plasticity, which is still very difficult to emulate at the device level. Here, an artificial synaptic transistor based on WSe 2 /graphene van der Waals heterojunction is demonstrated with both electrically and optically modulated synaptic plasticity. By changing the polarity of applied V gs and V ds as well as superimposed gate voltage spikes, both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity can be realized in a single device. Moreover, due to the asymmetric optical response of WSe 2 /graphene heterojunction, optical modulation on hysteretic behaviors is achieved and also contributes to the inversion of synaptic plasticity. Hence, this work demonstrates a coordinated regulation on synaptic plasticity under electrical and optical stimuli and provides a multi-dimensional modulation strategy to understand the underlying mechanisms of complicated neuromorphic computing and further develop multifunctional neuromorphic optoelectronics.",

A unidirectional freeze-casting technique was used to prepare an anisotropic Ti 3 C 2 T x aerogel into which epoxy resin was then vacuum infiltrated and cured. The resulting composite showed an excellent Joule heating performance over repeated heating–cooling cycles. A steady-state temperature of 123 °C was obtained by applying a low voltage of 2 V with 5.1 A current, giving a total power output of 6.1 W cm −2 .

It particularly focusses the novel innovation interface investigation (3I) approach designed to explore the impact of GRM on the formation and transformation of potential future value chains. Context specific innovation spheres and their interrelations through innovation interfaces constitute the underlying key concepts of the 3I approach and serve as essential building blocks of prospective supply chains.

    "abstract": "Abstract Semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials-based devices usually exhibit inferior electrical performance compared to their theoretical predictions, which is mainly attributed to the presence of high density of interfacial defect induced trap states within the bandgap of 2D materials. It is pertinent to control the density of interface traps ( D it ) and identify their respective energy levels inside the band gap of the 2D materials to understand the tailored device performance. Here, we report the large modulation of D it by electrical gating and varying the channel thickness of tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ) placed on ultra-clean hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) gate insulator in a metal–insulator–semiconductor structure, which is revealed by performing multi-frequency capacitance and conductance measurements. Analysis of the 2D hBN/WSe 2 interface reveals that with the increase of WSe 2 thickness, D it at the midgap of WSe 2 is reduced to 6 × 10 9 cm −2 eV −1 , which is less than D it reported for SiO 2 /Si interface (∼10 10 cm −2 eV −1 ). Furthermore, by increasing thickness and applying gate voltage, D it distribution is systematically modulated inside the WSe 2 band gap from valence band edge to mid-gap to conduction band edge, thereby changing the Fermi level of WSe 2 , and inducing versatile device polarity. Our results show that D it and its spatial energy distribution within the thickness tailored WSe 2 band gap primarily control polarity modulation in WSe 2 .",

So far, more than 1800 layered materials (LMs) have been identified but only a few insulating and naturally occurring LMs were deeply investigated. Phyllosilicate minerals, which are a class of natural and abundant LMs, have been recently considered as a low-cost source of insulating nanomaterials. Within this family an almost barely explored material emerges: phlogopite [KMg3(AlSi3)O10(OH)2]. Here we carry out a high throughput characterization of this LM by employing several experimental techniques, corroborating the major findings with first-principles calculations. We show that monolayers (1L) and few-layers of this material are air and temperature stable, as well as easily obtained by the standard mechanical exfoliation technique, have an atomically flat surface, and lower bandgap than its bulk counterpart, an unusual trend in LMs. We also systematically study the basic properties of ultrathin phlogopite and demonstrate that natural phlogopite presents iron impurities in its crystal lattice, which decreases its bandgap from about 7 eV to 3.6 eV. Finally, we combine phlogopite crystals with 1L-WS2 in ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures and present a photoluminescence study, revealing a significant enhancement on the 1L-WS2 optical quality (i.e., higher recombination efficiency through neutral excitons) similarly to that obtained on 1L-WS2/hBN heterostructures. Our proof-of-concept study shows that phlogopite should be regarded as a good and promising candidate for LM-based applications as a low-cost layered nanomaterial.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene is a promising active material for developing fiber-based devices due to its exceptional electrical conductivity and electrochemical capacitance. However, fabricating robust fibers with high MXene content remains challenging due to shortcomings such as low interfacial adhesion between sheets and shrinkage-induced sheet disorientation during processing, leading to diminished physical and electrochemical properties. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of tough, conductive, and electrochemically active fibers through a sequential bridging strategy involving calcium cation (Ca 2+ ) infiltration of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)-bridged MXene, cross-linked and dried under tension. The resulting fibers exhibited a record toughness of ∼2.05 MJ m −3 and retained high volumetric capacitance (∼985 F cm −3 ), attributed to the synergistic CNC bridging, Ca 2+ cross-linking, and tension application during fiber drying. These fibers also surpass the conductivity of their unaligned pristine MXene counterpart (∼8347 S cm −1 vs ∼5078 S cm −1 ), ascribed to the tension-induced improvement in MXene alignment within these fibers, mitigating the undesirable effects of inserting an insulating CNC bridge. We anticipate that improving the toughness and conductivity of sequentially bridged MXene fibers will pave the way for the production of robust multifunctional MXene fibers, allowing their use in practical high-performance applications like wearable electronics and energy storage devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With increasing demands of high-performance and functionality, electronics devices generate a great amount of heat. Thus, efficient heat dissipation is crucially needed. Owing to its extremely good thermal conductivity, graphene is an interesting candidate for this purpose. In this paper, a two-step temperature-annealing process to fabricate ultrahigh thermal conductive graphene assembled films (GFs) is proposed. The thermal conductivity of the obtained GFs was as high as 3826 ± 47 W m −1 K −1 . Extending the time of high-temperature annealing significantly improved the thermal performance of the GF. Structural analyses confirmed that the high thermal conductivity is caused by the large grain size, defect-free stacking, and high flatness, which are beneficial for phonon transmission in the carbon lattice. The turbostratic stacking degree decreased with increasing heat treatment time. However, the increase in the grain size after long heat treatment had a more pronounced effect on the phonon transfer of the GF than that of turbostratic stacking. The developed GFs show great potential for efficient thermal management in electronics devices.",

As many properties critically depend on the exact twist angle and its spatial homogeneity, there is a need for a fast and non-invasive characterization technique of the local twist angle, to be applied preferably right after stacking. We demonstrate that confocal Raman spectroscopy can be utilized to spatially map the twist angle in stacked bilayer graphene for angles between 6.5 ∘ and 8 ∘ when using a green excitation laser. The twist angles can directly be extracted from the moiré superlattice-activated Raman scattering process of the transverse acoustic (TA) phonon mode. Furthermore, we show that the width of the TA Raman peak contains valuable information on spatial twist angle variations on length scales below the laser spot size of ∼500 nm.",

Three standard excitation laser lines are used (457, 532, and 633 nm wavelengths), and the main Raman active graphene bands (G and 2D) are considered. Our results reveal that electron–phonon interaction influences the G band’s linewidth close to the magic angle regardless of laser excitation wavelength. Also, the 2D band lineshape in the θ &lt; 1° regime is dictated by crystal lattice and depends on both the Bernal (AB and BA) stacking bilayer graphene and strain soliton regions (SP) (Gadelha et al 2021 Nature 590 405–9).

In this work, we show the electrical switching of the photoluminescence from h -BN quantum emitters, enabled by the controllable electron transfer from the nearby charge reservoir. By tuning the Fermi level of graphene next to the h -BN defects, we observed luminescence brightening of quantum emitters upon the application of a voltage due to the direct charge state manipulation. In addition, the correlation measurement of the single photon sources with the graphene’s Raman spectroscopy allows us to extract the exact charge transition level of quantum emitters, providing the information on the crystallographic nature of the defect structure.

In addition to its thermal, chemical and mechanical stability, hBN demonstrates high thermal conductivity, low compressibility, and wide band gap around 6 eV, making it a promising candidate for many groundbreaking applications and more specifically in van der Waals heterostructures. Millimeters scale hBN crystals are obtained through a disruptive dual method (polymer derived ceramics (PDC)/pressure-controlled sintering (PCS)) consisting in a complementary coupling of the PDC route and a PCS process. In addition to their excellent chemical and crystalline quality, these crystals exhibit a free exciton lifetime of 0.43 ns, as determined by time-resolved cathodoluminescence measurements, confirming their interesting optical properties. To go further in applicative fields, hBN crystals are then exfoliated, and resulting boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) are used to encapsulate transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Such van der Waals heterostructures are tested by optical spectroscopy. BNNSs do not luminesce in the emission spectral range of TMDs and the photoluminescence width of the exciton at 4 K is in the range 2–3 meV. All these results demonstrate that these BNNSs are of high quality and relevant for future opto-electronic applications.",

The emerging moir\\'e potential can trap interlayer excitons into arrays of strongly interacting bosons, which form a unique platform to study strongly correlated many-body states. In order to create and manipulate these exotic phases of matter, a microscopic understanding of exciton-exciton interactions and their manifestation in these systems becomes indispensable. Recent density-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements have revealed novel spectral features indicating the formation of trapped multi-exciton states providing important information about the interaction strength. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory to model the PL spectrum of trapped multi-exciton complexes focusing on the emission from moir\\'e trapped single- and biexcitons. Based on an excitonic Hamiltonian we determine the properties of trapped biexcitons as function of twist angle and use these insights to predict the luminescence spectrum of moir\\'e excitons for different densities. We demonstrate how side peaks resulting from transitions to excited states and a life time analysis can be utilized as indicators for moir\\'e trapped biexcitons and provide crucial information about the excitonic interaction strength.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Mermin–Wagner theorem forbids spontaneous symmetry breaking of spins in one/two-dimensional (2D) systems at a finite temperature and rules out the stabilization of this ordered state. However, it does not apply to all types of phase transitions in low dimensions, such as the topologically ordered phase rigorously shown by Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT) and experimentally realized in very limited systems such as superfluids and superconducting thin films. Quasi-2D van der Waals magnets provide an ideal platform to investigate the fundamentals of low-dimensional magnetism. We explored the quasi-2D honeycomb antiferromagnetic single crystals of (Ni x Fe 1− x ) 2 P 2 S 6 ( x = 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0) using in-depth temperature-dependent Raman measurements supported by first-principles calculations of the phonon frequencies. Quite surprisingly, we observed renormalization of the phonon modes much below the long-range magnetic ordered temperature attributed to the topological ordered state, namely the BKT phase, which is also found to change as a function of doping. The extracted critical exponent of the order-parameter (spin–spin correlation length, <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo> <mml:mi>T</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) evinces the signature of a topologically active state driven by vortex–antivortex excitations. As a function of doping, a tunable transition from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic ordering is shown via phonons reflected in the strong renormalization of the self-energy parameters of the Raman active phonon modes. The extracted exchange parameter ( J ) is found to vary by ∼100% by increasing the value of doping, ranging from ∼6 meV (for x = 0.3) to 13 meV (for x = 1).",

The highly exposed lattice planes coupled with tunable electronic states of 2D materials have created manifold opportunities in the design of new platforms for energy conversion and sensing applications. Still, challenges in understanding the electrochemical (EC) characteristics of these materials arise from the complexity of both intrinsic and extrinsic heterogeneities that can obscure structure–activity correlations. Scanning EC probe microscopic investigations offer unique benefits in disclosing local EC reactivities at the nanoscale level that are otherwise inaccessible with macroscale methods. This review summarizes recent progress in applying techniques of scanning EC microscopy (SECM) and scanning EC cell microscopy (SECCM) to obtain distinctive insights into the fundamentals of 2D electrodes. We showcase the capabilities of EC microscopies in addressing the roles of defects, thickness, environments, strain, phase, stacking, and many other aspects in the heterogeneous electron transfer, ion transport, electrocatalysis, and photoelectrochemistry of representative 2D materials and their derivatives.

Exploring the THz conductivity of graphene nanostructures is crucial for optimizing their performance in advanced devices, necessitating comprehensive research into their optical responses across a broad frequency spectrum. In this study, we experimentally investigate the optical conductivity of graphene nanostructures using ultra-broadband THz time-domain spectroscopy. Extracted from the time-dependent THz echo signals, an order-of-magnitude enhancement of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in graphene nanostructures was observed. This led to the anisotropic behavior in optical conductivity over the broadband THz range. In addition, the analyzed results show that LSPRs in graphene nanostructures experience damping loss from the intraband transition, resulting in energy dissipation into the substrate through the dielectric space layer. The induced redshift of the LSPR and linewidth broadening, in turn, modifies the optical conductivity of the graphene nanostructures.

We show that spectrum of the lowest gapless subband is characterized by imaginary frequencies, for wave-numbers below a critical value, dependent on the dislocation orientation, which indicates an instability for long enough straight partial and perfect dislocations. We argue that pinning potential and/or small deformations of the dislocations could stabilize the gapless phonon spectra.

Initially predicted by simulation in 1997, borophene was first synthesized in 2015. This 2D form of boron exists under various polymorphic structures, the most observed being β_12 and χ_3. Borophene fills a crucial gap in the 2D material repertoire thanks to its intrinsic metallicity and relative stability in air. However, in view of practical applications including borophene, it is crucial to master its synthesis to enable controlling its structure and thus tuning its properties. This review focuses on its current bottom-up syntheses, i.e., physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition. Indeed, borophene’s structure is different from the bulk boron one, which excludes its top-down synthesis. The impact of substrate characteristics, temperature, pressure conditions, and precursor molecules on borophene's phase and domain size is analyzed, along with key characterization techniques. The review extends to hydrogenated borophene and bilayer borophene for a comprehensive understanding of boron bonding and substrate interactions. Given the importance of ambient stability and transferability of 2D boron layers for device applications, a thorough comprehension of borophene oxidation is imperative. The review thus also discusses potential solutions to mitigate oxidation-related challenges.",

However, it fails to achieve the long-term metallic protection because the highly-conductive graphene could accelerate the electrochemical degradation of substrates.

The development of superior BN-based composite coatings (BNCCs) has attracted a great deal of attention, aiming to realize high-performance anticorrosion coating materials, and numerous efforts have been made in surface engineering and basic fabrication of BNCCs. In this paper, we provided a critical review on statues, advances, and challenges in surface engineering and fabrication of BNCCs in corrosion protection. The processing-structure-property relationships between functionalized BNNSs andBNCCs were in-depth discussed. Finally, the research perspectives of BNCCs were&amp;#xD;proposed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Neuromorphic computing is a low-power and energy efficient alternative to von Neumann computing that demands new materials and computing architectures. Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials and ions are a particularly favorable pair for neuromorphic computing. The large surface to volume ratio of 2D layered materials makes them sensitive to the presence of ions, detected as orders of magnitude change in electrical resistance. Quantum confinement of 2D crystals limits carrier scattering and enhances mobility, which decreases power consumption. Moreover, the 2D crystal-ion pair can provide volatile and non-volatile responses in the same device, as well as dynamic synaptic properties, such as spike-timing dependent plasticity. These dynamic properties are particularly relevant because they mirror the mechanisms involved in biological learning and memory. In this perspective, we first summarize recent progress in the field, categorize 2D crystal-ion devices in terms of their mechanisms (either electrostatic or electrochemical), and highlight key synaptic functionalities these devices can replicate. We underscore the differences between artificial and biological synapses, and between devices meant to emulate biological functions versus those optimized for compatibility with digital artificial neural networks (ANNs). We note that the use of ionically gated transistors based on 2D crystals (2D IGTs) in ANNs has primarily focused on their non-volatile memory functions, rather than fully exploiting their dynamic synaptic properties. We assert that the energy-efficient operation of 2D IGTs, enabled by their high capacitance density and tunable ion dynamics, makes them particularly suited for low-power edge computing applications. Finally, our perspective is that realizing the full potential of 2D crystals and ions in neuromorphic systems will require bridging the gap between demonstrated synaptic functionalities and their practical implementations in neural networks.",

From first-principle calculations, we investigate impact of electron-phonon interaction on single-particle spectrum and temperature-dependent bandgap renormalization of h-AlN monolayer. Additionally, temperature-dependent optical absorption and emission studied from finite-temperature Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) show significant impact of electron-phonon interaction. We calculate temperature-dependent non-radiative linewidths using the exciton-phonon coupling function that gives a parameter free exciton lifetimes. We demonstrate that h-AlN monolayers exhibit strong photoluminescence (PL) emission within the UV range of 3.94-4.05 eV. Furthermore, from the finite-momentum exciton spectrum calculation using BSE, we show that the PL emissions in indirect bandgap AlN are facilitated by phonon modes with finite lattice momentum. These phonon modes promote efficient recombination of electrons and holes having finite momentum difference q .

    "abstract": "Abstract Fundamental research on two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems based on van der Waals materials has been gaining traction rapidly since their recent discovery. With the increase of recent knowledge, it has become clear that such materials have also a strong potential for applications in devices that combine magnetism with electronics, optics, and nanomechanics. Nonetheless, many challenges still lay ahead. Several fundamental aspects of 2D magnetic materials are still unknown or poorly understood, such as their often-complicated electronic structure, optical properties, and magnetization dynamics, and their magnon spectrum. To elucidate their properties and facilitate integration in devices, advanced characterization techniques and theoretical frameworks need to be developed or adapted. Moreover, developing synthesis methods which increase critical temperatures and achieve large-scale, high-quality homogeneous thin films is crucial before these materials can be used for real-world applications. Therefore, the field of 2D magnetic materials provides many challenges and opportunities for the discovery and exploration of new phenomena, as well as the development of new applications. This Roadmap presents the background, challenges, and potential research directions for various relevant topics in the field on the fundamentals, synthesis, characterization, and applications. We hope that this work can provide a strong starting point for young researchers in the field and provide a general overview of the key challenges for more experienced researchers.&amp;#xD;",

    "abstract": "Abstract Germanium sulfide (GeS) is a 2D semiconductor with potential for high-speed optoelectronics and photovoltaics due to its near-infrared band gap and high mobility of optically excited charge carriers. Here, we use time-resolved THz spectroscopy to investigate the differences in ultrafast carrier dynamics in GeS following near-band gap photoexcitation (1.55 eV), which penetrates deep into the multilayer GeS, and excitation with above-band gap photon energy (3.1 eV), which is absorbed within a sub-20 nm surface layer. We find that the photoexcited carriers in the bulk have significantly longer lifetimes and higher mobility, as they are less impacted by trap states that affect carrier behavior in the surface layer. These insights are important for designing GeS-based photodetectors, solar energy conversion devices, and sensors that leverage the sensitivity of surface-layer photoexcited carriers to trap states.&amp;#xD;",

    "abstract": "Abstract Metallenes are presented for a new class of single-atom-thick two-dimensional (2D) metal sheets. It is motivated by a recent (2024) discovery of 2D gold, dubbed goldene, by selectively etching off Ti3C2 slabs from a Ti3AuC2 nanolaminate. This synthesis-derivative method bypasses the natural tendency for metals to form three-dimensional forms. Thus, 2D-materials’ research goes beyond ceramics with graphene as the most-known example. A range of noble and non-noble metals are now proposed for metallene preparation. Their exploration is motivated by the unique properties offered by 2D and nanostructured materials. Metallene’s ultimate high surface-to-volume ratio with abundant uncoordinated metal atoms makes them attractive for high-end applications, like in catalysis, sensing, electronics, and biomedicine. Challenges for scientific research and practical use, however, lie in scalable synthetic processes, sheet integrity, and transfer methods. Here, we review state-of-the-art for processes to prepare atomic and few-atomic layer-thick noble metals, as well as their characterization and properties.",

However, due to the strong adhesion between the substrate and deposited materials, the peel-off and dry transfer of MBE-grown vdW films onto other substrates has been challenging. This limits the study and use of MBE films for heterogeneous integration including stacked and twisted heterostructures. In this work, we develop a polymer-assisted dry transfer method and successfully perform full-film transfer of various MBE-grown 2D vdW materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, topological insulators and 2D magnets. In particular, we transfer air-sensitive 2D magnets, characterize their magnetic properties, and compare them with as-grown materials. The results show that the transfer technique does not degrade the magnetic properties, with the Curie temperature and hysteresis loops exhibiting similar behaviors after the transfer. Our results enable further development of heterogeneous integration of 2D vdW materials based on MBE growth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Uniform deposition of metal oxides on 2D materials, while preserving their structural integrity, is a crucial step to realize the integration of 2D materials in practical devices. In this study, we demonstrate the rapid nucleation of ZnO using atmospheric-pressure spatial chemical vapor deposition (AP-SCVD) on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides MoS 2 and WS 2 . The high precursor partial pressure and uniform precursor delivery afforded by the AP-SCVD process, as compared to conventional atomic layer deposition (ALD), led to rapid ZnO nucleation on both CVD-grown MoS 2 and WS 2 in as little as 5 AP-SCVD oscillations and complete film closure was achieved on CVD-grown WS 2 flakes in less than 60 AP-SCVD oscillations. The ZnO nuclei formed larger interconnected clusters on MoS 2 , whereas more-isolated islands were formed on the WS 2 . Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy revealed that AP-SCVD is a benign process that does not damage the underlying 2D materials and rather helps to passivate defects via oxygen/water adsorption from the air, when performed in an appropriate temperature window. Deposition of the ZnO was found to impact the optical and structural properties of CVD-grown MoS 2 and WS 2 differently. For the MoS 2 –ZnO heterostructure, electron doping and strain dominate, resulting in a reduction in the PL of MoS 2 , whereas for the WS 2 –ZnO, strain and dielectric screening have a larger impact, resulting in an enhanced PL.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we demonstrate a low-temperature transfer method for MoS 2 onto a 200 mm silicon wafer while maintaining the integrity of the 2D layer. The approach involves the direct bonding of MoS 2 , grown on SiO 2 , to a silicon substrate. The separation of the bonded wafers is achieved through mechanical debonding, using a blade inserted at a controlled speed. By carefully optimizing the debonding environment and blade velocity, we were able to improve the transfer yield to over 93%. Our findings indicate that both the transfer rate and material quality are enhanced when the blade insertion velocity is slow and the process conducted in water. Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed that the chemical structure of MoS 2 is preserved. Additionally, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed no mechanical defects, such as cracks or wrinkles, and showed the absence of residues. Experimental conditions were conducted on several wafers to prove the excellent reproducibility of the process.",

Magnetic ordering, optical response, and chemical reactivity are investigated. Our results demonstrated that WS2 zigzag nanoribbons exhibit a ferromagnetic-metallic behavior that is attributed to the edges; the resulting magnetic moments are mainly localized in S and W edge atoms. Furthermore, the magnetic ordering along the edges depends on the zigzag nanoribbon's width. Armchair nanoribbons exhibit semiconducting behavior. Optical response results demonstrated that there exists a strong optical polarization anisotropy enhancing a well defined absorption intensity peak, with polarization along the nanoribbons axis. Regarding chemical reactivity, ribbons are exposed to water (H2O), thiophene (C4H4S), and carbon monoxide (CO) molecules. Results reveal that H2O can be covalently joined to the edges via the W-atoms in the ribbons with zigzag-edges, whereas in ribbons with armchair edges, H2O is dissociated in OH and H, and these species are joined to W and S atoms respectively. Results for thiophene on zigzag nanoribbons demonstrated that C4H4S molecules are absorbed by W-terminated edges, whereas in armchair ribbons, the C4H4S is linked to the edges by binding to the sulfur. Interestingly, CO molecules give rise to half-metallicity and surprising ferromagnetism in zigzag and armchair nanoribbons, respectively. The results discussed here could help to understand the physical and chemical properties of edges in transition metal dichalcogenides materials.",

    "abstract": "Silicene, the silicon counterpart of graphene, has been identified as a promising 2D material for electronics applications. The reported very low thermal conductivity of silicene can potentially pose challenges on the thermal management of such nanoelectronics, which can in turn influence the device performance and reliability. Although the thermal conductivity of silicene has been studied, the impact of hydrogenation of silicene, which can happen spontaneously due to the resultant lower energy state, on its thermal transport ability is not clear. In this paper, we use first-principles calculations and iterative solution of phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to investigate and compare the thermal transport property of silicene and hydrogenated silicene. Surprisingly, we predict that the hydrogenation can lead to a large increase in thermal conductivity (from 22.5 W m−1 K−1 for silicene to 78.0 W m−1 K−1 for hydrogenated silicene at 300 K). We also find that the main contributor for such an improvement is the transverse acoustic phonon modes, and the reasons are the reduced anharmonicity as well as the reduced three-phonon scattering phase space after hydrogenation. This research may help better understand thermal transport in functionalized 2D materials and inspire new strategies to manipulate their thermal properties, which is of critical importance for designing high performance and reliable nanoelectronic devices.",

We use a combination of a tight-binding model and rigorously determined bare Coulomb interactions, which allows us to consider relevant microscopic effects beyond the long-wavelength limit. We calculate the dielectric function of few-layer BP in the random phase approximation and show that it exhibits strongly anisotropic behavior even in the static limit. We also estimate the strength of effective local and non-local Coulomb interactions and determine their doping dependence. We find that the $p_z$ states responsible for low-energy excitations in BP provide a moderate contribution to the screening, weakening the on-site Coulomb interaction by less that a factor of two. Finally, we calculate the full plasmon spectrum of few-layer BP and discuss the effects beyond long-wavelengths.",

We exploit liquid phase exfoliation of layered MoO3 crystallites to produce multilayer MoO3 nanosheets dispersed in isopropanol, which are then mixed with solution processed SWNTs in the same solvent. The addition of SWNTs to the MoO3 nanosheets provides the conductive framework for electron transport, as well as a bridge structure, which buffers the volume expansion upon lithiation/de-lithiation. We demonstrate that the hybrid SWNT-bridged MoO3 structure is beneficial for both the mechanical stability and the electrochemical characteristics of the anodes leading to a specific capacity of 865 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles, with a columbic efficiency approaching 100% and a capacity fading of 0.02% per cycle.

In this work, graphene ink formulations are successfully utilized toward the design and fabrication of high-power resistive structures that are printed on both rigid and flexible substrates and have the potential to deliver close to 10 W of power. A near-flat, negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) is measured with an activation energy Ea ~ 2.4 meV for electron hopping, which is 100× lower compared to Ea values for high TCR materials. The TCR and Ea values are amongst the lowest reported for 2D layered material systems. The thermal-invariance of resistivity for such high-power graphene printed resistors is attractive for applications, for example to provide a stable heating source for flexible electronics over extreme thermal environments. The transport characteristics of the ink-jet printed features is modeled as a composite structure in order to explain the thermal response which appears to be mediated via defects in the sonicated graphite, and correlates well to inferences made from Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis conducted on the printed graphene structures. In order to fabricate such functional structures with ink-jet printing, the active nozzle number, printing passes, and annealing conditions are shown to play an important role to determine line resolution, and also dictate the morphological and electronic transport characteristics of the printed graphene features.",

First we will discuss which bound state solutions in different B-field regimes can be used as the basis for qubits states. We find that at low B-fields combined spin-valley Kramers qubits to be suitable, while at large magnetic fields pure spin or valley qubits can be envisioned. Then we present a discussion of the relaxation of a single electron spin mediated by electron–phonon interaction via various different relaxation channels. In the low B-field regime we consider the spin-valley Kramers qubits and include impurity mediated valley mixing which will arise in disordered quantum dots. Rashba spin–orbit admixture mechanisms allow for relaxation by in-plane phonons either via the deformation potential or by piezoelectric coupling, additionally direct spin-phonon mechanisms involving out-of-plane phonons give rise to relaxation. We find that the relaxation rates scale as B6 for both in-plane phonons coupling via deformation potential and the piezoelectric effect, while relaxation due to the direct spin-phonon coupling scales independant to B-field to lowest order but depends strongly on device mechanical tension. We will also discuss the relaxation mechanisms for pure spin or valley qubits formed in the large B-field regime.",

    "abstract": "Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) demonstrate a wide range of optoelectronic properties due to their diverse elemental compositions, and are promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronics and energy harvesting devices. However, effective band offset engineering is required to implement practical structures with desirable functionalities. Here, we explore the pressure-induced band structure evolution of monolayer WS2 and Mo0.5W0.5S2 using hydrostatic compressive strain applied in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) apparatus and theoretical calculations, in order to study the modulation of band structure and explore the possibility of band alignment engineering through different compositions. Higher W composition in Mo(1−x)W(x)S2 contributes to a greater pressure-sensitivity of direct band gap opening, with a maximum value of 54 meV GPa−1 in WS2. Interestingly, while the conduction band minima (CBMs) remains largely unchanged after the rapid gap increase, valence band maxima (VBMs) significantly rise above the initial values. It is suggested that the pressure- and composition-engineering could introduce a wide variety of band alignments including type I, type II, and type III heterojunctions, and allow to construct precise structures with desirable functionalities. No structural transition is observed during the pressure experiments, implying the pressure could provide selective modulation of band offset.",

While aiming to study spin injection/detection with 1D edge contacts, a spurious magnetoresistance signal was observed, which is found to originate from the local Hall effect in graphene due to fringe fields from ferromagnetic edge contacts and in the presence of charge current spreading in the nonlocal measurement configuration. Such behavior has been confirmed by the absence of a Hanle signal and gate-dependent magnetoresistance measurements that reveal a change in sign of the signal for the electron- and hole-doped regimes, which is in contrast to the expected behavior of the spin signal. Calculations show that the contact-induced fringe fields are typically on the order of hundreds of mT, but can be reduced below 100 mT with careful optimization of the contact geometry. There may be an additional contribution from magnetoresistance effects due to tunneling anisotropy in the contacts, which needs further investigation. These studies are useful for optimization of spin injection and detection in 2D material heterostructures through 1D edge contacts.",

Because of a strong spin-layer locking, the ground state A excitons exhibit a monolayer-like valley Zeeman splitting with a negative g-factor, whose magnitude increases monotonically when crystal thickness decreases from bulk to a monolayer. Using kp calculations, we demonstrate that the observed dependence of g-factors for different materials is well accounted for by hybridization of electronic states in the and valleys. The mixing of the valence and conduction band states induced by the interlayer interaction decreases the g-factor with increasing layer number.

The exciton-exciton interaction results in a resonance blue shift which lasts for the exciton lifetime (several ps), while the band gap renormalization manifests as a resonance red shift with several tens ps lifetime. Our model based on the many-body interactions for the nonlinear optical susceptibility fits well the experimental observations. The power dependence of the spectra shows that with the increase of pump power, the exciton population increases linearly and then saturates, while the free carrier density increases superlinearly, implying that exciton Auger recombination could be the origin of these free carriers. Our model demonstrates a simple but efficient method for quantitatively analyzing the spectra, and indicates the important role of Coulomb interactions in nonlinear optical responses of such 2D materials.",

However, a clear understanding of the growth mechanism is lacking for its wider industrial adoption on technologically relevant substrates such as SiO2. Here, we demonstrate a controllable growth method of thin, wafer scale h-BN films on arbitrary substrates. We also clarify the growth mechanism to be diffusion and surface segregation (D-SS) of boron (B) and nitrogen (N) in Ni and Co thin films on SiO2/Si substrates after exposure to diborane and ammonia precursors at high temperature. The segregation was found to be independent of the cooling rates employed in this report, and to our knowledge has not been found nor reported for 2D h-BN growth so far, and thus provides an important direction for controlled growth of h-BN. This unique segregation behavior is a result of a combined effect of high diffusivity, small film thickness and the inability to achieve extremely high cooling rates in CVD systems. The resulting D-SS h-BN films exhibit excellent electrical insulating behavior with an optical bandgap of about 5.8 eV. Moreover, graphene-on-h-BN field effect transistors using the as-grown D-SS h-BN films show a mobility of about 6000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.",

Here, we report a systematic Raman study of exfoliated semi-metallic WTe2 flakes with thickness ranging from few layers down to a single layer. A dramatic change in the Raman spectra occurs between the monolayer and few-layer WTe2 as a vibrational mode centered at ~86.9 cm−1 in the monolayer splits into two active modes at 82.9 and 89.6 cm−1 in the bilayer. Davydov splitting of these two modes is found in the bilayer, as further evidenced by polarized Raman measurements. Strong angular dependence of Raman modes on the WTe2 film thickness reflects that the existence of directional interlayer interaction, rather than isotropic van der Waals (vdw) coupling, is playing an essential role affecting the phonon modes, especially in anisotropic 2D WTe2 material. Therefore, the strong evolution of Raman modes with thickness and polarization direction, can not only be a reliable fingerprint for the determination of the thickness and the crystallographic orientation, but can also be an ideal probe for such strong and directional interlayer interaction.",

    "abstract": "The 2D graphdiyne has attracted much attention in spin-dependent physical properties recently due to its superior intrinsic semiconductor properties and greater paramagnetic moment compared with graphene. However, to date, no ferromagnetic ordering has been successfully induced into graphdiyne (GDY), which restricts its further application in electronics involving spin. Herein, we for the first time obtain the ferromagnetic graphdiyne based on transition metal ferrum (Fe) doping through a simple and affordable synthetic route. In particular, by means of chemical reduction with heat-treatment in the special carbon matrix of graphdiyne, a typical ferromagnetic curve with Tc above room temperature is observed in Fe/GDY hybrid, which can be attributed to the presence of low valence Fe ions. After annealing, the remanent magnetization of Fe/GDY increases and the coercive field reduces by an order of magnitude compared with the raw Fe/GDY hybrid even at 300 K, establishing the robust room temperature ferromagnetic characteristics. Subsequent spin-polarized DFT calculation further supports our conclusion that the observed ferromagnetism originates from the remarkable local magnetic moment as well as the electron transfer between carbon atoms and ferric ions. The coexistence of ferromagnetism and semiconductivity can not only promote exploration of new physical property of GDY but also develop spintronic devices based on carbon materials.",

This competition is the central issue of the crumpling transition, i.e., a transition between flat and crumpled phases. We show that anharmonicity-controlled fluctuations of a graphene membrane around equilibrium flat phase lead to unusual elastic properties. In particular, we demonstrate that stretching ξ of a flake of graphene is a nonlinear function of the applied tension at small tension: and for clean and strongly disordered graphene, respectively.

In fact, large scale growth of two-dimensional MoS2 and its conventional way of patterning for integrated devices have remained as one of the unresolved important issues.

Such properties are achieved via deposition of graphene on atomically flat layered talc, a natural and abundant dielectric crystal. Raman investigation shows a preferential charge accumulation on graphene-talc van der Waals heterostructures, which are investigated through the electronic properties of talc/graphene/hBN heterostructure devices. These heterostructures preserve graphene's good electronic quality, verified by the observation of quantum Hall effect at low magnetic fields (B = 0.4 T) at T = 4.2 K. In order to investigate the physical mechanisms behind graphene-on-talc p-type doping, we performed first-principles calculations of their interface structural and electronic properties. In addition to potentially improving solar cell efficiency, graphene doping via van der Waals stacking is also a promising route towards controlling the band gap opening in bilayer graphene, promoting a steady n or p type doping in graphene and, eventually, providing a new path to access superconducting states in graphene, predicted to exist only at very high doping.",

    "abstract": "Since the first realization of reversible charge doping in graphene via field-effect devices, it has become evident how the induction of a gap could further enhance its potential for technological applications. Here we show that the gap opening due to a sublattice symmetry breaking has also a profound impact on the polar response of graphene. By combining ab initio calculations and analytical modelling we show that for realistic band-gap values ( eV) the piezoelectric coefficient and the Born effective charge of graphene attain a giant value, independent on the gap. In particular the piezoelectric coefficient per layer of gapped mono- and bilayer graphene is three times larger than that of a large-gap full polar insulator as hexagonal Boron nitride (h-BN) monolayer, and 30% larger than that of a polar semiconductor as MoS2. This surprising result indicates that piezoelectric acoustic-phonons scattering can be relevant to model charge transport and charge-carrier relaxation in gated bilayer graphene. The independence of the piezoelectric coefficient and of the Born effective charge on the gap value follows from the connection between the polar response and the valley Chern number of gapped Dirac electrons, a relation previously identified for polar h-BN and made possible by the effective gauge-field description of the electron-lattice/strain coupling in these systems. In the small gap limit, where the adiabatic ab initio approximation fails, we implement analytically the calculation of the dynamical effective charge, and we establish a universal relation between the complex effective charge and the so-called Fano profile of the phonon optical peak. Our results provide a general theoretical framework to understand and compute the polar response in narrow-gap semiconductors, but may also be relevant for the contribution of piezoelectric scattering to the transport properties in Dirac-like systems.",

    "abstract": "We studied the nucleation and growth of hexagonal BN (h-BN) on AlN template on c-plane sapphire by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy as functions of growth temperature, deposition time, and triethylboron (TEB) partial pressure. A lateral growth rate of about 25 nm min−1 for h-BN nuclei was obtained by atomic force microscopy and a nucleation activation energy of 2.1 eV was extracted from the temperature dependence of the nucleation density. A large TEB flow rate strongly enhances the formation of h-BN nuclei. At a reduced TEB flow rate, we observed a significantly decreased nuclei density and a delay in nucleation due to TEB desorption. By fine tuning the growth parameters, single-crystalline multilayer h-BN was successfully formed on AlN surface, as confirmed by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The epitaxial relationship between h-BN and AlN was [0 0 0 1]h-BN || [0 0 0 1]AlN and [1 0 −1 0]h-BN || [1 1 −2 0]AlN from TEM and electron backscatter diffraction measurements. In addition, TEM showed that the initial h-BN layers are not parallel and tend to form half-domes. On those half-domes (cap-shaped-like) a 2D lateral growth sets on, resulting in a well-oriented 2D multilayer observed in TEM. Thus, the surface topography further develops to form a relatively flat surface without wrinkles and finally a typical hexagon-like wrinkled surface at thicker h-BN layers. Particularly, the small h-BN nuclei have dangling bonds at their periphery that can interact with the substrate, forming actual bonds with AlN. Hence the choice on the substrate is important, despite the basal planes of multilayer h-BN are bonded by a weak van der Waals force.",

We observe that on bare black phosphorus, the conductivity changes drastically over the whole surface within a day. We demonstrate that the degradation process is slowed down considerably by covering the material with a 10 nm layer of hafnium oxide. It is stable for more than a week, opening up a route towards stable black phosphorus devices in which the high dielectric constant of hafnium oxide can be exploited.

The crystallinity and morphology of the growth substrates usually play a crucial role in the CVD synthesis of high-quality monolayer MoS2, a kind of 2D layered material which has ignited huge interest in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and energy harvesting, etc. Herein, by utilizing a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) system, we demonstrate a regioselective synthesis of monolayer MoS2 on the corrugated single-crystal LaAlO3 (100) with twin crystal domains induced by the second-order phase transition. Unique dendritic morphologies with tunable nucleation densities were obtained in different regions of the undulated substrate, presenting a strong substrate modulation effect. Interestingly, the exposure of abundant active edge sites along with the rather high nucleation density makes the monolayer dendritic MoS2 a good electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), particularly featured by a rather high exchange current density (70.4 μA cm−2). Furthermore, uniform monolayer MoS2 films can also be obtained and transferred to arbitrary substrates. We believe that this work provides a new growth system for the controllable synthesis of 2D layered materials with unique dendritic morphologies, as well as its great application potential in energy conversion and harvesting.",

    "abstract": "The emerging physical phenomena found in transition metal dicalcogenides (TMDCs) have triggered vast investigations in recent years. Among them, nanoelectronics in WTe2 devices have attracted particular attentions due to its exotic band structure that leads to exciting phenomena such as the predicted type-II Weyl semimetallic state. However, the thickness dependence of its quantum transport properties in the two-dimensional limit remains under debate. The major missing ingredient in the previous studies is the aging-induced disorder, as atomically thin layers of TMDCs are often known to be metastable in the ambient atmosphere. Here, we show systematic performance of low temperature quantum electronic transport of few-layer WTe2. It is observed that aging-induced localized electronic states explains the low temperature Coulomb gap in transport measurements, leading to the anomalous magnetotransport which appears to be extrinsic. While few-layered WTe2 shows clear metallic tendency in the fresh state, degraded devices first exhibited a re-entrant insulating behavior, and finally entered a fully insulating state. Correspondingly, a crossover from parabolic to linear magnetoresistance, and, upon further aging, leads to the observation of weak anti-localization. Our study reveals for the first time the correlation between the unusual magnetotransport and disorder in few-layered WTe2, which is indispensable in providing guidance on its future device applications.",

    "abstract": "Recently, two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have drawn much attention due to their unique atomic and electronic properties. Among 2D layered materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) display metallic or semiconducting properties depending on the structural phase. In particular, MoS2, which is one such TMD, has the most stable structure in the trigonal prismatic phase with a sizable band gap of about 1.8 eV. To utilize this semiconducting property and take advantage of the nature of metal–MoS2 contacts, many efforts have been made to employ MoS2 in electronic devices such as field-effect transistors. Despite various studies of metal–MoS2 contacts, however, understanding of the contact behavior between ferromagnetic metals and MoS2 is insufficient. Additionally, we need to understand the contact nature between metals and various TMDs for various applications. Here, we report on ferromagnetic contacts between Ni(1 1 1) and MoX2 (X = S, Se, or Te) with first-principles calculations. In particular, we study the different electronic and spin properties at Ni–MoX2 interfaces, depending on the type of chalcogen atoms. Our calculations show that the Fermi level is not simply aligned by the work function difference between Ni(1 1 1) and MoX2, representing the Fermi-level pinning occurring at metal–semiconductor interfaces, and that Schottky barrier types are varied depending on MoX2. Interestingly, spin splitting occurs at the conduction band offset or valence band offset, depending on the X type in the MoX2, and a spin magnetic moment is induced on MoX2 by Ni(1 1 1) due to the ferromagnetic nature of Ni.",

Here, we show the great potential of 2D halide perovskite sheets (C4H9NH3)2PbX4 (X = Cl, Br and I) that were synthesized recently (Dou et al 2015 Science 349 1518–21) as the channel materials contacting with graphene and other 2D metallic sheets to form van der Waals heterostructures for field effect transistor (FET). Based on state-of-the-art theoretical simulations, we show that the intrinsic properties of the 2D halide perovskites are preserved in the heterojunction, which is different from the conventional contact with metal surfaces. The 2D halide perovskites form a p-type Schottky barrier (Φh) contact with graphene, where tunneling barrier exists, and a negative band bending occurs at the lateral interface. We demonstrate that the Schottky barrier can be turned from p-type to n-type by doping graphene with nitrogen atoms, and a low-Φh or an Ohmic contact can be realized by doping graphene with boron atoms or replacing graphene with other high-work-function 2D metallic sheets such as ZT-MoS2, ZT-MoSe2 and H-NbS2. This study not only predicts a 2D halide perovskite-based FETs, but also enhances the understanding of tuning Schottky barrier height in device applications.",

In contrast, intercalation of hydrogen between h-BN and the Ni(1 1 1) substrate occurs for high exposures. For intermediate regimes, a mixture of intercalation and hydrogenation is observed. From temperature-programmed desorption and temperature-programmed XPS experiments, we conclude that the hydrogen covalently bound to h-BN is rather stable with a desorption temperature of 600 K, while intercalated hydrogen is desorbing already at 390 K.

Here, we investigate a direct growth process for the fabrication of insulating hexagonal boron nitride on high quality epitaxial graphene using plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Samples were grown at varying temperatures and times and studied using atomic force microscopy, revealing a growth process limited by desorption at high temperatures. Nucleation was mostly commencing from morphological defects in epitaxial graphene, such as step edges or wrinkles.

Sheet conductivity of Langmuir–Blodgett assembled multi-layer graphene films is enhanced through doping with nitric acid, leading to a fivefold improvement while retaining the same transparency as un-doped films. Sheet resistivity of such chemically improved films reaches 10 , with optical transmittance 78% in the visible. When the films are encapsulated, the enhanced sheet conductivity effect is stable in time. In addition, stacking of multiple layers, as well as the dependence of the sheet resistivity upon axial strain have been investigated.",

The two-dimensional nature of these materials enables facile integration for vertical device design with novel properties. Here, we report highly efficient photocurrent generation from vertical MoS2 devices fabricated using asymmetric metal contacts, exhibiting an external quantum efficiency of up to 7%. Compared to in-plane MoS2 devices, the vertical design of these devices has a much larger junction area, which is essential for achieving highly efficient photovoltaic devices. Photocurrent and photovoltage spectra are measured over the photon energy range from 1.25 to 2.5 eV, covering both the 1.8 eV direct K-point optical transition and the 1.3 eV Σ-point indirect transition in MoS2. Photocurrent peaks corresponding to both direct and indirect transitions are observed in the photocurrent spectra and exhibit different photovoltage–current characteristics. Compared to previous in-plane devices, a substantially shorter photoresponse time of 7.3 μs is achieved due to fast carrier sweeping in the vertical devices, which exhibit a −3 dB cutoff frequency of 48 kHz.",

    "abstract": "Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) mechanically exfoliated from bulk crystals have exceptional mechanical and optical properties. They are extremely flexible, sustaining mechanical strain of about 10% without breaking. Their optical properties dramatically change with applied strain. However, the fabrication of a large number of mechanical devices is tedious due to the micromechanical exfoliation process. Alternatively, monolayers can be grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on the wafer scale, with the drawback of cracks and grain boundaries in the material. Therefore, it is important to investigate the mechanical properties of CVD-grown material and its potential as a material for mass production of nanomechanical devices. Here, we measure the optical absorption of CVD-grown MoS2 monolayers with applied uniaxial tensile strain. We derive a strain-dependent shift for the A exciton of −42 meV/%. This value is identical to MoS2 monolayers, which are mechanically exfoliated from natural molybdenite crystals. Using angle-resolved second-harmonic generation spectroscopy, we find that the applied uniaxial tensile strain is fully transferred across grain boundaries of the CVD-grown monolayer. Our work demonstrates that large-area artificially grown MoS2 monolayers are promising for mass-produced nanomechanical devices.",

    "abstract": "Strain and defects in graphene have critical impact on morphology and properties of graphene. Here we report equi-biaxial compressive strain in monolayer graphene on SiO2 and Si3N4 substrates induced by thermal cycling in vacuum. The equi-biaxial strain is attributed to the mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion between graphene and the substrate and sliding of graphene on the substrate. The sliding occurs during heating at the temperatures of 390 and 360 K for graphene on SiO2 and Si3N4 substrates, respectively. The biaxial Grüneisen parameter is determined to be 1.95 and 3.15 for G and 2D Raman bands of graphene, respectively. As the heating temperature exceeds a threshold temperature (1040 K for graphene/SiO2 and 640 K for graphene/Si3N4), buckling ridges are observed in graphene after the thermal cycle, from which the biaxial buckling strain of graphene on SiO2 and Si3N4 substrates are obtained as 0.21% and 0.22%, respectively. Importantly, the induced buckling ridges in graphene exhibit a pattern representing the symmetry of graphene crystal structure, which indicates that graphene relieves the compressive stress mainly along its lattice symmetry directions. These thermally induced graphene ridges are also found reminiscent of those in the synthesized graphene, suggesting the same origin of formation of the buckling ridges under biaxial compression.",

High-quality monolayer h-BN with mean grain sizes ranging from ~7 µm to ~19 nm were successfully synthesized on Pt foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The thermal conductivity (κ) of the single-crystalline h-BN was measured to be ~545 Wm−1 K−1 at 315K, well above the bulk value, and more than a factor of four higher than the value of poly-crystalline h-BN with mean grain size of ~19 nm. The very low thermal boundary conductance (deduced to be ~9.6 GW m−2 K−1) accounts for the significant reduction of κ for h-BN with small grain size. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that due to the disordered vibrations of atoms along/near GB, the phonon scattering in poly-crystalline h-BN is greatly enhanced compared to large-grained or single-crystalline samples. These results provide a deep understanding of the thermal transport in two-dimensional systems as well as the possible technological applications.",

It is shown that, whereas calculations employing the semi-local functional PBE favor the undistorted structure, the hybrid functional HSE06 correctly predicts a distortion. The study suggests that the magnitude of the semi-metallic overlap between the valence band top at and the conduction band bottom at is a key factor controlling the tendency towards the distortion. It is also shown that tensile strain stabilizes a CDW, and we suggest that this fact could be further used to induce the instability in double-layers of TiTe, which in the absence of strain remain undistorted in the experiment. The driving force for the CDW instability seems to be the same phonon mediated mechanism acting for single-layer TiSe, although in single-layer TiTe the driving force is smaller, and the semimetallic character is kept below the transition temperature.",

    "abstract": "A novel concept of membrane process in a thermal-driven system is proposed for water desalination. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we show fast water transport through graphene galleries at a temperature gradient. Water molecules are driven to migrate through nanometer-wide graphene channels from cold reservoir to hot reservoir by the effect of thermal creep flow. Reducing the interlayer spacing to 6.5 Å, an abrupt escalation occurs in water permeation between angstrom-distance graphene slabs. A change from disordered bulklike water to quasi-square structure has been found under this extremely confined condition. This leads to a transition to subcontinuum transport. Water molecules perform collective diffusion behaviors inside graphene channels. The special transport processes with structure change convert thermal energy into motion without dissipation, resulting in unexpectedly high water permeability. The thermal-driven system reaches maximum flowrate at temperature variance of 80 K, corresponding to the quantity at pressure difference up to 105 bar in commercial reverse osmosis processes and 230 bar in pressure-driven slip flow. Our results also reveal the movement of saline ions influenced by thermophoretic effect, which complements the geometry limitation at greater layer spacing, enhancing the blockage of ions. This finding aims to provide an innovational idea of developing a high-efficiency desalination technology able to utilize various forms of energy.",

We demonstrate that the design least susceptible to the disorder corresponds to the weak coupling regime (opposite to tight binding) which is realised via a system of quantum anti-dots. The most relevant type of disorder is the area disorder which is a random variation of areas of quantum anti-dots. The area disorder results in the formation of puddles. Other types of disorder, the position disorder and the shape disorder, are practically irrelevant. The formation/importance of puddles dramatically depends on the parameters of the nanopatterned heterostructure. A variation of the parameters by 20–30% can change the relative amplitude of puddles by orders of magnitude. Based on this analysis we formulate criteria for the acceptable design of the heterostructure aimed at the creation of the artificial graphene.",

Here, we precisely monitor the evolution of electronic states using time-resolved ARPES at a photon energy of 6.3 eV. The probing depth of laser-based ARPES is long enough to observe the buried electronic states originating from the valence band maximum. Our data shows that the band gap has a maximal value of 0.32 eV in the pristine sample, and that it shrinks down monotonically by increasing the carrier concentration in the topmost layer. Most interestingly, the band velocity of the valence band increases by a factor of two along the armchair direction, surpassing the value reported in graphene on silicon carbide (SiC). This control of band structure via external gating will be of interest with regard to the design of optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Device performance of two dimensional (2D) material based field effect transistors is severely limited by the relatively high contact resistance encountered at the contact-channel interface. Metal-graphene hybrid contacts have been previously used to improve the contact resistance of devices based on thick exfoliated materials. Here we report a novel 2D FET fabrication process entailing the transfer of metal-graphene hybrid contacts on top of 3 monolayer-thick chemical vapor deposition (CVD) MoS 2 , enabling a lithography free contacting strategy, with respect to MoS 2 . Three different metal-graphene stacks consisting of Ni, Pd and Ru, have been fabricated, transferred onto MoS 2 and characterized extensively using electrical and physical characterization techniques. We find strong correlation between the measured electrical characteristics and physical characterization of the contact interface. From Raman spectra measurement, maximum charge transfer of 1.7 × 10 13 cm −2 is observed between graphene and Ru, leading to an improved contact resistance for MoS 2 devices with Ru-Gr contacts. Ru-Gr contact shows the lowest contact resistance of 9.34 kΩ · µ m among the three metal-graphene contact stacks reported in this article. This contact resistance is also the best among reported CVD grown graphene contacted MoS 2 devices. Using more than 400 devices, we study the impact of the different metal-graphene contacts on other electrical parameters such as hysteresis, sub-threshold swing and threshold voltage. The metal-graphene contact stack transfer technique represents a technologically relevant contacting approach which can be further up-scaled to larger wafer areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The rise of human–machine interaction and the internet of things technology requires the development of functionalized sensors that are mechanically flexible and fabulously wearable. Therefore, the emergence of new materials and devices is particularly important for technology design and development. Graphene has the atomically level thickness, mechanical flexibility, lightweights, and high conductivity and transparency. Especially, the large specific area of graphene enables the perception of external stimuli with high sensitivity, which is expected to be used in flexible sensor technology. In this review, we will introduce the research progress of graphene in flexible physical signal sensors, including the device structure design and the applications of these devices in wearable technology. We will overview the development of new directions of sensors, such as miniaturization, intelligence, and multi-modal. We will also focus on the latest technical progress of related sensing devices and point out the challenges and directions of future development of wearable sensors.",

The measured weak localization agrees well with the Hikami–Larkin–Nagaoka model and the extracted phase coherence length of 104 nm at 350 mK, decreasing as ∼T−0.513+−0.053 with increased temperature. Weak localization measurement allows us to qualitatively probe the temperature-dependent phase coherence time τϕ, which is in agreement with the theory of carrier interaction in the diffusive regime.

Recently discovered analogues of phosphorene, group-IV monochalcogenides (MX with M = Ge, Sn and X = S, Se, Te), display several interesting phenomena intimately related to the in-plane strain, such as giant piezoelectricity and multiferroicity, which combine ferroelastic and ferroelectric properties. Here, using calculations from first principles, we reveal for the first time giant intrinsic spin Hall conductivities (SHC) in these materials. In particular, we show that the SHC resonances can be easily tuned by combination of strain and doping and, in some cases, strain can be used to induce semiconductor to metal transitions that make a giant spin Hall effect possible even in absence of doping. Our results indicate a new route for the design of highly tunable spintronics devices based on two-dimensional materials.",

It can also be agreed, that when it comes to reality, one should not refer just to Graphene but 'Graphenes' as each synthesis method renders a material characterized by different properties. Recently, Graphene and other 2D materials scalable synthesis methods have provided improved materials at highly competitive costs. However, a long way is ahead to approach the properties of mechanically exfoliated materials. Also, as a scalable method succeeds and it is indeed upscaled for industrial production, new characterization protocols and metrics have to be devised to enable efficient on line quality control of the produced materials. Significant advances can be reported recently in the synthesis of high quality graphene although a shift towards other 2D materials research is clearly observed. An overview of the progress made by several groups in WP ' Materials' of the Graphene Flagship is given.",

In this paper, we decouple the effect of tensile strain with those of other interfacial interactions, and studying the corresponding electronic structure and superconducting gap behavior through in-situ angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy. By growing single-layer FeSe/Nb:SrTiO3/LaAlO3 heterostructures with varied thicknesses of Nb:SrTiO3 films, the tensile strain on FeSe is controlled from 0.6% to 3.7% while preserving other interfacial interactions as in single-layer FeSe grown on Nb:SrTiO3 substrate. The electronic correlation strength is weakened with reduced tensile strain. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is positively correlated with the tensile strain in single-layer FeSe/Nb:SrTiO3 when the film morphology is well ordered. Remarkably, the Tc remains 55 K in single-layer FeSe with negligible tensile strain. These results help to reveal the effect of tensile strain on the enhanced superconductivity in single-layer FeSe/Nb:SrTiO3.",

Theory predicts exceptional electronic properties, including Dirac fermions and a topological spin Hall insulator phase. An important obstacle impeding exploration of such properties in electronic devices is the chemical sensitivity of silicene, hampering its incorporation in layer stacks. Here we show experimentally that epitaxial silicene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) can be stacked without perturbing the electronic properties of silicene. Intercalated silicene underneath epitaxial h-BN on ZrB2(0 0 0 1) substrate films is obtained by depositing Si atoms at room temperature. Using (angle resolved) photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES, PES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we find that the intercalated silicene exhibits the same electronic properties as epitaxial silicene on ZrB2, while it resists oxidation in air up to several hours. This is an essential step towards the development of layer stacks that allow for fabrication of devices.",

The spin-lifetime systematically presents a marked minimum at the charge neutrality point, as typically observed in pristine exfoliated graphene. However, by studying the carrier density dependence beyond n ~ 5 × 1012 cm−2, via electrostatic gating, it is found that the spin lifetime reaches a maximum and then starts decreasing, a behavior that is reminiscent of that predicted when the spin-relaxation is driven by spin–orbit interaction. The spin lifetimes and relaxation lengths compare well with state-of-the-art results using exfoliated graphene on SiO2/Si, being a factor two-to-three larger than the best values reported at room temperature using the same substrate. As a result, the spin signal can be readily measured across 30 µm long graphene channels. These observations indicate that Pt-CVD graphene is a promising material for large-scale spin-based logic-in-memory applications.",

Each new 2D material demonstrated unusual physical properties offering a large flexibility in their tailoring for high-tech applications. Here, we report on the formation and characterization of an uncharted 2D material: ‘Cu 2 Te alloy monolayer on Cu(111) surface’. We have successfully grown a 2D binary Te-Cu alloy using a straightforward approach based on chemical deposition method. Low electron energy diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results reveal the existence of a well-ordered alloy monolayer characterized by (√3 × √3)R30° superstructure, while the x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicate the presence of single chemical environment of the Te atoms associated with the Te-Cu bonding. Analysis of the valence band properties by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES); in particular the electronic states close to the Fermi level suggests a strong hybridization between Te and Cu electronic states leading to an appearance of new dispersive bands localized at the surface alloy, which is confirmed by first-principles calculations. These bands are strongly influenced by the surface reconstruction and undergo a back-folding at the boundaries of the reduced surface Brillouin zone (SBZ). More interesting, a band gap of about 0.91 eV and a Rashba splitting in the conduction band are obtained. These findings taken together clearly prove the presence of 2D-type electron system within the Cu 2 Te alloy layer, which is promising for spintronic application.",

Moreover, we include an important mass content parameter which is essential to separate otherwise statistically identical graphene-rich from graphite-rich samples.

    "abstract": "Abstract Integration of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) into lateral heterostructures has drawn focus due to the ability to broadly engineer the material properties. Hybrid monolayers with tuneable bandgaps have been reported, while the interface itself possesses unique electronic and magnetic qualities. Herein, we demonstrate lateral heteroepitaxial growth of graphene and hBN by sequential growth using high-temperature molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). We find, using scanning probe microscopy, that graphene growth nucleates at hBN step edges and grows across the surface to form nanoribbons with a controlled width that is highly uniform across the surface. The graphene nanoribbons grow conformally from the armchair edges of hexagonal hBN islands forming multiply connected regions with the growth front alternating from armchair to zigzag in regions nucleated close to the vertices of hexagonal hBN islands. Images with lattice resolution confirm a lateral epitaxial alignment between the hBN and graphene nanoribbons, while the presence of a moiré pattern within the ribbons indicates that some strain relief occurs at the lateral heterojunction. These results demonstrate that high temperature MBE is a viable route towards integrating graphene and hBN in lateral heterostructures.",

    "abstract": "Analogue gravitational systems are becoming an increasing popular way of studying the behaviour of quantum systems in curved spacetime. Setups based on ultracold quantum gases in particular, have been recently harnessed to explore the thermal nature of Hawking's and Unruh's radiation that was theoretically predicted almost 50 years ago. For solid state implementations, a promising system is graphene, in which a link between the Dirac-like low-energy electronic excitations and relativistic quantum field theories has been unveiled soon after its discovery. This link could be extended to the case of curved quantum field theory when the graphene sheet is shaped in a surface of constant negative curvature, known as Beltrami's pseudosphere. Here we provide numerical evidence that energetically stable negative curvature graphene surfaces can be realized. Owing to large-scale simulations, our geometrical realizations are characterized by a ratio between the carbon–carbon bond length and the pseudosphere radius small enough to allow the formation of an analog of a black hole event horizon. Additionally, from the energy dependence of the spatially resolved density of states, we infer some thermal properties of the corresponding gravitational system, which could be investigated using low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy or optical near field spectroscopy. These findings pave the way to the realization of a solid-state system in which the curved spacetime dynamics of quantum many body systems can be investigated.",

First of all, this new approach is shown to give the correct magnetic properties of both bulk and two-dimensional limit of VSe2 which demonstrates its superiority to the conventional methods. The results demonstrate that monolayer VSe2 without charge density waves is a ferromagnet with ordering temperature of 250 K. From the direct simulation of temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility and ordered moment, it is shown that its ferromagnetism is clearly two-dimensional in nature. Further, it is shown that this ferromagnetic order is vulnerable to extra charge dopings which provides the important insight to elucidate recent experimental controversies.",

Here we show that Ti 3 C 2 T x —the most studied compound of the MXene family—is a good acid catalyst, thanks to the surface acid functionalities. We demonstrate this by applying Ti 3 C 2 T x in the epoxide ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide (SO) and its isomerization in the liquid phase. Modifying the MXene surface changes the catalytic activity and selectivity. By oxidizing the surface, we succeeded in controlling the type and number of acid sites and thereby improving the yield of the mono-alkylated product to &gt;80%. Characterisation studies show that a thin oxide layer, which forms directly on the Ti 3 C 2 T x surface, is essential for catalysing the SO ring-opening. We hypothesize that two kinds of acid sites are responsible for this catalysis: In the MXene, strong acid sites (both Lewis and Brønsted) catalyse both the ring-opening and the isomerization reactions, while in the Mxene–TiO 2 composite weaker acid sites catalyse only the ring-opening reaction, increasing the selectivity to the mono-alkylated product.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) have recently become some of the most studied nano-materials due to their wide array of technological and industrial applications. Among these, they display great potential as solid lubricants. Friction properties of 2D-materials, however, are very sensitive to environmental conditions, e.g. humidity. In MoS 2 , for instance, humidity can hamper its tribologic performances. Past experiments and recent ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations have highlighted that, at ordinary temperatures, a possible reason for lower lubricity is the physical interaction of water with the layers. It is, therefore, crucial to better understand the microscopic mechanisms underlying this behaviour, in order to optimise the lubrication performance of these materials. In this paper we used density functional theory simulations and classical molecular dynamics simulations to provide a multi-scale description of how external load affects the energetic, structural and dynamic properties of intercalated water between MoS 2 layers. As a result of combining these two different approaches, we provide an atomistic description of the role of intercalated water in modifying the frictional behaviour of physically interacting layers, e.g. MoS 2 . The identified interlocking mechanism, which is enhanced under load, is relevant for understanding the frictional effects observed for water confined in slit nanopores, and for nanofluidics applications.",

In this study, we demonstrate an efficient synthesis of PdTe2 and PtTe2 MLs Large-area and high quality MLs of PdTe2 and patterned PtTe2 were epitaxially grown on the Pd(111) and Pt(111) surfaces by direct telurization in ultra-high vacuum.

PdTe2 ML demonstrated high thermal stability showing no decomposition sign after annealing at 470 °C. A well-ordered (2 × 2) PtTe2 structure with Kagome lattice was observed on Te/Pt(111) surface following annealing at 200 °C in UHV, where the (2 × 2) pattern was formed by Te atom vacancies. PtTe2 multilayer film was prepared as well, and it demonstrated the excitation of the Dirac plasmons as measured by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, researchers have explored the interlayer stacking structure of the bilayer (BL) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and found that it has unique impact on the electrical, optical, and vibrational properties of TMDCs. Unfortunately, the size of BL TMDCs synthesized by the pre-existing methods is not large. In addition, there is not any effective mean to control the number of layers as well as the stack structure. This is the major limiting factor for further exploration of the properties of BL TMDCs. We report a new method for the rapid and controllable growth of AB-stacked BL MoS 2 . Firstly, the mixed solution of Na 2 MoO 4 and NaOH was spun on the sapphire substrate and then sulfurated. The BL MoS 2 of AB-stacked can be obtained by changing the time of sulfur introduction. The size of the BL MoS 2 is related to the parameters of sulfur. The maximum size of BL MoS 2 grown by this method can reach 288 μ m, and the average size can reach about 200 μ m, which is larger than the size reported in most articles. In addition, the growth rate of BL MoS 2 can be clearly increased by the spin-coating growth method and the fastest growth rate is up to 144 μ m min −1 , which is far higher than other published reports at present. Subsequently, a photodetector based on BL MoS 2 was prepared. The response time of rising edge is about 0.32 ms, and that of falling edge is about 3.2 ms. The detector prepared by us shows excellent photoelectric detection performance. Therefore, the excellent performance of BL MoS 2 makes it have a broad application prospect in the field of high-performance electronics and optoelectronics.",

Here, we report the anisotropic refractive index and extinction coefficient dispersions of BP in the visible and near infrared range of 540–1500 nm, and then characterize optical phase retardation in a BP flake. Cauchy absorbent equations are provided for the refractive index dispersions along both armchair and zigzag directions, which well reproduce the experimentally measured reflectance and transmittance contrast spectra of BP flakes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a linear polarized light through BP becomes elliptical, a finding that agrees well with simulation results using the obtained anisotropic refractive index dispersions.

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding spin physics in graphene is crucial for developing future two-dimensional spintronic devices. Recent studies show that efficient spin-to-charge conversions (SCCs) via either the inverse spin Hall effect or the inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect (IREE) can be achieved in graphene by proximity with an adjacent spin–orbit coupling (SOC) material. Lateral spin valve devices, made up of a graphene Hall bar and ferromagnets, are best suited for such studies. Here, we report that signals mimicking the IREE can be measured in pristine graphene possessing negligible SOC, confirming that these signals are unrelated to SCC. We identify either the anomalous Hall effect in the ferromagnet or the ordinary Hall effect in graphene induced by stray fields as the possible sources of this artefact. By quantitatively comparing these options with finite-element-method simulations, we conclude the latter better explains our results. Our study deepens the understanding of SCC measurement schemes in graphene, which should be taken into account when designing future experiments.",

Here, the directional etching of transitional metal nano-particles (NPs) on the surface of h BN to produce nano-trenches with sharp edges was systematic investigated. It is found that, only Pt and Ir NPs can produce armchair-oriented nano-trenches at low H 2 partial pressure, while other transitional metals lead to zigzag oriented nano-trenches. The density and width of the nano-trenches always increase with etching temperature and the pre-treated solution concentration while the trench orientation depends on both H 2 partial pressure and etching temperature. The aspect ratio of nano-trenches may reach several thousand under optimized conditions. The method exhibited here shines a light on edge-selective patterning of 2D crystals.",

Low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) could be an effective way to synthesize large area 2D PdSe 2 materials at low growth temperatures creating new opportunities for the widescale applications of PdSe 2 . Here, we report LPCVD growth of PdSe 2 for the first time at a growth temperature down to 250 °C, which is significantly lower than what was previously reported. The 2 nm Pd films became 8 nm PdSe 2 after selenization in the temperature range of 250 °C–375 °C and no thickness variation with growth temperature was observed in our atomic force microscopy study. Raman study showed narrowing of PdSe 2 related peaks with increasing growth temperature suggesting improved structural quality of the films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study confirmed complete selenization of the thin films to the lowest growth temperature of 250 °C. Electrical transport properties study showed resistance of the devices decrease with increasing growth temperature possibly due to the improvement of crystallinity. We also found that the devices show p-type behavior with mobilities up to 1 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . The good electrical quality of the film was further confirmed by demonstrating its application in fabricating PdSe 2 /MoSe 2 vertical heterojunction which showed rectification behavior with a rectification ratio of up to 232. Kelvin probe force microscopy confirmed that the rectification behavior was originated from the work function difference of 0.76 eV between MoSe 2 and PdSe 2 .",

Also, unlike many 2D ferroelectrics, CIPS is a wide band gap semiconductor, well suited for use as a gate in field-effect transistors (FETs). Here, we report on a hybrid FET in which the graphene conducting channel is gated through a CIPS layer. We reveal hysteresis effects in the transfer characteristics of the FET, which are sensitive to the gate voltage, temperature and light illumination. We demonstrate charge transfer at the CIPS/graphene interface in the dark and under light illumination. In particular, light induces a photodoping effect in graphene that varies from n - to p -type with increasing temperature. These hybrid FETs open up opportunities for electrically and optically controlled memristive devices.",

However, their mechanism is still poorly figured out. Currently, Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene suffers from low photoresponsivity, high overpotential, and low sensitivity in such important applications. In order to develop catalytic activity and performances of those devices, modifications must be made to the structure of MXenes to enhance the separation of photogenerated charges, rate of the H + /e − couplings, and surface-active sites. These manipulations of MXenes heavily depend on understanding the mechanism of devices, appropriate modification elements, and the method of modification. This study for the first time reveals a facile solid-state annealing strategy for doping semi-metallic selenium (Se) atoms on Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene for self-powered PEC-type photodetector, HER, and vapor sensor applications. The suitable characteristics of Ti 3 C 2 T x make it an appropriate substrate to accommodate Se atoms. The well-designed Se-doped Ti 3 C 2 heterojunction including some TiO 2 cuboids could exhibit unprecedented photoresponsivity (up to 90 mA W −1 ) and detectivity (up to 2.0 × 10 8 cm Hz 1/2 W −1 ) for 420 nm light, HER (−0.7 V at 10 mA cm −2 ), and gas sensitivity (Z′ = 347 Ω and Z′′ = 150 Ω, for ethanol) in comparison with the pristine Ti 3 C 2 T x nanosheets. The acquired promising results can be promoted with some other elements and also be examined in other electrolytes. Then, bring inspiration to the applications involving charge transfer, H + /e − couplings, and surface-active sites.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Porous MXene-polymer composites have gained attention due to their low density, large surface area, and high electrical conductivity, which can be used in applications such as electromagnetic interference shielding, sensing, energy storage, and catalysis. High internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) can be used to template the synthesis of porous polymer structures, and when solid particles are used as the interfacial agent, composites with pores lined with the particles can be realized. Here, we report a simple and scalable method to prepare conductive porous MXene/polyacrylamide structures via polymerization of the continuous phase in oil/water HIPEs. The HIPEs are stabilized by salt flocculated Ti 3 C 2 T x nanosheets, without the use of a co-surfactant. After polymerization, the polyHIPE structure consists of porous polymer struts and pores lined with Ti 3 C 2 T x nanosheets, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The pore size can be tuned by varying the Ti 3 C 2 T x concentration, and the interconnected Ti 3 C 2 T x network allows for electrical percolation at low Ti 3 C 2 T x loading; further, the electrical conductivity is stable for months indicating that in these composites, the nanosheets are stable to oxidation at ambient conditions. The polyHIPEs also exhibit rapid radio frequency heating at low power (10 °C s −1 at 1 W). This work demonstrates a simple approach to accessing electrically conductive porous MXene/polymer composites with tunable pore morphology and good oxidation stability of the nanosheets.",

Here we report a theoretical prediction that such phenomena can be realized in two-dimensional (2D) bilayer FE/PMM and trilayer FE/PMM/FE heterostructures (two-terminal and three-terminal devices), where FE is a 2D ferroelectric and PMM is a polar magnetic metal with strong spin–orbit coupling. Such a PMM has strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) that can generate skyrmions, while the FE can generate strong magnetoelectric coupling through polarization-polarization interactions. In trilayer heterostructures, contact to the metallic PMM layer enables multiple polarization configurations for electric-field control of skyrmions. We report density-functional-theory calculations for particular material choices that demonstrate the effectiveness of these arrangements, with the key driver being the polarization-polarization interactions between the PMM and FE layers. The present findings provide a method to achieve strong magnetoelectric coupling in the 2D limit and a new perspective for the design of related spintronics.",

Here we report the observation of LMR in layered kagome superconductor and CDW material CsV 3 Sb 5 thin flakes, as well as the dimensional crossover and temperature ( T ) crossover of such LMR. Specifically, in ultrathin CsV 3 Sb 5 crystals, the magnetoresistance (MR) exhibits a crossover from LMR at low T to quadratic B dependence above the CDW transition temperature; the MR also exhibits a crossover from LMR to sublinear MR for sample thickness at around ∼20 nm at low T .

In order to obtain sufficiently large quantities of high-quality material, a knowledge-based optimization strategy for the synthesis process must be developed. A major problem that has not yet been considered is the degradation of materials by etching during synthesis due to the high growth temperatures. To address this problem, we introduce a mathematical model that accounts for both growth and, for the first time, etching to describe the synthesis of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. We consider several experimental observations that lead to a differential equation based on several terms corresponding to different supply mechanisms, describing the time-dependent change in flake size. By solving this equation and fitting two independently obtained experimental data sets, we find that the flake area is the leading term in our model. We show that the differential equation can be solved analytically when only this term is considered, and that this solution provides a general description of complex growth and shrinkage phenomena. Physically, the dominance suggests that the supply of material via the flake itself contributes most to its net growth. This finding also implies a predominant interplay between insertion and release of atoms and their motion in the form of a highly dynamic process within the flake. In contrast to previous assumptions, we show that the flake edges do not play an important role in the actual size change of the two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide flakes during chemical vapour deposition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transition metal carbides or nitrides, collectively known as MXenes, are burgeoning two-dimensional materials for energy conversion and storage. The surface chemistry of MXenes could be specially tuned by the modified surface terminations, which directly influences their physicochemical properties. However, the in-depth study and understanding of the specific microstructure and the influence on the electrochemical performance of these terminations remain lacking. Herein, we present an accordion layered Ti 2 NT x MXene with –Cl and –O terminations obtained from copper chloride molten salt etching at a relatively low temperature. X-ray absorption fine structure and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal the formation of Ti–Cl and Ti–O bonds on the surface of Ti 2 NT x MXene. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that the surface terminations tend to be replaced by –O terminations after Ti–Cl decoration, which implies promising lithium-ion storage performance due to the high lithium affinity of –O terminations. As a result, the Ti 2 NT x MXene based electrode delivers a high reversible capacity (303.4 mAh g −1 at 100 mA g −1 ), stable cycling capability (1200 cycles without capacity attenuation), and fast Li + storage (52% capacity retention at 32 C).

Presented works to create moiré patterns have been focused on a twist embedded inside channel materials or between channel and substrate. However, the effects of a twist inside the substrate materials on the unaligned channel materials are much less explored. In this work, we report the realization of superlattice multi-Dirac cones with the coexistence of the main Dirac cone in a monolayer graphene (MLG) on a ∼0.14° twisted double-layer boron nitride (tBN) substrate. Transport measurements reveal the emergence of three pairs of superlattice Dirac points around the pristine Dirac cone, featuring multiple metallic or insulating states surrounding the charge neutrality point. Displacement field tunable and electron–hole asymmetric Fermi velocities are indicated from temperature dependent measurements, along with the gapless dispersion of superlattice Dirac cones. The experimental observation of multiple Dirac cones in MLG/tBN heterostructure is supported by band structure calculations employing a periodic moiré potential.

The reduction of the (002) x-ray diffraction peak and the transparent scanning electron microscope image are used to characterize the exfoliation. The thickness of exfoliated graphene layers is measured using an atomic force microscope. Turbostratic nature (twist) in graphene is identified based on the appearance of three Raman combination bands (TS 1 , TS 2 , and TS 3 ) between 1800 cm −1 and 2300 cm −1 . The twist between the layers is precisely measured using selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and the turbostratic nature is confirmed by observing a moiré pattern utilizing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The produced turbostratic graphene exhibited large variability in twist angles (2°–30°) with a visible moiré pattern. The high crystalline quality and clean interface between single layers of graphene were confirmed by the moiré pattern and SAED. Later, we demonstrated the mechanism underlying the twist in our exfoliated graphene, which could open the way for the production of high-quality turbostratic graphene with clean interfaces.",

Due to its unique physical and chemical properties, BP has shown considerable potential in many applications, such as field-effect transistors, energy storage and conversion, and photocatalysis. However, low-dimensional BP is easily corroded by oxygen and water owing to the large specific surface area and unbonded lone pair electrons on the surface, which reduces its chemical stability in the environment. As a result, different passivation approaches, relying on noncovalent bonding, covalent functionalization, and surface coordination, are employed to enhance the stability and performance of BP. In this review, the degradation mechanisms of BP are first analyzed for the material in both its ground state and excited state. Subsequently, the promising strategies for improving stability are overviewed. A comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the oxidation mechanisms and protection strategies of BP will provide guidance for the large-scale applications of BP and its derivatives.",

Here, we demonstrate the doping of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) via charge transfer from an adsorbed layer of Cs atoms with sub-monolayer coverage. The electronic structure of the graphene is analyzed using x-ray and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. In H-intercalated, quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene (QFMLG), the Dirac point can be tuned continuously from p-type to strong n-type doping. For strong n-type doping, analysis of the core level binding energies implies a deviation from a rigid band shift. This might be explained by an increased screening of the atomic core potential due to the higher number of charge carriers per C atom in the graphene layer. Furthermore, charge transfer into the SiC substrate leads to a change in band bending at the SiC/QFMLG interface, which saturates into a flat band scenario at higher Cs coverage. An analysis of the Fermi surfaces suggests an increasing electron-phonon-coupling in strongly doped QFMLG. In monolayer graphene (MLG), which is intrinsically n-type doped due to the presence of the buffer layer at the SiC interface, n-type doping can be enhanced by Cs evaporation in a similar fashion. In contrast to QFMLG, core level spectra and Dirac cone position in MLG apparently show a rigid band shift even for very high doping, emphasizing the importance of the substrate.",

Our analysis indicates that the dipolar interaction is largely enhanced by 2D dielectric screening at an inter-exciton separation of several nanometers or larger. The underlying mechanism can be attributed to the induced-charge densities in layered materials, which give rise to induced-dipole densities at large distances with directions parallel to that of the IX. The interaction between quadrupolar excitons in trilayer structures are found to be enhanced even larger, with a magnitude one to two orders stronger than that without 2D dielectric screening. The strengths of these dipolar and quadrupolar interactions can be further tuned by engineering the dielectric environment.",

Such a short timescale requires measurements with better resolution than achievable with a streak camera. Therefore, we employ an excitation correlation spectroscopy pump-probe technique. This approach allows us to identify two distinct non-radiative recombination channels attributed to lattice imperfections. The first channel is active at helium temperatures. It reduces the lifetime of the neutral exciton to below one picosecond. The second channel becomes active at elevated temperatures, further shortening the lifetimes of both neutral and charged exciton.

However, the effects of doping on the excitonic properties, particularly their dynamical properties, have been less studied. Using Nb-doped MoSe 2 as a case study, we experimentally investigate the effect of doping on excitonic dynamics in TMDs. Transient absorption measurements are used to directly compare the dynamical properties of excitons in Nb-doped MoSe 2 across monolayer, bilayer, and bulk flakes with their undoped counterparts. The exciton lifetimes in Nb-doped flakes are significantly shorter than those in their undoped counterparts. This effect is attributed to the trapping of excitons in defect states introduced by Nb impurities. These results reveal an important consequence of Nb doping on excitonic dynamics in TMDs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The exploration of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials has shown great promise and interest in tuning the magnetic and electronic properties as well as studying magneto-optical effects. The current work investigates the control of magneto-optical interactions in alloyed Mn x Zn 1− x PS 3 lamellar semiconductor single crystals, with the Mn/Zn ratio regulating the coupling strength. Magnetic susceptibility results show a retention of AFM order followed by a decrease in Néel temperatures down to ∼40% Mn concentration, below which a paramagnetic behavior is observed. Absorption measurements reveal an increase in bandgap energy with higher Zn(II) concentration, and the presence of Mn(II) d-d transition below the absorption edge. DFT + U approach qualitatively explained the origin and the position of the experimentally observed mid band-gap states in pure MnPS 3 , and corresponding peaks visible in the alloyed systems Mn x Zn 1‒ x PS 3 . Accordingly, emission at 1.3 eV in all alloyed compounds results from recombination from a 4 T 1g Mn(II) excited state to a hybrid p-d state at the valence band. Most significant, temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) intensity trends demonstrate strong magneto-optical coupling in compositions with x &gt; 0.65. This study underscores the potential of tailored alloy compositions as a means to control magnetic and optical properties in 2D materials, paving the way for advances in spin-based technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Stacking two semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (MX 2 ) monolayers to form a heterobilayer creates a new variety of semiconductor junction with unique optoelectronic features, such as hosting long-lived dipolar interlayer excitons. Despite many optical, transport, and theoretical studies, there have been few direct electronic structure measurements of these junctions. Here, we apply angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micron-scale spatial resolution ( µ ARPES) to determine the band alignments in MoSe 2 /WSe 2 heterobilayers, using in-situ electrostatic gating to electron-dope and thus probe the conduction band edges. By comparing spectra from heterobilayers with opposite stacking orders, that is, with either MoSe 2 or WSe 2 on top, we confirm that the band alignment is type II, with the valence band maximum in the WSe 2 and the conduction band minimum in the MoSe 2 . The overall band gap is E G = 1.43 ± 0.03 eV, and to within experimental uncertainty it is unaffected by electron doping. However, the offset between the WSe 2 and MoSe 2 valence bands clearly decreases with increasing electron doping, implying band renormalisation only in the MoSe 2 , the layer in which the electrons accumulate. In contrast, µ ARPES spectra from a WS 2 /MoSe 2 heterobilayer indicate type I band alignment, with both band edges in the MoSe 2 . These insights into the doping-dependent band alignments and gaps of MX 2 heterobilayers will be useful for properly understanding and ultimately utilizing their optoelectronic properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), have garnered significant attention in the nanoscale piezoelectric field due to their high crystallinity and ability to withstand large strains. Through density-functional theory calculations, we have discovered that monolayer H-phase CrS 2 and CrSe 2 exhibit antiferromagnetic semiconducting properties, in contrast to the previously held belief that they were nonmagnetic (NM) semiconductors. While the piezoelectric coefficients of NM CrS 2 and CrSe 2 are comparable to those of MoS 2 , their antiferromagnetic ground states demonstrate significantly enhanced piezoelectric coefficients ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>d</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>11</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) of 27.66 pm V −1 and 52.36 pm V −1 , respectively. These values exceed that of MoS 2 by an order of magnitude, marking the highest recorded for TMD materials and the highest in 2D magnetic materials to date. The greatly enhanced piezoelectric responses in the antiferromagnetic states of CrS 2 and CrSe 2 compared to their NM states arise from three primary factors. Firstly, the displacement of the Wannier center under strain is more pronounced in the antiferromagnetic state, leading to a greater change in dipole moment (enhanced clamped-ion contribution). Secondly, there is a heightened polarization change due to internal atomic distortions (internal-strain term) in response to macroscopic strain in the antiferromagnetic state. Thirdly, the material undergoes a softening of the elastic coefficient in its antiferromagnetic state. These findings open new avenues for designing high-performance piezoelectric and magnetic multifunctional materials.",

As a result, we predict the emergence of a photoexcited quasiparticle current, and, as a consequence, oppositely oriented stationary flow of Cooper pairs.

    "abstract": "In this research, we have analyzed the electrochemical characteristics of the different rGO/Co3O4 composites prepared by controlling the rGO surface characteristics and its relationship between the growth of Co3O4 nanoparticles and the performance of the pseudocapacitor. Reduced graphene oxide/cobalt oxide (rGO/Co3O4) nanocomposites of different morphologies were prepared through the simple hydrothermal method. First, different kinds of graphite precursors, crumpled and planar with different properties, were used to determine the most suitable substrate to grow Co3O4 nanoparticles. As a result, rGO/Co3O4 composite synthesized from planar graphite shows a higher specific capacitance of 207.2, 170.1, and 141.5 Fg?1 at 1, 2, and 5 Ag?1 than the one prepared from crumpled graphite. In the second part, planar graphite, confirmed to be the most suitable substrate from the previous part, was oxidized under various oxidation conditions to increase the oxygen functional groups attached on the GO surfaces and observed to see how it affects the growth of Co3O4 nanoparticles and its influence on the electrochemical performance of the rGO/Co3O4 pseudocapacitor. As a result, the one with the largest amount of functional groups had the Co3O4 nanoparticles well dispersed and grown on the rGO substrate in small nanoparticle sizes, as small as 5.9 nm, leading to an improved electrochemical performance. Thus, the specific capacitance with the least amount of oxygen functional groups are 207.2, 170.1, and 141.5 Fg?1 and for the largest amount of functional groups are 411.5, 371.4, and 292.7 Fg?1, at 1, 2, and 5 Ag?1 respectively. This approach could become a guideline for the ideal fabrication of rGO/metal oxide composite for further research involving rGO based pseudocapacitors.",

The presence of surfactant can provide homogeneous nucleation sites for SnO2 nanoparticles formation, thus ensuring the generated SnO2 nanoparticles have a tiny size of ∼5 nm and are uniformly distributed on the graphene sheets. Simultaneously, the random aggregation of graphene sheets leads to the in-situ encapsulation of SnO2 nanoparticles into graphene layers, forming a mechanically robust composite structure. These unique structural features are not only favorable for fast electrons transport and Li ions diffusion, but also capable of effectively buffering the volume changes of SnO2 nanoparticles. As a consequence, the SnO2/graphene composite exhibits superior Li storage performance in terms of large reversible capacity, good cycling stability and excellent rate capability.",

    "abstract": "When passing an optical medium in the presence of a magnetic field, the polarization of light can be rotated either when reflected at the surface (Kerr effect) or when transmitted through the material (Faraday rotation). This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the optical Hall effect arising from the light-charge carrier interaction in solid state systems subjected to an external magnetic field, in analogy with the conventional Hall effect. The optical Hall effect has been explored in many thin films and also more recently in 2D layered materials. Here, an alternative approach based on strain engineering is proposed to achieve an optical Hall conductivity in graphene without magnetic field. Indeed, strain induces lattice symmetry breaking and hence can result in a finite optical Hall conductivity. First-principles calculations also predict this strain-induced optical Hall effect in other 2D materials. Combining with the possibility of tuning the light energy and polarization, the strain amplitude and direction, and the nature of the optical medium, large ranges of positive and negative optical Hall conductivities are predicted, thus opening the way to use these atomistic thin materials in novel specific opto-electro-mechanical devices.",

In particular, NbSe2 and TaSe2 are the canonical systems to study superconductivity and charge density waves. Here, we perform a comparative study of the thermal transport properties of 2D NbSe2 and TaSe2 for both 1T and 2H phases based on first-principles calculations. Usually, the lattice thermal conductivity () is smaller with larger average atom mass. However, it is contrary for the comparison between TaSe2 and NbSe2, despite the heavier Ta than Nb. The abnormally larger of TaSe2 originates from the weakened phonon–phonon scattering due to the combination of large phonon bandgap and bunching of the acoustic phonon branches, which is caused by the larger mass difference. On one hand, the large bandgap hinders the acoustic–optical phonon scattering. On the other hand, the bunching of the acoustic phonon branches hampers Umklapp process by weakening the high frequency acoustic–acoustic phonon scattering. The special characteristics of phonon transport are further conformed by mode level analysis and scattering channels of phonon–phonon scattering. Moreover, lower κL of 1T phase for both Nb and Ta selenides compared to 2H phase are also reported, which stems from the stronger anharmonicity.",

    "abstract": "Electrides are ionic compounds in which electrons confined in the interstitial spaces serve as anions and are attractive owing to their exotic physical and chemical properties in terms of their low work function and efficient charge-transfer characteristics. Depending on the topology of the anionic electrons, the surface electronic structures of electrides can be significantly altered. In particular, the electronic structures of two-dimensional (2D) electride surfaces are of interest because the localized anionic electrons at the interlayer space can be naturally exposed to cleaved surfaces. In this paper, we report the electronic structure of 2D Y2C electride surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and first-principles calculations, which reveals that anionic electrons at a cleaved surface are absorbed by the surface and subsequently resurged onto the surface due to an applied electric field. We highlight that the estranged anionic electrons caused by the electric field occupy the slightly shifted crystallographic site compared with a bulk Y2C electride. We also measure the work function of the Y2C single crystal, and it shows a slightly lower value than the calculated one, which appears to be due to the electric field from the STM junction.",

Here we report an elegant technique for growing homogeneous-luminescence WS2 monolayer with desired shapes and developed electrochemical properties, through the improved chemical vapor deposition method with a semi-closed airflow environment. It is an effective, economic and especially environment-friendly approach with atmospheric pressure and hydrogen-free condition, aiming at synthesizing high-quality and large-scale monolayer WS2 crystals with only one heating zone. Compared with the existing methods, this one significantly minimizes the sulphur contamination to the environment and equipment, enabling the reuse of quartz tube and reducing the cost. More importantly, different shapes of WS2 domains with high crystalline and excellent homogeneity of luminescent intensity are controllable by adjusting the growth temperatures. In addition to the good electrical transport performance of WS2 monolayer, the WS2 domains with different morphologies exhibit modulated properties for catalyzing the electrochemical hydrogen evolution. This systematic study on shape-controlled growth and shape-dependent electrochemical performances of WS2 will further push forward their practical applications.",

We report photoluminescence (PL) from CVD-grown layered MoS2 in the presence of a skewed or a deformed triangular-shaped monolayer/bilayer (1L/2L) lateral interface. Integrated PL mapping images over the 1L and 2L MoS2 regions revealed that the neutral exciton emission was significantly enhanced and exhibited an oscillatory behavior in its intensity in the 1L region near the 1L/2L boundary, whereas the negative trion emission remained unchanged. The interplays among the number of MoS2 layers, a substrate, and a geometric boundary structure of the 1L/2L lateral interface turned out to be important in charge transfer due to a modulation in work functions. Density functional theory predicted that the work functions of 1L and 2L MoS2 were strongly influenced not only by the substrate material but also by the edge configuration of MoS2. As a result, PL intensity profiles showed rich features such as a stacking dependent decomposition of excitons and trions, a sharp spectroscopic contrast along the 1L/2L boundary, and a charge transfer relevant to the work function difference at the lateral interface. Our results demonstrate that understanding the MoS2 PL is useful in characterizing the electronic properties in 2D layered nanostructures and sheds light on possible new device applications.",

Starting from an intercalated Fe layer between the graphene and Ir(111) surface we find that graphene–substrate interaction can be fine-tuned by Fe–Ir alloying at the interface. When a critical Ir-concentration close to 0.25 is reached in the Fe layer, the Dirac cone of graphene is largely restored and can thereafter be tuned across the Fermi level by further increasing the Ir content. Indeed, our study reveals an abrupt transition between a chemisorbed phase at small Ir concentrations and a physisorbed phase above the critical concentration. The latter phase is highly reminiscent of the graphene on the clean Ir(111) surface. Furthermore, the transition is accompanied by an inversion of the graphene's induced magnetization due to the coupling with the Fe atoms from antiferromagnetic when chemisorbed to weakly ferromagnetic in the physisorption regime, with spin polarizations whose magnitude may be tuned with the amount of Fe content.",

    "abstract": "Graphene field-effect transistor devices were fabricated using a bottom-up and resist-free method, avoiding common compatibility issues such as contamination by resist residues. Large-area CVD graphene sheets were structured into device channels by patterning with a focused ion beam. Platinum contacts were then deposited by direct-write atomic layer deposition (ALD), which is a combination between electron beam induced deposition (EBID) and bottom-up area-selective ALD. This is a unique approach that enables nucleation of Pt ALD on graphene, and therefore these devices are the first reported graphene devices with contacts deposited by ALD. Electrical characterization of the devices confirms ambipolar transistor behaviour with typical field-effect mobilities in the range of 1000–1800 cm2 V−1 s−1. We observe clear signs of strong Pt-graphene coupling and contact induced hole doping, implying good contact properties in contrast to the conventionally weak bonding between Pt and graphene. We attribute these observations to the reduced amount of resist residue under the contacts, the improved wettability of the Pt due to the use of ALD, and the formation of a graphitic interlayer that bonds the Pt more strongly to the graphene. We conclude that direct-write ALD is a very suitable technique for metallization of graphene devices and to study the intrinsic properties of metal-graphene contacts in more detail. In addition, it offers unique opportunities to control the metal-graphene coupling strength.",

Here we first report first-principles calculations of lateral junctions between a PdSe2 bilayer and a Pd2Se3 monolayer. We find that, while several distinct junction geometries are possible, they all exhibit empty interface states below the conduction band. As a result, light n-type doping of either or both sides, e.g. by halogen atoms replacing Se atoms, leads to a remotely-doped interface, i.e. a 1D conducting nanowire that runs along the junction, in between the two semiconductors.

However, simultaneous utilization of both optical and electrical properties has been overlooked, yet it can offer enhanced accuracy and detection versitility. Here, we demonstrate a dual-mode optoelectronic biosensor based on monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) capable of producing simultaneous electrical and optical readouts of biomolecular signals. On a single platform, the biosensor exhibits a tunable photonic Fano-type optical resonance while also functioning as a field-effect transistor (FET) based on a optically transparent gate electrode. Furthermore, chemical vapor deposition grown MoS2 provides a clean surface for direct immobilization of a water-soluble variant of the μ-opioid receptor (wsMOR), via a nickel ion-mediated linker chemistry. We utilize a synthetic opioid peptide to show the operation of the electronic and optical sensing modes. The responses of both modes exhibit a similar trend with dynamic ranges of four orders of magnitude and detection limits of <1 nM. Our work explores the potential of a versatile multimodal sensing platform enabled by monolayer MoS2, since the integration of electrical and optical sensors on the same chip can offer flexibility in read-out and improve the accuracy in detection of low concentration targets.",

The scalable synthesis of graphene/WS 2 heterostructures on technologically attractive substrates like SiO 2 would greatly facilitate the implementation of novel two-dimensional (2D) devices. In this work, we report the direct growth of monolayer WS 2 via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on single-crystal graphene arrays on SiO 2 . Remarkably, spectroscopic and microscopic characterization reveals that WS 2 grows only on top of the graphene crystals so that the vertical heterostack is selectively obtained in a bottom-up fashion. Spectroscopic characterization indicates that, after WS 2 synthesis, graphene undergoes compressive strain and hole doping. Tailored experiments show that such hole doping is caused by the modification of the SiO 2 stoichiometry at the graphene/SiO 2 interface during the WS 2 growth. Electrical transport measurements reveal that the heterostructure behaves like an electron-blocking layer at large positive gate voltage, which makes it a suitable candidate for the development of unipolar optoelectronic components.",

The calculated band structures are compared both to those of 2D quantum wells and graphene-type honeycomb structures. It is found that in silicene type CdSe honeycomb structures, the lowest electron conduction bands (derived from S-type nanocrystal wave functions) form a Dirac-type dispersion, very similar as in graphene. The P-type bands are usually more complex. However, when the hybridization between S- and P-type bands increases, a second Dirac cone and a genuine non-trivial flat band is observed, similar as in the case of graphene-type honeycomb structures of CdSe. There is a strong non-trivial gap between the first and second valence band, hosting the quantum spin Hall effect. Silicene-type PbSe structures show Dirac features in their bands, which however can be clouded due to the multi-valley character of PbSe.",

The LFN characteristics of a FET composed of a 'bi-layer' MoS2 channel, which was passivated with an atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) Al2O3 layer, follow the conventional carrier number fluctuation (CNF) model. However, FETs consisting of multi-layered MoS2 channels (4, 7, 9, and 18 layers) show abnormal LFN characteristics, which substantially deviate from well-established 1/f noise models such as the CNF and Hooge's mobility fluctuation models. The bulk traps inside the MoS2 layers are the origin of the abnormal LFN characteristics and the large hysteresis of FETs with multi-layered MoS2 is due to its randomly embedded bulk traps. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) confirms the existence of oxygen species that induce the electrical bulk trap in the MoS2 layers.",

First-principles calculations are used to show that the electronic band offset depends crucially on the width and thickness of the heterostructure slab. The particular heterostructures under study consist of thin hydrogenated and fluorinated diamond slabs which are laterally joined together. Two different limits for the band offset are observed. For infinitely wide heterostructures the vacuum potential above the two materials is aligned leading to a large step potential within the heterostructure. For infinitely thick heterostructure slabs, on the other hand, there is no potential step in the heterostructure bulk, but a large potential step in the vacuum region above the heterojunction is observed. The band alignment in finite systems depends on the particular dimensions of the system. These observations are shown to result from an interface dipole at the heterojunction that tends to align the band structures.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the hierarchical nanofibrous and highly oriented structures of natural extracellular matrices, we report a rational design of chemical vapor deposition graphene-anchored scaffolds that provide both physical and chemical cues in a multilayered organization to control the adhesion and functions of cells for regenerative medicine. These hierarchical platforms are fabricated by transferring large graphene film onto nanogroove patterns. The top graphene layer exhibits planar morphology with slight roughness (∼20 nm between peaks) due to the underlying topography, which results in a suspended structure between the nanoridges. We demonstrate that the adhesion and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells were sensitively controlled and enhanced by the both the nanotopography and graphene cues in our scaffolds. Our results indicate that the layered physical and chemical cues can affect the apparent cell behaviors, and can synergistically enhance cell functionality. Therefore, these suspended graphene platforms may be used to advance regenerative medicine.",

In particular, we investigate the effect of vacancy defects on the carrier transport in 2D TI ribbons with hexagonal lattice structure. To account for the random distribution of the vacancy defects, we present a statistical study of varying defect densities by stochastically sampling different defect configurations. We demonstrate that the topological edge states of TI ribbons are fairly robust against a high concentration (up to 2%) of defects. At very high defect densities, we observe an increased inter-edge interaction, mediated by the localisation of the edge states within the bulk region. This effect causes significant back-scattering of the, otherwise protected, edge-states at very high defect concentrations (>2%), resulting in a loss of conduction through the TI ribbon. We discuss how this coherent vacancy scattering can be used to our advantage for the development of TI-based transistors. We find that there is an optimal concentration of vacancies yielding an ON–OFF current ratio of up to two orders of magnitude. Finally, we investigate the importance of spin–orbit coupling on the robustness of the edge states in the TI ribbon and show that increased spin–orbit coupling could further increase the ON–OFF ratio.",

The noble metal plates on the surface of 2D MOF are uniform and possess ultrathin structure, which are the ideal materials for catalysis due to accessible active sites, fast electron transfer, high stability, and good solution-dispersion. Notably, the synthesized Pd/Cu-TCPP(Fe) hybrid nanomaterials shows enzyme-mimic catalytic activity, which exhibits enhanced catalytic performance compared to Pd nanoplates, MOF nanosheets, and their mixture.

We first show that the often-used approaches fail in predicting the ground-state properties of this material in both its monolayer and bilayer forms, and even more spectacularly in its bulk form. In the latter case, the fundamental gap decreases by increasing the Hubbard-U parameter, eventually leading to a metallic ground state for physically relevant values of U, in stark contrast with experimental data. On the contrary, the use of hybrid functionals, which naturally take into account nonlocal exchange interactions between all orbitals, yields good account of the electronic gap as measured by ARPES. We then calculate all the relevant exchange couplings (and the magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy) for monolayer, bilayer, and bulk with a hybrid functional, with super-cells containing up to 270 atoms, commenting on existing calculations with much smaller super-cell sizes. In the case of bilayer , we show that two distinct intra-layer second-neighbor exchange couplings emerge, a result which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been noticed in the literature.",

Local electric field enhancement at the graphene edges leads to a more than ten-fold increased photoresponse compared to the bulk of the graphene-silicon junction.

    "abstract": "The use of graphene-based electrodes is burgeoning in a wide range of applications, including solar cells, light emitting diodes, touch screens, field-effect transistors, photodetectors, sensors and energy storage systems. The success of such electrodes strongly depends on the implementation of effective production and processing methods for graphene. In this work, we take advantage of two different graphene production methods to design an advanced, conductive oxide- and platinum-free, graphene-based counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In particular, we exploit the combination of a graphene film, produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (CVD-graphene), with few-layer graphene (FLG) flakes, produced by liquid phase exfoliation. The CVD-graphene is used as charge collector, while the FLG flakes, deposited atop by spray coating, act as catalyst for the reduction of the electrolyte redox couple (i.e., I3-/I-- and Co+2/+3). The as-produced counter electrodes are tested in both I3-/I-- and Co+2/+3-based semitransparent DSSCs, showing power conversion efficiencies of 2.1% and 5.09%, respectively, under 1 SUN illumination. At 0.1 SUN, Co+2/+3-based DSSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency as high as 6.87%. Our results demonstrate that the electrical, optical, chemical and catalytic properties of graphene-based dual films, designed by combining CVD-graphene and FLG flakes, are effective alternatives to FTO/Pt counter electrodes for DSSCs for both outdoor and indoor applications.",

    "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) MOSFETs have been widely reported to exhibit hysteresis behavior, which is usually attributed to charge trapping effects due to defective/sub-stoichiometric compositions in the material, or defects near, or at, the oxide/channel interfaces.It is also suggested that defective MoS 2 transistors show current limitations caused by the Schottky barrier junctions formed at the contacts.Here, we report on the static and dynamic device response of back-gated MoS 2 transistors directly fabricated on a SiO 2 /Si substrate using chemical vapor deposition synthesis, without film transfer, and standard CMOS optical lithography.The devices exhibit an atypical hysteresis in the transfer characteristics, as well as a delayed response in the formation of the conducting channel in response to voltage pulses applied to the back gate.Analysis of the output characteristic is consistent with two back-to-back Schottky diodes, allowing the Fermi level pinning position at the Ni/MoS 2 source and drain contacts and blocking the MoS 2 hole channel.Capacitancevoltage characterization demonstrates that the grown MoS 2 thin film is p-type, resulting in a nominally-off, inversion mode, n-channel device.Analysis of the transient response and hysteresis as a function of device temperature, illumination and ambient conditions indicates that the dynamic response of the device is determined by the net charge in the MoS 2 film combined with the minority carrier generation lifetime in the underlying silicon substrate.The work demonstrates the strong dependence of the device response time on substrate, temperature, illumination, and net charge in the MoS 2 layer opening the possibility of applications in photo-detectors and sensors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While silicon-based negative electrode materials have been extensively studied, to develop high capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), implementing a large-scale production method that can be easily transferred to industry, has been a crucial challenge. Here, a scalable wet-jet milling method was developed to prepare a silicon-graphene hybrid material to be used as negative electrode in LIBs. This synthesized composite, when used as an anode in lithium cells, demonstrated high Li ion storage capacity, long cycling stability and high-rate capability. In particular, the electrode exhibited a reversible discharge capacity exceeding 1763 mAh g −1 after 450 cycles with a capacity retention of 98% and a coulombic efficiency of 99.85% (with a current density of 358 mA g −1 ). This significantly supersedes the performance of a Si-dominant electrode structures. The capacity fade rate after 450 cycles was only 0.005% per cycle in the 0.05–1 V range. This superior electrochemical performance is ascribed to the highly layered, silicon-graphene porous structure, as investigated via focused ion beam in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy tomography. The hybrid electrode could retain 89% of its porosity (under a current density of 358 mA g −1 ) after 200 cycles compared with only 35% in a Si-dominant electrode. Moreover, this morphology can not only accommodate the large volume strains from active silicon particles, but also maintains robust electrical connectivity. This confers faster transportation of electrons and ions with significant permeation of electrolyte within the electrode. Physicochemical characterisations were performed to further correlate the electrochemical performance with the microstructural dynamics. The excellent performance of the hybrid material along with the scalability of the synthesizing process is a step forward to realize high capacity/energy density LIBs for multiple device applications.",

In the presence of attractive interactions between fermions with pseudospin-1/2 degree of freedom, a competition between semi-metal and superfluid behavior is found at the mean-field level. Using the quantum Monte Carlo method, we also investigate the case of strong repulsive interactions. In the Mott phase, each layer exhibits a different amount of long-range magnetic order. Upon coupling both layers, a valence-bond crystal is formed at a critical coupling strength. Finally, we discuss how these bilayer systems could be realized in existing cold atom experiments.",

Using density functional theory in combination with Monte Carlo simulations, we obtain an estimate of the Curie or Néel temperature. We find that the magnetic ordering is highly dependent on the dopant type. While Ti and Cr-doped WSe 2 have a ferromagnetic ground state, V, Mn, Fe and Co-doped WSe 2 are antiferromagnetic in their ground state. For Fe doped WSe 2 , we find a high Curie-temperature of 327 K. In the case of V-doped WSe 2 , we find that there are two distinct magnetic phase transitions, originating from a frustrated in-plane antiferromagnetic exchange interaction and a ferromagnetic out-of-plane interaction. We calculate the formation energy and reveal that, in contrast to earlier reports, the formation energy is positive for the intercalated systems studied here.

Here the propagations of surface plasmon waves near graphene defect boundaries created by ion beams are studied. Specifically, plasmon reflections are observed near the induced defect boundaries for the first time, which implies that ion-irradiation induced defects act as efficient scattering centers for the plasmonic waves, just like the native grain boundaries. Moreover, engineering the defects with varied ion doses results in tailorable plasmon reflection properties due to changed defect degrees. The controllable plasmon reflections near ion induced defect boundaries open up a new avenue for plasmon wave engineering.",

In this work, we predict the emergence of a 'heavy' Dirac fermion in a graphene/TI hetero-junction, where the linear term almost vanishes and the corresponding energy dispersion becomes highly nonlinear. By combining ab initio calculations and an effective low-energy model, we show explicitly how strong hybridization between Dirac fermions in graphene and the surface states of TIs can reduce the Fermi velocity of Dirac fermions. Due to the negligible linear term, interaction effects will be greatly enhanced and can drive 'heavy' Dirac fermion states into the half quantum Hall state with non-zero Hall conductance.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional layered materials (2DLMs) have attracted great research interest due to their exotic physical properties and potential applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Device fabrication with 2DLMs is challenging because their ultrathin characteristic makes them extremely sensitive to the external environment, especially to chemical contamination introduced by optical lithography. The shadow mask technique is a clean alternative in lithography-free electrode patterning for emerging nanomaterials. However, shadow mask assisted fabrication over large areas and multilevel alignment of patterns remain challenging for practical applications. In this paper, we report an over wafer scale shadow mask fabrication technique for 2DLMs. Based on successful fabrication of customized silicon shadow masks with micrometer feature sizes, their advantages for fabricating higher mobility and lower interface trapped exfoliated MoS2 transistors are demonstrated. Meanwhile, applications in large-scale metal deposition and sample etching are also explored. The max alignment error of multilayer patterns fall in 0.5–3.0 µm in x- and 2.0–9.0 µm in y -directions. Then this technique is employed to realize a fabrication of MoS2 top-gated field effect transistor arrays with two universal strategies: 'etching-last' and 'channel-first' on 1 × 1 cm2 Al2O3 substrate. Furthermore, logic inverter circuits with a high gain of 10 are successfully fabricated. The results provide an alternative as a universal, low-cost, time-saving method for fabricating large-scale 2DLM electronics and flexible electronics.",

The existence of sulfur vacancies formed in MoS2, however, will potentially make devices unstable and problematic. Random telegraphic signals (RTSs) have often been studied in small area Si metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) to identify the carrier capture and emission processes at defects. In this paper, we have systemically analyzed RTSs observed in atomically thin layer MoS2 FETs. Several types of RTSs have been analyzed. One is the simple on/off type of telegraphic signals, the second is multilevel telegraphic signals with a superposition of the simple signals, and the third is multilevel telegraphic signals that are correlated with each other. The last one is discussed from the viewpoint of the defect-defect interaction in MoS2 FETs with a weak screening in atomically confined two-dimensional electron-gas systems. Furthermore, the position of defects causing RTSs has also been investigated by preparing MoS2 FETs with multi-probes. The electron beam was locally irradiated to intentionally generate defects in the MoS2 channel. It is clearly demonstrated that the MoS2 channel is one of the RTS origins. RTS analysis enables us to analyze the defect dynamics of TMD devices.",

    "abstract": "Graphene has been widely used in the form of micro-flakes to fabricate composite materials with enhanced mechanical properties. Due to the small size of the inclusions and their random orientation within the matrix, the superior mechanical properties of graphene cannot be fully exploited. Recently, attempts have been made to fabricate nanolaminate composites by interleaving large sheets of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) monolayer graphene between thin layers of polymer matrices. However, CVD graphene is inevitably accompanied by wrinkles that are formed in the synthesis process, and it remains unknown how the wrinkles affect the mechanical properties of graphene. Here, we employ Brillouin Light Spectroscopy (BLS) to study the elastic moduli of CVD graphene by probing graphene/poly(methylmethacrylate) hybrid Bragg stacks at zero strain. We find the Young's and shear moduli of the CVD graphene, which has wrinkles in the form of sharp elevations of height of about 6 nm and a FWHM of ca. 30 nm, to be 680 and 290 GPa, respectively, with the former being about 30% lower than that of exfoliated, flat graphene. This work sheds light on the elastic properties of CVD graphene and provides a method that can be extended to studying the wrinkle-induced softening effect in other two-dimensional materials.",

This results in a dramatic enhancement of the superconducting properties of graphene while keeping its relativistic dispersion. We study the behavior of the superconducting gap and calculate critical temperatures in cases with single-bogolon and bogolon-pair-mediated pairing processes, accounting for the complex band structure of graphene. We also compare the critical temperature of the superconducting transition with the BKT temperature.",

The system is magnetically much better ordered than substitutionally doped materials, however, the detrimental effects of certain disorders are becoming increasingly acknowledged. Here, from compiling structural, compositional, and magnetic metrics of disorder in ferromagnetic MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}/$(Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$)$_{n}$ it is found that migration of Mn between MnBi$_{2}$T$e_{4}$ septuple layers (SLs) and otherwise non-magnetic Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ quintuple layers (QLs) has systemic consequences - it induces ferromagnetic coupling of Mn-depleted SLs with Mn-doped QLs, seen in ferromagnetic resonance as an acoustic and optical resonance mode of the two coupled spin subsystems. Even for a large SL separation (n $\\gtrsim$ 4 QLs) the structure cannot be considered as a stack of uncoupled two-dimensional layers. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory studies show that Mn disorder within an SL causes delocalization of electron wavefunctions and a change of the surface bandstructure as compared to the ideal MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}/$(Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$)$_{n}$. These findings highlight the critical importance of inter- and intra-SL disorder towards achieving new QAH platforms as well as exploring novel axion physics in intrinsic topological magnets.",

With the help of a combination of the experimental data and a rate equation model, we argue that the binding energy of the charged biexciton is less than the spectral separation of its peak from the neutral exciton. We also note that while the momentum-direct radiative recombination of the neutral exciton is restricted within the light cone, such restriction is relaxed for a charged biexciton recombination due to the presence of near-parallel excited and final states in the momentum space.",

However, the complete removal of PMMA on graphene surface has become a troublesome, and the PMMA residue could degrade the properties of graphene significantly. We report here a facile water assisted technique to directly peel off the PMMA layer over centimeter-sized CVD graphene film for the first time. No organic solvents are involved in the whole transfer process. The transferred graphene film is clean and intact over large area because of the cooperative effect of the capillary force and the van der Waals force which facilitates the conformal contact between graphene film and the substrate. Various types of graphene samples (i.e. monolayer, multilayer, and incomplete domains) can be easily transferred to diverse substrates including silicon wafer, sapphire, and quartz with good integrity. The transferred graphene film is of high cleanliness, and the graphene transistors show higher carrier mobility and lower level of p-type doping comparing to the conventional wet transfer technique.",

Despite great efforts devoted to develop high-performance optical memory devices based on two-dimensional (2D) material, the photoelectric conversion is still limited to defect-dominant photo-generated carrier trapping/de-trapping process at the interface of 2D materials. Here, a reconfigurable optical memory implanted with photonic programming/electric erasing operation is demonstrated based on MoS 2 /quantum dots (QDs) mixed-dimensional heterostructure. Unique photoelectric coupling effect between MoS 2 and QDs leads to a continuous n-doping on MoS 2 channel after light exposure removed, resulting in the generation of persistent photocurrent. Excellent optical memory characteristics such as high programming/erasing ratio, long retention time and stable operation cycles have been achieved and demonstrated to be gate-tunable. Besides, multi-level optical data storage with ten different states is also realized by applying a series of programmable optical signals. Owing to the unique dynamic response of mix-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure to optical and electric signals, our proposed optical memory transistor may pave up a new path to explore photoelectric conversion in low-dimensional system and develop high-performance optoelectronics for a broad range of applications.",

    "abstract": "By utilizing time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect technique, we investigated both demagnetization and remagnetization processes of a typical two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) and two comparative Te-based crystals, i.e. three-dimensional (3D) FM metal Cr3Te4 (CT) and 2D vdW FM metal Fe3GeTe2 (FGT). Different from 3D CT showing one-step laser-induced demagnetization, two-steps demagnetization behavior is dominated in 2D vdW FGT and CGT, which indicates that the 2D vdW magnets have relatively weaker electron-spin coupling. Of particular interest, we discovered an ultra-long remagnetization behavior in the 2D vdW CGT flake. The laser pumping induced spin demagnetization would not recover even in the time scale of 3500 ps (experimental setup limitation). To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest remagnetization process observed so far and it might be one of the particular characterizations of 2D vdW ferromagnet semiconductors. Based on the modified three temperature model, the key roles played by the crystal dimensionality and thermal diffusion anisotropy were revealed in the spin dynamics of 2D vdW magnets. Our findings would not only open the door to the thoroughly understanding of the origin of the magnetism in 2D FM materials but also undoubtedly find suitable applications in spintronics and magnonics devices.",

Small additions of arsenic (2.5 and 5%) seemingly enhance ferromagnetic order in polycrystalline samples by quenching fluctuations on one of the three magnetic sublattices, whereas larger As concentrations decrease the ferromagnetic Curie temperature ($T_{\\rm C}$) and saturation magnetization. This work also describes the growth and characterization of Fe$_{4.8}$AsTe$_2$ single crystals that are structurally analogous to Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$ but with some phase stability complications.

Here, we report the fabrication of a functionalized MoS 2 -field effect transistor (FET) for sensitive and quantitative detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD) in vaccinated serum specimens. The device was modified by SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD fusion protein on the surface and enabled rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In addition, an on-chip calibration method was established for quantitative measurement. Furthermore, this method was applied to measure the levels of S-RBD antibodies in serum specimens from vaccinated donors. The devices showed no response to negative control samples from individuals who did not receive vaccination, suggesting the high specificity of this method.

Till now, most studies focus on the twist of atomic lattices and the resulted moiré superstructures, while the reports about the twist of charge density waves (CDWs), the superstructures of which are from individual layers are limited. Here, using molecular beam epitaxy, we construct bilayer (BL) 1T-NbSe 2 vertical structures. With high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy observations, we identify two cases of CDW twisted stacking with atomic precision. The typical twist angles are 0° and 60° between the 1st and the 2nd layer, although the top Se atomic lattices of these two layers are parallel. Compared to the single layer case, the d I /d V at BL shows an insulator-to-metal transition, with the Hubbard bands shrinking towards the Fermi level ( E F ). More intriguingly, interlayer coupling states rise near E F , which are related to the CDW twist angles. These findings give fresh insight into the engineering of 2D materials by CDW twisting and are potentially applicable for future nanoelectronic devices.",

We probe the capacitive coupling through the conductance, showing good agreement between simulations and experiments for all the systems considered.

Specifically, alloys of 2D TMDs have broad potential applications owing to their composition-controlled properties. Several important challenges remain regarding controllable and scalable fabrication of these alloys, such as achieving control over their atomic ordering (i.e. clustering or random mixing of the transition metal atoms within the 2D layers). In this work, atomic layer deposition is used to synthesize the TMD alloy Mo 1− x W x S 2 with excellent composition control along the complete composition range 0 ⩽ x ⩽ 1. Importantly, this composition control allows us to control the atomic ordering of the alloy from well-mixed to clustered while keeping the alloy composition fixed, as is confirmed directly through atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron micrography imaging. The control over atomic ordering leads to tuning of the bandgap, as is demonstrated using optical transmission spectroscopy. The relation between this tuning of the electronic structure and the atomic ordering of the alloy was further confirmed through ab-initio calculations. Furthermore, as the atomic ordering modulates from clustered to well-mixed, the typical MoS 2 and WS 2 A 1g vibrational modes converge. Our results demonstrate that atomic ordering is an important parameter that can be tuned experimentally to finely tune the fundamental properties of 2D TMD alloys for specific applications.",

Nanoscale confinement in the form of reduced thickness can modulate the phase transitions of 2D materials both in their thermodynamics and kinetics. Here, using in situ Raman spectroscopy we demonstrate that reducing the thickness of MoS 2 below five layers slows the kinetics of the phase transition from 2H- to 1T′-MoS 2 induced by the electrochemical intercalation of lithium. We observe that the growth rate of 1T′ domains is suppressed in thin MoS 2 supported by SiO 2 , and attribute this growth suppression to increased interfacial effects as the thickness is reduced below 5 nm. The suppressed kinetics can be reversed by placing MoS 2 on a 2D hexagonal boron nitride ( h BN) support, which readily facilitates the release of strain induced by the phase transition. Additionally, we show that the irreversible conversion of intercalated 1T′-MoS 2 into Li 2 S and Mo is also thickness-dependent and the stability of 1T′-MoS 2 is significantly increased below five layers, requiring a much higher applied electrochemical potential to break down 1T′-MoS 2 into Li 2 S and Mo nanoclusters.",

In this work, we study the light emission properties of hBN flakes obtained by mechanical exfoliation with particular focus on extended defects generated in the process. In particular, we tackle different issues related to the light emission in hBN flakes of different thicknesses in the range of hundreds of nanometers, revealing a higher concentration of deep level emission in thinner area of the flake. We recognize the effect of crystal deformation in some areas of the flake with an important blue-shift (130 meV) of the room temperature near band edge emission of hBN and the concurrent presence of a novel emission at 2.36 eV, related to the formation of array of dislocations. We studied the light emission properties by means of cathodoluminescence (CL) and sub-bandgap excitation photoluminescence of thickness steps with different crystallographic orientations, revealing the presence of different concentration of radiative centers. CL mapping allows to detect buried thickness steps, invisible to the scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy morphological analysis.",

Traditional constructing techniques (coating, extrusion and deposition) are failing to offer accurate control on material interface and roughness, which generally leads to inferior devices performance. Well-developed printing processes are powerful tools to precisely manufacture multiscale, multimaterials and multifunctional devices, and equip them with satisfied properties, providing new opportunities for the manufacturing of MXene. There have been increasing research efforts being spent to combine the printing methods with MXene-based materials. Nevertheless, lots of difficulties and limitations still exist. In this paper, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the recent research progress around the printing of MXene-based materials, focusing on three parts, i.e. the formation of printable inks, current mainstream printing methods and the applications of the as-printed objects.

The use of molecular simulation is a complementary strategy to explore how this complexity influences the ion transport properties of GO membranes. However, despite recent advances, computational models of GO typically lack the required complexity as suggested by experiment. The labor required to create such an ensemble of such structural models with the required complexity is impractical without recourse to automated approaches, but no such code currently can meet this challenge. Here, a modular tiling concept is introduced, along with the HierGO suite of code; an automated approach to producing highly complex hierarchically-structured models of GO with a high degree of control in terms of holes and topological defects, and oxygen-group placement, that can produce simulation-ready input files. The benefits of the code are exemplified by modeling and contrasting the properties of three types of GO membrane stack; the widely-modeled Lerf–Klinowski structure, and two types of highly heterogeneous GO sheet reflecting differing processing conditions. The outcomes of this work clearly demonstrate how the introduction of the complexity modeled here leads to new insights into the structure/property relationships of GO with respect to permeation pathways of water, ions and molecular agents that are inaccessible using previously-considered models.",

This challenge is further exacerbated to platelet surface chemistry when scalable functionalisation processes, such as plasma treatment, are used to modify the GNPs to improve the filler-matrix interphase in nanocomposites. The costly and complex suite of analytical equipment necessary for a complete material description makes quality control and process optimisation difficult. Raman spectroscopy is a facile and accessible characterisation technique, with recent advancements unlocking fast mapping for rapid data collection. In this study, we develop novel techniques to better characterise GNP morphology and changes in surface chemistry using Raman maps of bulk powders. Providing a bespoke algorithmic framework for the analysis of these advanced materials. An unsupervised peak fitting and processing algorithm was used to extract crystallinity data and correlate it with laser-diffraction-derived lateral size values for a commercial set of GNPs rapidly and accurately. Classical machine learning was used to identify the most informative Raman features for classifying the plasma-functionalised GNPs. The initial material properties were found to affect the peak features that were the most useful for classification. In low defect density and low specific surface area GNPs, the D peak full width at half maximum is found to be the most useful, whereas the <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>I</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>2D</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>I</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>G</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ratio is the most useful in the opposite case.

The prepared GO and MX nanoparticles (NPs) were firstly characterized utilizing Fourier transform infrared, ultraviolet–visible, atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques and subsequently assessed in terms of their radiobiological properties. The results of the cell toxicity assay indicated that neither NPs exhibited significant cytotoxicity after 48 h incubation with BCC up to 50 µ g ml −1 concentration without irradiation. The cell internalization results showed an approximately equivalent cellular uptake for both NPs after 6 h incubation with BCC. Our comparative studies with radiotherapy demonstrated that both NPs substantially increased cell proliferation inhibition and cell apoptosis of BCC under x-ray irradiation when compared to BCC treated with irradiation alone. Additionally, the 2ʹ,7ʹ-dichlorofluorescin diacetate flow cytometry results and fluorescent microscopy images revealed that both NPs remarkably increased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in BCC under x-ray irradiation. The MX nanosheets exhibited superior radiosensitization efficiency than GO under x-ray irradiation due to its higher level of intracellular ROS generation (MX = 75.2% and GO = 65.2%). Clonogenic cell survival assay and extracted radiobiological parameters revealed that both NPs in combination with x-ray irradiation induced more lethal damage and less sublethal damage to BCC. Generally, the obtained results demonstrate that the MX NPs, as a stronger radiosensitizer than GO, could be a promising candidate for enhancing the effectiveness of radiotherapy in breast cancer treatment.",

This concept is demonstrated using the example of the bilayer MnBi 2 Te 4 on ferroelectric In 2 Se 3 or In 2 Te 3 , where the polarization direction of the 2D ferroelectrics determines the interfacial band alignment and consequently the direction of the charge transfer. This charge transfer, in turn, enhances the stability of the ferromagnetic state of MnBi 2 Te 4 and leads to a possible topological phase transition between the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and the zero plateau QAH.

At room temperature, mechanical resonance of electrostatically-actuated devices show narrow distribution of their characteristic parameters with high quality factor and low effective mass and resonance frequencies, as expected for low stress and adsorbate-free membranes. Upon cooling, a sharp increase of both resonant frequency and quality factor is observed, enabling to extract the thermal expansion coefficient of CVD graphene. Comparison with state-of-the-art graphene NEMS is presented.",

Their applications in memory devices have been demonstrated, yet much still remains to explore optimal materials and device structure for practical application. In this work, a forming-free, bipolar resistive switching behavior are demonstrated in 2D TiO2-based resistive random access memory (RRAM). Physical adsorption method is adopted to achieve high quality, continuous 2D TiO2 network efficiently. The 2D TiO2 RRAM devices exhibit superior properties such as fast switching capability (20 ns of erase operation) and extremely low erase energy consumption (0.16 fJ). Furthermore, the resistive switching mechanism is attributed to the formation and rupture of oxygen vacancies-based percolation path in 2D TiO2 crystals. Our results pave the way for the implementation of high performance 2DLMs-based RRAM in the next generation non-volatile memory (NVM) application.",

Due to the reduced dielectric screening and confinement of electrons in two dimensions, these materials show dramatically different electronic and optical properties from their bulk counterparts. So far, studies on two-dimensional materials have mainly focused on crystalline materials. Here we report studies of atomically thin amorphous black phosphorus, as the first two-dimensional amorphous material. Spatially and temporally resolved pump-probe measurements show that large-area and uniform atomic layers of amorphous black phosphorus, synthesized at low temperature, possess a long exciton lifetime of about 400 ps, a room-temperature exciton diffusion coefficient of 5 cm2 s−1, which is at least two orders of magnitude larger than amorphous silicon, and an exciton mobility of about 200 cm2 V−1 s−1. We also deduce from these values an exciton mean free time of 50 fs, a mean free path of 5 nm, and a diffusion length of 450 nm. These results suggest that amorphous black phosphorus can be potentially used in low-cost optoelectronic devices.",

For device application, however, controllable doping of the materials is essential. Here we report hole doping of epitaxial MoSe2 by nitrogen (N) plasma treatment with the aim of understanding the defect structure and its electronic characteristics. Examinations by annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy clearly reveal substitutional doping of N by replacing Se atoms in MoSe2 monolayer upon N-plasma treatment, though creation of Se vacancies are also possible. Interestingly, we note an unexpectedly high concentration of 'dual defects', where both Se atoms in the top and bottom Se layers of MoSe2 at the same lattice site are substituted by N and/or become vacant, suggesting a catalytic effect of defect formation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy confirm the presence of N–Mo bonds. Photoemission spectroscopy reveals an impurity band as well as the Fermi level shift, confirming the p-type doping effect in MoSe2 monolayer by N-plasma treatment. Consistent with the PES results, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurement also reveal defect states peaked at 0.6–0.7 eV above the valance band maximum.

In this work the interplay of the technologically relevant graphene–Cu system is investigated in detail as a function of substrate grain orientation in Cu polycrystalline foils. While (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) Cu grains show the well-known graphene-enhanced oxidation, (1 1 0) grains present a superior oxidation resistance compared to uncovered Cu and an anomalous shift of its graphene 2D Raman band which cannot be explained by the known effects of strain and doping. These results are interpreted in terms of a weak graphene–Cu coupling at the (1 1 0) grains, and show that graphene can actually be used as anticorrosion coating, contrary to previously reported. The anomalous shift is suggested to be the result of an enhanced outer Raman scattering process which surpasses the usually dominant inner process. Since Raman spectroscopy is widely used as first and main characterization tool of graphene, the existence of an anomalous shift on its 2D band not only challenges the current theory of Raman scattering in graphene, but also has profound implications from an experimental point of view.",

The WF of graphene sheets was increased by up to 0.74 eV, as a result of the formation of carbon-fluorine bonds that function as negative surface dipoles. We fabricated hole-only devices and conducted dark injection space-charge-limited-current transient measurement; the fluorination greatly increased the hole injection efficiency of graphene anodes (from 0.237 to 0.652).

This allows us to show that, averaging over short-range impurity configurations destroys quantum coherence between valleys, leaving the elastic scattering time and inter-valley scattering rate as the only parameters characterizing the transport theory. Using the theory, we compute the nonlocal resistance of a Hall bar device in the diffusive regime.

To meet this challenge, we have devised a promising large-scale synthesis method for few-layer MoS2 film integrated with unique fabrication process that provides good contact. A thin layer of Mo was first deposited using sputtering evaporation and defined by a shadow mask, instead of immediate sulfurization in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) furnace. Au contact electrodes were then deposited on Mo, followed by further sulfurization, which readily provides source-drain electrodes for synthesized MoS2. Top-gated transistors based on such MoS2 film show improved device performance compared to transistors fabricated using the traditional method. The transfer line method was further applied to verify that the proposed method could effectively decrease the contact resistance by more than 10 times, which can be attributed to the incomplete sulfurization of Mo atoms beneath the Au electrodes. It is envisioned that the proposed method could eventually be used to provide uniform and low contact resistance for CVD-grown 2DLM devices.",

However, BP's high susceptibility to oxidation when exposed to ambient conditions is a critical challenge for its implementation into functional systems. Here, we investigate the degradation of BP flakes exposed to various environmental conditions by synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS). As a near-field based technique, SINS provides sub-diffractional mid-infrared images and spectra from nano-sized domains. Supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, our SINS spectra reveal the formation of nanoscale POx domains, with x between 0.5 and 1, and a 100 meV red shift in the bandgap of flakes exposed to air for a few minutes. On the other hand, exposure to air for 24 h led to the preferential formation of H3PO4, with complete removal of the electronic transitions from the mid-infrared spectral window, while a long (1 month) exposure to low O2 levels mainly led to the formation of P4O8 and P4O9 species. The SINS analysis allows correlating the morphology of oxidized samples to the oxide type, thus, contributing to a comprehensive characterization of the BP degradation process.",

In particular, the Brewster angle undergoes an up-shift if a substrate is covered with a conducting 2D material. This work theoretically and experimentally investigates this effect related to the 2D induced current at the interface. The shift is predicted for all conducting 2D materials and tunability with respect to the Fermi level of graphene is evidenced. Analytical approximations for high and low 2D conductivities are proposed and avoid cumbersome numerical analysis of experimental data. Experimental demonstration using spectroscopic ellipsometry has been performed in the UV to NIR range on mono-, bi- and trilayer graphene samples. The non-contact measurement of this modified Brewster angle allows to deduce the optical conductivity of 2D materials. Applications to telecommunication technologies can be considered thanks to the tunability of the shift at 1.55 μm.",

Li-ion capacitor is a promising hybrid technology that strategically exploits high energy density from a Li-ion battery electrode and high power density from a supercapacitor electrode. However, the performance and safety of hybrid devices are still major concerns due to the use of graphite anodes which form passivation layers with organic electrolytes at lower potentials. Here, we explore 2D nanosheets as both anode and cathode electrodes to build a high power system without compromising energy density. Owing to the high electrical conductivity and multivalent redox activity at higher potentials, the Li-ion intercalation electrode is capable of maintaining large energy density at higher current rates with less safety risk than conventional systems. Hybrid devices consisting of all in all 2D electrodes deliver energy density as high as 121 Wh g−1 (at 240 W kg−1) and retains 29 Wh g−1 at high power density of 3600 W kg−1.",

Here, we study band gap renormalization and exciton binding energy changes in WS2/WSe2 hetero-bilayers using absorption and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy. From the scaling behavior of higher order exciton energies, we estimate the exciton binding energy and quasi-particle band gap of constituent layers in the hetero-bilayer. We show that the band gap and the intralayer exciton binding energy of the constituent layers are reduced by as much as ~100 meV and ~70 meV, respectively, due to dielectric screening of the adjacent layer.

Strongly bound excitons with binding energies up to 0.3 eV and remarkably large trion binding energies up to 100 meV have been observed for supported monolayer bP. Surprisingly, this trion binding energy is significantly larger than those found in other 2D materials (e.g. about 30 meV in transition metal dichalcogenides). This has previously been ascribed to the quasi-1D nature of bP. In this work we show, using first principles calculations, that the trion binding energy of bP is indeed large (80 meV) when referenced to the lowest bright exciton but only 30 meV when its energy is measured relative to the lowest dark exciton. Our analysis thus shows that the trion binding energy in bP is not larger than in other 2D materials, and the previous conclusions have to be understood incorporating the large splitting between the dark and bright excitons in bP. We also explore the effect of substrate and in-plane strain of the exciton and trion binding energies and show that these effects do not change the main conclusions. Our results correct the misconception that trion binding energies in monolayer bP are particularly large due to its quasi-1D structure and contribute to the establishment of more a detailed understanding of optical properties of atomically thin semiconductors.",

    "abstract": "Unfunctionalised few-layer graphene (FLG) refers to graphene materials and formulations which have low or no defects in the graphene sheet structure, thus enhancing their physico-chemical properties. However, the use of FLG and its derivatives in the biomedical field is not without risk to human health. It is largely accepted that the generation of reactive oxygen species and the consecutive inflammatory response is at the basis of its toxicity; nonetheless the signaling pathways triggered by FLG still need to be explored in detail. The present study was aimed at providing some elucidations on the specific molecular signaling induced by low doses of a well characterized FLG material in macrophages. Exposure to low doses of FLG resulted in no significant decrease of macrophage viability. Nevertheless, it elicited a marked oxidative stress. The latter triggered significant inflammatory responses, increasing Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion as well as nitric oxide (NO) production, leading to autophagy via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Indeed, exposure to FLG in the presence of 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), inhibitors of ER stress and oxidative stress, respectively, decreased ER stress, autophagy, oxidative stress and inflammation. Interestingly, graphene exposure did not induce Interleukin-1Beta (IL-1β) and Interleukin-18 (IL-18) secretion, which are indicators of inflammasome activation. Pre-treatment with 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, actually suppressed the autophagy activation triggered by graphene exposure, but leaded to inflammasome activation. Our work highlight for the first time for this type graphene an interplay between oxidative stress and ER stress-mediated autophagy. It also suggests that such a pathway could protect the cells from exaggerated inflammation. This study underlines the importance of having a clear overview on the mechanism behind the interaction between FLG and cells, especially when graphene is used for the development of novel biomedical materials.",

The manifestation of the spin Hall effect (SHE) in semiconductors with a simple geometry is still a challenge to implement in spintronics. In this work, we demonstrate the distinct electrical detection of the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in WS2 multilayer crystals at temperatures ranging from 4.2 K to 300 K. The novel idea of this study is the electrical detection of the ISHE in WS2 using an in-plane spin-polarized current, which is realized using non-ferromagnetic electrodes on the top and bottom surfaces of the WS2 channel. The flow alteration of spin-polarized current results in a polarity change in the inverse spin Hall signal. By analyzing the magnitude of the ISHE, we estimated a spin diffusion length of ~250 nm, spin Hall angle of ~0.028, spin polarization of ~0.20 and spin lifetime of ~560 ps in WS2-layered crystals at room temperature. The ISHE in layered, 2D materials, including WS2 crystals, provides a new methodology to develop low-power and fast memory devices to write, read and store information.",

    "abstract": "It is still a great challenge to avoid the degradation of ultrathin black phosphorus (BP) since its discovery in 2014. Various methods have been explored to stabilize the properties of ultrathin BP through capping technology or chemical passivation. Besides, the large metal–semiconductor contact resistance is also one of the critical issues. The two problems hinder the further development of ultrathin BP devices. Herein, we demonstrate that polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) capping can not only enhance the durability of the ultrathin BP effectively and nondestructively, but also tune the effective Schottky barriers (SBs) formed at the interfaces between the metal and semiconductor dramatically. Particularly, the Schottky barrier (SB) for electron injection from metal to semiconductor is decreased by ~13 meV and the performance of the BP field effect transistor (FET) is strongly enhanced with the current on/off ratio increased by 6.8 times for the hole conduction after the PMMA capping. In addition, after the electron beam irradiation to the PMMA layer, the charge neutral point of the BP FET exhibits remarkable negative shift resulting in the electron dominated semiconductor channel at zero gate voltage. Furthermore, through partially capping the BP channel, a prototype of BP p-n diode was demonstrated with a maximum rectification factor of 21.3. The diode performs quite well with just a quarter of the BP channel capped by the PMMA layer. Our findings suggest that the PMMA capped ultrathin BP would be a promising choice for future device applications.",

Moreover, the memory device shows an excellent cycling endurance of more than 104 cycles.

Here, we concentrate on the growth of hBN on the coinage metal surface Cu(1 1 1). Using low energy electron microscopy and diffraction, we investigate the self-terminated growth of the first layer in situ and in real time. Most prominently, we find dendritic structures with three strongly preferred growth branches that are mostly well aligned with the Cu(1 1 1) substrate and exhibit a three-fold symmetric shape. The observation of dendritic structures is very surprising since hBN was found to grow in compact, triangular-shaped islands on many other metal substrates, in particular, on transition metal surfaces where it shows a much stronger interaction to the surface. We explain the unexpected dendritic growth by an asymmetry of the bonding energy for the two possible ways a borazine molecule can attach to an existing hBN island, namely either with one of its boron or one of its nitrogen atoms. We suggest that this asymmetry originates from different dehydrogenation states of the adsorbed borazine molecules and the hBN islands. We call this mechanism ‘Dehydrogenation Limited Aggregation’ since it is generic in the sense that it is merely based on different dehydrogenation energies for the involved building blocks forming the 2D layer.",

For the first time, we propose a clustering of experimental 2D nanopore data based on the ionic current blockade height and unrelated to the traditional dwell time for each DNA event. Within this approach, the blockade level information is implicitly included in the feature space analysis and does not need to be treated explicitly. We could show the higher efficiency of the blockade height over the traditional dwell time also in coping with sparse nanopore data sets. Our approach allows for a deep insight into characteristic molecular features in 2D nanopores and provides a feedback mechanism to tune these materials and interpret the measured signals. It has, thus, a high impact on the efficiency of 2D nanopore-based DNA sequencers.",

    "abstract": "The photocatalytic potential of large area CVD grown nitrogen doped graphene (NGr) has been explored though the chemical transformation of 4-nitrobenzene thiol into p,p'-dimercaptoazobenzene. Decoration of NGr with Ag nanocubes with rounded edges to form NGr/Ag nanohybrids resulted in a slight increase in the work-function and a decrease in the n-type character of NGr due to ground state transfer of negative charge from NGr to Ag. The Ag nanocubes exhibited a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at ~425 nm. When the NGr/Ag nanohybrids were illuminated with visible light of wavelength close to the LSPR peak, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) indicated a dramatic change in surface potential of −225 mV and Raman spectra detected electron accumulation in NGr, which are attributed to a high local field enhancement-mediated hot electron injection into NGr and the formation of long-lived charge separated states. Pristine nitrogen doped graphene and its coupled system with plasmonic Ag nanoparticles showed superior photocatalytic performance compared to bare plasmonic Ag catalyst. While standalone Ag NPs were unable to complete the transformation of 4-NBT into DMAB even at a laser power of 10 mW, NGr/Ag nanohybrids completed this transformation at a laser power of 1 mW, pointing to the high photoreduction strength of NGr/Ag. Density functional theory (DFT) based computational modeling was used to examine the electronic structure of graphene doped with graphitic, pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen dopant atoms. DFT results indicated an enhanced chemical reactivity of NGr due to stronger localization of charge at the dopant sites and a pronounced difference in the projected density of states (PDOS) for carbon atoms in proximity to, and distant from, the nitrogen dopant sites.",

We find that the rapid degradation proceeds via the growth of dendrites on the basal plane that have a fractal dimension close to that of diffusion-limited aggregation. We also observe dendrites in unheated samples that have been in ambient air for a year. We explain the rapid degradation after heating to an increase in MoO3. We propose that the mechanism for dendrite growth involves the diffusion of H2O to oxide sites. This results in the liquefication of the oxides. The liquefied oxides do not protect the surface from further oxidation. Putting heated samples in a dry box for 2 weeks immediately after heating prevents the rapid degradation from occurring.",

We utilise widely-available iron foils for the catalytic chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of h-BN and report on the significant role of bulk dissolved species in h-BN CVD, and specifically, the balance between dissolved oxygen and carbon. A simple pre-growth conditioning step of the iron foils enables us to tailor an error-tolerant scalable CVD process to give exceptionally large h-BN monolayer domains. We also develop a facile method for the improved transfer of as-grown h-BN away from the iron surface by means of the controlled humidity oxidation and subsequent rapid etching of a thin interfacial iron oxide; thus, avoiding the impurities from the bulk of the foil. We demonstrate wafer-scale (2″) production and utilise this h-BN as a protective layer for graphene towards integrated (opto-)electronic device fabrication.",

By computing the nonlinear response and characterizing theoretically the respective SH as a function of polarization, temperature, electron density, and degree of VP, we demonstrate the possibility of disentangling and individually quantifying the intrinsic and valley contributions to the SH. A specific experimental setup is proposed to obtain direct quantitative information about the degree of VP and allow its remote mapping. This approach could prove useful for direct, contactless, real-space monitoring of valley injection and other applications of valley transport and valleytronics.",

Protecting the 2D layers by encapsulation between hexagonal boron nitride layers significantly improves their quality. Locating these samples within the encapsulant and assessing their integrity prior to further processing then becomes challenging. Here we show that conductive scanning probe techniques such as electrostatic force and Kelvin force microscopy makes it possible to visualize the encapsulated layers, their charge environment and local defects including cracks and bubbles on the sub-micrometer scale. Our techniques are employed without requiring electrical contact to the embedded layer, providing valuable feedback on the local electronic quality prior to any device etching or electrode deposition. We show that these measurement modes, which are simple extensions of atomic force microscopy, are perfectly suited for imaging encapsulated conductors and their local charge environments.",

Due to low cost and simplicity, adsorption and filtration materials are often chosen to deal with oil spills, but the outcomes are not satisfactory mainly because of the awfully high viscosity of crude oil. Herein a photothermal ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene/MXene composite aerogel with a high light absorption (99.97%) and water repellency (water contact angle>148°) is developed by thermally induced phase separation method. The composite aerogel endows durable hydrophobicity with which the water contact angle is more than 142° in acidic/alkaline environments, and the maximum absorption capacity of 81g·g-1. In addition, it exhibits an excellent photothermal performance, rising surface temperature to 70 ℃ within 60 s under 1 sun irradiation, that can drastically reduce the crude oil absorption time from 60 min to 60 s, saving 98% of absorption time and reaching a crude oil absorption capacity of 21g·g-1. More interestingly, the designed solar evaporation device with the obtained composite aerogel can achieve an evaporation rate of 1.15 kg·m-2 h-1 and evaporation efficiency of 74%. The designed composite aerogel opens a possible pathway for solar-powered crude oil adsorption applications.&#xD",

We found that the magnetic ground state of bulk and monolayer FeSe is the block-checkerboard phase, which turns into the collinear stripe phase under in plane tensile strain. FeTe, in both bulk and monolayer phases, shows two magnetic transitions upon increasing the tensile strain: from bicollinear in the ground state to block-checkerboard ending up to the collinear antiferromagnetic phase which could bring it in the superconducting state.

We fabricated graphene/Si nanomembrane (NM)/metal vertical heterostructures by using a dry transfer technique to transfer Si NMs onto chemical vapor deposition-grown graphene layers. The resulting van der Waals interfaces between graphene and p-Si NMs exhibited nearly ideal Schottky barrier behavior. Due to the low density of states of graphene, the graphene/Si NM Schottky barrier height can be modulated by modulating the band profile in the channel region, yielding well-defined current modulation. We obtained a maximum current on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) of up to ∼103, with a current density of 102 A cm−2. We also observed significant dependence of Schottky barrier height Δφb on the thickness of the Si NMs. We confirmed that the transport in these devices is dominated by the effects of the graphene/Si NM Schottky barrier.",

    "abstract": "Benefiting from extremely high conductivity, graphene sheets (GS) with very low defect density are preferable to reduced graphene oxide sheets for constructing the free-standing hybrid electrodes of flexible electrochemical energy storage devices. However, due to the hydrophobic nature and deficiency of nucleation sites, how to uniformly and intimately anchor electrochemically active materials onto less defective GS is a challenge. Herein, a free-standing and mechanically flexible hybrid film with two-layer structure, mesoporous TiO2 anchored less defective GS hybrid (mTiO2-GS) upper-layer and graphene under-layer, denoted as mTiO2-GS/G, is fabricated. The hydrolysis of a Ti glycolate aqueous sol solution were applied to form mTiO2. The decoration of less defective GS with sodium lignosulfonate (SLS) surfactant is crucial for anchoring TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The aromatic rings of SLS favor a non-destructive functionalization of GS through the π-π stacking interaction. The sulfonic acid groups and hydroxyl groups of SLS, respectively, greatly improve the dispersity of GS in water and trigger the nucleation of TiO2 through the oxolation in the hydrolysis of Ti glycolate sol solution. The following characteristics of free-standing mTiO2-GS/G electrode benefit the fast charging/discharging capabilities: highly conductive graphene framework, ultra-small NPs (~5.0 nm) in mTiO2 anchored, high specific surface area (202.5 m2 g−1), abundant mesopores (0.32 cm3 g−1), intimate interfacial interaction between mTiO2 and GS, robust contact between the mTiO2-GS upper-layer and an under-layer of bare graphene as the current collector. In coin half-cells, the mTiO2-GS/G electrode delivers a capacity of 130 mA h g−1 at 50 C, and 71 mA h g−1 at 100 C, and it also exhibits excellent cycle stability up to 10 000 cycles under 10 C, with a degradation rate of 0.0033% per cycle. When packed in flexible cells, the mTiO2-GS/G electrode maintains fast charging/discharging capabilities regardless of being flat or bent. Furthermore, because of the high durability of mTiO2-GS/G electrode, repeated deformations do not cause extra capacity degradation.",

GMRs were added in different concentrations in order to improve thermo-mechanical properties of the nano-composite thermoset. Different dispersion methods were taken into account in order to produce stable long-lasting dispersion of the GRMs, that can withstand a commercial shelf life. Addition of the GRMs improves the glass transition temperature of the nanocomposite up to 20 °C with respect to the plain commercial formulation, and both stress and elongation at break increase up to almost 4 times the original values. Moreover, the industrial curing of some of the more promising modified resins was computer-simulated when the two-components resins are used to produce a carbon-fibre reinforced thick composite beam. Simulation results show that some of the applied GRMs helps reducing or even completely preventing the overheat phenomena that are well renown to induce significant thermal stresses negatively affecting the final object performances. These interesting effects would contribute reducing the time required for a single industrial production cycle, since no time for overheat dispersion is required, thus helping increasing the production rate.",

The uniformity of the Raman signal enhancement was studied by making large Raman maps. The relative enhancement of the Raman signal is demonstrated to be dependent on the functional groups, which was rationalized by the different doping levels of pristine, fluorinated and 4-nitrophenyl functionalized graphene substrates. The impact of the Fermi energy of graphene and the phonon energy of the molecules was considered together for the first time in order to explain the enhancement. Such approach enables to understand the enhancement without assuming anything about the uniformity of the molecules on the graphene surface. The agreement between the theory and our measured data was further demonstrated by varying excitation energy.",

    "abstract": "A remarkable property of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is the possibility to selectively address single valleys by circularly polarized light. In the context of technological applications, it is very important to understand possible intervalley coupling mechanisms. Here, we show how the Dexter-like intervalley coupling mixes A and B states from opposite valleys leading to a significant broadening γB 1s of the B 1s exciton. The effect is much more pronounced in tungsten-based TMDs, where the coupling excitonic states are quasi-resonant. We calculate a ratio γB B 1s /γA B 1s ≈ 4.0, which is in good agreement with the experimentally measured value of 3.9 ± 0.7. In addition to the broadening effect, the Dexter-like intervalley coupling also leads to a considerable energy renormalization resulting in an increased energetic distance between A 1s and B 1s states.",

A change in the phase of MoS2 from 2H to 1T transforms it from a semiconductor to conductor, thus broadening its potential applications in electronics. The structural transformation associated with the phase change may significantly affect the mechanical properties. Here we statistically characterized the elastic modulus and fracture strength of phase-changed single-layer MoS2 sheets using the atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation technique. MoS2 sheets were subjected to lithium intercalation, which transformed them from the 2H phase to the 1T phase. The transformed sheets were again annealed to make a partially phase-changed sample. The elastic modulus and fracture strength of 1T phase MoS2 were about 50% lower than those of 2H phase MoS2. Annealing of the 1T phase MoS2 sheet resulted in a good recovery of the mechanical properties, up to 90% of those of the original 2H phase MoS2. This result was attributed to a mixture of phases in the annealed product, and the ratio of the phases was evaluated spectroscopically. Interestingly, while the fracture strengths differed for the three phases, their average fracture strains were quite similar, suggesting that the overall structure of the material maintained its integrity during the phase transition process.",

The resistive transition under the magnetic fields is found to be well described by the thermally assisted collective flux creep model. The magnetic field dependence of activation energy barrier exhibits an enhancement at low fields, indicating a dimensional crossover from 2D to 1D vortex states in Mo2C crystals.

Our results show that the carrier lifetime of α-phase In2Se3 on mica is nearly independent of thickness and comparable to that of MoS2, and the efficient charge carrier separation occurs on Au substrate. Because all of the key parameters of In2Se3 nanoflakes that determine its photoresponsive behavior are of similar values to those of MoS2, we suggest that the interface effect, i.e. photogating effect and contact resistance, should be responsible for the dramatic photoresponsivity reported for field-effect transistor-type optoelectronic devices.",

We further demonstrate that tellurium nanoflakes with thicknesses as low as ~2 nm can be achieved by this strategy. Compared with the peak positions of bulk crystal, peak shifts in Raman spectra for the flakes fabricated on different substrates is an indication of substrate induced strain. The strain-induced band gap variations are probed by the optical studies, which exhibit large photoluminescence from as-prepared tellurium nanoflakes as compared with bulk tellurium. As-prepared nanoflakes further exhibit substrate-dependent structural properties, while maintaining excellent air-stability.

We analyse how magnetic flux, electric field, interlayer rotation angle, and interactions (treated at a mean field level) combine to produce a pseudo-QSH with broken time-reversal symmetry, and spin-polarized helical edge states. The effect is a consequence of a robust interaction-induced ferrimagnetic ordering of the Quantum Hall ground state under an interlayer bias, provided the two rotated layers are effectively decoupled at low energies. We discuss in detail the electronic structure, and the constraints on system parameters, such as the angle, interactions and magnetic flux, required to reach the pseudo-QSH phase. We find, in particular, that purely local electronic interactions are not sufficient to account for the experimental observations, which demand at least nearest-neighbour interactions to be included.",

We form a collimating contact in a hBN-encapsulated graphene hall bar by adding zigzag contacts on either side of an electron emitter that absorb stray electrons; collimation can be turned off by floating the zig-zag contacts. The electron beam is imaged using a liquid-He cooled scanning gate microscope (SGM). The tip deflects electrons as they pass from the collimating contact to a receiving contact on the opposite side of the channel, and an image of electron flow can be made by displaying the change in transmission as the tip is raster scanned across the sample. The angular half width Δθ of the electron beam is found by applying a perpendicular magnetic field B that bends electron paths into cyclotron orbits. The images reveal that the electron flow from the collimating contact drops quickly at B = 0.05 T when the electron orbits miss the receiving contact. The flow for the non-collimating case persists longer, up to B = 0.19 T, due to the broader range of entry angles. Ray-tracing simulations agree well with the experimental images. By fitting the fields B at which the magnitude of electron flow drops in the experimental SGM images, we find Δθ = 9° for electron flow from the collimating contact, compared with Δθ = 54° for the non-collimating case.",

We propose a new concept for spin amplification that will allow a small spin current in a non-magnetic spin channel to control the magnetization of an attached ferromagnet. The key step is to bring the ferromagnet into an unstable symmetric state (USS), so that a small spin transfer torque from a small spin current can provide a magnetic bias to control the spontaneous symmetry breaking and select the final magnetization direction of the ferromagnet. Two proposed methods for achieving the USS configuration are voltage-controlled Curie temperature (VC-TC) and voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VC-MA). We believe the development of new 2D magnetic materials with greater tunability of VC-TC and VC-MA will be needed for practical applications. A successful realization of spin amplification by controlled symmetry breaking will be important for the implementation of existing spin-logic proposals (e.g. 'all spin logic') and could inspire alternative ideas for spintronic circuits and devices.",

Strain-induced pLLs yield enhanced scattering effects across the energy spectrum resulting in lower mean free path and enhanced localization effects. In the vicinity of the zeroth order pLL, we demonstrate an anomalous transport regime, where the mean free paths increases with disorder. We attribute this puzzling behavior to the low-energy sub-lattice polarization induced by the zeroth order pLL, which is unique to pseudomagnetic fields preserving time-reversal symmetry.

However, sophisticated roles of seeding promoter remain unclear. Here, adopting triangular-shaped crystal violet (CV) consisting of nonpolar and polar parts as the seeding promoter, we study the role of seeding promoter for the growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ). We systematically control the geometrical configuration of CV on SiO 2 /Si substrate by changing the solvent polarity and find that it strongly affects the growth of monolayer or multilayer MoS 2 domains via CVD. Monolayer MoS 2 domains were predominantly grown on randomly lying-down CV configurations on SiO 2 /Si substrate, whereas multilayer MoS 2 domains are synthesized at concentrated polar parts in CV micelle on the substrate. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the initial nucleation step for the MoS 2 growth is the adsorption of S on CV and the most favourable S adsorption site is the polar part in CV. Furthermore, it is found that the CV adsorption to SiO 2 is mediated by the polar CV part and additionally strengthened in the lying-down CV configuration. Enhancing the thermal stability as well as hindering the re-aggregation of CV at high temperature, the lying down CV configuration allows the predominant growth of monolayer MoS 2 . This work provides a general framework to understand the growth of MoS 2 from aromatic seeding promoters.",

The so-called A, B and C excitonic features are precisely identified, and significant differences with respect to literature data of WS2 on fused silica are highlighted. Since this investigation is based on SE, the complex dielectric function of WS2 is retrieved without performing Kramers Kronig analysis, which is instead necessary when employing reflectance or transmittance spectroscopy. Furthermore, the approach described in this work can be used in principle to characterize any two-dimensional flakes, both in terms of complex dielectric function and percentage of surface coverage.",

    "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) self-supporting materials are a class of promising catalysts for electrochemical water splitting, because 3D materials can not only effectively prevent the catalyst from falling off by the generated vigorous H2 or O2 bubbles, but also provide large catalytically active surface areas by designing porous structures. However, the relationship between anion species and their electrocatalytic performances of such materials in alkaline media has not been clearly known. Herein, a simple strategy is used to grow NiFe-based hydroxides/oxides/phosphides (NiFe-X, X = OH, O, P) nanosheet arrays directly on nickel foam (NF) as electrode materials for overall water splitting. We found that the electrocatalytic activity is strongly dependent on the composition of the prepared 3D composites. The electrochemical results reveal that the NiFeP-NF shows the highest electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with ultra-low overpotentials of 194 and 220 mV to reach the current densities of 20 and 50 mA cm−2, while the NiFeO-NF has the highest catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential of 162 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2. In addition, both materials exhibit high long-term durability. Based on the excellent catalytic properties for OER and HER, the two catalysts are then assembled as cathode and anode, respectively, and only 1.58 V is needed to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting. This work presents a strategy to fabricate excellent OER and HER catalysts for electrochemical water splitting and demonstrates the effects of various anion species on the catalytic activities of transition metal-based nanosheet materials.",

As such, it is possible to substantially polarize valley excitons with chiral light and furthermore create coherent superpositions of K and K' polarized states. Yet, at ambient conditions dephasing usually becomes too dominant, and valley coherence typically is not observable. Here, we demonstrate that valley coherence is, however, clearly observable for a single monolayer of WSe2, if it is strongly coupled to the optical mode of a high quality factor microcavity. The azimuthal vector, representing the phase of the valley coherent superposition, can be directly manipulated by applying magnetic fields, and furthermore, it sensibly reacts to the polarization anisotropy of the cavity which represents an artificial magnetic field. Our results are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with our model based on pseudospin rate equations, accounting for both effects of real and pseudo-magnetic fields.",

Conventional processing techniques inevitably modify graphene's intrinsic properties by introducing adsorbents and/or defects which limit device performance and understanding the intrinsic properties of graphene. Here we demonstrate femtosecond laser direct patterning of graphene microstructures, without the aid of resists or other chemicals, that enables us to study both intrinsic and extrinsic effects on the graphene–metal interface. The pulsed femtosecond laser was configured to ablate epitaxial graphene (EG) on a sub-micrometer scale and form a precisely defined region without damaging the surrounding material or substrate. The ablated area was sufficient to electrically isolate transfer length measurement structures and Hall devices for subsequent transport measurements. Using pristine and systematically contaminated surfaces, we found that Ni does not form bonds to EG synthesized on SiC in contrast to the well-known C–Ni bond formation for graphene synthesized on metals; known as end-contacting. Without end-contacting, the contact resistance (RC) of Ni to pristine and resist-contaminated EG are one and two orders of magnitude larger, respectively, than the intrinsic quantum limited contact resistance. The range of reported RC values is explained using carrier transmission probability, as exemplified by the Landauer–Büttiker model, which is dependent on the presence or absence of end-contacts and dopant/work-function mediated conduction. The model predicts the need for both end-contacts and a clean graphene–metal interface as necessary conditions to approach quantum limited contact resistance.",

Key remaining challenges for producing practical devices from these materials lie in improving the coupling of light into and out of single atomic layers, and in making these layers robust to the influence of their surrounding environment. We present a solution to tackle both of these problems simultaneously, by deterministically placing a micro-lens directly onto the surface of these materials. These lenses are dynamically tuned to increase the coupling of light, whilst controlling chromatic aberration, before being set in place with UV light. We show that this approach enhances photoluminescence of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayers by up to 300%, and nearly doubles the imaging resolution of the system. Furthermore, this solution fully encapsulates the monolayer, preventing it from physical damage and degradation in air. The optical solution we have developed could become a key enabling technology for the mass production of ultra-thin optical devices, such as quantum light emitting diodes.",

Two-dimensional (2D) Bi-based semiconductor nanomaterial (Bi2OS2) can be a potential material for improving the charge carrier mobility in the active layer of PSCs, because it exhibits a high carrier mobility, suitable band gap, wide absorption range, and good stability. In this work, we synthesize the 2D Bi2OS2 nanomaterial and incorporate it into active layer of PSCs as a third component for the first time. By introduction 1 wt% 2D Bi2OS2 nanomaterial into the PSCs, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs can be obviously improved by more than 17% comparison with binary PSCs (from 10.51% to 12.31%). The enhancement of PCE is mainly due to the improving of charge transport, surface morphology, and crystallization of active layer. It is worth noting that the 2D Bi2OS2 play the role of the heterogeneous nucleation in the active layer, resulting in the enhanced crystallization of PBDB-T and ITIC. These results not only provide a way to improve the performance of PSCs, but also show that the 2D Bi2OS2 nanomaterial has great potential application in the PSCs.",

    "abstract": "The interlayer tunneling resistivity (Rint) and Thomas-Fermi charge screening effects play critical roles in the carrier transport of two-dimensional (2D) multilayer devices. For example, the vertical electric field modifies the Rint, resulting in a channel migration along the c-axis. However, because Rint varies considerably with the drain electric field in addition to the vertical field, the effective contribution of each layer to the total current varies with the drain bias (VD). Here, we demonstrate a drain induced barrier increasing (DIBI) in 2D multilayer rhenium disulfide (ReS2) as a possible reverse short channel effect (rSCE). The reported decoupled layer interaction and much higher interlayer resistivity of ReS2 compared to other 2D materials allow us to observe the DIBI clearly. As VD increases, the effective amplitude of Rint decreases dramatically, leading to (i) the increase of off-current, (ii) the enhancement of field-effect mobility, and (iii) the blue shift of the flat band voltage (VFB), which is in sharp contrast to a previous report on a short-channel bulk-Si device with drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL). We attribute this difference to the weakened Fermi level (EF) tunability when the channel migrates from the bottom to the top surface of ReS2, and to an opposite electrostatic force resulting from VD, implying the increased importance of VD-dependent Rint in the carrier transport mechanism of 2D multilayer systems. The VD-dependent Coulomb scattering parameter probed via a low frequency (LF) noise analysis provides deeper insights for the channel shift. Our findings pave the way for understanding and exploiting the fundamental charge transport mechanism in 2D multilayer systems.",

Recently it has been shown that heterojunctions of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides have sharp and epitaxial interfaces that can be used to the next generation of flexible and on chip optoelectronic devices. Here, we show that second harmonic generation (SHG) can be used as an optical tool to reveal these atomically sharp interfaces in different lateral heterostructures. We observed an enhancement of the SH intensity at the heterojunctions, and showed that is due to a coherent superposition of the SH emission from each material. This constructive interference pattern reveals a phase difference arising from the distinct second-order susceptibilities of both materials at the interface. Our results demonstrate that SHG microscopy is a sensitive characterization technique to unveil nanometric features in layered materials and their heterostructures.",

    "abstract": "Constructing a new topological structure with unique ordered channels for rapid potassiation kinetics is crucial to ameliorating the inherent drawbacks of carbon anodes, arising from the large K-ion radius, such as huge volume expansion, slow diffusion rate, and poor interfacial transfer dynamics. Herein, dihydrogen- and nitrogen/hydrogen-substituted rhombic graphynes (HH-rGY, NH-rGY) were synthesized through a mechanochemical cross-coupling method using specific D2h-symmetric tetrahalogenated organic molecules and alkynyl-containing calcium carbide as precursors. The pyridinic-N atoms in NH-rGY can efficiently manipulate electron distribution and tailor structural arrangement, endowing unique AA'-stacking mode with ordered vertical rhombic channels, broad interlayer spacing of 4.1 Å (1.16 times to that of HH-rGY), and negligible volumetric expansion (<3%) during potassiation, which are studied by experimental investigation and theoretical calculations. Instead of a common capacitive-dominated storage mechanism, intercalation-dominated K-storage is verified in rhombic graphynes by quantitative kinetics analysis. Especially, the NH-rGY electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 230 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 (90.2% after 500 cycles), 97 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 and retains 146 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 5000 cycles, owing to outstanding structural stability and rapid in-plane and inter-layer K+ diffusion. This work proposes a universal mechanochemical cross-coupling synthetic methodology and brings new insight into the topological structure design of carbon skeletons for high-performance potassium storage.",

However, there is no experimental data demonstrating the layer-number dependence of photovoltaic effects (PVEs) in vertical TMD heterojunctions. Here, by combining scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) with optical probes, we report the first layer-dependence of photocurrents in WSe 2 /WS 2 vertical heterostructures as well as in pristine WS 2 and WSe 2 layers. For WS 2 , we find that photocurrents increase with increasing layer thickness, whereas for WSe 2 the layer dependence is more complex and depends on both the layer number and applied bias ( V b ). We further find that photocurrents in the WSe 2 /WS 2 heterostructures exhibit anomalous layer and material-type dependent behaviors. Our results advance the understanding of photoresponse in atomically thin WSe 2 /WS 2 heterostructures and pave the way to novel nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "A mismatch of atomic registries between single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructure produces a moiré superlattice with a periodic potential, which can be fine-tuned by introducing a twist angle between the materials. This approach is promising both for controlling the interactions between the TMDs and for engineering their electronic band structures, yet direct observation of the changes to the electronic structure introduced with varying twist angle has so far been missing. Here, we probe heterobilayers comprised of single-layer MoS2 and WS2 with twist angles ranging from 2° to 20° and determine the twist angle-dependent evolution of the electronic band structure using micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find strong interlayer hybridization between MoS2 and WS2 electronic states at the G-point of the Brillouin zone, leading to a shift of the valence band maximum in the heterostructure. Replicas of the hybridized states are observed at the center of twist angle-dependent moiré mini Brillouin zones. We confirm that these replica features arise from the inherent moiré potential by comparing our experimental observations with density functional theory calculations of the superlattice dispersion. Our direct visualization of these features underscores the potential of using twisted heterobilayer semiconductors to engineer hybrid electronic states and superlattices that alter the electronic and optical properties of 2D heterostructures for a wide range of twist angles.",

Due to the number and density of possible states, attributing different spectral peaks to the specific origin can be difficult. In particular, there has been much conjecture around the presence, binding energy and/or nature of biexcitons in these materials. In this work, we remove any ambiguity in identifying and separating the optically excited biexciton in monolayer WS 2 using two-quantum multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (2Q-MDCS), a technique that directly and selectively probes doubly-excited states, such as biexcitons. The energy difference between the unbound two-exciton state and the biexciton is the fundamental definition of biexciton binding energy and is measured to be 26 ± 2 meV. Furthermore, resolving the biexciton peaks in 2Q-MDCS allows us to identify that the biexciton observed here is composed of two bright excitons in opposite valleys.",

The weak interaction between the functionalized MBenes and MoS 2 results in MoS 2 retaining its original intrinsic properties while significantly reducing the Fermi level pinning effect; this, is perfectly consistent with the revised Schottky–Mott model after considering charge redistribution. Combined with band calculations and device local projection density of states, MoS 2 /TiBO, MoS 2 /TiBF, and MoS 2 /MoBO, either with the vertical hole Schottky barrier or the lateral hole Schottky barrier, are negative, forming p-type ohmic contacts.

By comparing results of density functional calculations with experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results, we explore the hybridisation between the valence states of the TMD and hBN layers, and show that it introduces avoided crossings between the TMD and hBN bands, with umklapp processes opening `ghost' avoided crossings in individual bands. Comparison between DFT and ARPES spectra for the MoSe$_2$/hBN heterostructure shows that the valence bands of MoSe$_2$ and hBN are significantly further separated in energy in experiment as compared to DFT. We then show that a novel scissor operator can be applied to the hBN valence states in the DFT calculations, to correct the band alignment and enable quantitative comparison to ARPES, explaining avoided crossings and other features of band visibility in the ARPES spectra.",

As an emerging family of two-dimensional (2D) materials, MXenes have been attracting extensive interests for constructing osmotic membrane due to its natural 2D nanoconfined space, hydrophilicity and abundant surface terminations. The regulation of the surface charge density of MXenes plays an important role for the improvement of osmotic energy conversion. Herein, we systematically investigate Mo 2 TiC 2 T x MXene membranes for osmotic energy harvesting. Benefitting from the improved surface negative-charged density treated by alkali solution, and the 2D nanoconfined space, the Mo 2 TiC 2 T x MXene membrane shows improved cation selectivity and permeability performance. The osmotic voltage ( V os ) increases to 83 mV with an improved cation transference number ( t + ) of 0.95 at 0.5 M/0.01 M alkali KCl solution (pH = 9), while osmotic voltage ( V os ) is 74 mV with a cation transference number ( t + ) of 0.9 at 0.5 M/0.01 M alkali KCl solution (pH = 7). The output power density ( P max ) reaches up to 13.1 W m −2 with an energy conversion efficiency ( η max ) of 40.5% at 0.5 M/0.01 M alkali KCl solution (pH = 9), which is superior to many of other 2D osmotic membranes. The modification of surface charge density for Mo 2 TiC 2 T x MXene membrane may pave a way for improving the performance of MXene based osmotic energy harvesting.",

Widefield nitrogen-vacancy (NV) microscopy allows rapid, quantitative magnetic imaging across entire vdW flakes, ideal for capturing changes in the micromagnetic structure due to an electric current. Here we use a widefield NV microscope to study the effect of current injection in thin flakes (∼10 nm) of the vdW ferromagnet Fe 3 GeTe 2 (FGT). We first observe current-reduced coercivity on an individual domain level, where current injection in FGT causes substantial reduction in the magnetic field required to locally reverse the magnetisation. We then explore the possibility of current-induced domain-wall motion, and provide preliminary evidence for such a motion under relatively low current densities, suggesting the existence of strong current-induced torques in our devices. Our results illustrate the applicability of widefield NV microscopy to imaging spintronic phenomena in vdW magnets, highlight the possibility of efficient magnetization control by direct current injection without assistance from an adjacent conductor, and motivate further investigations of the effect of currents in FGT and other vdW magnets.",

In this work, we studied SnS in which the layers are stacked in a ferroelectric manner both experimentally and theoretically. We utilized polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy to investigate numerous flakes of ferroelectric SnS few layers on mica substrates. We found the SHG polar patterns dramatically varied in the range of 800 nm and 1000 nm due to the frequency-dependent SHG susceptibilities. First-principles calculations have been performed to study the frequency-dependent and layer-dependent SHG susceptibilities in the ferroelectric SnS with AA and AC stacking orders. The variation trend of calculated SHG polar patterns as a function of frequency agrees well with that of the experimental results. Since polarization-resolved SHG is a noncontact and nondestructive technique to determine the crystal orientation, understanding of its properties is important, especially for monitoring the transition of different ferroic phases.",

However, the poor conductivity of sulfur and the ‘shuttle effect’ of polysulfides still impede their practical applications. In this study, thin layered MXene nanosheets sandwiched by conductive poly(m-phenylenediamine) with in-plane cylindrical mesochannels (mPmPD/MXene) are constructed as sulfur hosts for the cathode materials of Li–S batteries. The polar active sites on MXene and mesoporous conductive PmPD polymers synergistically alleviate the polysulfide shuttling through chemisorption and physical confinement; the high metallic conductivity of MXene and conductive PmPD ensure the transport of electrons and promote the redox kinetics; the in-plane cylindrical mesochannels on mPmPD/MXene provide hosting space for high sulfur loading (∼71 wt%) and facilitate smooth electrolyte transport in the internal space of the cathode. Profiting from these advantages, the Li–S battery based on the mPmPD/MXene cathode exhibits a capacity decay of 0.0593% after 800 cycles at 1 C (53% capacity retention). The optimized battery shows stable cycling performance even at high sulfur loading (6.8 mg cm −2 ) with 5.6 mAh cm −2 capacity remained after 60 cycles at 0.1 C.

However, the multi-faceted role of these halide salts in modulating the properties and quality of TMD monolayers remains mechanistically unclear. In this study, by introducing excessive gaseous sodium chloride (NaCl) into the CVD system, we demonstrate that preferential NaCl deposition along the monolayer edges causes large in situ strain that can invoke localized domains of high defect density and 2H to 1T phase transition. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, Raman mapping and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that higher NaCl concentrations can promote the coalescence of independent local strain domains, further increasing the 1T/2H phase ratio and defect density. Furthermore, excessive NaCl was also proven by density functional theory calculations to convert thermodynamic growth to kinetic growth, accounting for the unique cloud-shaped MoS 2 crystals acquired. Compared with post-growth strain processing methods, this one-step approach for phase and defect engineering not only represents a deeper understanding of the role that NaCl plays in the CVD process, but also provides a convenient means to controllably synthesize conductive/defect-rich materials for further electrocatalysis and optoelectronic applications.",

However, the current understanding of the influence of the twist angle for interlayer excitons (IXs) in heterostructures is mainly limited to momentum-direct K – K transitions. In this work, we use a judicious combination of spectroscopy and many-particle theory to investigate the influence of the twist angle on momentum-indirect IXs of a MoSe 2 /MoS 2 heterostructure. Here, the energetically lowest state is a dark and strongly hybridized ΓK exciton. We show that increasing the twist angle from an aligned structure (0 ∘ or 60 ∘ ) gives rise to a large blue shift of the IX, which is a manifestation of the strong dehybridization of this state. Moreover, for small twist angle heterostructures, our photoluminescence measurements reveal contributions from two IX states, which our modelling attributes to transitions from different moiré minibands. Our finding contributes to a better fundamental understanding of the influence of the moiré pattern on the hybridization of momentum-dark IX states, which may be important for applications in moiré-tronics including novel quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Optoelectronics with two dimensional (2D) heterostructures combining transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and other semiconductors in hybrid stacks is potentially promising because of the possibility of fabricating devices with high efficiency and new properties. Ultrafast charge transfer across the interface and long lifetime of carriers makes the vertical geometry attractive with respect to traditional bulk heterostructures. In such ultrathin structures, the multiple boundaries and the thickness of each material play a key role in the interaction of light with the device and can strongly influence the device performance. In this article we study light harvesting in 2D InSe/MoS2 semiconductor heterostructures by measuring Raman enhancement or attenuation as a function of layer thicknesses. Measurements are precisely reproduced by the calculation of the light emission, and the field distribution inside the heterostructure. Optimizing layer thickness and material interfaces has a significant effect on the light distribution in such 2D heterostructures with layer thickness in the region of a few tens of nanometers, providing a means to enhance the performance of emerging 2D semiconductor-heterostructure optoelectronics.",

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet–ozone (UVO) and oxygen plasma are widely used to modify the surface of materials because these processes are facile and accessible. These dry oxidation treatments are also commonly applied to 2D graphene and are presumed to induce similar oxidation effects on the graphene surface. However, in this work, these treatments are revealed to induce the formation of different types of defects on the surface of graphene because the UVO treatment causes a chemical reaction, whereas the oxygen plasma treatment causes both physical and chemical reactions. The oxygen plasma treatment results mainly in topological defects, which effectively induce the attachment of oxygen atoms onto the treated surface; by contrast, the UVO treatment induces only the attachment of oxygen atoms onto the treated surface, without inducing lattice distortion. These results are confirmed mainly by atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Using such facile dry oxidation treatments, we experimentally modified the surface states of graphene at the atomic scale.",

Flaws created during crystal growth or fabrication lead to spatial variations in the bandgap of 2D materials that can be characterized through photoluminescence measurements. We show a simple setup involving an angle-adjustable transmission filter, simple optics and a CCD camera can capture spatially-dependent photoluminescence to produce complex maps of unique information from 2D monolayers. Atomic force microscopy is used to verify the origin of the optical signature measured, demonstrating that it results from nanometer-scale imperfections. This solution to optical identification with 2D materials could be employed as a robust security measure to prevent counterfeiting.",

Here we present the insight into structural and morphological organization of biomolecules on graphene in water, using an RNA hairpin as a model system. We show that the key parameters governing the RNA's behavior on the graphene surface are the number of graphene layers, RNA concentration, and temperature. At high concentrations, the RNA forms a film on the graphene surface with entrapped nanobubbles. The density and the size of the bubbles depend on the number of graphene layers. At lower concentrations, unfolded RNA stacks on the graphene and forms molecular clusters on the surface. Such a control over the conformational behavior of interacting biomolecules at graphene/water interfaces would facilitate new applications of graphene derivatives in biotechnology and biomedicine.",

Here, we demonstrate that a novel mesoscopic superconductivity at ambient pressure arises on the surface of MoTe2 with a critical temperature up to 5 K significantly exceeding the bulk Tc=0.1K. We measured the derivatives of I-V curves for metallic hetero-contacts of MoTe2 with Ag or Cu, homo-contacts of MoTe2 as well as \"soft\" point contacts (PCs). Large number of these hetero-contacts exhibit a dV/dI dependence, which is characteristic for Andreev reflection. It allows to determine the superconducting gap \\Delta. The average gap values are 2\\Delta=1.30+/-0.15 meV with a 2\\Delta/kBTc ratio of 3.7+/-0.4, which slightly exceeds the standard BCS value of 3.52. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the gap follows a BCS-like behavior, which points to a nodeless superconducting order parameter with some strong-coupling renormalization. Remarkably, the observation of a \"gapless-like\" single minimum in the dV/dI of \"soft\" PCs may indicate a topological superconducting state of the MoTe2 surface as these contacts probe mainly the interface and avoid additional pressure effect. Therefore, MoTe2 might be a suitable material to study new forms of topological superconductivity.",

However, there has been possibility of the channel layer being damaged during the upper dielectric deposition process. Because several layers of 2D TMDCs are atomically thin, the damage may significantly degrade the overall electrical performance. In this study, we investigated the damage to molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) during the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of single dielectrics of Al2O3 and ZrO2. We observed the MoS2 layers were damaged, depending on the ALD process conditions; the kind of oxidant and the growth temperature. To reduce the damage, we formed a bi-layered Al2O3/ZrO2 dielectric structure by developing a two-step ALD process. It is notable that the electrical performance of the device was significantly improved compared to those using the single dielectrics, indicating this two-step process is a promising candidate to satisfy the requirements of future 2D TMDCs-based electronics.",

In particular, inhomogeneity in the residual strain (pre-strain) of the graphene membrane may affect the vibration dynamics as well as the energy dissipation. Despite its importance, achieving a precise local mapping of the pre-strain of a graphene membrane remains challenging. Here, we correlate scanning-probe force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy to map the local mechanical properties of circular monolayer-graphene drums. At odds with other techniques, we obtain maps of the membrane pre-strain with nanometric resolution and measure the effective Young's modulus in a non-invasive way. Moreover, we show that the common topographic artefacts stemming from tip-induced deformations can be precisely corrected using the information derived from force-spectroscopy data. As a result, the local map of the pre-strain can be correlated with the true morphology of the graphene drum. Our analysis demonstrates that graphene resonators can be characterized by a non-flat morphology and a non-uniform pre-strain distribution, as a consequence of complex boundary conditions at the edge of the membrane and in correlation with local material defects. Since these non-ideal features are strictly related to the growth and the fabrication procedures, our method can provide a useful screening tool for the development of 2D materials-based NEMSs.",

Here, we report the observation of a systematic evolution of the sign change process of Hanle spin precession signal in the graphene nonlocal spintronic devices at room temperature. By tuning the interface tunnel resistances of the ferromagnetic contacts to graphene, different transformation processes of Hanle spin precession signal are probed in a controlled manner by tuning the injection bias current/voltage. Detailed analysis and first-principles calculations indicate a possible magnetic proximity and the energy dependent electronic structure of the ferromagnet-graphene interface can be responsible for the sign change process of the spin signal and open a new perspective to realize a spin-switch at very low bias-current or voltage.",

The brightened dark exciton, on the other hand, exhibits vanishing V P , indicating long valley relaxation time.Remarkably, the inter-valley bright-dark biexciton shows unconventional behavior with an inverted V P .The opposite V P for intra-and inter-valley bright-dark biexcitons, coupled with their large valley splitting and long valley lifetime may facilitate their coherent manipulation for quantum computing.",

Here, we investigate the response of -MoS2 to the electron irradiation by ab initio molecular dynamics means. Our simulations suggest that an electron beam with energy smaller than 75 keV does not result in any knock-on damage. The displacement threshold energies are different for the two nonequivalent sulfur atoms in -MoS2 and strongly depend on whether the top or bottom chalcogen layer is considered. As a result, a careful tuning of the beam energy can promote the formation of ordered defects in the sample. We further discuss the effect of the electron irradiation in the neighborhood of a defective site, the mobility of the sulfur vacancies created and their tendency to aggregate. Overall, our work provides useful guidelines for the imaging and the defect engineering of -MoS2 using electron microscopy.",

Liquid-induced damage to SiO2-bound graphene was previously observed with a range of solvents. A recently developed microdroplet system, used for a detailed examination of this behaviour, reveals that few-layer graphene flakes down to a bi-layer are stable with respect to aqueous electrolyte droplet formation, but the stability of these droplets is significantly reduced on monolayer graphene and irreversible rupture of the underlying graphene flake occurs. This damage, which we attribute to the presence of nanoscale defects and high adhesion between the graphene and the substrate, seems specific to plasma-cleaned SiO2 substrates and is not observed on flakes transferred to other substrates. Furthermore, the introduction of impurities, in the form of both polymer residues and native impurities between the flake and the SiO2 substrate, significantly enhance graphene's immunity to external strain as shown by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.",

Here, we perform local probe measurements on single-layer h-BN grown over graphene and highlight the manifestation of a proximity effect that significantly affects the electronic properties of h-BN due to its coupling with the underlying graphene. We find electronic states originating from the graphene layer and the Cu substrate to be injected into the wide electronic gap of the h-BN top layer. Such proximity effect is further confirmed in a study of the variation of h-BN in-gap states with interlayer couplings, elucidated using a combination of topographical/spectroscopic measurements and first-principles density functional theory calculations. The findings of this work indicate the potential of mutually engineering electronic properties of the components of vdW heterostructures.",

We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with ab initio modelling to extract the Eliashberg function and EPC for both substrates. This allows us to quantitatively assess the environmental effects for both Au and Ge substrates on superconductivity in graphene. We show that for semiconducting Ge substrates, the doping level and EPC are higher.

However, the diffraction limit poses ultimate device size limits for conventional photonics that can potentially be circumvented by exploiting nano-plasmonic effects to achieve deep-subwavelength optical confinement. Integrable efficient light sources are key requirements for on-chip plasmonic interconnects and recently, monolayer transition metal dichalcognides (TMDs) have shown significant potential for the use as high efficiency optical emitters at room temperature due to their direct bandgap, extremely high exciton binding energies and large quantum efficiency. First studies on coupling plasmonic waveguides and TMD flakes have demonstrated plasmonic excitation and guiding of light. We show a enhancement of the photoluminescence intensity for a hybrid system consisting of a MoSe2 monolayer and lithographically fabricated nano-plasmonic slot waveguides. Beside this indication of enhanced light-matter interaction, the plasmonic guiding of light in strongly sub-wavelength waveguide modes exhibiting a transverse mode area of with propagation lengths of () nm is demonstrated. The integration of 2D materials with deterministic routing paves the way toward novel small footprint, deep-subwavelength on-chip light sources.",

By means of angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we have shown that below a Curie temperature, at 15–20 K, a spontaneous anomalously large energy gap at the Kramers point appears up to 90 and 125 meV depending on the V concentration (0.5 and 2%, respectively). Nevertheless, spin-resolved measurements show only a weak out-of-plane spin polarization both for the V 3d-resonances and the Rashba states owing to the presence of magnetic domains with opposite magnetic moments spontaneously generated without external magnetic field. Above a Curie temperature the out-of-plane spin polarization for the V 3d-resonances and 2D Rashba electron gas can be also induced by circularly polarized SR reversed in dependence on the chirality of circular polarization. It is followed by opening the energy gap at the Kramers point that confirms the induced magnetization. We connect the SR–induced out-of-plane spin polarization with a SR–derived hole generation leading to corresponding uncompensated spin accumulation in 2D Rashba electron gas with transferring the induced torque to the diluted V 3d-ions.

We also found that the magnetoresistive behavior of ultra-thin WTe2 devices is well-captured by a two-fluid model. According to the model, the change of MR could be as large as 400 000%, the largest potential change of MR among all materials known, if the ultra-thin samples are tuned to neutrality when preserving the mobility of 167 000 cm2 V−1 s−1 observed in bulk samples. Our findings show the prospects of ultra-thin WTe2 as a variable magnetoresistance material in future applications such as magnetic field sensors, information storage and extraction devices, and galvanic isolators.

    "abstract": "Polyaromatic carbon is widely held to be strongly diamagnetic and hydrophobic, with textbook van der Waals and 'π-stacked' binding of hydrocarbons, which disrupt their self-assembled supramolecular structures. The NMR of organic molecules sequestered by polyaromatic carbon is expected to be dominated by shielding from the orbital diamagnetism of π electrons. We report the first evidence of very different polar and magnetic behavior in water, wherein graphene remained well-dispersed after extensive dialysis and behaved as a 1H-NMR-silent ghost. Magnetic effects dominated the NMR of organic structures which interacted with graphene, with changes in spin–spin coupling, vast increase in relaxation, line broadening and decrease in NMR peak heights when bound to graphene. However, the interactions were weak, reversible and did not disrupt organic self-assemblies reliant on hydrophobic 'π-stacking', even when substantially sequestered on the surface of graphene by the high surface area available. Interacting assemblies of aromatic molecules retained their strongly-shielded NMR signals and remained within self-assembled structures, with slower rates of diffusion from association with graphene, but with no further shielding from graphene. Binding to graphene was selective for positively-charged organic assemblies, weaker for non-aromatic and negligible for strongly-negatively-charged molecules, presumably repelled by a negative zeta potential of graphene in water. Stronger binders, or considerable excess of weaker binders readily reversed physisorption, with no evidence of structural changes from chemisorption. The fundamental nature of these different electronic interactions between organic and polyaromatic carbon is considered with relevance to electronics, charge storage, sensor, medical, pharmaceutical and environmental research.",

Revealing the graphene growth mechanism at the atomic-scale is of great importance for realizing single crystal graphene (SCG) over wafer scale. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations are playing an increasingly important role in revealing the structure of the most stable carbon species, understanding the evolution processes, and disclosing the active sites. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful surface characterization tool to illustrate the real space distribution and atomic structures of growth intermediates during the CVD process. Combining them together can provide valuable information to improve the atomically controlled growth of SCG. Starting from a basic concept of the substrate effect on realizing SCG, this review covers the progress made in theoretical investigations on various carbon species during graphene growth on different transition metal substrates, in the STM study of the structural intermediates on transition metal surfaces, and in synthesizing graphene nanoribbons with atomic-precise width and edge structure, ending with a perspective on the future development of 2D materials beyond graphene.",

    "abstract": "Thin-film wearable electronics are required to be directly laminated on to human skin for reliable, sensitive bio-sensing but with minimal irritation to the user after long-time use. Excellent heat management films with strongly anisotropic thermal conductivity (K) and adequate breathability are increasingly desirable for shielding the skin from heating while allowing the skin to breathe properly. Here, interfacial self-assembly of a graphene oxide (GO) film covering an ambient-dried bacterial cellulose aerogel (AD-BCA) film followed by laser reduction was proposed to prepare laser-reduced GO (L-rGO)/AD-BCA bilayered films. The AD-BCA substrate provides low cross-plane K (K⊥ ≈ 0.052 W mK−1), high breathability, and high compressive and tensile resistance by 'partially' inheriting the pore structure from bacterial cellulose (BC) gel. The introduction of an upper L-rGO film, which is only 0.31 wt% content, dramatically increases the in-plane K (K//) from 0.3 W mK−1 in AD-BCA to 10.72 W mK−1 owing to the highly in-plane oriented, continuous, uniform assembling geometry of the GO film; while K⊥ decreases to a lower value of 0.033 W mK−1, mainly owing to the air pockets between L-rGO multilayers caused by the laser reduction. The bilayered films achieve a K///K⊥ of 325, which is substantially larger even than that of graphite and similar polymer composites. They permit high transmission rates for water vapor (416.78 g/m2/day, >204 g/m2/day of normal skin) and O2 (449.35 cm3/m2/day). The combination of strongly anisotropic thermal conductivity and adequate breathability facilitates applications in heat management in on-skin electronics.",

In contrast to previous studies, a density functional theory (DFT) treatment including van der Waals (vdW) corrections predicts that the thermo-structural properties do not lead to a phase transition from BP to bP. To account for entropic (i.e. finite temperature) effects on the stability of materials deposited on a substrate within a first-principles framework, we develop an algorithm to investigate phonons properties at the interface between the phosphorus layers and a metallic substrate. This approach greatly reduces the computational cost and makes it possible to use DFT to model vibrational properties of systems with hundreds of atoms, and especially those that can be separated into weakly interacting sub-systems. It also allows for the description of interfacial shear and breathing-like modes, which enter in the evaluation of finite temperature effects via the Helmholtz free energy. In contrast to the freestanding case, we find that bP is energetically more stable than BP adsorbed on Au(1 1 1) with an energy difference between these two phases equal to 46 meV/atom at room temperature.",

    "abstract": "The relaxation of complex excitons in 2D materials is a topic of immense interest, due to their relevance in various optical and optoelectronic applications. In particular, relatively little is known regarding the dynamics in directly-synthesized heterostructures of dissimilar 2D materials, which are prototype architectures for atomically-thin optoelectronic devices. In this work, we have investigated vertical heterostructures (VH) of as-grown MoSe2 on MoS2. Specifically, we studied spatially-resolved photoluminescence at room and low temperatures, thermal stability and power dependence through photoluminescence spectroscopy combined with atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The VH structure forms a Moiré pattern which was observed by high-resolution STEM imaging. At room temperature, we observed a tenfold suppression of the neutral exciton of MoSe2 in the VH area compared with individual MoSe2 layer, due to negative charge transfer from MoSe2 to MoS2. As a result, trions were found in MoS2. At low temperature, the intensity of the neutral exciton from the MoS2 in the VH area is suppressed. The thermal quenching of the neutral exciton at temperatures below 140 K is related to the trapping of the neutral excitons in mid-gap states induced by defects. These states are effective at trapping excitons to form bound excitons. Finally, using power dependence experiments, we identified three types of the excitonic complexes at 77 K besides the neutral exciton: trions, biexcitons and bound excitons.",

Surface-science studies on this material are of great interest, but they are hampered by bP's high reactivity to oxygen and water, a major challenge to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments. As a consequence, the large majority of these studies were performed by cleaving a bulk crystal in situ. Here we present a study of surface modifications on exfoliated bP flakes upon consecutive annealing steps, up to 550 C, well above the sublimation temperature of bP. In particular, our attention is focused on the temperature range 375 C - 400 C, when sublimation starts, and a controlled desorption from the surface occurs alongside with the formation of characteristic well-aligned craters. There is an open debate in the literature about the crystallographic orientation of these craters, whether they align along the zigzag or the armchair direction. Thanks to the atomic resolution provided by STM, we are able to identify the orientation of the craters with respect to the bP crystal: the long axis of the craters is aligned along the zigzag direction of bP. This allows us to solve the controversy, and, moreover, to provide insight in the underlying desorption mechanism leading to crater formation.",

    "abstract": "Chlorine-doped tungsten disulfide monolayer (1L-WS2) with tunable charge carrier concentration has been realized by pulsed laser irradiation of the atomically thin lattice in a precursor gas atmosphere. This process gives rise to a systematic shift of the neutral exciton peak towards lower energies, indicating reduction of the crystal's electron density. The capability to progressively tune the carrier density upon variation of the exposure time is demonstrated; this indicates that the Fermi level shift is directly correlated to the respective electron density modulation due to the chlorine species. Notably, this electron withdrawing process enabled the determination of the trion binding energy of the intrinsic crystal, found to be as low as 20 meV, in accordance to theoretical predictions. At the same time, it is found that the effect can be reversed upon continuous wave laser scanning of the monolayer in air. Scanning auger microscopy (SAM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to link the actual charge carrier doping to the different chlorine configurations in the monolayer lattice. The spectroscopic analyses, complemented by density functional theory calculations, reveal that chlorine physisorption is responsible for the carrier density modulation induced by the pulsed laser photochemical reaction process. Such bidirectional control of the Fermi level, coupled with the capability offered by lasers to process at pre-selected locations, can be advantageously used for spatially resolved doping modulation in 1L-WS2 with micrometric resolution. This method can also be extended for the controllable doping of other TMD monolayers.",

    "abstract": "During the growth of graphene via chemical vapor deposition, its recessive process, that is, etching, is often neglected. However, recent experimental studies showed that etching is not only able to give rise to complex morphologies that cannot be achieved by pure growth, but it also can be used to create designed patterns. In this work, we develop a kinetic Monte Carlo model based on the underlying mechanisms and growth kinetics of graphene to predict the formation of various morphologies during growth and etching. The simulation results reproduce a variety of experimentally observed morphologies of graphene domains with six-fold, four-fold and three-fold symmetries. In addition, we propose analytical relations between the gas flow rate in the experiments and the growth and etching parameters used in our simulations. We also present a phase diagram for the domain morphology from the attachment-limited regime to the diffusion-limited regime to guide the control of domain morphology. The present study not only presents a viable model to simulate the morphological evolution of graphene domain, but also provides essential guidance to control graphene pattern formation for specific applications.",

    "abstract": "The lithium ion migration dynamics and the fast lithiation pathways in electrode materials are quite critical for the rate capability of lithium ion batteries (LIBs). To reveal the relationship between lithiation behavior and crystallographic orientations in layered MoSe2, its dynamic electrochemical reactions are investigated with in situ microscopy technique. We report the crystallographic-orientation dependent lithium ion migration and reaction in MoSe2, where the preferential lithium-ion migration is observed along the orientations. These oriented-lithiation tips further assisted the surface to interior lithiation of layered MoSe2. Meanwhile, a phase transition from pristine 2H-MoSe2 to 1T-LixMoSe2 and the following conversion reaction with the formation of Li2Se and Mo are observed during the first lithiation process. The lithiation induced stress and orientation-dependent interfacial reaction rate might be the main factor leading to the orientation-dependent lithiation behavior. The experimentally revealed crystallographic-orientation dependent lithium ion migration and reaction in layered MoSe2 will provide intuitive understanding of the structural evolution during the discharge/charge cycling process, give guidance for the design of anode materials and can broaden the promising application of MoSe2 in solid electrochemical devices.",

By performing first-principles density functional theory calculation, this indirect-to-direct bandgap transition is demonstrated to be realized in twisted bilayer InSe (tbIS). Through analyzing the spatial distribution of wave functions with respect to variations of twist angles, it is found that the shift of location of valence band maximum arises from the formation of Moiré flat bands associated with the evolution of electronic localization. Meanwhile, the relaxation effect introduced by out-plane displacement in relaxed tbIS Moiré superlattice is inevitable when considering the twist-angle dependent electronic properties. Our prediction in tbIS systems could provide an alternative strategy to realize indirect-to-direct bandgap transition through twistronics for designing nano-electronic devices.",

However, to utilize these materials in photonic applications, it is imperative to investigate the robustness of the nonlinear optical properties against various defects introduced during or post synthesis. Here we study the SHG in hexagonal monolayer WS2 with synthesis defects, in triangular monolayer WS2 with focused ion beam induced structural defects, and in WS2 under ambient and aqueous environmental conditions. We find that WS2 hexagonal monolayers exhibit significantly more uniform SHG intensity across the sample with a coefficient of variation, than the varying photoluminescence (PL) intensity (). We also show that introducing structural defects in WS2 monolayers leads to diminishing, but not vanishing SHG. To further explore the robustness of SHG in comparison with PL, we show that aged WS2 monolayers have greatly varying PL across different samples (), while exhibiting much more uniform SHG (). Lastly, we find that WS2 monolayers submerged in deionized water shows similar intensity in SHG signal. To understand these experimental results, density functional theory calculations have been performed. Our analysis suggests that potential defects and water introduced to the WS2 monolayers produce relatively little change in the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, whereas nonradiative recombination caused by these defects can significantly affect the PL. These results show a good qualitative agreement with the experimental results.",

Here, we demonstrate a novel approach making it possible to induce strain in graphene using polymeric micrometric artificial muscles (MAMs) that contract in a controllable and reversible way under an electronic stimulus. Our method exploits the mechanical response of poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) to electron-beam irradiation. Inhomogeneous anisotropic strain and out-of-plane deformation are demonstrated and studied by Raman, scanning-electron and atomic-force microscopy.

Using multi-wavelength Raman spectroscopy, we investigated three types of graphene bound on Cu: graphene grown on Cu foils and Cu film/SiO2, and Cu-evaporated exfoliated graphene. 2D peak frequencies of the first two samples were ~17 cm-1 higher than expected for 1.96 eV excitation even when the effect of strain was considered. More notably, the upshift in 2D decreased with increasing excitation energy. Based on control experiments using Cu-evaporated graphene, we revealed that the spectral anomaly was induced by environment-dependent nonlinear dispersion in the electronic bands of graphene and determined the degree of the electronic modification. We also showed that the large upshifts of G and 2D peaks originating from differential thermal expansion of Cu could be significantly reduced by backing Cu films with dielectric substrates of insignificant thermal expansion. The quantitative analysis of electronic coupling between graphene and Cu presented in this study will be highly useful in characterizing as-grown graphene and possibly in other forms.",

Under an applied magnetic field, with current density lower than the critical current density, the sheet resistance versus current density (Rsq–J) dependence changes from ohmic (Rsq independent of J) to non-ohmic (a nonlinear dependence of Rsq on J) as the temperature decreases, indicative of a vortex phase transition/crossover. We interpret the high-temperature phase as the vortex liquid phase and the low-temperature phase as the vortex slush phase, which has short-ranged vortex lattice correlation, while long-range correlation (i.e. true superconductivity) is absent. No transition into a vortex glass phase is seen, illustrating the importance of thermal fluctuations in a perfect 2D superconductor under a magnetic field.",

To date, thickness measurements of Bi2Te3 2D nanosheets are mainly carried out via atomic force microscope or Raman spectroscopy. Here, we investigate a practical, rapid, inexpensive, and non-invasive thickness measurement technique that utilizes the optical contrast of Bi2Te3 2D nanosheets on a mica substrate (i.e., as-grown) and a SiO2/Si substrate (i.e., transferred). The reflected optical intensity and the corresponding contrast are studied as a function of Bi2Te3 thickness, illumination wavelength, and substrate thickness. Disagreement between experimental and calculated optical contrast values is observed, which is ascribed to the thickness-dependent refractive indices of Bi2Te3, mica thickness error, and the deviation from normal light incidence. Despite thin film interference in mica, the monotonic relationship between nanosheet's contrast and thickness makes mica a better substrate for identifying Bi2Te3 thickness. In addition, a brief recipe is provided for such a thickness identification method to be generally applied in any laboratory.",

Despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies no quantitative agreement has been found on some details of the adsorption geometry such as the corrugation amplitude. The issue highlights the differences in chemical and electronic environment in the strongly bound pore regions and the weakly bound wire regions of the corrugated structure. For reliable results it is important to probe the structure with a method that is intrinsically sensitive to the position of the atomic cores rather than the electron density of states. In this work, we determine the corrugation of h-BN nanomesh from angle- and energy-resolved photoelectron diffraction measurements with chemical state resolution. By combining the results from angle and energy scans and comparing them to multiple-scattering simulations true adsorbate-substrate distance can be measured with high precision, avoiding pitfalls of apparent topography observed in scanning probe techniques. Our experimental results give accurate values for the peak-to-peak corrugation amplitude (0.80 Å), the bonding distance to the substrate (2.20 Å) and the buckling of the boron and nitrogen atoms in the strongly bound pore regions (0.07 Å). These results are important for the development of theoretical methods that involve a quantitative description of van der Waals systems as required for the understanding of the physics of two-dimensional sp 2 layers.",

The resultant close proximity of atomic lattices with differing periodicity can lead to new phenomena. For umklapp processes, this opens the possibility for interlayer umklapp scattering, where interactions are mediated by the transfer of momenta to or from the lattice in the neighbouring layer. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to study a graphene on InSe heterostructure, we present evidence that interlayer umklapp processes can cause hybridization between bands from neighbouring layers in regions of the Brillouin zone where bands from only one layer are expected, despite no evidence for Moiré-induced replica bands. This phenomenon manifests itself as ‘ghost’ anti-crossings in the InSe electronic dispersion. Applied to a range of suitable two-dimensional material pairs, this phenomenon of interlayer umklapp hybridization can be used to create strong mixing of their electronic states, giving a new tool for twist-controlled band structure engineering.",

One significant obstacle for their realization is the inherent lack of scalability associated with the mechanical exfoliation commonly used for fabrication of two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures. Chemical vapor deposition offers an alternative scalable fabrication method for both monolayer semiconductors and other two-dimensional materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride. Observation of the strong light-matter coupling in chemical vapor grown transition metal dichalcogenides has been demonstrated so far in a handful of experiments with monolayer molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide. Here we instead demonstrate the strong exciton-photon coupling in microcavities composed of large area transition metal dichalcogenide/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures made from chemical vapor deposition grown molybdenum diselenide and tungsten diselenide encapsulated on one or both sides in continuous few-layer boron nitride films also grown by chemical vapor deposition. These transition metal dichalcogenide/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures show high optical quality comparable with mechanically exfoliated samples, allowing operation in the strong coupling regime in a wide range of temperatures down to 4 Kelvin in tunable and monolithic microcavities, and demonstrating the possibility to successfully develop large area transition metal dichalcogenide based polariton devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Structural defects play an important role in the optimization of material structures and properties, especially in low-dimensional systems such as two-dimensional (2D) materials. In this work, we investigated the formation, aggregation, and diffusion of vacancy defects in atomically thin black phosphorus (BP) via in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Vacancy defects including di-vacancies (DVs), vacancy clusters (e.g. tetra-vacancy and TV), and vacancy lines were confirmed as the primary forms of structural defects in BP. DV and TV defects were found to be highly mobile. The defects preferentially diffused and migrated along the diagonal and in a zigzag pattern (rather than an armchair pattern). After prolonged thermal excitation and electron-beam irradiation, all these as-formed vacancies tended to aggregate and line up parallel to the zigzag pattern direction to form extended vacancy lines with a total length reaching hundreds of nanometers or even the micrometer scale. Ab initio calculations were conducted to reveal the vacancy migration pathway, energy landscape, and modifications to the electronic structure of the host BP monolayers (MLs). It was found that the migration of a 5-8-5 DV was accomplished via sequential structural transformations including several transitions and intermediate configurations, such as 5-7-7-5 DVs. The associated migration barriers were determined as 2.1 eV for diagonal migration and 2.6 eV along the zigzag path, respectively. Calculations further confirmed that the presence of vacancy defects induced considerable electronic structure modification of the host ML-BP; for example, the bandgap was reduced from 0.9 eV (for defect-free ML-BP) to 0.7 eV in the presence of vacancy lines with a concentration of 1.2 at.%. The present study expands the current understanding of the formation and dynamic behaviors of primary vacancy defects and illustrates methods available to alter the electronic structures of 2D BP materials. It can further serve as a guideline for the function-oriented design and fabrication of BP-based devices via precisely controlled defect engineering.",

Such correlated electronic states also occur in multilayer rhombohedral stacked graphene (RG), which has been receiving increasing attention in the last years. In both natural and artificial samples however, multilayer stacked Bernal graphene (BG) occurs more frequently, making it desirable to determine what is their relative stability and under which conditions RG might be favored. Here, we study the energetics of BG and RG in bulk and also multilayer stacked graphene using first-principles calculations. It is shown that the electronic temperature, not accounted for in previous studies, plays a crucial role in determining which phase is preferred. We also show that the low energy states at room temperature consist of BG, RG and mixed BG–RG systems with a particular type of interface. Energies of all stacking sequences (SSs) are calculated for N = 12 layers, and an Ising model is used to fit them, which can be used for larger N as well. In this way, the ordering of low energy SSs can be determined and analyzed in terms of a few parameters. Our work clarifies inconsistent results in the literature, and sets the basis to studying the effect of external factors on the stability of multilayer graphene systems in first principles calculations.",

The DI bands in MoS 2 have been studied in the last years, but a multiple excitation study using laser excitation energies near the excitonic energies was still lacking. In this work, we investigate the low-frequency defect-induced Raman bands in MoS 2 coming from the acoustic phonon branches near the Brillouin zone edge using samples produced by mechanical exfoliation and chemical vapor deposition, recorded with different laser excitation energies close to the resonance with the excitonic transitions, and measured at different temperatures, from 100 K to 400 K. Our results show that the defect-induced Raman processes are affected by both excitation energy and temperature. We find that the temperature of measurement affects the linear dependence between the intensities of the DI peaks and the defect concentration. In particular, we observed that the ratio of intensities of the DI longitudinal acoustic (LA) and transversal acoustic (TA) modes with respect to the first-order E′ mode is about the same for the two different samples when results are corrected by the defect density. We show in this work that the largest intensity of the DI peaks occurs for laser energies in the resonance with the excitonic transitions. Finally, we introduce a general expression that provides the parameters for the quantification of defects in MoS 2 samples based on the intensity of the DI Raman bands, measured at different laser energies across the excitonic transitions.",

The microsized graphene oxide (GO) sheets (829 nm) were tailored strategically to 282 nm-sized monodispersed nanosheets for uniform electrostatic attachment of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). The GNPs-GO sheets were reduced to GNPs-RG sheets using a visible-light-induced chemical-free green method where the oxygen functional groups of GO have not been removed completely to enhance the functionality of GNPs-RG for bone tissue regeneration. The monodispersibility of GNPs-RG sheets helped to prepare PCL-based nanofibrous scaffolds with uniformly distributed GNPs-RG (0.002 wt%) with higher electrical conductivity (>3.5 times) and greater mechanical strength (>4.5 times). The electrostatic field simulation studies with COMSOL suggested that there was a uniform distribution of the electric field. The GNPs-RG addition creates an apt adhesion site due to their multifunctional and conductive properties for PCL@GNPs-RG nanofibrous scaffold which resulted in enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells. The PCL@GNPs-RG nanofibrous scaffold showed higher alkaline phosphatase activity and improved calcium mineralization after 21 d of incubation.

Herein, we propose an approach for the synthesis of few-layered GDY on arbitary metal substrate using a radio frequency (RF) heating directed temperature gradient at solid/liquid interface. RF irradiation only heats the metal substrate but not the solvent, thus the cross-coupling reaction occurs on metal substrate and monomers remain stable in the bulk solution. We obtained GDY film with homogenous morphology and an average thickness of 1–2 nm on the surface of metal substrate. Due to the high electrical conductivity and uniform pore size, GDY film is used as an artificial interface layer to avoid the formation of Zn dendrite in Zn ion batteries by direct synthesis on Zn anodes.

We discuss the dependence of the imprinted spin texture on the wave-vector of the helical structure, and on the strength of the effective local exchange field.

The energy transport in technologically promising transition metal dichalcogenides is determined by exciton diffusion, which strongly depends on the underlying excitonic and phononic dispersion. Based on a fully microscopic theory we demonstrate that the valley-exchange interaction leads to an enhanced exciton diffusion due to the emergence of a linear excitonic dispersion and the resulting decreased exciton-phonon scattering. Interestingly, we find that the application of a uniaxial strain can drastically boost the diffusion speed and even give rise to a pronounced anisotropic diffusion, which persists up to room temperature. We reveal that this behaviour originates from the highly anisotropic exciton dispersion in the presence of strain, displaying parabolic and linear behaviour perpendicular and parallel to the strain direction, respectively. Our work demonstrates the possibility to control the speed and direction of exciton diffusion via strain and dielectric engineering. This opens avenues for more efficient and exotic optoelectronic applications of atomically thin materials.",

Both 2D CTPA and CTPB show the transition from semiconductor to metal after combining with Li. The migration of Li through the pore space of 2D CTPB and CTPA is facilitated with a small diffusion barrier of 0.76 and 0.79 eV, respectively. 2D CTPB exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 760.86 mAh g −1 because it can accommodate Li at both the carbonyl sites and the surface sites of the skeleton, which is ascribed to the promotion of the electron-deficient B center. As a comparison, 2D CTPA can only combine with Li at the carbonyl sites and shows a capacity of 251.09 mAh g −1 .

    "abstract": "Abstract Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been proposed for a wide variety of applications, such as neuromorphic computing, flexible field effect transistors, photonics, and solar cells, among others. However, for most of these applications to be feasible, it is necessary to integrate these materials with the current existing silicon technology. Although chemical vapor deposition is a promising method for the growth of high-quality and large-area TMD crystals, the high temperatures necessary for the growth make this technique incompatible with the processes used in the semiconductor industry. Herein, we demonstrate the possibility of low-temperature growth of TMDs, using tungsten selenide (WSe 2 ) as a model, by simply using moisture-assisted defective tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) precursor powders during the growth of these materials. Density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism by which moisture promotes the defect formation on the precursor crystal structure and how it dictates the reduction of the temperature of the growth. The results were compared with the standard growth at high temperatures and with a precursor mixture with alkali salts to show the high quality of the WSe 2 grown at temperatures as low as 550 °C. To conclude, the work improves the understanding of nucleation and growth mechanisms of WSe 2 at low temperatures and provides a useful strategy for the growth of TMDs at temperatures required for the back-end-of-line compatibility with current silicon technology.",

However, studies on thermal catalyst of nitrogen fixation mainly focus on metal-containing, and the microscopic mechanism of thermal reduction process is still limited. Herein, we explored an economic metal-free boron atom decorated poly(triazine imide) (B/PTI), a crystalline carbon nitride, as an excellent thermal catalyst of nitrogen fixation and proposed a substrate-hydrogen mechanism for the N 2 thermal reduction reaction (NTRR). Our results reveal that the substrate hydrogen as the hydrogen source can promote the hydrogenation process with activation barrier of 0.56 eV, significantly lower than that of reported NTRR catalysts. Importantly, the B/PTI exhibits high turnover frequency, which is comparable to Fe, Ru, and Ti catalysts. Our work offers new insights into NTRR mechanism and provides an alternative solution for the sustainable ammonia synthesis.",

The physisorption nature of interaction between H 2 O and FePX 3 is found at low temperatures and relatively small concentrations of water molecules, that is supported by the DFT results. When temperature of the FePX 3 samples and partial pressure of H 2 O are increased, the interaction at the interface is defined by two competing processes—adsorption of molecules at high partial pressure of H 2 O and desorption of molecules due to the increased surface mobility and physisorption nature of interaction. Our intensive XPS/NEXAFS experiments accompanied by DFT calculations bring new understanding on the interaction of H 2 O with surface of a new class of 2D materials, TMTs, pointing to their stability and reactivity, that is important for further applications in different areas, like sensing and catalysis.",

The phonon, magnons and excitonic properties of two-dimensional ternary nickel-phosphorus trisulfides (NiPS 3 ) are investigated using Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) study. With magnetic exchange interaction, an exotic phonon scattering degenerates the optical phonons into in-plane A g and B g modes. We have observed eight Raman modes with two acoustic anisotropic magnon modes ( M 1 , M 2 ) below the critical temperature for co-( XX ), while only M 1 at cross ( XY ) polarizations. The M 1 mode is coupled with the phonon B g mode that can survive after transition temperature. The phonon and magnon modes soften with variations in temperature, which is attributed to anharmonic phonon–phonon coupling and interlayer forces. The polarized Raman shows the two-fold and four-fold symmetry orientations of the phonon and magnon modes, respectively, which exhibit strong in-plane anisotropic phonon/magnon. The PL spectra revealed the existence of bound excitonic features and ensemble emitters in NiPS 3 . The robust interlayer excitation and structural stability further revealed the optothermal properties. Moreover, the fabricated field-effect transistor on NiPS 3 reveals p -type semiconducting nature with an ON/OFF ratio of 5 × 10 6 and mobility of ∼16.34 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . In contrast, the rectification ratio indicates their diode characteristics. Similarly, the photocurrent is enhanced by changing the wavelength of light, which shows the potential for optoelectronics. The strong spin-charge interaction provides new insights into these materials’ magneto-optical and thermal properties for memory devices.",

Via investigating the evolution of the antisymmetric MR depending on the spatial distribution, current direction, and magnetization configuration, we demonstrate that the antisymmetric MR results from the local nonequilibrium current through the trilayer. Furthermore, an exchange bias effect is induced which modifies the antisymmetric MR. A stable multi-bit memory is presented in the heterostructure.

Interestingly, with suitable tuning of the cavity length, the hybridization between intra- and interlayer excitons can be ‘unmixed’ due to the interaction with photons.

Here, we report the successful construction of ultrafast-programmable 2D p–n homojunctions with a semi-floating-gate configuration based on a vertically stacked molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 )/hexagonal boron nitride/multilayer graphene van der Waals heterostructure. By partially electrostatically doping the MoS 2 channel under different control-gate voltage pulses, three types of 2D homojunctions, including p–n, n + –n, and n–n, can be constructed. The 2D p–n homojunction can be programmed at an ultrafast speed of within 160 ns and exhibits a large rectification ratio of ∼10 4 . Based on a modified Shockley equation, an ideality factor of ∼2.05 is extracted, indicating that the recombination process dominated the transport mechanism. The MoS 2 2D p–n homojunction shows a maximum electrical power conversion efficiency of up to 2.66% under a weak light power of 0.61 nW and a high photovoltage responsivity of 5.72 × 10 9 V W −1 .

Among these systems, 2D magnetic Janus materials have become important candidates for inducing a sizable DMI and chiral spin textures. Herein, we demonstrate that layer-dependent DMI and field-free magnetic skyrmions can exist in multilayer MnSTe. Moreover, strong interlayer exchange coupling and Bethe–Slater curve-like behaviors arising from the Mn–Mn double exchange mechanism are found in bilayer MnSTe. We also uncover that the distribution of DMIs in multilayer MnSTe can be understood as making a significant contribution to the intermediate DMI using the three-site Fert–Lévy model.

While the observed variations of the valley Zeeman effect for the A- exciton are qualitatively in accord with expectations from the bandgap reduction and modification of the exciton binding energy due to the graphene-induced dielectric screening, the valley Zeeman effect for the B- exciton behaves markedly different.

Electrochemical cycling investigations in combination with Ti 1s X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) have therefore been performed with the objective to study oxidation state changes during potential variations. In some of these studies Ti3C2Tx has shown main edge shifts in the Ti 1s X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES).

The detailed microscopic pathways are material specific as they sensitively depend on the band structures of the individual layers, the relative band alignment in the heterostructure, the twist angle between the layers, and interlayer interactions resulting in hybridization. We used time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with tight binding and density functional theory electronic structure calculations to investigate ultrafast charge separation and recombination in WS2-graphene vdW heterostructures. We identify several avoided crossings in the band structure and discuss their relevance for ultrafast charge transfer.

The charged excitons (trions), three particle bound states of two electrons and a hole or two holes and an electron, do not show any strain-induced fine structure splitting compared to neutral excitons whose radiative doublet is split by the strain into linearly polarized components. The correlation of the trions with Fermi sea holes gives rise to attractive Fermi polarons. We show that this results in a fine structure splitting of the polaron into states polarized along the main axes of the strain tensor. This effect is related to the bosonic statistics of Fermi polarons. We develop a microscopic theory of the effect and calculate the strain-induced splitting of Fermi polarons for both tungsten- and molybdenum-based monolayers, identifying the role of inter- and intravalley exciton–electron interactions. The fine structure splitting of the attractive Fermi polaron is proportional to both the excitonic splitting and the Fermi energy. The Fermi polaron fine structure in bilayers is briefly analyzed, and the role of electron and trion localization in moiré potentials is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In a two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide Ising superconductor in the fluctuating regime under the action of a uniform external electromagnetic field, a second-harmonic generation (SHG) effect takes place. There emerge two contributions to this effect, one conventional, which is due to the electron gas in its normal state, and the other one is of the Aslamazov–Larkin nature. Namely, it originates from the presence of fluctuating Cooper pairs in the system when the temperature approaches the temperature of the superconducting transition in the sample from above. Employing a usual approach to Ising superconductors, we lift the valley degeneracy by application of a weak out-of-plane external magnetic field, which produces a Zeeman effect. In calculations, we use the Boltzmann equations approach for the electron gas in the normal state, and the time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau equations for the fluctuating Cooper pairs, and show the emergence of SHG electric current characterized by a temperature-dependent broadening and a redshift.",

Here, we use aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to observe hexagonally close-packed Ti nano-islands grown on atomically clean graphene, and establish a 30 ∘ epitaxial relationship between the lattices. Due to the strong binding of Ti on graphene, at the limit of a monolayer, the Ti lattice constant is mediated by the graphene epitaxy, and compared to bulk Ti, is strained by ca. 3.7% to a value of 0.306(3) nm. The resulting interfacial strain is slightly greater than what has been predicted by density functional theory calculations. Our early growth stage investigations also reveal that, in contrast to widespread assumptions, Ti does not fully wet graphene but grows initially in islands with a thickness of 1–2 layers.

In bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist angle near the magic angle, the electronic dispersion is strongly modified by a manifold of hybridizing moir\\'e Dirac cones leading to flat band segments with strong electronic correlations. Numerous technical challenges arising from spatial inhomogeneity of interlayer interactions, twist angle and device functionality have so far limited momentum-resolved electronic structure measurements of these systems to static conditions. Here, we present a detailed characterization of the electronic structure exhibiting miniband dispersions for twisted bilayer graphene, near the magic angle, integrated in a functional device architecture using micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The optimum conditions for visualizing the miniband dispersion are determined by exploiting the spatial resolution and photon energy tunability of the light source and applied to extract a hybridization gap size of $(0.14 \\pm 0.03)$~eV and flat band segments extending across a moir\\'e mini Brillouin zone. \\textit{In situ} electrostatic gating of the sample enables significant electron-doping, causing the conduction band states to shift below the Fermi energy. Our work emphasizes key challenges in probing the electronic structure of magic angle bilayer graphene devices and outlines conditions for exploring the doping-dependent evolution of the dispersion that underpins the ability to control many-body interactions in the material.",

Despite being a remarkable material with fascinating new physics, the understanding of its phonon properties is at its infancy. In this study, we investigate the phonon dynamics of Nb 3 Cl 8 in bulk and few layer flakes using polarized Raman spectroscopy and density-functional theory (DFT) analysis to determine the material’s vibrational modes, as well as their symmetrical representations and atomic displacements. We experimentally resolved 12 phonon modes, five of which are A 1 g modes while the remaining seven are E g modes, which is in strong agreement with our DFT calculation. Layer-dependent results suggest that the Raman peak positions are mostly insensitive to changes in layer thickness, while peak intensity and full width at half maximum are affected. Raman measurements as a function of excitation wavelength (473–785 nm) show a significant increase of the peak intensities when using a 473 nm excitation source, suggesting a near resonant condition. Temperature-dependent Raman experiments carried out above and below the transition temperature did not show any change in the symmetries of the phonon modes, suggesting that the structural phase transition is likely from the high temperature P <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mover> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>3</mml:mtext> <mml:mi>m</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mo>ˉ</mml:mo> </mml:mover> </mml:math> 1 phase to the low-temperature R <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mover> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>3</mml:mn> <mml:mi>m</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mo>ˉ</mml:mo> </mml:mover> </mml:math> phase.

    "abstract": "Abstract The recent growth of two-dimensional (2D) layered crystals of MoSi 2 N 4 and WSi 2 N 4 has sparked significant interest due to their outstanding properties and potential applications. This development has paved the way for a new and large family of 2D materials with a general formula of MA 2 Z 4 . In this regard, motivated by this exciting family, we propose two structural phases ( 1T - and 1H -) of M Si 2 N 4 ( M = Ge, Sn, and Pb) monolayers and investigate their structural, vibrational, mechanical, electronic and optical properties by using first-principles methods. The two phases have similar cohesive energies, while the 1T structures are found to be more energetically favorable than their 1H counterparts. The analysis of phonon spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that all the suggested monolayers, except for 1H -GeSi 2 N 4 , are dynamically and thermally stable even at elevated temperatures. The elastic stability and mechanical properties of the proposed crystals are examined by calculating their elastic constants ( C ij ), in-plane stiffness ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>Y</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>2D</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:math> ), Poisson’s ratio ( ν ), and ultimate tensile strain (UTS). Remarkably, the considered systems exhibit prominent mechanical features such as substantial in-plane stiffness and high UTS. The calculated electronic band structures reveal that both the 1T - and 1H - M Si 2 N 4 nanosheets are wide-band-gap semiconductors and their energy band gaps span from visible to ultraviolet region of the optical spectrum, suitable for high-performance nanoelectronic device applications. Lastly, the analysis of optical properties shows that the designed systems have isotropic optical spectra, and depending on the type of the system, robust absorption of ultraviolet and visible light (particularly in 1H -PbSi 2 N 4 monolayer) is predicted. Our study not only introduces new members to the family of 2D MA 2 Z 4 crystals but also unveils their intriguing physical properties and suggests them as promising candidates for diverse nanomechanical and optoelectronic applications.",

Besides, through constructing the local photogate vertical heterostructures on two-dimensional SnS 2 surface can significantly increase its photoconductive gain. However, the potential of this photogain mechanism for SnS 2 films has not yet been revealed in practical photodetection devices. To investigate its special advantages on promoting the optical-sensing activity, the high-quality SnS 2 films with discrete, micro-area, and uniform rubrene-nanodots modification have been prepared. Benefit from the local interfacial photogating effect induced by hole trap states by rubrene-nanodots, the light-absorption and carrier-excitation efficiencies were significantly enhanced. Afterwards, the high-performance photodetector was designed based on the photogate vertical heterostructures of rubrene-nanodots/SnS 2 , which demonstrated an enhanced photoelectric response to 1064 nm light. Note that the maximum photocurrent density, photoresponsivity, and photodetectivity can reach up to 0.389 mA cm −2 , 388.71 mA W −1 , and 1.13 × 10 10 Jones, respectively. Importantly, the optimal band-structure offsets accelerated the localized hole transfer from SnS 2 film to rubrene-nanodots. The trapped holes in rubrene-nanodots induced an enhanced interface gating effect, which may help to modulate the number and lifetime of excess electrons under light illuminations.

Most current twisted experiments use a so-called tear-and-stack method using a polymer called polypropylene carbonate (PPC). However, despite the clear advantage of the current PPC tear-and-stack method, there are also technical limitations, mainly a limited number of vdW materials that can be studied using this PPC-based method. This technical bottleneck has been preventing further development of the exciting field beyond a few available vdW samples. To overcome this challenge and facilitate future expansion, we developed a new tear-and-stack method using a strongly adhesive polycaprolactone. With similar angular accuracy, our technology allows fabrication without a capping layer, facilitating surface analysis and ensuring inherently clean interfaces and low operating temperatures. More importantly, it can be applied to many other vdW materials that have remained inaccessible with the PPC-based method. We present our results on twist homostructures made with a wide choice of vdW materials—from two well-studied vdW materials (graphene and MoS 2 ) to the first-ever demonstrations of other vdW materials (NbSe 2 , NiPS 3 , and Fe 3 GeTe 2 ). Therefore, our new technique will help expand moiré physics beyond few selected vdW materials and open up more exciting developments.",

In the present study, we report a superior-performance broadband PD founded on the epitaxial SnS film. Large-area uniform SnS films were grown epitaxially on (100)-oriented KBr using magnetron sputtering technique, further exfoliated, and transferred in a wafer size to fabricated two-ends PD devices. Benefitting from high crystallization and unique photoconductive-bolometric coupling effect, the two modes of operation exhibit a wide range of spectral responses from the visible to near-infrared wavelength (405–1920 nm). Particularly noteworthy is the SnS device fabricated, which demonstrates an impressive responsivity of 95.5 A W −1 and a detectivity of 7.8 × 10 11 Jones, outperforming other devices by 1–2 orders of magnitude. In addition, SnS PD shows excellent environmental durability.

Starting from the continuum model, we analyze the low-energy domain wall modes within the moiré bilayer structure and obtain an analytic form representing charge density distributions of the two-dimensional structure. By computing the screened electron–electron interaction strengths both within and between the domain walls, we develop a bosonized model that describes the correlated domain wall network. We demonstrate that these interaction strengths can be modified through an applied interlayer bias, screening length and dielectric materials, and show how the model can be employed to investigate various properties of the domain wall network and its stability. We compute correlation functions both without and with phonons. Including electron–phonon coupling in the network, we establish phase diagrams from these correlation functions. These diagrams illustrate electrical tunability of the network between various phases, such as density wave states and superconductivity. Our findings reveal the domain wall network as a promising platform for the experimental manipulation of electron–electron interactions in low dimensions and the study of strongly correlated matter. We point out that our investigation not only enhances the understanding of domain wall modes in TBG but also has broader implications for the development of moiré devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Graphene-based electrodes have been extensively investigated for supercapacitor applications. However, their ion diffusion efficiency is often hindered by the graphene restacking phenomenon. Even though holey graphene (hG) is fabricated to address this issue by providing ion transport channels, those channels could still be blocked by densely stacked graphene nanosheets. To tackle this challenge, this research aims at improving the ion diffusion efficiency of microwave-synthesized hG films by tuning the water interlayer spacer towards the improved supercapacitor performance. By controlling the vacuum filtration during graphene-based electrode fabrication, we obtain dry films with dense packing and wet films with sparse packing. The SEM images reveal that 20 times larger interlayer distance is constructed in the wet film compared to that in the dry counterpart. The hG wet film delivers a specific capacitance of 239 F g −1 , ∼82% enhancement over the dry film (131 F g −1 ). By an integrated experimental and computational study, we quantitatively show that the interlayer spacing in combination with the nanoholes in the basal plane dominates the ion diffusion rate in hG-based electrodes. Our study concludes that novel hierarchical structures should be further considered even in hG thin films to fully exploit the superior advantages of graphene-based supercapacitors.",

Using a combination of experimental techniques, we emphasize the role of the growth temperature and of a subsequent annealing of the grown layers under a selenium flux on the polytype formed and on its structural and morphological properties. We show that a low growth temperature promotes the formation of the 1T′ and 3R phases depending on the layer thickness whereas a higher growth temperature favours the stable 2H phase.

They have unique electronic (such as 2D TiO 2 and MoO 2 ), catalytic (such as 2D CeO 2 and MnO 2 ), and magnetic properties (such as 2D Fe 2 O 3 ) compared with bulk metal oxides due to their atomically thin structures. Certain types of 2D metal oxides also have the potential to be a new type of high-performance solid lubricants due to the tunable interlayer interaction and possibility for 2D heterostructure formation, but this remains largely unexplored. In this work, we developed a scalable microwave-assisted solid-state synthesis of 2D Fe 2 O 3 and their nanocomposites with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The 2D Fe 2 O 3 /rGO nanocomposites were systematically characterized by electron microscopies and spectroscopies, and their utilization as solid lubricants was studied by pin-on-disk tribometer on both silicon and steel substrates. The results show that due to the easy sliding between 2D Fe 2 O 3 and rGO nanosheets and their unique magnetic-induced assembled morphology, low coefficient of friction (COF) can be achieved for both steel-silicon and steel-steel interfaces. Superlubricity (COF ∼ 0.007) can be achieved for the 2D Fe 2 O 3 /rGO nanocomposite with a GO primer layer on a steel substrate. This work provides new insights into the development of functional 2D nanocomposites and expands their applications to solid lubrication and beyond.",

The structural and electronic properties, synthesis feasibility, piezoelectric properties, and hydrogen evolution reaction were calculated. Our results showed that these 2D Janus MXTe are narrow-gap semiconductors, indicating great conductivity for electrocatalysis. The feasibility of synthesis was comparable to the already synthesized Janus materials. To exhibit a piezoelectrocatalytic effect, the material has to be piezoelectric and catalytically effective simultaneously. As the Janus structure breaks the centrosymmetry, the considered MXTe are intrinsically piezoelectric. We therefore calculated the dipole moments and the variation of out-of-plane polarization upon strain. The computed piezoelectric coefficient e 31 is within the same order of magnitude as that of other Janus 2D materials. Finally, although pristine 2D Janus MXTe were inert to hydrogen evolution reaction, incorporation of single-atom defects was found to boost hydrogen adsorption significantly. The catalytic efficacy can be further tuned by biaxial tensile strain, effectively controlling the Gibbs free energy of adsorption to be close to the thermoneutral value that is indicative of an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activity, at least for ZrSTe Janus monolayer. In summary, this work proposed and comprehensively investigated a new class of possible piezoelectrocatalysts, 2D Janus materials, which is feasible to be synthesized, catalytically effective, and has great conductivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Effective treatment of radioactive wastewater is crucial for broader nuclear energy adoption, with caesium radionuclides (most exist in the form of caesium chloride) presenting challenges due to their long half-life and biological hazards. Conventional adsorbents like zeolites and carbon-based materials, including graphene, face limitations in adsorption capacity due to the formation of electric double layers (EDL). This has led to the investigation of alternatives such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) e.g. MoS 2 , MoSe 2 , and WSe 2 , which offer promising galleries for caesium ion removal. Aside from extensively studied MoS 2 , there is limited research on the adsorption mechanisms and capacities of other TMDs like MoSe 2 and WSe 2 . Here, we conduct a comparative study examining the removal mechanisms and capacities of exfoliated MoS 2 , MoSe 2 , and WSe 2 nanosheets, alongside an evaluation of these properties in relation to graphene. Our investigation reveals distinct removal mechanisms and capacities among these three materials for capturing caesium ions in a variety of mechanisms. MoS 2 nanosheets primarily utilise a pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism via electrochemical intercalation, as evidenced by a total charge storage of 0.78 C g –1 , with only 2.6% stored via EDL formation. In contrast, MoSe 2 predominantly relies on EDL formation, with almost 60% of the total 0.54 C g –1 charge storage attributed to this mechanism. Lastly, WSe 2 exhibits a combination of both charge storage behaviours, with a total charge storage of 0.77 C g –1 , of which 14% is due to EDL formation. This research highlights the potential efficacy of TMDs as viable materials for caesium removal, offering an appealing alternative to conventional adsorbents and likely fostering advancements in water treatment technologies.",

This study shows that inkjet-printed tellurium nanowires or tellurene nanoflakes can offer high-performance p -type TFTs with current density up to 100 μA/μm and an On-Off ratio &gt;10 5 . In order to circumvent the high inter-flake junction resistance, a narrow-channel, near-vertical device architecture has been used that ensures predominantly intra-flake/ intra-nanowire transport, which resulted in three orders of magnitude increase in the current density compared to conventional devices without compromising on the On-Off ratio. Moreover, we show the whole device operation within ± 2 V, with a threshold voltage close to 0 V. The complete device fabrication is carried out at room temperature, thereby making it compatible with inexpensive polymer substrates. Next, outstanding device performance has also been realized with electrochemically-exfoliated and inkjet-printed n-type MoS 2 TFTs, demonstrating a current density of 60 μA/μm and an On-Off ratio of 10 6 . Furthermore, we show tellurene-based p-type depletion-load unipolar inverters and CMOS inverters alongside n-type MoS 2 TFTs, demonstrating a signal gain of 12 and 11, respectively.

This review focuses on the mechanical properties of few-layer TMDs and their integration into polymer matrices to create high-performance nanocomposites. Incorporating these TMDs into polymers results in significant improvements in modulus, strength and toughness. The review explores various incorporation techniques, emphasizing how these methods influence the mechanical properties of the composite. Additionally, the review highlights the impact of strain engineering on the mechanical properties of TMDs. By applying controlled mechanical deformation along with in situ Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, the intrinsic properties of TMDs can be explored with a high degree of precision and then finely tuned to further enhance the composite materials. Next, we present how the performance of these materials in bulk nanocomposites can be optimised through the understanding of micromechanics that we show is applicable even at the nanoscale. Finally, we summarise the large amount of literature upon the reinforcement of polymers by few-layer TMDs and summarise conclusions on the effectiveness of reinforcement as a function of filler content.",

In photocatalysis, MXenes exhibit beneficial properties such as transparency, electrical conductivity, tunable Fermi level, photo-corrosion resistance, and plasmonic resonance. Two fundamental characteristics that underpin MXenes’ superiority over many other traditional catalysts are the tunability of their properties to meet specific application needs and the low dimensionality of their structure, which enables nanoscale phenomena to be harnessed.

Here, we exploit the same approach to investigate the generalization of the cell response to the surface cues of the fabricated substrates and, contextually, to quantify cell adhesion on the different areas of the patterns. To attain this goal, we tested Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells on PDL-coated micropatterned SLG substrates and quantified the adhesion by using single cell force spectroscopy (SCFS). Our results indicate higher cell adhesion on PDL-SLG, and, consequently, an initial CHO cell accumulation on the graphene areas, confirming the neuronal behaviour observed previously; interestingly, at later time point in culture, cell migration was observed towards the adjacent SLG ablated regions, which resulted more favourable for cell proliferation.

    "abstract": "Despite intensive investigations, the comprehension of the mechanisms ruling the interplay of charge doping, electron–phonon coupling and dynamic screening in supported graphene remains elusive yet. Using a combination of surface-science spectroscopies, we have studied these phenomena for graphene on both Pt-skin-terminated and nickel-oxide-skin-terminated Pt3Ni(1 1 1). Graphene epitaxially grown on the (1 1 1)-oriented Pt skin behaves as a charge-neutral graphene/metal contact, exhibiting a reduced coupling of the out-of-plane optical phonon with Dirac-cone electrons. Conversely, p-doped graphene/Pt(1 1 1) exhibits giant Kohn anomalies arising from the electron–phonon coupling. Upon oxidation, the Pt skin of Pt3Ni(1 1 1) evolves into a nickel-oxide skin, which results into a p-type doped graphene sheet. The plasmonic spectrum shows dramatic changes when going from a graphene/Pt-skin/Pt3Ni to a graphene/nickel-oxide/Pt3Ni configuration. Finally, we show that the presence of Ni atoms in the metal alloy does not affect the temperature at which the graphene phase is formed, contrarily to the interpretation of previous experiments.",

Current rectification behavior has been demonstrated using heterojunctions constructed from different TMDs materials, as well as single layer-few layer homojunctions utilizing the layer-dependent behavior of TMDs. MoS2 is the best known TMDs and high quality few-layer samples with different stacking sequences can be facilely obtained by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. In this paper, we firstly report the stacking-dependent junctions formed by the interface of AA-AB stacked bilayer MoS2 samples, together with AA bilayer-single layer (AA-1L) and AB bilayer-single layer (AB-1L) junctions. Current rectification and asymmetric photoresponse are observed for the unique AA-AB junctions, similar to that of bilayer-monolayer (2L-1L) junctions. Current mappings clearly show that the photocurrents are mainly localized along the interfaces, confirming that intrinsic junctions are responsible to their electronic/optoelectronic performances, rather than Schottky barrier between electrode and sample. Our finding demonstrates the promise of using stacking-modulated 2D materials for future electronics and optoelectronics.",

This information can be obtained from the thermal attenuation of the specular intensity, as well as from angular distributions of He and Ne atoms in the low incident energy (∼50 meV) regime. For graphene (Gr) grown on several metal substrates, there is a direct correlation between the slope of thermal attenuation measurements and the Gr–substrate coupling strength obtained from surface phonons measurements. In addition, Ne scattering presents a broad, classical angular distribution when the Gr–substrate coupling is weak, like in Gr/Ir(1 1 1), whereas sharp diffraction features are observed for strongly interacting systems, like Gr/Ru(0 0 0 1). This makes neutral atom scattering a quick and sensitive indicator of the coupling strength between any 2D material with their substrates. The influence of the moiré superstructures on this simple picture is also discussed.",

Here, we measure heat flow across graphene junctions (GJs) from monolayer to bilayer graphene, as well as bilayer to four-layer graphene for the first time, in both heat flow directions. The thermal conductance of the monolayer-bilayer GJ device ranges from ~0.5 to 9.1x10^8 Wm-2K-1 between 50 K to 300 K. Atomistic simulations of such GJ device reveal that graphene layers are relatively decoupled, and the low thermal conductance of the device is determined by the resistance between the two dis-tinct graphene layers. In these conditions the junction plays a negligible effect. To prove that the decoupling between layers controls thermal transport in the junction, the heat flow in both directions was measured, showing no evidence of thermal asymmetry or rectification (within experimental error bars). For large-area graphene applications, this signifies that small bilayer (or multilayer) islands have little or no contribution to overall thermal transport.",

Both growth methods yield crystalline thin films with similar electronic band structures. TiSe2 films on TiO2 substrates exhibit large electron doping and a lack of charge density wave (CDW) order, which is different from both bulk single crystal TiSe2 and TiSe2 thin films on graphene. These phenomena can be explained by selenium vacancies in the TiSe2 films, which naturally occur when these films are grown on TiO2 substrates.

The low-energy peak is diminished when we induce defects in the material. Simultaneously the photoluminescence is significantly enhanced. We thus attribute the 1.77 eV spectral feature in the absorption spectrum to a quenching state, which energetically coincides with the emission. Our results clearly demonstrate the significance of this state in photoluminescence processes in the ribbons. We additionally measure the dependence of the generation of defects on the energy of the incident photons and the photoluminescence excitation spectrum. The photoluminescence excitation efficiency peaks at a higher photon energy than the maximum absorption, hinting at an efficient decay from higher energetic states to the emissive state.",

    "abstract": "Platinum (Pt) is one of the most commonly used materials for neural interface owing to its excellent biocompatibility and good charge transfer characteristics. Although Pt is generally regarded to be a safe and inert material, it is known to undergo irreversible electrochemical dissolution during neurostimulation. The byproducts of these irreversible electrochemical reactions are known to be cytotoxic that can damage the surrounding neural substrate. With decreasing size of microelectrodes for more advanced high-density neural interfaces, there is a need for a more reliable, safe, and high-performance neurostimulating electrodes. In this work, we demonstrate that a monolayer of graphene can significantly suppress Pt dissolution while maintaining excellent electrochemical functionality. We microfabricated bare and graphene-coated Pt microelectrodes with circular and fractal designs and measured their Pt dissolution rate using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In addition, we measured changes in electrochemical characteristics of these microelectrodes before and after a prolonged stimulation period to quantify the effects of Pt dissolution and graphene protective layer. We confirm that fractal microelectrodes do have a better charge transfer performance than conventional circular designs but bare Pt fractal microelectrodes had significantly faster dissolution rate than the circular ones. When coated with monolayer of graphene, however, Pt dissolution was reduced >97% for fractal microelectrodes while they retained the superior charge transfer characteristics. The results of our work suggest that graphene can serve as an excellent diffusion barrier that can ameliorate the concerns for Pt dissolution in chronically implanted neurostimulation microelectrodes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sc has been employed as an electron contact to a number of two-dimensional (2D) materials (e.g. MoS 2 , black phosphorous) and has enabled, at times, the lowest electron contact resistance. However, the extremely reactive nature of Sc leads to stringent processing requirements and metastable device performance with no true understanding of how to achieve consistent, high-performance Sc contacts. In this work, WSe 2 transistors with impressive subthreshold slope (109 mV dec −1 ) and I ON / I OFF (10 6 ) are demonstrated without post-metallization processing by depositing Sc contacts in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at room temperature (RT). The lowest electron Schottky barrier height (SBH) is achieved by mildly oxidizing the WSe 2 in situ before metallization, which minimizes subsequent reactions between Sc and WSe 2 . Post metallization anneals in reducing environments (UHV, forming gas) degrade the I ON / I OFF by ~10 3 and increase the subthreshold slope by a factor of 10. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates the anneals increase the electron SBH by 0.4–0.5 eV and correspondingly convert 100% of the deposited Sc contacts to intermetallic or scandium oxide. Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy highlight the highly exothermic reactions between Sc and WSe 2 , which consume at least one layer RT and at least three layers after the 400 °C anneals. The observed layer consumption necessitates multiple sacrificial WSe 2 layers during fabrication. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy elucidate the enhanced local density of states below the WSe 2 Fermi level around individual Sc atoms in the WSe 2 lattice, which directly connects the scandium selenide intermetallic with the unexpectedly large electron SBH. The interface chemistry and structural properties are correlated with Sc–WSe 2 transistor and diode performance. The recommended combination of processing conditions and steps is provided to facilitate consistent Sc contacts to WSe 2 .",

We construct a phase diagram which consists of three distinct regions: (1) subcritical, (2) frustrated atomic collapse, and (3) molecular collapse. We show that the single impurity atomic collapse resonances rearrange themselves to form molecular collapse resonances which exhibit a distinct bonding, anti-bonding and non-bonding character. Here we limit ourselves to systems consisting of two and three charges. We show that by tuning the distance between the charges and their strength a high degree of control over the molecular collapse resonances can be achieved.",

In the magneto-optical response of HgTe the contribution of two types of carriers (electrons and holes) can be identified. The density of the electrons can be modified by light illumination by more than one order of magnitude. As the hole density is roughly illumination-independent, the terahertz response of the illuminated samples becomes purely electronic. In some cases, light illumination may switch the qualitative electrodynamic response from hole-like to the electron-like. The cyclotron mass of the electrons could be extracted from the data and shows a square root dependence upon the charge concentration in the broad range of parameters. This can be interpreted as a clear proof of a linear dispersion relations, i.e. Dirac-type charge carriers.",

In this work we investigate how this technique can be extended to h-BN encapsulated monolayer MoSe2 phototransistors at room temperature. By exposing the sample to 785 nm laser excitation we can controllably increase the charge carrier density of the MoSe2 channel by Δn ≈ 4.45 × 1012 cm−2, equivalent to applying a back gate voltage of ~60 V. We also evaluate the efficiency of photodoping at different illumination wavelengths, finding that it is strongly correlated with the light absorption by the MoSe2 layer, and maximizes for excitation on-resonance with the A exciton absorption. This indicates that the photodoping process involves optical absorption by the MoSe2 channel, in contrast with the mechanism earlier described for graphene/h-BN heterostroctures.",

To demonstrate that the method is suitable for applications in composites, these graphene-organic hybrids are processed into a commercial commodity polymer (polyvinyl alcohol, PVA), enhancing its electrical bulk conductivity by ten orders of magnitude by adding as few as 3% of GNP. We attribute the good performance of IBS in dispersing GNPs in water to its amphiphilic nature and the tendency to self-assemble through π–π interaction of its large aromatic core with the graphene surface.

When only one of the two sublattices is selectively excited by the probe beams that are momentum-matched onto the Dirac points, a singly-charged optical vortex emerges in the output of the symmetric conical diffraction pattern. Furthermore, flipping of the topological charge is observed as the excitation shifts from sublattice A to sublattice B. On the other hand, when both sublattices are simultaneously excited, the conical diffraction pattern becomes highly asymmetric, accompanied by interesting phenomena related to the generation of half-integer vortices and line singularities. We present four different cases of selective excitation using two different approaches; one with three input probe beams that are momentum-matched to the three K valleys, and the other with only two probe beams while the Bloch modes surrounding the third valley are excited due to Bragg reflection. Our experimental results are confirmed by numerical simulation of the paraxial wave equation with a HCL potential as well as by theoretical analysis of the two-dimensional Dirac–Weyl equations directly. These studies indicate that the lattice pseudospin is not just a mathematical formality, but rather it can manifest through its angular momentum transferred to probing optical beams.",

Herein, we report inductively coupled plasma-assisted CVD of epitaxially grown graphene on (111)-textured Cu film alloyed with a small amount of Ni, where large area high quality graphene film can be grown in less than 5 min at 800 °C, thus affording industrial scalability. The epitaxially grown graphene films on (111)-textured Cu contain grains which are predominantly aligned with the Cu lattice and about 10% of 30°-rotated grains (anti-grains). Such graphene films are exclusively monolayer and possess good electrical conductivity, high carrier mobility, and room temperature quantum Hall effect. Magnetoresistance measurements reveal that the reduction of the grain sizes from 150 nm to 50 nm produce increasing Anderson localization and the appearance of a transport gap. Owing to the presence of grain boundaries in these anti-grains, epitaxially grown graphene films possess n-type characteristics and exhibit ultra-high sensitivity to adsorbates.",

Here we present a new class of semiconducting two-dimensional material based on hexagonal MgB2. Although MgB2 is a semimetal, similar to the other well-studied transition metal diborides, we demonstrate that, unlike the transition metal diborides, thinning MgB2, to create nanosheets, opens a band gap in the density of states. We predict that a 7 Å thick MgB2 nanosheet will have a band gap of 0.51 eV. MgB2 nanosheets differ from other two-dimensional semiconductors in that the band gap is introduced by (001) surfaces and is opened by the quantum confinement effect. The implications of these findings are that nanostructured MgB2 is not merely a new composition, but also has intrinsic mechanisms for tuning its electronic properties, which may facilitate the development of nanoelectronics.",

In a homojunction of monolayer and multilayer MoS2, the thickness-dependent band structure implies the possibility of band realignment and a new interface charge state with properties distinct from the isolated layers. In this report, we probe the interface charge state using scanning photocurrent microscopy and gate-dependent transport with source-drain bias applied along the interface. Enhanced photoresponse observed at the interface is attributed to band bending. The effective conductivity of a material with a monolayer-multilayer interface of MoS2 is demonstrated to be higher than that of independent monolayers or multilayers of MoS2. A classic heterostructure model is constructed to interpret the electrical properties at the interface. Our work reveals that the band engineering at the transition metal dichalcogenides monolayer/multilayer interfaces can enhance the longitudinal conductance and field-effect mobility of the composite monolayer and multilayer devices.",

Ripples in graphene are prevalent and they could significantly influence carrier transport. However, little attention has been paid to the role of ripples in the permeation properties of graphene. Here, we report that gases can permeate through graphene ripples at room temperature. The feasibility of gas permeation through graphene ripples is determined by detecting the initial oxidation sites of Cu surface covered with isolated graphene domain. Nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations demonstrate that the oxygen atom permeation occurs via the formation of C–O–C bond, in which process the energy barrier through the rippled graphene lattice is much smaller than that through a flat graphene lattice, rendering permeation through ripples more favorable. Combining with the recent advances in atoms intercalation between graphene and metal substrate for transfer-free and electrically insulated graphene, this discovery provides new perspectives regarding graphene's limited anti-permeation performance and evokes for rational design of graphene-based encapsulation for barrier and selective gas separation applications through ripple engineering.",

By decoupling the growth of the two layers via a growth-and-regrowth scheme, we report the kinetics and termination mechanisms of the bilayer graphene growth on copper. We observe, for the first time, that the secondary layer growth follows Gompertzian kinetics. Our observations affirm the postulate of a time-variant transition from a mass-transport-limited to a reaction-limited regimes and identify the mechanistic disparity between the monolayer growth and the secondary-layer expansion underneath the monolayer cover. It is the continuous carbon supply that drives the expansion of the graphene secondary layer, rather than the initially captured carbon amount, suggesting an essential role of the surface diffusion of reactant adsorbates in the interspace between the top graphene layer and the underneath copper surface. We anticipate that the layer selectivity of the growth relies on the entrance energetics of the adsorbed reactants to the graphene–copper interspace across the primary-layer edge, which could be engineered by tailoring the edge termination state. The temperature-reliant saturation area of the secondary-layer expansion is understood as a result of competitive attachment of carbon and hydrogen adatoms to the secondary-layer graphene edge.",

Non-destructive exfoliation of nanosheets using macromolecular dispersing agents is beneficial in rendering the TMD nanocomposite films suitable for mechanically flexible devices. Here, an efficient LPE of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with an amine modified poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) co-polymer (AM-PSMA) is demonstrated, wherein the maleic anhydrides were converted into maleic imides with primary amines using N-Boc-(CH2)n-NH2. The exfoliation of nanosheets was facilitated through Lewis acid-base interaction between the primary amine and transition metal. The results demonstrate that the exfoliation depends upon both the fraction of primary amines in the polymer chain and their distance from the polymer backbone. Under optimized conditions of primary amine content and its distance from the backbone, AM-PSMA gave rise to a highly concentrated MoS2 nanosheet suspension that was stable for over 10 d. Exfoliation of several other TMDs was also achieved using the optimized AM-PSMA, indicating the scope of AM-PSMA applications. Furthermore, a flexible composite film of AM-PSMA and MoS2 nanosheets fabricated by vacuum-assisted filtration showed excellent photoconductive performances including a high Ion/Ioff ratio of 102 and a fast photocurrent switching of 300 ms.",

Interlayer spacings in the (SiN)2(AlN)4 structure on the Si (111) surface are found equal to 3.3 Å in SiN and 2.86 Å in AlN. These interlayer spacings correspond to weak van der Waals interaction between layers.

It is revealed that the deposition of Al atoms on top of a highly ordered (8 × 8) structure results in graphene-like AlN (g-AlN) layers formation. The g-AlN lattice constant of 3.08 Å is found in a good agreement with the ab initio calculations. A transformation of the g-AlN to the bulk-like wurtzite AlN is analyzed.",

Here we argue that bandstructure engineering with superlattices can be pushed to the extreme limit by stacking gapped van der Waals (vdW) materials on patterned dielectric substrates. Specifically, we find that high quality vdW patterned dielectric superlattices (PDS) realize a series of robust flat bands that can be directly switched on and off by gate voltage in situ. In contrast to existing superlattice platforms, these flat bands are realized without the need for fine tuning. Instead, the bands become flat as the gate voltage increases in magnitude. The characteristics of PDS flatbands are highly tunable: the type of flatband (single non-degenerate or dirac-cone-like), localization length, and interaction energy are sensitive to the applied gate voltage. As a result, electron-electron interactions in the PDS flatbands can become stronger than both the bandwidth and disorder broadening, providing a setting for correlated behavior such as flatband ferromagnetism. We expect PDS flatbands can be experimentally realized in a range of readily available gapped vdW materials such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, e.g. WSe2.",

We study the temperature dependence of this effect up to K for both materials, focusing on the dynamics of the valley pseudospin relaxation. A rate equation model is used to analyze our data and from the analysis of the width of the polarization dip in magnetic field we conclude that the competition between the dark exciton pseudospin relaxation and the decay of the dark exciton population into the localized states are rather different in these two materials which are representative of the two extreme cases for the ratio of relaxation rate and depolarization rate.",

In particular, we explore the persistent spin texture (PST) intrinsically present in the ferroelectric phase which protects the spin from decoherence and supports extraordinarily long spin lifetime. Our first-principles calculations followed by symmetry arguments revealed that such a spin wave mode can be externally detuned by perpendicular electric field, leading to spin randomization and decrease in spin lifetime. We further extend our analysis to ultrathin SnTe films and confirm the emergence of PST as well as a moderate enhancement of intrinsic spin Hall conductivity.

Furthermore, the surface relaxation of monolayer-level thin films is completely unknown yet. In this report, surface sensitive low energy electron diffraction technique with μm selectivity (μ-LEED) combined with dynamical LEED analysis were used to reveal the detailed crystal structure of the surface monolayer of α-RuCl3. A surface structural distortion that breaks the inversion symmetry of the ideal bulk structure was revealed. To be specific, we found the surface Cl sub-lattice is buckled with one Cl atom approximately 0.16 A below the other two Cl atoms, in the unit cell. The Ru atomic layer shows an even larger buckling of approximately 0.31 A. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we suggested that this surface distortion may be induced by Cl-vacancies that are inevitable in these samples.

This 2D in-plane exciton-polariton (2DEP) is described by the coupling of an electromagnetic light field with the collective oscillations of the excitons supported by monolayer TMDs. We expose the specific experimental conditions required for the excitation of the 2DEP and show that these can be created if the TMD is encapsulated with hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN) and cooled to cryogenic temperatures. In addition, we compare the properties of the 2DEPs with those of surface-plasmons-polaritons (SPPs) at the same spectral range, and find that the 2DEP exhibit over two orders-of-magnitude larger wavelength confinement.

While stacking atomically thin vdW layers in combination with automate machine vision identification and semi-automated stacking have been demonstrated, a combination of machine learning based automatic detection/identification assembly capability is necessary to further advance vdW heterostructure fabrication. Here, we developed a new automatic optical detection technique with a deep neural network (DNN) incorporated into a motorized microscope that automatically scans entire silicon wafers to detect and identify two-dimensional (2D) materials. We demonstrated the automated combination on an optical microscope (OM) with a DNN algorithm that enables identification and classification of graphene with different sizes, shapes and thicknesses. For this purpose, we trained a representative DNN for object detection with approximately 1000 OM images, resulting in high accuracy in detection and classification. We further verified the effectiveness of graphene trained DNN (GT-DNN) in practice, by confirming the yield of flakes depending on exfoliation method. In addition, we also showed the transferability of our method to other 2D materials. Our pre-trained GT-DNN was used to train a detection model for hexagonal boron nitride with only a few samples, resulting in further improvement of the accuracy of DNN-based detection. Our experimental method can effectively be extended to automatic detection and assembly of a plethora of 2D materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We report a novel strategy to stitch small WS 2 flakes to form larger features in liquid-phase exfoliation. Owing to the initial granular size of the bulk WS 2, which, is around 2 µ m, the use of conventional liquid-based exfoliation techniques leads to small area nanoflakes with sizes around 1 μ m. However, by joining smaller flakes through tin-oxide quantum dot (SnO 2 QD) decoration during probe sonication, sheets up to 20 μ m are achieved. The neighboring flakes could stitch together to form larger features through the Sn–S and Sn–O bonds at their lateral sides of their flakes and to realize mosaic arrangement of arbitrary shaped larger sheets. While the original WS 2 flakes show n-type behavior, an interesting conversion into a p-channel behavior is observed upon addition of SnO 2 QDs followed by additional SF 6 plasma treatment process. Additionally, we have investigated the use of SF 6 plasma treatment to enhance the carrier mobility and on-off ratio of the field effect transistors, yielding an effective field-effect-mobility of 80 cm 2 V −1 s −1 and relatively high on/off current ratio of 10 5 , indicating its superior electronic properties.",

When the average of the 'time varying' coefficients yields a focusing NLS equation, soliton propagation is exhibited.

Here we report on electronic charge transport behavior of multi layer n-type InSe field-effect transistor (FET) devices fabricated on SiO2/Si substrate with seven different channel thicknesses, t > 20 nm, well within its direct band gap regime. Through gate dependent conductivity measurements over a wide range of temperatures (T; 20 K <T < 310 K), we show that, irrespective of the channel thickness, carrier transport in these materials occurs via Arrhenius-type activated process above a certain characteristic temperature (T*), whereas for temperatures T < T* conduction occurs via variable range hopping (VRH) mechanism consistent with Mott's 2D VRH formalism, manifesting the presence of disorder induced localized states in these channels. Although the broad mechanisms of charge transport in all these devices are similar, the variation of correlation energy value (T1) of VRH with channel thickness indicates fewer density of localized states in thinner channels and hence higher electron mobility even without sufficient charge impurity screening from the substrate. Such intricate interplay between channel thickness and charge impurity screening and its influence on overall disorder landscape and hence on carrier localization in 2D layered systems underscores the need for strategic optimization of device parameters for their future prospect in electronic applications.",

Discovery of new methods with high thermal sensitivity are required for the widespread use of thermal conductivity measurements in characterizing materials’ properties. We propose and demonstrate a simple non-destructive method with superior thermal sensitivity to measure the in-plane thermal conductivity of nanosheets and nanowires using the bolometric effect. The method utilizes laser beam heating to create a temperature gradient, as small as a fraction of a Kelvin, over the suspended section of the nanomaterial with electrical contacts. Local temperature rise due to the laser irradiation alters the electrical resistance of the device, which can be measured precisely. This resistance change is then used to extract the temperature profile along the nanomaterial using thermal conductivity as a fitting parameter. We measured the thermal conductivity of V 2 O 3 nanosheets to validate the applicability of the method and found an excellent agreement with the literature. Further, we measured the thermal conductivity of metallic 2H-TaS 2 for the first time and performed ab initio calculations to support our measurements. Finally, we discussed the applicability of the method on semiconducting nanosheets and performed measurements on WS 2 and MoS 2 thin flakes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ion irradiation is a versatile tool to introduce controlled defects into two-dimensional (2D) MoS 2 on account of its unique spatial resolution and plethora of ion types and energies available. In order to fully realise the potential of this technique, a holistic understanding of ion-induced defect production in 2D MoS 2 crystals of different thicknesses is mandatory. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron diffraction and Raman spectroscopy show that thinner MoS 2 crystals are more susceptible to radiation damage caused by 225 keV Xe + ions. However, the rate of defect production in quadrilayer and bulk crystals is not significantly different under our experimental conditions. The rate at which S atoms are sputtered as a function of radiation exposure is considerably higher for monolayer MoS 2 , compared to bulk crystals, leading to MoO 3 formation. P-doping of MoS 2 is observed and attributed to the acceptor states introduced by vacancies and charge transfer interactions with adsorbed species. Moreover, the out-of-plane vibrational properties of irradiated MoS 2 crystals are shown to be strongly thickness-dependent: in mono- and bilayer MoS 2 , the confinement of phonons by defects results in a blueshift of the <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>A</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mi>g</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> mode.

    "abstract": "Abstract 2D excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer interesting effects related to the valley pseudo-spin degree of freedom and long-range exchange interactions, as well as the coupling with light states. Several theoretical predictions have claimed that the neutral exciton of TMDCs splits into a transversal and longitudinal exciton branch, with the longitudinal one, which is the upper branch, exhibiting an extraordinary strong dispersion in the meV range within the light cone. Historically, this was linked for semiconductor quantum wells to strong far-field optical dipole coupling, or strong electronic long-range exchange interactions. Recently, experiments utilizing Fourier-space spectroscopy have shown that the exciton (exciton–polariton) dispersion can indeed be measured for high-quality hexagonal-BN-encapsulated WSe 2 monolayer samples and can confirm the energy scale. Here, the exciton fine-structure’s pseudo-spin and the valley polarisation are investigated as a function of the centre-of-mass-momentum and excitation-laser detuning. For quasi-resonant excitation, a strong dispersion featuring a pronounced momentum-dependent helicity is observed. By increasing the excitation energy step-wise towards and then above the electronic band gap and the B-exciton level, the dispersion and the helicity systematically decrease due to contributions of incoherent excitons and emission from plasma. The decline of the helicity with centre-of-mass momentum can be phenomenologically modelled by the Maialle–Silva–Sham mechanism using the exciton splitting as the source of an effective magnetic field. By contributing to a better understanding of valley decoherence effects and the role of hybridised states in the optoelectronic properties, polarisation-sensitive Fourier-space investigations can support the development of future ‘optical-valleytronic’ devices.",

An attractive application of such defects is towards controlled functionalization of graphene with foreign molecules. However, the interaction of the defects with reactive environment, such as ambient, decreases the efficiency of functionalization and makes it poorly controlled. Here, we report a novel approach to generate, monitor with time resolution, and functionalize the defects in situ without ever exposing them to the ambient. The defects are generated by an energetic argon plasma and their properties are monitored using in situ Raman spectroscopy. We find that these defects are functional, very reactive, and strongly change their density from ≈1 × 10 13 cm −2 to ≈5 × 10 11 cm −2 upon exposure to air. We perform the proof of principle in situ functionalization by generating defects using the argon plasma and functionalizing them in situ using ammonia functional. The functionalization induces the n-doping with a carrier density up to 5 × 10 12 cm −2 in graphene and remains stable in ambient conditions.",

    "abstract": "When complex mechanisms are involved, pinpointing high-performance materials within large databases is a major challenge in materials discovery. We focus here on phonon-limited conductivities, and study 2D semiconductors doped by field effects. Using state-of-the-art density-functional perturbation theory and Boltzmann transport equation, we discuss 11 monolayers with outstanding transport properties. These materials are selected from a computational database of exfoliable materials providing monolayers that are dynamically stable and that do not have more than 6 atoms per unit cell. We first analyse electron-phonon scattering in two well-known systems: electron-doped InSe and hole-doped phosphorene. Both are single-valley systems with weak electron-phonon interactions, but they represent two distinct pathways to fast transport: a steep and deep isotropic valley for the former and strongly anisotropic electron-phonon physics for the latter. We identify similar features in the database and compute the conductivities of the relevant monolayers. This process yields several high-conductivity materials, some of them only very recently emerging in the literature (GaSe, Bi$_2$SeTe$_2$, Bi$_2$Se$_3$, Sb$_2$SeTe$_2$), others never discussed in this context (AlLiTe$_2$, BiClTe, ClGaTe, AuI). Comparing these 11 monolayers in detail, we discuss how the strength and angular dependency of the electron-phonon scattering drives key differences in the transport performance of materials despite similar valley structure. We also discuss the high conductivity of hole-doped WSe$_2$, and how this case study shows the limitations of a selection process that would be based on band properties alone.",

Analysis of the wave vector dependencies of the electron-phonon interaction traces the higher energy peak to phonon-assisted relaxation of the excited electrons from the Q to the K valley in the conduction band. Our results thus reveal the importance of ultrafast charge dynamics in understanding photoemissive properties of a few-layer transition-metal dichalcogenide. These calculations are based on time dependent density functional theory in the density matrix formulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the evolution mechanisms of interlayer stacking structures, particularly at the atomic scale, is of great significance for modulating the physical properties and realizing the full potential of 2D materials in electronics and quantum information applications. Herein, by performing in situ experiments using aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, the evolution of diverse interlayer stacking sequences (from 3R to N, N to 3R and N(3R) to AB′-stacked) in bilayer PtSe 2 are directly observed. Furthermore, the interlayer rotational angles are tuned (e.g. 13.3° to 9.4°, 16.8° to 11° and 16.1° to 6°) in situ at real time in bilayer PtSe 2 . Density functional theory calculations reveal a small energy barrier (&lt;0.2 eV per formula unit) for the kinetic evolution of interlayer structures. The illumination electron beam, while being as an atomic-scale probe for imaging, transfers enough energy initiating the transition. The bilayer PtSe 2 has show the rich stacking and twisted structures which may create novel physical phenomena. These findings shed new light on the diversity of structural properties of bilayer PtSe 2 , which may be valuable for constituting a step further toward their potential uses for next generation of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides-based device applications.",

In response to the inevitable tide, we previously demonstrated that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injected graphene quantum dots (GQDs) retrieve the experimental colitis. Nevertheless, it is still requested to verify the effect of oral administration for the actual application of GQDs as an alternative remedy. GQDs (1 mg ml −1 , 300 μ l/injection) were orally administered to dextran sulfate sodium-induced mice every 3 d, and the therapeutic effects were monitored by changes of body weights, disease activity index and colon length. To address GQDs’ maintenance of therapeutic efficacy even after passing the gastrointestinal tract, its physicochemical properties were investigated after exposure to a low pH environment. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of GQDs on intestinal microbiota by determining bacterial viability. As a result, repetitive oral administration of GQDs resolved the symptoms of colitis, such as body weight loss and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and efficiently suppressed intestinal inflammation, similar to the previous i.p. injection. GQDs were confirmed to retain its properties after exposure to the acidic environment. No significant toxicity was found in vivo and on the microbiota, which is critical in terms of a direct correlation between GQDs and recipients’ intestinal environment. Taken together, we demonstrated that oral administration of GQDs could ameliorate experimental colitis without any harmful effect, which potentiates GQDs as an alternative microbiome-friendly treatment for colitis.",

Depending on the Se concentration, the CuSe monolayer has two distinct superstructures on a Cu(111) substrate, a one dimensional (1D) moiré pattern, and two dimensional (2D) periodic nanopores. Here, we devise a strategy for simultaneous fabrication of the two superstructures of the CuSe monolayer on a Cu(111) substrate via artificially creating a density gradient of the Se concentration by an off-centered deposition method. At the boundary of the two superstructures, an intermediate state of the CuSe monolayer with a 2D hexagonal moiré pattern connected by six twisted petal-like stripes is observed. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy characterizations of three distinct CuSe monolayer superstructures demonstrate that the Se density can effectively modulate the stress in the CuSe monolayer formed by the lattice mismatch, driving the superstructure transformation from 1D moiré pattern through 2D intermediate states to 2D periodic nanopores. In addition, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show that the intermediate state features a semiconducting behavior with a band gap of ∼2.0 eV. Our findings open up a new route for superstructure transformation control of 2D materials.",

The polarization accumulation is determined by interplay of the anomalous velocity, side-jump and skew scattering effects. In the hydrodynamic regime, where the electron-electron scattering is dominant, the valley and spin current generation and dissipation by the electron-electron collisions are taken into account. The accumulated polarization magnitude and its spatial distribution depend strongly on the transport regime. The polarization is much larger in the hydrodynamic regime as compared to the ballistic one.

    "abstract": "Abstract Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) is one of the most studied two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides that is being investigated for various optoelectronic properties, such as catalysis, sensors, photovoltaics, and batteries. One such property that makes this material attractive is the ease in which 2D MoS 2 can be converted between the semiconducting (2H) and metallic/semi-metallic (1T/1T′) phases or heavily n-type doped 2H phase with ion intercalation, strain, or excess negative charge. Using n -butyl lithium (BuLi) immersion treatments, we achieve 2H MoS 2 monolayers that are heavily n-type doped with shorter immersion times (10–120 mins) or conversion to the 1T/1T′ phase with longer immersion times (6–24 h); however, these doped/converted monolayers are not stable and promptly revert back to the initial 2H phase upon exposure to air. To overcome this issue and maintain the modification of the monolayer MoS 2 upon air exposure, we use BuLi treatments plus surface functionalization p-(CH 3 CH 2 ) 2 NPh-MoS 2 (Et 2 N-MoS 2 )—to maintain heavily n-type doped 2H phase or the 1T/1T′ phase, which is preserved for over two weeks when on indium tin oxide or sapphire substrates. We also determine that the low sheet resistance and metallic-like properties correlate with the BuLi immersion times. These modified MoS 2 materials are characterized with confocal Raman/photoluminescence, absorption, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, scanning electrochemical microscopy, and four-point probe sheet resistance measurements to quantify the differences in the monolayer optoelectronic properties. We will demonstrate chemical methodologies to control the modified monolayer MoS 2 that likely extend to other 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, which will greatly expand the uses for these nanomaterials.",

We present a theoretical investigation of interaction among various exciton species within these structures where Coulomb attraction and repulsion are subject to reduced screening. For a homobilayer MoS 2 , we examine both direct, spatially-indirect, and hybridised excitons, considering the effects of direct and exchange interaction of electrons and holes distributed across one or different layers. Similar physics arises in perfectly aligned twisted TMD heterobilayers which support the direct-to-indirect exciton hybridisation. Deriving the exciton–exciton interaction matrix elements, we unveil a distinct non-monotonic dependence of the interaction on transferred momentum, changing sign from repulsive to attractive even for ground-state excitons, and compare our results with existing calculations for monolayers. Our findings demonstrate that for large momenta involved in high-density effects (strongly correlated phases), the interaction is chiefly governed by the prevailing attractive exchange component. At the same time, at small momenta that are more relevant for rarefied systems, we find that the enhancement of the interaction constant for dipolar species compared to intralayer non-dipolar excitons may be hindered by the surrounding medium. We draw comparisons with existing experiments and discuss the implications of our findings on the collective effects in TMD-based systems of excitons and exciton-polaritons.",

As a powerful tool, the high-pressure technique can be used to achieve novel superconductors and tune their physical properties. One typical example is binary germanium phosphides with different stoichiometries, which exhibit abundant physical properties with layered lattice structures similar to blue phosphorus. The detailed phase diagrams of the Ge–P systems are important for understanding the influence of stoichiometry on pressure-driven superconductivity, but it remains unexplored. Here, we measured and compared the detailed superconducting phase diagrams of the Ge–P systems of layered isostructural germanium phosphides GeP 3 and GeP 5 under pressure. Even though these two binary phosphides exhibit obviously different atomic occupations in the crystal structure due to their distinct stoichiometric ratios, the onset superconducting transition temperatures <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>T</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>c</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> of GeP 3 and GeP 5 both show dramatic enhancements from ∼2.5 K at 12.0 GPa to the maximum values of ∼9.0 K at 28.0 GPa, which are higher than those of other binary metal phosphides. Such pressure-enhanced superconductivity therein is accompanied by significant pressure-induced phonon mode softening, which is confirmed via in situ high-pressure Raman measurements. Our observations deepen the physical understanding of pressure-driven superconductivity in phosphorous-rich layered compounds and pave the way for potential applications in microsuperconducting devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hexagonal boron-nitride ( h -BN) provides an ideal substrate for supporting graphene devices to achieve fascinating transport properties, such as Klein tunneling, electron optics and other novel quantum transport phenomena. However, depositing graphene on h -BN creates moiré superlattices, whose electronic properties can be significantly manipulated by controlling the lattice alignment between layers. In this work, the effects of these moiré structures on the transport properties of graphene are investigated using atomistic simulations. At large misalignment angles (leading to small moiré cells), the transport properties (most remarkably, Klein tunneling) of pristine graphene devices are conserved. On the other hand, in the nearly aligned cases, the moiré interaction induces stronger effects, significantly affecting electron transport in graphene. In particular, Klein tunneling is significantly degraded. In contrast, strong Fabry-Pérot interference (accordingly, strong quantum confinement) effects and non-linear I-V characteristics are observed. P-N interface smoothness engineering is also considered, suggesting as a potential way to improve these transport features in graphene/ h -BN devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In ferromagnet/superconductor bilayer systems, dipolar fields from the ferromagnet can create asymmetric energy barriers for the formation and dynamics of vortices through flux pinning. Conversely, the flux emanating from vortices can pin the domain walls of the ferromagnet, thereby creating asymmetric critical currents. Here, we report the observation of a superconducting diode effect (SDE) in a NbSe 2 /CrGeTe 3 van der Waals heterostructure in which the magnetic domains of CrGeTe 3 control the Abrikosov vortex dynamics in NbSe 2 . In addition to extrinsic vortex pinning mechanisms at the edges of NbSe 2 , flux-pinning-induced bulk pinning of vortices can alter the critical current. This asymmetry can thus be explained by considering the combined effect of this bulk pinning mechanism along with the vortex tilting induced by the Lorentz force from the transport current in the NbSe 2 /CrGeTe 3 heterostructure. We also provide evidence of critical current modulation by flux pinning depending on the history of the field setting procedure. Our results suggest a method of controlling the efficiency of the SDE in magnetically coupled van der Waals superconductors, where dipolar fields generated by the magnetic layer can be used to modulate the dynamics of the superconducting vortices in the superconductors.",

The apparent color of BSCCO-2212 exfoliated flakes on SiO 2 /Si has allowed a rough and fast identification of the number of layers. By analyzing the optical contrast of different flakes we determined the complex refractive index in the visible range and found the optimal combination of illumination wavelength and substrate properties for the identification of flakes with different thickness. In addition, we report the hardening of the most characteristic Raman modes as flake thickness decreases, possibly caused by strain in the BiO and CuO 2 planes. Moreover, the evolution of the Raman modes establishes a second approach to determine the thickness of BSCCO-2212 thin flakes. As BSCCO-2212 is a challenging material due to its sensitivity to ambient conditions, the present work provides a guide for the fabrication and characterization of complex van der Waals systems paving the way for studying heterostructures based on unconventional superconductors in the 2D limit.",

In this work, we have fabricated WSe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures and investigated the proximity effects on 2D magnetism. Through reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD), we have observed a temperature-dependent modulation of magnetic order in the heterostructure. For temperatures above $40$ K, WSe$_2$-covered Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ exhibits a larger coercive field than that observed in bare Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, accompanied by a noticeable enhancement of the Curie temperature by $21$ K. This strengthening suggests an increase in magnetic anisotropy in the interfacial Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ layer, which can be attributed to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) proximity effect induced by the adjacent WSe$_2$ layers. However, at much lower temperatures ($T<20$ K), a non-monotonic modification of the coercive field is observed, showing both reduction and enhancement, which depends on the thickness of the WSe$_2$ and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ layers. Moreover, an unconventional two-step magnetization process emerges in the heterostructure, indicating the short-range nature of SOC proximity effects. Our findings revealing proximity effects on 2D magnetism may shed light on the design of future spintronic and memory devices based on 2D magnetic heterostructures.",

Excitation with 800 nm pulses results in a rapid enhancement in photoconductivity, which decays to less than 25% of its peak value within several picoseconds, underlying efficient photothermal conversion.

Various approaches have been carried out for the synthesis of multilayered h -BN. Among them, the metal flux method is reliable in yielding h -BN crystals with high crystalline quality. However, this time- and energy-demanding method hinders its scale application. Herein, inspired by the metal flux method, we reported the time-effective growth of high-quality multilayered h -BN film (ca. 20 nm) on a molten Ni–B layer wetting on W substrate with chemical vapor deposition method. The film exhibits an excellent stacking sequence and a full-width at half maximum of the Raman E 2g peak narrow to 9.5 cm −1 . Cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and in-situ x-ray diffraction spectroscopy were carried out to investigate the crystal structure evolution of Ni–B layer wetting on W substrate. It is found that the low surface tension caused by the spreading of Ni–B alloy on the W substrate and the presence of the Ni subsurface may be responsible for the formation of multilayered h -BN with excellent crystalline quality. Meanwhile, the W diffusion in Ni–B-based melt can hinder the formation of h -BN under certain growth conditions. The approach demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale growth of multilayered h -BN, paving the way to future applications in van der Waals electronic and optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Designing two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials with high Curie temperature is urgent for the development of spintronic technology. The exploration of non-van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic nanosheets play a vital role in enriching the 2D ferromagnetic materials family on account of the scarcity of vdW materials in nature. Herein, we report a non-vdW AgCrS 2 material with antiferro-to-ferro-magnetism transition when it thinned down to monolayer. Based on it, a universal ion-exchange strategy was employed to replace Ag + by the M (M = Li + , Na + , K + ) cations, acquiring a series of 2D non-vdW M x Ag 0.5− x CrS 2 materials with tunable ferromagnetism. The Curie temperature is higher than the AgCrS 2 nanosheet, and reaches up to 160 K when M is K + . The theoretical calculations verify the ferromagnetism of AgCrS 2 and M x Ag 0.5− x CrS 2 nanosheet originated from CrS 2 layer. The disorderly arranged M and Ag ions increase the asymmetry of the lattice structure of M x Ag 0.5− x CrS 2 , thereby strengthening the interlayer ferromagnetic coupling and raising the Curie temperature of the nanosheets. This work provides ideas for discovering more 2D ferromagnetic materials with high Curie temperature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent experiments in twisted bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides have revealed a variety of strongly correlated phenomena. To theoretically explore their origin, we combine here ab initio calculations with correlated model approaches to describe and study many-body effects in twisted bilayer WSe 2 under pressure. We find that the interlayer distance is a key factor for the electronic structure, as it tunes the relative energetic positions between the K and the Γ valleys of the valence band maximum of the untwisted bilayer. As a result, applying uniaxial pressure to a twisted bilayer induces a charge-transfer from the K valley to the flat bands in the Γ valley. Upon Wannierizing moiré bands from both valleys, we establish the relevant tight-binding model parameters and calculate the effective interaction strengths using the constrained random phase approximation. With this, we approximate the interacting pressure-doping phase diagram of WSe 2 moiré bilayers using self-consistent mean field theory. Our results establish twisted bilayer WSe 2 as a platform that allows the direct pressure-tuning of different correlated phases, ranging from Mott insulators, charge-valley-transfer insulators to Kondo lattice-like systems.",

Endeavors have been continuously made to progressively elevate the conductivity of graphene materials that are synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the primary means to prepare high-quality graphene in batches. From this perspective, we offer a comprehensive analysis and discussions on the growth, transfer, and post-treatment strategies evolved towards highly conductive graphene over the past five years. Large-area graphene films, ranging from monolayer to multilayer ones, are initially addressed, succeeded by graphene-based composites which enable traditional metals and non-metal materials to showcase novel or enhanced electrical performances. Eventually, an outlook for future directions to achieve higher electrical conductivity and to develop novel applications for CVD graphene materials is provided.",

These features are also evident in photocurrent spectra, presenting a strongly dichroic photoresponse with dichroic ratios exceeding 4 for excitation on resonance with the main exciton level.

Particularly interesting are graphene-based van-der-Waals heterostructures, which allow the creation of tailored spintronic properties, emerging from proximity effects, without destroying the unique Dirac states. The possibility to induce customized spin–orbit and exchange coupling in graphene, via band structure engineering, can lead to topologically protected edge states for dissipationless electronics and spintronics. In flat-band graphene materials, in particular, magic-angle bilayer graphene and rhombohedral (ABC stacked) trilayer graphene, the coupling between spin and valley (orbital) degrees of freedom can be coupled by strong Coulomb interactions, leading to a variety of fascinating correlated and superconducting phases. The emerging isospin electronics, combining both the electron spin and valley flavors, can transform the landscape of low-temperature electronics and lead to novel functionalities based on quantum matter. This Perspective explores the latest advancements in proximity effects, topological states, and correlated physics in graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures, discussing the fundamentals for potential applications.",

We show that for thick hBN barrier layers, where tunneling currents into the conductive substrate are suppressed, a side-contact still enables addressing the defect states in the scanning tunneling microscopy via the lateral current flow. Few-layer hBN realizes an intermediate regime in which the competition between vertical tunneling and lateral transport needs to be considered.

A combination of multi-probe scanning tunneling microscopy/potentiometry and low-energy electron microscopy allows the transport properties of individual grain boundaries to be correlated with their misorientation and atomic-level structure, without any device fabrication. We find that different types of grain boundary show dramatically different transport properties, and that boundaries can change structure and resistivity along their length. Boundary regions made up of dislocation superlattices separated by continuous graphene exhibit relatively low resistivity which is comparable to the resistivity of the graphene sheet itself. Other grain boundaries display trench structures with a resistivity 1–2 orders of magnitude greater and sufficient to dominate transport through the polycrystalline sheet. We also measure the transport properties of step edges and monolayer-bilayer boundaries on C-face graphene and compare them to Si-face graphene. Such measurements offer a guideline for optimizing graphene growth on SiC to improve its electronic properties.",

    "abstract": "The topological nature of two-dimensional (2D) chalcogenide platelets, can present novel opportunities in thin, flexible thermoelectrics. In this work, metal dopants are added to the reactive edges of 2D Bi2Te3 platelets. We show that along this active edge, an atomically well-ordered heterojunction is formed and facile charge exchange is created, onto the platelet and proximal to its known topological states. Temperature dependent conductivity suggests that local band bending across the interface may act as an injection energy filter for dopant-originated carriers. Moreover, as carrier density increases with increasing edge-dopant, carrier scattering does not appear to increase dramatically. As a result, an apparent decoupling between electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient occurs, leading to a surprisingly high power factors (PF): For example, the PF increases in Bi2Te3 platelets by eight times when doped with Cu. First principles calculations show that the electronics of the semiconductor-metal interfaces are quite different for edge and facial configurations, thus the site of metal dopant is believed to play an important role in the expected thermoelectric performance. Finally, this work suggests that the topological sensitivity of dopant placement should be considered in the rational design of high performance thermoelectric composites.",

More importantly, evaporation per length of contact line before and after graphene coverage shows negligible change, suggesting graphene is transparent for evaporation (per unit contact length). Molecular dynamics simulations confirm experimental findings and indicate that principal evaporation events take place via single-molecule desorption at the contact line.",

We extend the vector analysis method to produce separated spatial maps of the strain and doping variation across the heterostructures. This allows us to visualise and directly quantify the much-speculated effect of the environment on carrier concentration in graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that variations in strain and carrier concentration in graphene arise from nanoscale features of the heterostructures such as fractures, folds and bubbles trapped between layers. For bubbles in hBN-encapsulated graphene, hydrostatic strain is shown to be greatest at bubble centres, whereas the maximum carrier concentration is localised at bubble edges.

Efforts to mass-produce graphene electrodes led to the development of roll-to-roll chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene growth and transfer, and the only remaining obstacle to the mass-production of CVD graphene electrodes is a cost-effective patterning technique that is compatible with the roll-to-roll manufacturing. Herein, we propose a mechanics-driven technique for patterning graphene synthesized on copper foil (commonly used in roll-to-roll manufacturing). The copper foil is exposed to high temperature for a prolonged period during the CVD growth of graphene, and thus can result in recrystallization and grain growth of the copper foil and thereby reducing to the yield strength. This softening behavior of the copper was carefully controlled to allow simple stamp patterning of the graphene. The strength of the underlying substrate was controlled for the accuracy of the residual patterns. The proposed stamp patterning technique is mask-less and photoresist-free, and can be performed at room temperature without high-energy sources such as lasers or plasma. To demonstrate the capability of this process to produce a continuous electrode, a transparent in-plane supercapacitor was fabricated using the proposed patterning technique.",

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is of particular interest due to its direct bandgap in the visible spectrum, high electron mobility, and chemical stability. Here, we demonstrate that alterations in the density of surface hydroxyl groups on silicon dioxide substrates can control nucleation and growth in molybdenum disulfide thin films produced by atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition. The extent of MoS2 nucleation is linearly correlated to the density of surface hydroxyl groups. Controlling the density of surface hydroxyl groups on the initial substrate provides a method of growing patterned molybdenum disulfide. Furthermore, we establish that the surface density of hydroxyl groups on silicon dioxide (SiO2) is altered using conventional gallium focused ion beam (FIB) patterning. Upon gallium-ion beam exposure, the number of hydroxyl groups generated on the surface is directly proportional to the ion dosage. This work establishes a means of patterning large-area monolayer MoS2 on silicon dioxide substrates, which is a critical step for realizing applications in imaging, catalysis, biosensing, chemical detection, electronics and optoelectronics.",

Understanding and predicting this process from theory is challenging because of the need to capture the complex interplay between the local chemistry and the long-range screening response. To address this problem, we present a first-principles multiscale approach that combines linear-scaling density-functional theory, continuum screening theory and large-scale tight-binding simulations into a seamless parameter-free theory of adsorbates on 2D materials. We apply this method to investigate the electronic structure of doped graphene with a single calcium (Ca) adatom and find that the Ca atom acts as a Coulomb impurity which modifies the graphene local density of states (LDOS) within a distance of several nanometres in its vicinity. We also observe an important doping dependence of the graphene LDOS near the Ca atom, which gives insights into electronic screening in graphene. Our multiscale framework opens up the possibility of investigating complex mesoscale adsorbate configurations on 2D materials relevant to real devices.",

    "abstract": "A Hall effect sensor is an analog transducer that detects a magnetic flux. The general requirements for its high magnetic sensitivity in conventional semiconductors are high carrier mobility and ultra-thin conduction channel in the material's and the device's point of view. Recently, graphene Hall elements (GHEs) that satisfy those conditions have been demonstrated with a current-normalized magnetic sensitivity (SI) superior to that of Si-based Hall sensors. Nevertheless, the feasibility of Hall elements based on an atomically thin monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) system has not been studied thus far, although such a system would further enable a largely suppressed 2D carrier density. Herein, we show the strategy how to achieve the highest possible SI in a TMD-based Hall element in terms of the device structure as well as the operating bias condition. A monolayer molybdenum disulfide Hall element (MHE) on a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin film was fabricated, and the best bias conditions were selected based on the analytical model for zero-field transconductance data. Finally, the maximum SI of MHE/h-BN was found to be ~3000 V/AT. This work sheds light on the feasibility of TMD-based Hall element systems.",

To model Li ionic gating, we employ two approaches; one is direct adsorption of Li on MoTe2 and the other is introducing non-contacting Li plate over MoTe2. We show phonon instability in H-phase of MoTe2 with increasing the amount of charge transfer from Li, which implies a large electron-phonon coupling in the system resulting in a charge density wave state.

Highly-crystalline h-BN films, with single-crystal sizes up to hundreds of microns, are demonstrated via a novel Ni foam assisted technique reported here for the first time. The nucleation density of h-BN domains can be significantly reduced due to the high boron solubility, as well as the large specific surface area of the Ni foam. The crystalline structure of the h-BN domains is found to be well aligned with, and therefore strongly dependent upon, the underlying Pt lattice orientation. Growth-time dependent experiments confirm the presence of a surface mediated self-limiting growth mechanism for monolayer h-BN on the Pt substrate. However, utilizing remote catalysis from the Ni foam, bilayer h-BN films can be synthesized breaking the self-limiting effect.

However, its potential properties arising from defect engineering of five-membered rings have not been explored yet. In this work, we explore the C1 vacancy in PG using first-principles density functional calculations. The formation energy of this vacancy is surprisingly within the formation energy window of monovacancy (MV) in graphene. This defect introduces eight midgap levels indicating the possibility of studying the charge states. The charged defect is amphoteric with deep donor and deep acceptor levels. Introducing the vacancy in the sheet renders it inherently ferromagnetic (FM) with a magnetic moment of 4 µB. Upon further investigating spin polarization in PG, three possible unique magnetic configurations are found to exist: FM, ferrimagnetic (FiM), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM). The energy difference between the FM and the FiM (AFM) states is ∼−62.4 meV atom−1 (∼−81.9 meV atom−1). Despite FiM and AFM being lower in energy, interestingly, this intrinsic FM ordering of spins is preserved even when the defect concentration is increased. This observation would probably hint at the existence of a kinetic barrier between FM and AFM states which merits further investigations.",

In the case of strain produced by a sharp tip pressing at the center of a suspended TMDC membrane, the excitons are transported to the point of the highest strain at the center of the membrane. This effect, exciton funneling, can be used to increase photoconversion efficiency in TMDC, to explore exciton transport and to study correlated states of excitons arising at their high densities. Here, we analyze the limits of funneling efficiency in realistic device geometries.

This results from dominant diffusion at room temperature and short exciton lifetimes at low temperatures. On the other hand, in TMDC heterostructures with long exciton lifetimes the funneling efficiency reaches ∼50% at room temperature, as the exciton density reaches thermal equilibrium in the funnel. Finally, we show that Auger recombination limits funneling efficiency for intense illumination sources.",

We find that interband tunneling is critically dependent on junction directions because of the anisotropic pseudospin structure of BP. When the armchair direction of BP is normal to the interface, pseudospins of incident and transmitted carriers are nearly aligned so that interband tunneling is highly effective, analogous to the Klein tunneling in graphene. However, when the zigzag direction is normal to the interface, interband tunneling is suppressed by misaligned pseudospins. We also study junctions of band-gap inverted BP where the electronic structure is characterized by two Dirac cones. In this case, intervalley tunneling is prohibited either by momentum conservation or by pseudospin mismatch while intravalley tunneling is Klein-like irrespective of the junction direction. These results provide a foundation for developing high-performance devices from BP and other pseudospin materials.",

However, their actual performance is usually largely affected by the presence of inevitable defects. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the influence of defects on the dynamic properties is crucial for optimizing near future implementations. Here, the exciton population and valley scattering dynamics in a chemical vapor deposition grown large size monolayer WSe 2 with naturally abundant vacancy and boundary defects were systematically investigated using polarization controlled heterodyned transient grating spectroscopy at different excitation wavelengths and temperatures. Slow and multi-exponential decay dynamics of the exciton population were observed while no sign of any micron scale diffusive transport was identified, consistent with the effect of exciton trapping by defects. In general, two different kinds of exciton species were identified: one with short population lifetime (∼10 ps) and extremely fast intervalley scattering dynamics (&lt;200 fs) and in contrast another one with a long population lifetime (&gt;1 ns) and very slow intervalley scattering dynamics exceeding 100 ps. We assign the former to non-trapped excitons in the nanometer scale and the latter to defect-bound excitons. Temperature dependent intervalley scattering dynamics of the trapped excitons can be understood in terms of a two optical phonon dominated process at the K point in momentum space. Our findings highlight the importance of the intrinsic defects in monolayer TMDCs for manipulating exciton valley polarization and population lifetimes, which is key for future device applications.",

Cu 2 O and CuO NPs in Cu/Pyr-GDY can be electrochemically reduced to cubic metallic CuNPs to get Cu/Pyr-GDY-R electrocatalyst, with the average size of metallic Cu NPs being 42 nm. The Cu/Pyr-GDY-R on Cu foil can be directly used as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for CO 2 -to-formate conversion in a CO 2 -saturated 0.1 M KHCO 3 electrolyte, with a formate Faradaic efficiency (FE formate ) as high as 95% (at −1.2 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), far superior to that of Pyr-GDY-free Cu NPs (with a FE formate of only 29%). The key reaction intermediate of HCOO* during CO 2 -to-formate conversion was identified by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The results of density functional theory calculations revealed that the Pyr-GDY support can decrease the reaction free energy for the adsorption of HCOO* on Cu site, due to the electron transfer from metallic Cu NPs to conjugated diacetylene groups in 2D Pyr-GDY support, which leads to the high selectivity for formate over hydrogen production.",

However, controllable growth of multilayer TMDs remains challenging. Herein, large-scale and high-quality multilayer prototype TMDs of W(Mo)Se 2 were synthesized via chemical vapor deposition. For Raman and photoluminescence measurements, 2H and 3R multilayer WSe 2 crystals displayed significant layer-dependent peak position and intensity feature. Besides, different from the oscillatory relationship of second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity for odd–even layer numbers in 2H-stacked multilayer WSe 2 , the SHG intensity of 3R-stacked ones parabolically increased with the thickness due to the absence of inversion symmetry. For device application, photodetectors based on WSe 2 with increasing thickness exhibited p -type (bilayer), ambipolar (trilayer), and n -type (four layers) semiconductor behaviors, respectively. Furthermore, photodetectors based on the as-synthesized 3R-stacked WSe 2 flakes displayed an excellent responsivity of 7.8 × 10 3 mA W −1 , high specific detectivity ( D a * ) of 1.7 × 10 14 Jones, outstanding external quantum efficiency of 8.6 × 10 2 %, and fast response time ( τ Rise = 57 ms and τ Fall = 53 ms) under 532 nm illumination with bias voltage of V ds = 5 V.

We used various characterization techniques, including atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to show that our electrodeposited WS 2 layers are highly uniform and can be grown over graphene at a controllable deposition rate.

This growth is mainly done using a melted diffusion based process; however, different morphologies in growth process is not well understood. In this work, we report deterministic synthesis of layered (non-uniform c -axis growth) and planar (uniform c -axis growth) of molybdenum carbide (Mo 2 C) using a diffusion-mediated growth. Mo-diffusion limited growth mechanism is proposed where the competition between Mo and C adatoms determines the morphology of grown crystals. Difference in thickness of catalyst at the edge and center lead to enhanced Mo diffusion which plays a vital role in determining the structure of Mo 2 C. The layered structures exhibit an expansion in the lattice confirmed by the presence of strain. Density functional theory shows consistent presence of strain which is dependent upon Mo diffusion during growth. This work demonstrates the importance of precise control of diffusion through the catalyst in determining the structure of Mo 2 C and contributes to broader understanding of metal diffusion in growth of MXenes.",

We demonstrate this mechanism for alternating-twist magic-angle three- and four-layer graphene at charge neutrality and in the vicinity of a phase transition which can be described by an Ising Gross-Neveu critical point corresponding, e.g. to the onset of valley Hall or Hall order. While the non-interacting model displays massless Dirac excitations with strongly different velocities, we show that interaction corrections make them equal in the infrared. However, the renormalization group flow of the velocities and of the coupling to the critical bosonic mode is strongly non-monotonic and dominated by the vicinity of a repulsive fixed point. We predict experimental consequences of this theory for tunneling and transport experiments and discuss the expected behavior at other quantum critical points, including those corresponding to intervalley coherent ordering.",

These experiments prove that the amorphous Se/Te additive is homogeneously distributed over the MoS 2 nanosheets with an expanded interlayer distance of ∼10 Å. The fabricated Li–S batteries composed of the Se/Te @ B-M-C cathodes exhibit superior electrochemical performances when compared to that of the pristine chalcogens and bare host. The improved charge storage characteristics of these hybrids are attributed to the uniform distribution of chalcogens as the rate accelerators and the formation of a protective solid-electrolyte interphase layer over composites.

Electrostatically-driven self-assembly between cationic Co–Fe-LDH and anionic MXene NSs yielded intimately-coupled Co–Fe-LDH–MXene nanohybrids with porous stacking structures and significant interfacial charge transfer.

The choice of the substrate for monolayer TMDs is an essential factor for the optoelectronic properties and for achieving a high degree of valley polarization at room temperature (RT). In this work, we investigate the RT valley polarization of monolayer WS 2 on different substrates. A degree of polarization of photoluminescence (PL) in excess of 27% is found from neutral excitons in 1L-WS 2 on graphite at RT, under resonant excitation. Using chemical doping through photochlorination we modulate the polarization of the neutral exciton emission from 27% to 38% for 1L-WS 2 /graphite. We show that the valley polarization strongly depends on the interplay between doping and the choice of the supporting layer of TMDs. Time-resolved PL measurements, corroborated by a rate equation model accounting for the bright exciton population in the presence of a dark exciton reservoir support our findings. These results suggest a pathway towards engineering valley polarization and exciton lifetimes in TMDs, by controlling the carrier density and/or the dielectric environment at ambient conditions.",

In this study, we present for the first time the synthesis of such 2D rhodium trihalide solid solutions: RhBr x Cl 3− x and RhBr x I 3− x . We use thermodynamic simulations and simultaneous thermal analysis to predict conditions for their rational synthesis and to investigate suitable chemical vapor transport (CVT) parameters for these solid solutions. The evolution of the lattice parameters was investigated by powder x-ray diffraction, showing an isostructural relationship of the synthesized compounds and only minor deviation from Vegard’s law. The optical band gap of these materials can be tuned in an energy range from 1.5 eV (RhCl 3 ) to 1.2 eV (RhI 3 ) by choosing the composition of the solid solution, while the samples also exhibit photoluminescence in similar energy ranges. Ultimately, the successful deposition of bulk as well as ultrathin 2D nanocrystals of RhBr x Cl 3− x by CVT from 925 °C to 850 °C is shown, where the composition of the deposited crystals is precisely controlled by the choice of the starting composition and the initial amount of material. The high quality of the obtained nanocrystals is confirmed by atomic force microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. For RhBr x I 3− x , the CVT from 900 °C to 825 °C is more difficult and has only been practically demonstrated for an exemplary case. According to the observed properties, these novel solid solutions and nanocrystals show a great potential for an application in optoelectronic devices.",

Nano-oxides (Fe 2 O 3 and Cu 2 O) were formed in situ between the MXene layers, forming a homogeneous oxide-intercalated structure. Compared with the original MXene, the intercalated structure significantly enhanced the electromagnetic wave absorption (EMA) performance of the MXene/Fe 2 O 3 composite in the frequency range of 2–18 GHz, with smaller reflection loss (RL) (−58.7 dB), thinner thickness (2.35 mm). The RL min value of the MXene/Cu 2 O composite was −50.9 dB (2.55 mm) and the effective frequency width was 4.88 GHz at a thickness of 1.3 mm. Compared with ordinary chemical methods, the γ -radiation is a facile and ‘green’ method that is suitable for large-scale preparation. The absorption mechanism was attributed to conductive loss, polarization loss, and magnetic loss, which contributed to efficient EMA. This work demonstrates that γ -radiation is a promising method for preparing nano metal oxide-intercalated MXene with enhanced EMA performance.",

This transient phase sets within half a period of the coherent lattice motion and is favored by strong electronic correlations. The experimental results are compared to density-functional theory calculations with a self-consistent evaluation of the Coulomb repulsion.

Here, we show that multilayered black phosphorus (bP), a novel anisotropic two-dimensional material, can simultaneously dramatically boost and directionally control ET rates in the near-field regime. We find that bP exhibits a critical thickness above which the ET rates increase by several orders of magnitude compared to vacuum. Moreover, we demonstrate that bP can manipulate the ET in specific in-plane directions due to its strong in-plane anisotropy. Our results build the framework and provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of ET near anisotropic materials, and open up new possibilities for designing and optimizing ET-based devices, systems and applications.",

Contrary to the latter, TMD-based polaritonic devices remain operational at ambient conditions and therefore have greater potential for practical nanophotonic applications. Here, we present the study of the nonlinear properties of Ta 2 O 5 slab waveguide coupled to a WSe 2 monolayer. We confirm that the hybridization between the waveguide mode and the exciton resonance in WSe 2 gives rise to the formation of guided exciton–polaritons with Rabi splitting of 36 meV. By measuring transmission of ultrashort optical pulses through this TMD-based polaritonic waveguide, we demonstrate the strong nonlinear dependence of the output spectrum on the input pulse energy. We develop a theoretical model that shows agreement with the experimental results and gives insights into the dominating microscopic processes which determine the nonlinear pulse self-action: Coulomb exciton–exciton interaction and scattering to an incoherent excitonic reservoir. Based on the numerical simulation of nonlinear phenomena in our polariton system, we conclude that it may support a quasi-stationary solitonic regime of pulse propagation at intermediate pump energies. Our results provide an important step for the development of nonlinear on-chip polaritonic devices based on 2D semiconductors.",

In this study, we show that the potential window of Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene can be efficiently widened to 1.5 V in a cost-effective and environmentally benign polyethylene glycol (PEG) containing molecular crowding electrolyte. Additionally, a pair of redox peaks at −0.25 V/−0.05 V vs. Ag (cathodic/anodic) emerged in cyclic voltammetry after the addition of PEG, yielding an additional 25% capacitance. Interestingly, we observed the co-insertion of the molecular crowding agent PEG-400 during the Li + intercalation process based on in-situ x-ray diffraction analysis. As a result, Ti 3 C 2 T x electrodes presented an interlayer space change of 4.7 Å during a complete charge/discharge cycle, which is the largest reversible interlayer space change reported so far for MXene-based electrodes. This work demonstrates the potential of adding molecular crowding agents to improve the performance of MXene electrodes in aqueous electrolytes and to enlarge the change of the interlayer spacing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Liquid phase exfoliation is the most promising method for the low-cost, scalable production of two-dimensional nanosheets from their bulk counterparts. Extensive exfoliation occurs in most solvents due to the huge amount of energy introduced by sonication or shear mixing. However, the subsequent dispersion is not always stable, with extensive reaggregation occurring in some solvents. Identifying the optimal solvent for a particular layered material is difficult and requires a fundamental understanding of the mechanism involved in maintaining a stable dispersion. Here, we use molecular dynamics calculations to show that when graphene is immersed in a solvent, distinct solvation layers are formed irrespective of the choice of solvent and their formation is energetically favourable for all considered solvents. However, energetic considerations such as these do not explain the experimental solvent-dependence of the dispersion concentration. Instead, we find that solvents with high diffusion coefficients parallel to the graphene layer result in the lowest experimental concentration of graphene in solution. This can be explained by the enhanced ease of reaggregation in these solvents. Solvents with smaller diffusion coefficients result in higher experimental graphene concentrations as reaggregation is prevented. In the low diffusion limit, however, this relationship breaks down. We suggest that here the concentration of graphene in solution depends primarily on the separation efficiency of the initial exfoliation step. Based on this, we predict that the concentration of exfoliated graphene in solvents such as benzaldehyde and quinoline, which have low diffusion constants, can be increased dramatically by careful tuning of the experimental sonication parameters.",

However, due to its short lifetime, real-time detection of NO is challenging. Herein, an electrochemical sensor based on fibronectin-modified, solution-processed graphene ink for NO detection is developed using a facile fabrication method involving spin-coating and hot-plate annealing. The sensor is first electrochemically characterized with a NO donor, spermine NONOate, exhibiting a dynamic range of 10–1000 μ M. The fibronectin-functionalized graphene supports the attachment and growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, as confirmed by optical microscopy. Extracellular NO production is stimulated using the amino acid L-arginine. NO production results in morphological changes to the adhered cells, which are reversible upon the addition of the NO synthase antagonist N ω -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The production of NO is also confirmed using real-time amperometric measurements with the fibronectin-functionalized graphene sensors. While this work focuses on NO detection, this potentially scalable platform could be extended to other cell types with envisioned applications including the high-throughput evaluation of therapeutics and biocompatible coatings.",

We show that the spatial correlation between electrically charged scattering centres close to the graphene/SiO2 interface and the localised charges in a QD layer can smooth out the electrostatic potential landscape, thus reducing scattering and enhancing the carrier mobility. The QD capping molecules influence the distribution and correlation of electrical charges in the vicinity of SLG and provide a means of tuning the carrier concentration and increasing the carrier mobility in graphene.

    "abstract": "Computation of the van der Waals (vdW) interactions plays a crucial role in the study of layered materials. The adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem within random phase approximation (ACFDT-RPA) has been empirically reported to be the most accurate of commonly used methods, but it is limited to small systems due to its computational complexity. Without a computationally tractable vdW correction, fictitious strains are often introduced in the study of multilayer heterostructures, which, we find, can change the vdW binding energy by as much as 15%. In this work, we employed for the first time a defined Lifshitz model to provide the vdW potentials for a spectrum of layered materials orders of magnitude faster than the ACFDT-RPA for representative layered material structures. We find that a suitably defined Lifshitz model gives the correlation component of the binding energy to within 8–20% of the ACFDT-RPA calculations for a variety of layered heterostructures. Using this fast Lifshitz model, we studied the vdW binding properties of 210 three-layered heterostructures. Our results demonstrate that the three-body vdW effects are generally small (10% of the binding energy) in layered materials for most cases, and that non-negligible second-nearest neighbor layer interaction and three-body effects are observed for only those cases in which the middle layer is atomically thin (e.g. BN or graphene). We find that there is potential for particular combinations of stacked layers to exhibit repulsive three-body van der Waals effects, although these effects are likely to be much smaller than two-body effects.",

The model reproduces both the non-monotonic dependence on and the characteristic shapes of graphene crystals observed in experiments.

To make use of 2D semiconductors for practical applications, it is highly desired to develop scalable methods for integration of complementary circuits rather than a discrete device. We report a simple, scalable method for fabricating complementary inverters based on n-type monolayer MoS2, grown by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and inkjet-printed p-type SWCNTs. The CVD and inkjet printing methods are effectively combined to show the feasibility in terms of the integration of low-dimensional materials for complementary circuits. In the complementary circuits, cost-effectively printed Ag is utilized as the source and drain electrodes for both MoS2 and SWCNT transistors. Both the n- A nd p-type transistors show decent device characteristics at low operating voltages under ambient conditions. As a result, the complementary inverter composed of MoS2 and SWCNT transistors exhibits excellent performance with a gain over 10, low power dissipation, high noise margins, and switching threshold of 1/2 V DD at a low operating voltage. This successful demonstration of the complementary inverter, the most basic building block in digital circuits, will lead promising 2D semiconductors to practical applications.",

    "abstract": "In layered magnetic materials, the magnetic coupling between neighboring van der Waals layers is challenging to understand and anticipate, although the exchange interaction inside a layer can be well rationalized for example by the superexchange mechanism.In this work, we elucidate the interlayer exchange mechanism and propose an electron-counting rule to determine the interlayer magnetic order between van der Waals layers, based on counting the d-orbital occupation (d n , where n is the number of d-electrons at the magnetic cation).With this rule, we classify magnetic monolayers into two groups, type-I (n < 5) and type-II (n ≥ 5), and derive three types of interlayer magnetic coupling for both insulators and metals.The coupling between two type-II layers prefers the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, while type-I and type-II interface favors the ferromagnetic (FM) way.However, for two type-I layers, they display a competition between FM and AFM orders and even lead to the stacking dependent magnetism.Additionally, metallic layers can also be incorporated into this rule with a minor correction from the free carrier hopping.Therefore, this rule provides a simple guidance to understand the interlayer exchange and further design van der Waals junctions with desired magnetic orders.",

Although dark excitons are not directly visible in optical spectra, they have a large impact on exciton dynamics and hence their understanding is crucial for potential TMD-based applications. Here, we study brightening mechanisms of dark excitons via interaction with phonons and in-plane magnetic fields. We show clear signatures of momentum- and spin-dark excitons in WS 2 , WSe 2 and MoS 2 , while the photoluminescence of MoSe 2 is only determined by the bright exciton. In particular, we reveal the mechanism behind the brightening of states that are both spin- and momentum-dark in MoS 2 . Our results are in good agreement with recent experiments and contribute to a better microscopic understanding of the exciton landscape in TMDs.",

By calibrating the Raman scattering efficiency and separately constraining the electric dipole matrix elements, we reveal that the scattering rates for k = 0 optical phonons are comparable for both 1s and 2s states despite differences in the envelope functions. We also observe multiple new dispersive Raman peaks including a peak at the WSe 2 A2s resonance that demonstrates non-linear dispersion and peak-splitting behavior that suggests the dispersion relations for dark excitonic states at energies near the 2s state are extremely complex.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of high mobility encapsulated graphene devices, new electronic components ruled by Dirac fermions optics have been envisioned and realized. The main building blocks of electron-optics devices are gate-defined p-n junctions, which guide, transmit and refract graphene charge carriers, just like prisms and lenses in optics. The reflection and transmission are governed by the p-n junction smoothness, a parameter difficult to tune in conventional devices. Here we create p-n junctions in graphene, using the polarized tip of a scanning gate microscope, yielding Fabry-Perot interference fringes in the device resistance. We control the p-n junctions smoothness using the tip-to-graphene distance, and show increased interference contrast using smoother potential barriers. Extensive tight-binding simulation reveal that smooth potential barriers induce a pronounced quasi-confinement of Dirac fermions below the tip, yielding enhanced interference contrast. On the opposite, sharp barriers are excellent Dirac fermions transmitters and lead to poorly contrasted interferences. Our work emphasizes the importance of junction smoothness for relativistic electron optics devices engineering.",

We fabricate the devices with clean and stable interfaces by placing freshly exfoliated CrI3 flake atop pre-patterned thin Pt strip and encapsulating the Pt/CrI3 heterostructure with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in a protected environment. In devices consisting of a wide range of CrI3 thicknesses (30–150 nm), we observe that an abrupt upward jump in Pt MR emerge at a 2 T magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the layers when the current density exceeds 2.5 × 1010 A m−2, followed by a gradual decrease over a range of 5 T. These distinct MR features suggest a spin-flop transition which reveals strong antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the surface layers of CrI3. We study the current dependence by holding the Pt/CrI3 sample at approximately the same temperature to exclude the joule heating effect, and find that the MR jump increases with the current density, indicating a spin current origin. This spin current effect provides a new route to control spin configurations in insulating antiferromagnets, which is potentially useful for spintronic applications.",

A first-principles evaluation of these can be very demanding, and can be affected by numerical noise that breaks translational or rotational invariance. In order to overcome these challenges, we study the Gartstein internal-coordinate potential and tune its 13 parameters on the first-principles interatomic force constants for graphene. We show that the resulting potential not only reproduces very well the phonon dispersions of graphene, but also those of carbon nanotubes of any diameter and chirality. The addition of a cubic term allows also to reproduce the dominant anharmonic terms, leading to a very good estimate of the lattice thermal conductivity. Finally, this potential form works very well also for boron nitride, provided it is fitted on the short-range (analytical) part of the interatomic force constants, and augmented thereafter with the long-range dielectric contribution. This consideration underscores how potentials based on short-ranged descriptors should be fit, in polar materials, to the short-range part of the first-principles interactions, and complemented by long-range analytical dielectric models parametrized on the same first-principles calculations.",

    "abstract": "Chemical functionalization has proven to be a promising means of tailoring the unique properties of graphene. For example, hydrogenation can yield a variety of interesting effects, including a metal-insulator transition or the formation of localized magnetic moments. Meanwhile, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition is the most suitable for large-scale production, but the resulting material tends to be polycrystalline. Up to now there has been relatively little focus on how chemical functionalization, and hydrogenation in particular, impacts the properties of polycrystalline graphene. In this work, we use numerical simulations to study the electrical properties of hydrogenated polycrystalline graphene. We find a strong correlation between the spatial distribution of the hydrogen adsorbates and the charge transport properties. Charge transport is weakly sensitive to hydrogenation when adsorbates are confined to the grain boundaries, while a uniform distribution of hydrogen degrades the electronic mobility. This difference stems from the formation of the hydrogen-induced resonant impurity states, which are inhibited when the honeycomb symmetry is locally broken by the grain boundaries. These findings suggest a tunability of electrical transport of polycrystalline graphene through selective hydrogen functionalization, and also have implications for hydrogen-induced magnetization and spin lifetime of this material.",

However, its electromagnetic properties under strain are experimentally poorly understood. Here we present the far-infrared transmission spectra of large-area chemical-vapor deposited monolayer graphene on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate subjected to uniaxial strain. The effective strain value is calibrated using the Raman spectroscopy and corrected for a relaxation of wrinkles and folds seen directly by atomic-force microscopy. We find that while the Drude weight and the Fermi level remain constant, the scattering rate increases by more than 10% per 1% of applied strain, showing a high level of reproducibility during strain cycling. As a result, the electronic mobility and optical absorption of graphene at terahertz and lower frequencies appear to also be sensitive to strain, which opens pathways to control these key parameters mechanically. We suggest that such a functionality can be potentially used in flexible optoelectronic and microelectromechanical systems based on graphene. By combining our findings with existing theoretical models, we discuss the possible mechanisms of strain-controlled Drude scattering.",

With small gaps there, the adiabatic limit for the existing formulations of Hall current can be exceeded in a moderate electric field. Here we present a theory of non-adiabatic Hall effect, capturing non-perturbatively the across gap electron-hole excitations by the electric field. We find a general connection between the field induced electron-hole coherence and intrinsic Hall velocity. In coherent evolution, the electron-hole coherence can manifest as a sizeable ac Hall velocity. When environmental noise is taken into account, its joint action with the electric field favors a form of electron-hole coherence that is function of wavevector and field only, leading to a dc nonlinear Hall effect. The Hall current has all odd order terms in field, and still retains the intrinsic role of the Berry curvature. The quantitative demonstration uses the example of gapped Dirac cones, and our theory can be used to describe the bulk pseudospin Hall current in insulators with gapped edge such as graphene and 2D MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$",

We have developed a convenient and effective way to print edge-enhanced highly conductive graphene twin-lines by coalescence regulation and multi-layers overwriting (CRMO), which enhances both outline accuracy and electrical conductivity. The overlapping traces and wavy edges were eliminated by droplets coalescence at the expense of introducing discrete footprints, which were transformed into continuous lines by multi-layers overwriting. We successfully fabricated the edge-enhanced graphene twin-line with an edge width of 72.33 ± 7.96 μ m and a linear resistivity of 0.188 ± 0.160 kΩ μ m −1 , yielding the coinstantaneous enhancement of outline accuracy, printing efficiency, and electrical conductivity. Printed graphene twin-lines achieve one of the lowest relative linear resistivity reported so far and a conductivity of 359.88 S m −1 . We attributed the highly concentrated and tightly interconnected graphene flakes at the edge to the synergetic effect of CRMO. Finally, we have demonstrated the feasibility of CRMO by printing graphene line resistors with excellent linearity and broad resistance ranges. Such findings establish relationships among the printing method, line morphologies, flakes distribution, and electrical conductivity.

However, an atomic-scale understanding and thus control of the phase transitions in the atomically-thin TMDs have not been reached, especially in some metastable phases. Here, in metastable monolayer 1T′ WS 2 , we demonstrate the dynamics of a phase transition nucleated from atomic defects by the means of time-resolved annular dark-field imaging and atomic-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy. It is found that the atomic and electronic structure of the 1T′ phase is inhomogeneous, which is decided by zone-dependent W–S bond strengths due to a Peierls-like structure distortion. Meanwhile, the W–S bonding is flexible to allow large nonequilibrium atom shifts for phase transition. Thus, just a few atomic defects can stabilize the atomic-scale nucleus of the new phase to initialize the phase transition from 1T′ to 1H locally. Our finding reveals the possibility of controlling the phase transitions in 2D materials by defect engineering.",

However, while graphene-based biosensors have been demonstrated in many different architectures, little attention has been given to the effects of the substrate that supports the atomically thin graphene layer. In this work, we investigate protein adhesion of model small (lysozyme), medium (bovine serum albumin), and large (fibrinogen) proteins on monolayer graphene with support substrates of varying hydrophobicity and surface polarity. Ex situ adsorption is measured via ellipsometry. For Au and Si support substrates, in situ adhesion of lysozyme is measured via quartz crystal microbalance. The results indicate that not only the equilibrium attachment, but also the kinetics of interaction, can be affected by the substrate. Overall, a more hydrophobic substrate leads to a larger amount of adsorption to graphene. Moreover, the effect is only observed with monolayer graphene, where no substrate effect is observed with the addition of a second graphene layer. This work indicates that the substrate of a graphene-based biosensor is an important but currently overlooked parameter when understanding and optimizing the performance of the device. The level of non-selective protein adsorption on graphene can be independently engineered through modifying the support substrate without directly modifying the graphene itself.",

The photoluminescence dynamics changes from 2D (PEA) 2 PbBr 4 NPs to Q-2D (1), (2) NCs by performing the time-resolved nanosecond transient absorption (NTAS) measurement for our perovskites. Compared with 2D (PEA) 2 PbBr 4 NPs, we discovered for the first time that the electronic spectral redshift is intrinsic property of Q-2D NCs, which is caused by excitons transition to higher dimensionality. And the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of Q-2D (1), (2) NCs is effectively increased from 8.780% to 14.72%, 21.80%, respectively. This directly verifies that Q-2D (1) and (2) NCs have enhanced their interlayer energy transfer capabilities. Moreover, the photoluminescence mechanism of these perovskites is investigated by the NTAS and the time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectroscopy. The photophysical process of Q-2D samples exhibits a highly efficient and single photoluminescence pathway. The photoluminescence comes from the radiation recombination of free excitons. The Q-2D samples also have excellent photostability and decay lifetime stability. Our findings advance the research of improving 2D perovskites photoluminescence, and highlight potential of Q-2D NCs for optoelectronic applications.",

TBLGs have hence been ideal platforms to explore superconductivity, correlated insulating states, magnetism, and quantized anomalous Hall states in reduced dimension. Below a threshold twist angle ($\\sim$ $1.1^\\circ$), the TBLG superlattice undergoes lattice reconstruction, leading to a periodic moir\\'e structure which presents a marked atomic corrugation. Using a tight-binding framework, this research demonstrates that superlattice reconstruction affects significantly the electronic structure of small-angle TBLGs.

    "abstract": "Atomically thin monoisotopic boron nitride (BN) which is electrically insulating and has a high thermal conductivity could be utilized as fillers in electronic packaging materials for thermal dissipation in integrated and miniaturized modern devices.Thermal expansion mismatch in electronic packaging could cause strain and ultimately device failure, so it is valuable to measure and understand the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of atomically thin isotopically pure BN.In this work, we studied the TECs of mono-, bi-, and tri-layer isotope-purified BN using Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations including van der Waals dispersion forces.Monolayer (1L) 10 BN had a slightly larger experimental TEC than 1L 11 BN at close to room temperature: (-5.1±0.8)×10 - /K and (-4.6±0.8)×10 - /K, respectively.The negative TECs up to 700K were attributed to the competition between the in-plane stretching vibration modes and out-of-plane bending modes in BN; the lighter isotope leads to a larger absolute TEC due to higher amplitude of its out-of-plane bending modes.The absolute TECs of isotopic BN decreased with increased atomic thickness, which indicates strengthening of the out-of-plane bending rigidity.The deep understanding of the isotope effect on the TEC of two-dimensional materials also opens a promising pathway to minimize TEC mismatch in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures.",

Among them, palladium diselenide (PdSe2) is an emerging 2D transition-metal dichalcogenide, with a band gap ranging from eV in the monolayer to a predicted semimetallic behaviour in the bulk. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to explore the electronic band structure of PdSe2 with energy and momentum resolution. Our measurements reveal the semiconducting nature of the bulk. Furthermore, constant binding-energy maps of reciprocal space display a remarkable site-specific sensitivity to the atomic arrangement and its symmetry. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we ascribe this effect to the inherent orbital character of the electronic band structure. These results not only provide a deeper understanding of the electronic configuration of PdSe2, but also establish additional capabilities of photoemission spectroscopy.",

The BN thickness was estimated by photoemission and the BN distribution by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy. Due to the catalytic effect of the Ni substrate, this thickness is self-limited in the range 1–2 layers regardless of the borazine dose. A spatially resolved photoemission study was carried out before and after transfer of the h-BN on a Si substrate. It shows that a strong electronic coupling exists at the interface between h-BN and polycrystalline Ni, not only for (111) grains, which disappears after transfer on Si. In addition, we highlight the importance of detecting π plasmons in the photoemission spectra to confirm the hexagonal nature of BN.",

We found that under lower precursor flux, tuned by temperature that controls the sublimation rates, the hBN grains change from triangle to truncated triangle shape with additional B-terminated edges, which could be understood through kinetic Wulff construction, while under higher flux, they form circular shape following deposition-controlled growth and predicted by a phase field modeling. In addition to the monolayer morphology from a single nucleation, adlayer patterns with centered aggregation and diffusive features at high precursor flux are observed and simulated by a two-dimensional (2D) diffusion-reaction model, where the random diffusion and deposition are revealed to be the dominating kinetics. The nucleation density and growth velocity could also be modulated by the ammonia borane heating temperature, where 80 °C is found to be optimal for the largest hBN grain size. Our transmission electron microscopy study shows that a misalignment of coalescing grains occurs on such molten Cu substrate, deviated from those observed on molten Au. Our results provide a new tool for the shape and grain size control of 2D materials and the understanding of their growth kinetics for large scale production.",

However, the current synthetic strategy offers limited versatility to prepare SNCs due to their subnanometric feature and high active surface. Herein, we demonstrate a universal and facile one-pot reaction to construct wide assortments of metal SNCs with the size of 2 to 3 nm on graphdiyne (GDY), denoted as M-SNCs/GDY (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, Pd, Rh, Au, Ir, and Pt). Systematic investigations reveal that the correlated metal SNCs formation undergone the nucleation and growth process, during which the metal single-atoms were first anchored and then served as nuclei to grow SNCs confined on GDY. The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) catalyzed by Cu-SNC/GDY and a Cu single-atom catalyst on GDY (Cu-SAC/GDY) was investigated to demonstrate the advantages of SNCs over SACs in manipulating the multicomponent reaction. Cu-SNC/GDY exhibited promoted Faradic efficiency (FE) of carbon products and suppressed competing hydrogen evolution reaction compared to the Cu-SAC/GDY. Benefiting from the function of multiple active centers, a C 2+ FE of 31.6% was achieved over the Cu-SNC/GDY at −0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is 11-fold higher than that of Cu-SAC/GDY. In situ infrared spectroelectrochemistry confirmed that Cu-SNC/GDY could adsorb more eCO 2 RR intermediates over Cu-SAC/GDY. This study delivers a single-step strategy for preparing metal SNCs on GDY and expands the scope of SNCs.",

We show that these compounds exhibit large spin-phonon coupling (SPC), dominated by out-of-plane vibrations of Cr atoms, resulting in significantly different phonon dispersions in ferromagnetic (FM) and paramagnetic (PM) phases. Lattice thermal conductivity calculations provide additional evidence for strong SPC, where particularly large κ l is found for the FM phase. Most strikingly, PM and FM phases exhibit radically different behavior with tensile strain, where κ l increases with strain for the PM phase, and strongly decreases for the FM phase—as we explain through analysis of phonon lifetimes and scattering rates. Taken all together, we uncover the high significance of SPC on the phonon transport in CrX 3 monolayers, a result extendable to other 2D magnetic materials, that will be useful in further design of thermal spin devices.",

The results reveal that the trans-membrane transport of different anions can be modulated by the corresponding cations. The diverse interactions among anions, cations, and the negatively charged GO membranes are responsible for selective anion permeation through GO membranes. During the ion penetration, electrical potential differences can be generated across drain and source as well as across GO membranes; based on this, the ion distributions around GO membranes can be determined. The results indicate that local ion ordering can be achieved by GO membranes. Interestingly, for the cases of KNO3, Ca(NO3)2, and Ba(NO3)2, alternate aggregations of metallic cations and NO3− anions can be formed around GO membranes, demonstrating the fantastic ability of these membranes for ordering the ions locally in solutions. In addition, based on the electrical potential differences generated by different salts, chlorides are demonstrated to be ideal sources for efficient practical electricity production compared to sulfates and nitrates, while the different voltage signals generated can be used to identify different source solutions for liquid sensing applications. These results indicate that GO membranes can find potential applications in membrane separation, energy generation, ion recognition, and local ion organizing.",

    "abstract": "Graphene field effect transistors are considered as a candidate for future high-frequency applications. For their realization, the optimal combination of substrate, graphene preparation, and insulator deposition and composition is required. This optimization must be based on an in-depth characterization of the obtained graphene insulator metal (GIM) stack. Hall effect measurements are frequently employed to study such systems, thereby focussing primarily on the charge carrier mobility. In this work we show how an analysis of the sheet Hall coefficient can reveal further important properties of the GIM stack, like, e.g., the interface trap density and the spacial charge inhomogeneity. To that end, we provide an extensive description of the GIM diode, which leads to an accurate calculation of the sheet Hall coefficient dependent on temperature and gate voltage. The gate dependent inverse sheet Hall coefficient is discussed in detail before we introduce the concept of an equivalent temperature, which is a measure of the spacial charge inhomogeneity. In order to test the concept, we apply it to evaluate already measured Hall data taken from the literature. This evaluation allows us to determine the Drude mobility, even at the charge neutrality point, which is inaccessible with a simple one band Hall mobility analysis, and to shed light on the spacial charge inhomogeneity. The formalism is easily adaptable and provides experimentalists a powerful tool for the characterization of their graphene field effect devices.",

    "abstract": "Graphene has attracted enormous attention in recent years because of its high carrier mobility and saturation velocity. High-performance graphene transistors for radio-frequency (RF) applications are especially attractive. Synthesis of high quality graphene sheets and application of various materials for gate dielectrics and substrates have been demonstrated. However, very few studies have been performed on the effects of graphene transistor parameters, such as parasitic resistances and graphene quality, in relation to RF applications. Here we report a systematic study of those effects on electrical performance depending on the transistor structure. It is found that the access resistance and contact resistance are the dominant factors leading to degradation of the device performance, especially in deep scaled devices. A guideline for device structural parameter design for required RF performance is discussed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the newly proposed self-aligned structure can minimize access resistance component, resulting in 6 times higher cut-off frequency compared to that of the conventional structure, when the gate length is 50 nm. The findings of this study can be used to predict the device RF performance and thus help the design of graphene transistor structures to meet specific requirements.",

Langmuir–Blodgett films of poly(amic acid) (PAA) were transferred to copper foils and then converted to graphene via a PI intermediate. The Cu foil substrate was also discovered to facilitate the orientation of aromatic moieties upon carbonization process of the PI. As approximately 50% of the initial quantity of the PAA was found to remain at 1000 °C, thermally-stable polymers may reduce the quantity of starting material required to prepare high quality films of graphene.

We demonstrate that Cr, Mn, Fe and Co prefer all to sit above the Nb atom, where the d states experience a substantial hybridization. The inter-atomic exchange coupling is shown to have an oscillatory nature accompanied by an exponential decay, in accordance with what theory predicts for a damped Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida interaction. Our results indicate that the qualitative features of the magnetic coupling for the four investigated adatoms can be connected to the fine details of their Fermi surface. In particular, the oscillations of the exchange in Fe and Co are found to be related to a single nesting vector, connecting large electrons and hole pockets. Most interestingly, this behavior is found to be unaffected by changes induced on the height of the impurity, which makes the magnetism robust to external perturbations. Considering that NbSe 2 is a superconductor down to a single layer, our research might open the path for further research into the interplay between magnetic and superconducting characteristics, which could lead to novel superconductivity engineering.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are known for their layered structure and tunable functional properties. However, a unified understanding on other transition metal chalcogenides (i.e. M 2 X) is still lacking. Here, the relatively new class of copper-based chalcogenides Cu 2 X (X = Te, Se, S) is thoroughly reported. Cu 2 X are synthesized by an unusual vapor–liquid assisted growth on a Al 2 O 3 /Cu/W stack. Liquid copper plays a significant role in synthesizing these layered systems, and sapphire assists with lateral growth and exfoliation. Similar to traditional TMDs, thickness dependent phonon signatures are observed, and high-resolution atomic images reveal the single phase Cu 2 Te that prefers to grow in lattice-matched layers. Charge transport measurements indicate a metallic nature at room temperature with a transition to a semiconducting nature at low temperatures accompanied by a phase transition, in agreement with band structure calculations. These findings establish a fundamental understanding and thrust Cu 2 Te as a flexible candidate for wide applications from photovoltaics and sensors to nanoelectronics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Graphdiyne (GDY) is a new 2D carbon material different from graphene, and its ideal drug carrying and photothermal therapy efficacy had been noticed recently. Graphdiyne-oxide (GDYO), which few phototherapy researches had been reported, has more oxygen functional groups than GDY. Metal-organic framework materials Fe 3 O 4 @UiO-66-NH 2 (FU) can covalently connect to GDYO layers and obtain covalent-organic framework-like structures FUGYO. FU enlarged interlamellar space of GDYO, which avoided the aggregation of FUGYO multiple layers. At the same time, more acetylenic bonds and hydrophilic group were exposed, which brings out advantages like stability, hydrophily, high drug-loading, as well as magnetic targeting and better magnetic resonance imaging efficacy. To promote cancer treatment effect and water solubility, we loaded chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX) in FUGYO, then encapsulated FUGYO/DOX in phosphatidylcholine and fluorescent organic polymer BODIPY-PEG (BP) to integrate image-guided and synergistic therapy in one nanoparticle (BPFG/DOX). Due to the unique structure of BPFG/DOX, the π – π interaction between GDYO and BP improved photodynamic therapy efficiency. About 10 μ g ml −1 BPFG/DOX have nearly 90% cell lethality to MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell line) cells with laser irradiation. In vivo , BPFG/DOX possessed ideal magnetic targeting and effectively inhibited tumor growth in 6 d. In conclusion, BPFG/DOX not only acts as an excellent tumor theranostic agent but also provides a scheme for applying GDYO in the biomedical region.",

However, the poor electrical conductivity and cyclic stability hinder its practical applicability. Surface modification of electrodes is considered one of the effective strategies to improve these properties. In this work, the surface of α -Co(OH) 2 is modified via Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene using a simple drop-casting method with different mass loadings and corresponding electrochemical performance is evaluated. The α -Co(OH) 2 surface modified with 0.05 mg cm −2 Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene (CM0.05) shows the maximum specific capacity of 403 C g −1 at the current density of 3 A g −1 . The aqueous EHC fabricated with CM0.05 as a positive electrode and two-dimensional (2D) Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene nanosheets as a negative electrode outperforms the EHC fabricated with the activated carbon as a negative electrode. The CM0.05//MXene EHC shows the maximum energy density of 44.5 Wh kg −1 at the power density of 2762 W kg −1 . This also shows appreciable stability of 72% even after 5000 cycles. The flexible EHC fabricated using polyvinyl alcohol: KOH gel electrolyte demonstrates a superior energy density of 1.17 mWh cm −2 at the power density of 11.9 mW cm −2 with a wide operating potential of 1.6 V. Therefore, MXene (Ti 3 C 2 T x ) modified α -Co(OH) 2 can be considered as a promising electrode material for flexible EHCs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The extreme sensitivity of 2D materials to defects and nanostructure requires precise imaging techniques to verify presence of desirable and absence of undesirable features in the atomic geometry. Helium-ion beams have emerged as a promising materials imaging tool, achieving up to 20 times higher resolution and 10 times larger depth-of-field than conventional or environmental scanning electron microscopes. Here, we offer first-principles theoretical insights to advance ion-beam imaging of atomically thin materials by performing real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations of single impacts of 10–200 keV light ions in free-standing graphene. We predict that detecting electrons emitted from the back of the material (the side from which the ion exits) would result in up to three times higher signal and up to five times higher contrast images, making 2D materials especially compelling targets for ion-beam microscopy. This predicted superiority of exit-side emission likely arises from anisotropic kinetic emission. The charge induced in the graphene equilibrates on a sub-fs time scale, leading to only slight disturbances in the carbon lattice that are unlikely to damage the atomic structure for any of the beam parameters investigated here.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials using graphene and MoS 2 have enabled both pivotal fundamental studies and unprecedented sensing properties. These heterosystems are intriguing when graphene and MoS 2 are interfaced with 2D sheets that emulate biomolecules, such as amino-terminated oligoglycine self-assemblies (known as tectomers). The adsorption of tectomer sheets over graphene and MoS 2 modulates the physicochemical properties through electronic charge migration and mechanical stress transfer. Here, we present a systematic study by Raman spectroscopy and tectomer-functionalised scanning probe microscopy to understand mechanical strain, charge transfer and binding affinity in tectomer/graphene and tectomer/MoS 2 hybrid structures. Raman mapping reveals distinctive thickness dependence of tectomer-induced charge transfer to MoS 2 , showing p-doping on monolayer MoS 2 and n-doping on multilayer MoS 2 . By contrast, graphene is n-doped by tectomer independently of layer number, as confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The interfacial adhesion between the amino groups and 2D materials are further explored using tectomer-functionalised probe microscopy. It is demonstrated here that these probes have potential for chemically sensitive imaging of 2D materials, which will be useful for mapping chemically distinct domains of surfaces and the number of layers. The facile tectomer-coating approach described here is an attractive soft-chemistry strategy for high-density amine-functionalisation of atomic force microscopy probes, therefore opening promising avenues for sensor applications.",

Recently, enhanced superconductivity has been reported in Weyl semimetal MoTe 2 and WTe 2 via ionic liquid (IL) cation intercalation. However, how the superconductivity enhancement depends on the interlayer interaction still remains elusive. Here by inserting IL cations with different sizes into MoTe 2 through this strategy, we are able to tune the interlayer spacing of the intercalated MoTe 2 samples and reveal the dependence of superconducting transition temperature T c on the interlayer spacing. Our results show that T c increases with the interlayer spacing, suggesting that the weakened interlayer coupling plays an important role in the superconductivity. Interestingly, the intercalation induced superconductivity shows a high Ginzburg–Landau anisotropy, which suggests a quasi-two-dimensional nature of the superconductivity where the adjacent superconducting layers are coupled through Josephson tunnelling.",

In this work we present a detailed first principles characterization of domain walls (DWs) in two-dimensional ferroelectric GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe. In particular, we calculate the formation energies and migration barriers for 180 and 90 DWs, and then derive a general expression for the coercive field assuming that polarization switching is mediated by DW migration. We apply our approach to the materials studied and obtain good agreement with experimental coercive fields. The calculated coercive fields are up to two orders of magnitude smaller than those predicted from coherent monodomain switching in GeSe, SnS and SnSe. Finally, we study the optical properties of the compounds and find that the presence of 180 DWs leads to a significant red shift of the absorption spectrum, implying that the density of DWs may be determined by means of simple optical probes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cataract surgery removes the diseased lens of the eye replacing it with an intraocular lens, restoring visual acuity. However, accommodation, the lens’ ability to provide dynamic change in focus, is lost. A number of accommodative intraocular lens (AIOL) designs have been considered although none have provided a truly effective clinical AIOL. Two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti 3 C 2 T x ) MXene has been used as a transparent conductive electrode within an AIOL feasibility study. Nevertheless, the potential for Ti 3 C 2 T x to repress excessive inflammation and promote wound healing following cataract surgery has not been considered. Cataract surgery can trigger chronic inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in residual lens epithelial cells (LECs), producing a fibrotic mass across the posterior capsule known as posterior capsule opacification (PCO). With a large surface area and capacity for surface functionalisation, MXene has properties enabling a dual purpose AIOL design with an additional therapeutic role in the repression of pathways leading to PCO development. In this study, Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene was investigated to determine its impact on pathways leading to chronic inflammation and EMT using an in vitro LECs model. Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene was synthesised and characterised using UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy. Changes in markers linked to inflammation and EMT in Ti 3 C 2 T x -treated LECs were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, scratch assay, RNA sequencing for whole-cell gene expression profiling and lipidomics analysis. Ti 3 C 2 T x significantly reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by interleukin 1 beta primed LECs and did not advocate EMT, promoting a positive resolution of the wound healing response. This study supports the role of Ti 3 C 2 T x within an AIOL design with the potential to repress key developmental pathways leading to PCO.",

The structure of the photoresponse correlates with weaker features in the dark dc resistance reflecting the complex band structure of tBLG.

To understand the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the macroscopic electronic transport properties, a systematic study controlling compositional and structural parameters was conducted with eight solid solutions in the Ti y Nb 2− y CT x system. In particular, we investigated the different roles played by metal (M)-site composition, flake size, and d -spacing on macroscopic transport. Hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry revealed changes to electronic structure induced by the M-site alloying. Consistent with the spectroscopic results, the low- and room-temperature conductivities and effective carrier mobility are correlated with the Ti content, while the impact of flake size and d -spacing is most prominent in low-temperature transport.

While the critical temperature ( T c ) strongly depends on the field effect geometry (single or double gate) and on the sample (MoS 2 or MoSe 2 ), T c always saturates at high doping. The pairing mechanism and the complicated dependence of T c on doping, samples and field-effect geometry are currently not understood. Previous theoretical works assumed homogeneous doping of a single layer and attributed the T c saturation to a charge density wave instability, however the calculated values of the electron–phonon coupling in the harmonic approximation were one order of magnitude larger than the experimental estimates based on transport data. Here, by performing fully relativistic first principles calculations accounting for the sample thickness, the field-effect geometry and anharmonicity, we rule out the occurrence of charge density waves in the experimental doping range and demonstrate a suppression of one order of magnitude in the electron–phonon coupling, now in excellent agreement with transport data. By solving the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations, we explain the behavior of T c in different systems and geometries. As our first principles calculations show an ever increasing T c as a function of doping, we suggest that extrinsic mechanisms may be responsible for the experimentally observed saturating trend.",

    "abstract": "Graphene layers grown epitaxially on SiC substrates are attractive for a variety of sensing and optoelectronic applications because the graphene acts as a transparent, conductive, and chemically responsive layer that is mated to a wide-bandgap semiconductor with large breakdown voltage. Recent advances in control of epitaxial growth and doping of SiC epilayers have increased the range of electronic device architectures that are accessible with this system. In particular, a recently-introduced Schottky-emitter bipolar phototransistor (SEPT) based on an epitaxial graphene (EG) emitter grown on a p-SiC base epilayer has been found to exhibit a maximum common emitter current gain of 113 and a UV responsivity of 7.1 A W−1. The behavior of this device, formed on an n+-SiC substrate that serves as the collector, was attributed to a very large minority carrier injection efficiency at the EG/p-SiC Schottky contact. This large minority carrier injection efficiency is in turn related to the large built-in potential found at a EG/p-SiC Schottky junction. The high performance of this device makes it critically important to analyze the sub bandgap visible response of the device, which provides information on impurity states and polytype inclusions in the crystal. Here, we employ scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) with sub-bandgap light as well as a variety of other techniques to clearly demonstrate a localized response based on the graphene transparent electrode and an approximately 1000-fold difference in responsivity between 365 nm and 444 nm excitation. A stacking fault propagating from the substrate/epilayer interface, assigned as a single layer of the 8H-SiC polytype within the 4H-SiC matrix, is found to locally increase the photocurrent substantially. The discovery of this polytype heterojunction opens the potential for further development of heteropolytype devices based on the SEPT architecture.",

Along with strong optical coupling strength, it provides an ideal platform to study exciton-related physics in the 2D limit. Intensive experimental approaches on exciton dynamics in monolayer TMDs have been focusing on the lifetime of the exciton, exciton valley/spin polarization, and coherence, whereas the 'hot' exciton relaxation is rarely addressed. Here we probe the dynamics of bright excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenides, by pumping at exciton ground state and probing at higher energy, where excitonic excited states can be identified from the pump-probe spectroscopy. Remarkably, the rise time of the differential reflection signal increases significantly with the index of the excited states, which we attribute to the phase-space filling effect that probes the momentum distribution of ground state exciton. Our results reveal fast exciton momentum relaxation as a signature of the strong Coulomb interaction in 2D TMDs.",

This effect originates from the diverging field-induced interband coupling at the Dirac point. Using semiconductor Bloch equations to model the electronic dynamics of graphene, we argue that the charge carriers undergo ultrafast Rabi oscillations leading to the anomalous saturation effect. The theory is complemented by a many-body study of the carrier relaxations dynamics in graphene. It will be demonstrated that the carrier relaxation dynamics is slow around the Dirac point, which in turn leads to a more pronounced saturation. The implications of this effect for the nonlinear optics of graphene are then discussed. Our analysis shows that the conventional perturbative treatment of the nonlinear optics, i.e. expanding the polarization field in a Taylor series of the electric field, is problematic for graphene, in particular at small Fermi levels and large field amplitudes.",

Microscopic corrugations in the twodimensional structure of bilayer CVD graphene having a quasi-free-suspended top layer, such as graphene ripples, nanodomes, and bubbles, may significantly enhance local reactivity leading to etching effects on exposure to plasma. Here, we discovered that bilayer CVD graphene treated with nitrogen plasma exhibits efficient UV-green-red emission, where the excitation at 250nm leads to photoluminescence with the peaks at 390, 470, and 620nm, respectively. By using Raman scattering and spectroscopic ellipsometry, we investigated doping effects induced by oxygen or nitrogen plasma on the optical properties of single- and bilayer CVD graphene. The surface morphology of the samples was studied by atomic force microscopy. It is revealed that the top sheet of bilayer graphene becomes perforated after the treatment by nitrogen plasma. Our comprehensive study indicates that the dominant green emission is associated with the edge defect structure of perforated graphene filled with nitrogen. The discovered efficient emission appearing in nitrogen plasma treated perforated graphene may have a significant potential for the development of advanced optoelectronic materials.",

The in situ introduction of GO promotes the formation of ZIF-L, leading to a higher yield of Pd/ZG, about three times higher than Pd/ZIF-L. We ascribe this to the possible interaction of the oxygen-containing groups on the GO surface with the Zn2+ cations in ZIF nodes and the PVP wrapped on the Pd surface, resulting in the formation of sheet-on-sheet Pd-ZIF/GO with good Pd dispersion. The Pd/ZG shows superior catalytic performance in the reduction of nitroarenes, and its turnover frequency (TOF) value is five times higher than Pd/ZIF-L. The superior catalytic activity can be ascribed to the uniformly dispersed tiny Pd NPs between ZIF-L and GO nanosheets, fast mass transfer in porous structure, and excellent electron conductivity due to strong interactions among ZIF-L, GO and PVP-Pd. These findings provide new opportunities for rational design of catalysts and their applications in the reduction of nitroarenes, important processes for industrial synthesis of pesticides, dyes, medicines, etc.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional metal-halide perovskites (2DMHPs) have attracted tremendous interest due to their promising applications in the light-harvesting and light-emitting diodes. Recently, intensive experiment observations suggested the lattice of 2DMHPs should be very soft, such that photoexcitations would interact to the surrounding lattice distortions through the electron-lattice (e-l) couplings and led to the formation of self-trapped exciton (STE). However, the detailed formation mechanism has never been clearly clarified from the theoretical point of view. In this theoretical study, we build an effective tight-binding model for a single-layer 2DMHP (S2DMHP) with the e-l coupling considered as the Holstein type. This model successfully describes the ground-state optoelectronic properties and generates the primary non-linear elementary excitations which have been observed in a series of experiments. Our calculation reveals that the exciton state of a S2DMHP will exhibit significant polaronic characters. Depending on the e-l coupling strength and the level-occupancy configuration of the electron-hole pairs, such polaronic states could behave as either large polarons or small polarons. Large polarons range over multiple unit cells and induce the local deformation of the surrounding crystalline structure. Contrarily, small polarons are strongly bound and being trapped within the single octahedras. The existence of large and small polarons respectively explain the relative lower charge mobilities and the peculiar broadened white-light emissions in some selected S2DMHPs. The present work highlights the essential role of e-l couplings in determination of the excitonic properties of S2DMHPs and provides a theoretical foundation to deeply understand the optoelectronic behavior of S2DMHPs-based semiconductor devices.",

The GBM stem cells (GSCs) can exist in quiescent or dormant states and infiltrate widely into surrounding brain tissues, currently incurable with only around one-year median survival. Innovative therapeutic strategies for GBMs are urgently needed. Here we explore functionalized graphene oxide (GO) to assess their value as delivery vehicles for GBM therapeutics. Interactions and cellular responses were assessed in vitro using both classic cell lines and patient derived GSCs. Association between the functionalised GO and established GBM cell lines (serum grown ‘non-stem’ cells) was strong and resulted in decreased cell viability, increased cell oxidative stress, and changes in lipids composition in a concentration-dependent manner. Responses were more moderate in GSCs and were only observed at highest functionalised GO concentrations. However, no significant toxicity was detected in brain astrocytes and endothelial cells. These results indicate selective toxicity to highly proliferative GBM cell lines and patient GSCs, with minimal toxicity to normal neural cells and brain tissue. We conclude that a novel class of GBM-targeting graphene-based nanocarriers could be useful delivery vehicles for GBM therapeutics.",

Our findings are supported by measurements performed on tilted samples that allow increasing the component of photon momenta in the plane of the flake, thus unambiguously setting the direction of an eventual NAC. We also investigate the influence of the parity of the number of layers and of the type of layer-by-layer stacking on the effect of NACs on the Raman spectra.",

    "abstract": "The thermoelectric response of HgTe quantum wells in the state of two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI) has been studied experimentally. Ambipolar thermopower, typical for an electron–hole system, has been observed across the charge neutrality point, where the carrier type changes from electrons to holes according to the resistance measurements. The hole-type thermopower is much stronger than the electron-type one. The thermopower linearly increases with temperature. We present a theoretical model which accounts for both the edge and bulk contributions to the electrical conductivity and thermoelectric effect in a 2D TI, including the effects of edge to bulk leakage. The model, contrary to previous theoretical studies, demonstrates that the 2D TI is not expected to show anomalies of thermopower near the band conductivity threshold, which is consistent with our experimental results. Based on the experimental data and theoretical analysis, we conclude that the observed thermopower is mostly of the bulk origin, while the resistance is determined by both the edge and bulk transport.",

The spectra demonstrate a main phonon peak around 8 meV and a shallow second maximum near 16 meV. Their position is in line with the calculation of the EPI spectra of WTe2 in the literature, albeit phonons with higher energy are not resolved in our PC spectra. An additional contribution to the spectra is present above the phonon energy, what may be connected with the peculiar electronic band structure and need to be clarified. We detected tiny superconducting features in d2V/dI2 close to zero bias, which broadens by increasing temperature and blurs above 6K. Thus, (surface) superconductivity may exist in WTe2 with a topologically nontrivial state. We found a broad maximum in dV/dI at large voltages (>200 mV) indicating change of conductivity from metallic to semiconducting type. The latter might be induced by the high current density (~10^8 A/cm^2) in the PC and/or local heating, thus enabling the manipulation of the quantum electronic states at the interface in the PC core.",

States close to the Dirac point have a wider multifractal character than those far from this point as the impurity concentration is increased.

In recent years, a new type of carbon material graphdiyne (GDY) has been proposed. GDY acetylene has a special atomic arrangement that graphene does not have a two-dimensional network of sp 2 and sp conjugated intersections makes it easier to construct active sites and improve photocatalytic ability. In addition, GDY also has the advantage of adjusting the bandgap of other catalysts and inhibiting carrier recombination, making it more prone to hydrogen evolution reactions. In addition to using mechanical ball milling to produce GDY, NiWO 4 without precious metals was also prepared. The sheet-like structure of GDY in the composite catalyst provides a anchoring site and more active sites for the granular NiWO 4 . And the composite catalyst fully enhances the good conductivity of GDY and its unique ability to enhance electron transfer, greatly improving the ability of NiWO 4 as a single substance. Through in-situ x-ray photoelectron spectrometer, it was demonstrated that a p–n heterojunction was constructed between GDY and NiWO 4 in the composite catalyst, further enhancing the synergistic effect between the two, resulting in a hydrogen production rate of 90.92 μ mol for the composite catalyst is 4.56 times higher than that of GDY and 4.97 times higher than that of NiWO 4 , respectively, and the stability of the composite catalyst is significantly higher than that of each single catalyst.",

The resulting materials can convert CO 2 into carbon monoxide (CO) up to 70 h at a steady rate of ∼185 ± 30 µ mol g −1 h −1 with a selectivity of nearly 100%. This material system contained rich oxygen vacancies and generated new oxygen vacancies during the photocatalytic process. Oxygen vacancies mediate the interactions with excitons: (i) promoting the dissociation of free excitons; (ii) leading to form bound excitons under the coupling effect with phonons, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes as well as enhancing the long-term effectiveness of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.

Thermally stable, two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an ideal non-gas-permeable material with high transparency and flexibility. Nevertheless, the polycrystalline multilayer hBN (m-hBN) grown on a rough Fe foil by chemical vapor deposition is not sufficient for use as a gas barrier due to the non-uniformity and discontinuity of the film. Here, we report a novel method for synthesizing highly uniform and continuous m-hBN films on smooth Fe foil on a wafer scale via deposition of an amorphous Fe layer on a rough Fe foil. The amorphous Fe layer on a unary Fe foil is effectively recrystallized to become a smooth surface via post-thermal annealing treatment at 1100 °C. The smoothed surface allows for the uniform precipitation of B and N atoms to form a highly continuous m-hBN film, as confirmed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. m-hBN/graphene heterostructure on polyethylene terephthalate further demonstrates the significant improvement of gas barrier performance; a water vapor transmission rate of 0.01 g m−2 day is achieved, which is seven times lower than the previously reported value, while retaining a high transparency of 96.4% at a wavelength of 550 nm.",

Valleytronic material platform with anisotropic response is highly desired to develop polarization sensitive valleytronic devices. In this work, we acquire monolayer MoS 2 with both valley degree of freedom and anisotropy by introducing Re doping during chemical vapor deposition growth. The atomic substitution with Re element induces prominent n-type doping. Electrical tests under both dark and light illumination show that 5 at% Re-doped MoS 2 achieves the optimum electrical and optoelectrical performances, corresponding to 27 and 35 times improved carrier mobility and photoresponsivity than pristine MoS 2 , respectively. Second harmonic generation (SHG) and polarization Raman spectroscopy (PRS) indicate increased anisotropic optical response of Re doped MoS 2 as Re concentration increases: maximum anisotropic ratios of 1.6 and 1.7 have been achieved for SHG and PRS measurements at different doping concentrations, respectively. Circularly polarized PL measurement demonstrates that the Re-doped MoS 2 preserves valley dependent optical response. Our theoretical calculations show that the anisotropic response is due to the strain induced by the dopants, so that the 2H lattice structure optical helicity dependent valley selection rules are largely preserved.

We formulate an elasticity-based theory to model the phonon-mediated heat dissipation between a 2DLM and its h-BN substrate. By treating the h-BN substrate as a semi-infinite stack of harmonically coupled thin plates, we obtain semi-analytical expressions for the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) and interfacial phonon transmission spectrum. We evaluate the temperature-dependent TBC of the N -layer 2DLM (graphene or MoS 2 ) on different common substrates (h-BN vs. a-SiO 2 ) at different values of N . The results suggest that h-BN is substantially more effective for heat dissipation from MoS 2 than a-SiO 2 especially at large N .

We use density functional theory calculations, with Hubbard correction that is found to be needed to describe correctly the insulating nature of these compounds.

Interlayer exchange should lead both to exchange bias and to the emergence of hybrid collective modes that combine FM and AF magnons.

This enables us to continuously tune between a homogeneous graphene-like honeycomb lattice and a triangular lattice and to open an energy gap at the characteristic Dirac points. We probe the symmetry of the lattice with microwave spectroscopy techniques and investigate the behavior of atoms excited to the second energy band. We find a striking influence of the energy gap at the Dirac cones onto the lifetimes of atoms in the excited band.",

We discuss a spin-polarized version to the VDOF in which spin degeneracy is broken by the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling (LAFM) between opposite layers of the quasi-two-dimensional silicon nanomembrane (SiNM). Based on first principles calculations, we found that the LAFM state in SiNM can lead to metal–insulator transition (MIT). The broken degeneracy of spin degree of freedom in this insulating state of ultrathin SiNM may differ for different valleys, so that the SiNM can be exploited to produce the spatially separated spin and valley currents. We propose that the tunable spin-polarized valley photocurrents can be generated in an experimentally feasible ellipsometry setup. Our work shows promise for the development of spintronic and valleytronic devices compatible with current silicon industry.",

The continuous tunability of plasmon resonance is either unachievable in conventional plasmonic materials like noble metals or requires gate voltage regulation in graphene. Here we investigate a simplest form of terahertz metasurface, graphene nanoribbon arrays (GNRAs), and demonstrate the graphene plasmon resonance modes can be tailored by mechanical deformation of the elastomeric substrate using finite element method (FEM). By integrating the electric doping with substrate deformation, we have managed to tune the resonance wavelength from 13.7 to 50.6 μm. The 36.9 μm tuning range is nearly doubled compared with that by electric doping regulation only. Moreover, we observe the plasmon coupling effect in GNRAs on waved substrate and its evolution with substrate curvature. A new decoupling mechanism enabled by the out-of-plane separation of the adjacent ribbons is revealed. The out-of-plane setup of plasmonic components extends the fabrication of plasmonic devices into three-dimensional space, which simultaneously increases the nanoribbon density and decreases the coupling strength. Our findings provide an additional degree of freedom to design reconfigurable metasurfaces and metadevices.",

Density Functional Theory investigation of the honeycomb structure supports a structural model based on a Ti-O bilayer having Ti2O3 stoichiometry.

Besides, the PL signal is further increased as high as 4.7 times at low temperature due to reduced electron-phonon interactions and also sensitive to the gradient magnetic field. Apart from the efficient PL enhancement, the photocarrier pumping efficiency which is modulated by energy offset of top layer and external field is &gt;130 times greater than that in isolated MoSe 2 .

In particular, we find bulk shift photocurrents (SPCs) can display a rich (atomic) configuration dependent phenomenology that range from contrasting SPC currents for different stacking arrangements in a vdW homostructure (e.g. AB vs BA stacking) to a strong light polarization dependence for SPC that align with crystallographic axes. Strikingly, we find that SPC in vdW homostructures can be directed by modest strain, yielding sizeable photocurrent magnitudes under unpolarized light irradiation and manifesting even in the absence of p–n junctions. These demonstrate that SPC are intimately linked to how the Bloch wavefunctions are embedded in real space, and enables a new macroscopic transport probe (photocurrent) of lattice-scale registration in vdW materials.",

Current BNNS synthesis methods show low yield and/or purity preventing effective implementation in real-life applications. This work reports two catalyst-free bottom-up approaches for BNNS synthesis using induction thermal plasma. High enthalpy and cooling rates of this plasma allow BNNS to form homogeneously when using solid ammonia borane (AB) as a precursor. In this case, clusters of BxNyHz nucleate to form particles of critical sizes on which BNNS propagate while releasing H2. Using boron powders instead of AB produces BNNS through a heterogeneous route. In this case, boron undergoes spheroidization while active nitrogen species diffuse on the liquid surface to form boron nitride nanowalls which propagate into BNNS. The operating pressure and nitrogen loading are shown to control BNNS nucleation and growth and minimize by-products. An optimum operating pressure of 62 kPa provides axial velocities necessary for decomposing AB and melting boron. The synthesis process is well controlled yielding homogeneously grown BNNS of 30 × 30 nm sheet lateral sizes and ∼8 atomic layers, while the heterogeneously grown BNNS are of 100 × 100 nm and ∼20 layers. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous routes lead to BNNS structures showing exceptional crystallinity with defect-free stacking of the BN planes.",

Two-laser Raman scattering thermometry was used combined with real time measurements of the absorbed laser power. Measurements on MoS 2 layers with thicknesses of 5 and 14 nm exhibit thermal conductivity in the range between 12 Wm −1 K −1 and 24 Wm −1 K −1 . Additionally, after determining the thermal conductivity of the latter MoS 2 sample, an hBN flake was transferred onto it and the effective thermal conductivity of the heterostructure was subsequently measured. Remarkably, despite that the thickness of the hBN layer was less than a hal of the thickness of the MoS 2 layer, the heterostructure showed an almost eight-fold increase in the thermal conductivity, being able to dissipate more than ten times the laser power without any visible sign of damage. These results are consistent with a high thermal interface conductance G between MoS 2 and hBN and an efficient in-plane heat spreading driven by hBN. Indeed, we estimate G ∼ 70 MW m −2 K −1 for hBN layer thermal conductivity of 450 Wm −1 K −1 which is significantly higher than previously reported values. Our work therefore demonstrates that the insertion of hBN layers in potential MoS 2 -based devices holds the promise for efficient thermal management.",

In this paper it is demonstrated that a single layer of a 2D-VDW form of SiO 2 can be grown by ALD on Au and Pd polycrystalline foils and epitaxial films. The silica was deposited by two cycles of bis(diethylamino) silane and oxygen plasma exposure at 525 K. Initial deposition produced a three-dimensionally disordered silica layer; however, subsequent annealing above 950 K drove a structural rearrangement resulting in 2D-VDW. The annealing could be performed at ambient pressure. Surface spectra recorded after annealing indicated that the two ALD cycles yielded close to the silica coverage obtained for 2D-VDW silica prepared by precision SiO deposition in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). Analysis of ALD-grown 2D-VDW silica on a Pd(111) film revealed the co-existence of amorphous and incommensurate crystalline 2D phases. In contrast, ALD growth on Au(111) films produced predominantly the amorphous phase while SiO deposition in UHV led to only the crystalline phase, suggesting that the choice of Si source can enable phase control.",

The procedure is exemplified by MoS$_2$ in the H-phase, which constitutes a generic example of a 2D OAL material and the predicted fractional corner charges is verified by direct calculations of nanoflakes with armchair edges. We also determine the bulk topological polarization, which always lead to gapless states at zigzag edges and thus deteriorates the concept of fractional corner charges in nanoflakes with zigzag edges that are typically more stable that armchair flakes. We then consider the case of TiCl$_2$, which has vanishing polarization as well as an OAL and we verify that the edge states of nanoflakes with zigzag edges may indeed by passivated such that the edges remain insulating and the corner charges are well defined.

    "abstract": "Abstract The atomic reconstruction and moiré patterns within moiré superlattices resulting from twist, stretch and vertical pressure have generated significant interest in the exploration of novel physical phenomena. In this study, we reveal a universal structural transition in moiré superlattices through comprehensive numerical simulations and theoretical analyses. This transition is characterized by a shift in the moiré pattern from a strain soliton network state at large moiré periods to a soliton-free state at smaller moiré periods. This transition is marked by the convergence of two branches of total energy solutions at a critical moiré period. We propose an intuitive size rule, highlighting that one third of the moiré periods smaller than the width of strain solitons serve as a universal trigger for this transformation. Additionally, our research shows that applying external vertical pressure can enhance interlayer van der Waals interactions, resulting in a decrease in the critical moiré period. We also demonstrate that during this state transition, the maximum elastic interaction occurs in proximity to the critical moiré period. Such structural transition regulated by the adjustment of parameters such as twist angle, in-plane stretch and pressure, provides opportunities for manipulating the exotic electronic properties of van der Waals materials.",

Graphene, with its remarkable opto-electronic properties, is an ideal candidate for such applications. Further candidates are 2D polymers, crystalline polymeric materials with customizable structure and electronic properties that can be synthesized in all mathematically possible Bravais lattices. In this study, we investigated the optoelectronic properties of a heterostructure created by pristine graphene and a rectangular 2D polyimide (2DPI) film. This imprints a new superlattice on graphene in conjunction with a direct influence on its electronic properties. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that interlayer charge exchange between the 2D polymer and graphene induces hole doping in the graphene layer. We have also observed that the properties of the heterostructure are dependent on the substrate used in experiments, likely due to the porous character of the 2DPI allowing direct interaction of graphene with the support. These findings highlight the unique ability to tailor functionalities in 2D polymers-based heterostructures, allowing the development of optoelectronic devices with precisely engineered properties and stimulating further exploration of the diverse phenomena accessible through tailored designs of the 2D polymers",

The phase transition of confined matter inside a circular blister or the interfacial slippage at the perimeter of the blister may give rise to wrinkling and tenting instabilities in 2D material blisters. Extensive research has focused on gaining adhesion mechanical insights of such instabilities in 2D material blisters over smooth, rigid substrates like silicon. These insights carry profound implications for quantum emission, magneto-straintronics, plasmonics, and piezotronics. In contrast, blistering a 2D material over a viscoelastic substrate has not received much attention. This gap has led to the underexploration of unconventional but fascinating phenomenon of viscous fingering in 2D materials, recently realized experimentally. Therefore, there is a significant demand for comprehending the formation and dynamics of instabilities in 2D material blisters, necessitating a critical review to advance this field. This understanding is key to either promoting or mitigating such instabilities, which has huge importance for both fundamental research and emerging quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 2D Janus semiconductors with broken mirror symmetry and low-dimensional quantum confinement effect have attracted much attention, but most of them exhibit thermoelectric performance between their parents. Here, we explore the electron and phonon transport mechanism of monolayer SnP, SnAs and their Janus Sn2PAs based on first-principles and Boltzmann transport theory. In terms of electronic transport, the n-type doping presents obvious anisotropy, while the p-type doping gradually approaches isotropy from parents to their Janus structure. Importantly, different to usual Janus monolayers which lattice thermal conductivity is between those of their parents, Janus Sn2PAs has the lower lattice thermal conductivity than both its parents due to the competition between the moderate phonon group velocity and the short phonon relaxation time in Sn2PAs. The weaker anharmonicity but more three-phonon scattering channels lead to the short phonon relaxation time. Ultimately, the moderate power factor and the low lattice thermal conductivity make the optimal figure of merit of Janus Sn2PAs higher than those of its parents, reaching 1.41, 1.32 and 1.02 at 700 K for n-type Sn2PAs, SnP and SnAs, respectively. This work highlights the potential thermoelectric applications for Janus Sn2PAs, and will stimulate broad study on this class of 2D Janus thermoelectric materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, layered materials have become an interesting platform for quantum optics and nanophotonics. Among them, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted a widespread interest due to its peculiar defect-related luminescence properties. In particular, the possible generation and tailoring of color centers by particle irradiation are becoming pivotal aspects for next generation quantum optics and photonics. In this work, we use in-situ cathodoluminescence hyperspectral analysis to investigate the effect of fast-scanning, low-voltage electron irradiation on deep level emissions in the UV range. The quenching of the UV band and changes in the width of the near-band-edge UV luminescence of hBN are investigated as a function of the irradiation time. This quenching is assigned to the electron beam dissociation of in-plane carbon dimer, responsible for such emission, with a concurrent substitutional carbon atoms reconfiguration in donor acceptor pair with a spatial separation in the hBN lattice, that can be optically inactive or can emit in a different optical range, as demonstrated by the intensity decrease of below-bandgap excitation photoluminescence emissions. A possible mechanism of the UVB quenching is also the change of the charge state of the in-plane carbon dimer, that causes a light emission in a different optical range. In addition, ex-situ analyses reveal an important side effect of prolonged electron irradiation, such as the 40 nm thick deposition of tetrahedral amorphous carbon on top of the hBN flake. This is a clear evolution of the well-established electron beam induced surface contamination due to the adsorption of carbonic species.",

Photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy reveal a pronounced doping effect induced by ozone irradiation on the graphene layer. Transient absorption measurements demonstrate a substantial suppression of charge transfer efficiency across the interface in the presence of ozone molecules. Spatially resolved pump-probe measurements further show a significant reduction in the diffusion coefficient of photocarriers in WS 2 on ozone-irradiated graphene compared to that of individual WS 2 monolayers. The slower diffusion suggests enhanced spatial separation of electrons and holes in the WS 2 layer, induced by a built-in electric field at the interface. This effect arises from the combined influences of doping and dielectric property changes caused by ozone molecules. These findings highlight the critical influence of ozone irradiation on graphene and heterostructure interfaces, offering valuable insights for the design of future graphene-based two-dimensional heterostructures.",

In this direction, isotope engineering also offers a potential avenue to alter electron–phonon interaction and impact quasiparticle scattering processes. In this study, we investigate the dependence of sulfur isotopes on upconversion and valley scattering phenomena by collecting the resonance photoluminescence under an applied magnetic field from 0 to 14 T at 4 K for the chemical vapor deposition-grown monolayer (1 l) of W N S 2 , W 32 S 2 , and W 34 S 2 . The upconversion of the mixed-state sulfur 1 l (W N S 2 ) exhibits one M-phonon absorption, with an obtained optical gain of nearly 30 meV, while the pure sulfur isotope labelled 1 Ls (W 32 S 2 and W 34 S 2 ) require two phonons (M and Г), yielding a gain of around 80 meV. It is also found that the exciton degree of polarization (DOP) of W N S 2 changes significantly by ∼ −30% as the field increases from 0 to 14 T, while for W 32 S 2 and W 34 S 2 , the exciton DOP increases by up to ∼8%. Similarly, distinct changes in the DOP are observed for trions and localized excitons among all the samples, attributed to the different valley scattering phenomena. The 1 l W N S 2 demonstrates a combination of intraband and interband scattering, whereas in the case of W 32 S 2 intraband scattering is preferred; W 34 S 2 predominantly exhibits interband scattering. Finally, a phenomenological model is proposed to describe the upconversion and valley scattering processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Major depressive disorder (MDD), a primary cause of disability across the globe, is mainly characterised by symptoms such as loss of interest and depressed mood. While there are, in general, effective treatment strategies available for MDD, there is a wide variability in treatment response between individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify reliable and easily accessible predictors to guide treatment decisions. To date, no tests exist to enable the prediction of the individual treatment response based on biofluids such as blood, serum, plasma, and saliva. Due to the increasing number of patients suffering from MDD, there is an urgent need for modern techniques such as biosensors to predict the treatment outcome and to potentially identify responsive subgroups for individual treatments. Recent research into different biomarkers for MDD offers an opportunity to develop biosensors to overcome the challenges faced by the conventional diagnostic tools. Over the past decade, substantial efforts have been dedicated to achieving this goal. In this process, graphene and its derivatives worked as an excellent transducer material for designing sensitive electrochemical/electrical biosensing platforms. Therefore, integrating graphene with the potential MDD biomarkers offers a promising approach towards the realization of reliable and cost-effective biosensors. This perspective provides an insight into the recent developments in the electrochemical/electrical biosensors for MDD biomarker quantification designed utilizing graphene and its derivatives. We also discuss the major challenges and next steps required to develop and further optimize biosensors for monitoring the response to different therapy options related to MDD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Single-photon emission centers generated by controlled atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation in monolayer WSe 2 on a flexible polymer substrate are explored for applications in quantum technologies. Here, we study the response of these emitters to the polymer substrate’s strain state, which is controlled by selecting the indentation force and by gradually thermally annealing the samples. In the indented areas, we observe sharp new photoluminescence (PL) peaks in the regions 1.62 − 1.68 eV and 1.70 − 1.73 eV characterized by sublinear power dependence and spectral wandering. We find that these peaks arise only when the indentation force exceeds a few μN and generally red-shift as the applied force increases. Conversely, after thermal annealing (T &lt; 60 °C), WSe 2 experiences strain relaxation, leading to a blue shift of the peaks’ spectral position and their ultimate disappearance. Our analysis of the peaks’ positions&amp;#xD;vs. strain allows us to draw several conclusions about the nature of these emission. Specifically, we elucidate the roles of excitonic confinement and hybridization between free excitons and defect-related states, a process activated by the strain level. Overall, our approach suggests that the energy of localized emitters may be controlled via strain engineering.",

Beyond the conventional polarization-state regulation through electric-field, 2D ferroelectrics can offer important additional functionalities through isomeric phases, including paraelectric and antiferroelectric phases. In recent years, a variety of novel ferroelectric orders have been discovered in 2D materials, resulting from intra- or inter-layer symmetry-breaking. These hidden phases, exhibit attractive properties, and understanding their phase transition mechanisms and controlling the transitions has become a central topic in the field of 2D ferroelectrics. Furthermore, phase control is a primary step towards scalable synthesis of 2D ferroelectrics and device applications. Here, we highlight the diverse mechanisms of the phase transitions in 2D ferroelectrics, particularly intrinsic and extrinsic ferroelectrics. We also summarize different approaches and respective conditions for phase control. Moreover, the in situ experimental techniques for studying phase transitions, and the rationalized scalable synthetic methods of 2D ferroelectrics are discussed. Finally, rich functionalities, opportunities and emerging applications combining phase control and ferroelectricity in phase-change ferroelectric devices are envisioned, with the remaining challenges briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The overall performance of a nanodevice is particularly sensitive to the contact properties at the interface between the two-dimensional (2D) channel material and the metallic electrode. Recently reported 2D semiconducting gold sulfide (AuS), which exhibits with superior oxidation resistance and high carrier mobility, shows great potential as a channel material for innovative applications in electronics. In this study, we systematically investigated the interfacial electronic properties and contact types of AuS in conjunction with various metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (m-TMDs) using first-principles calculations. T-VTe2, T-TaSe2, T-TiTe2, T-CoTe2, T-NbSe2, and T-TaS2 possess lower work functions (4.62-5.05 eV), enabling them to form n-type Schottky contacts with AuS. In contrast, T-NbS2 and T-TiTe2, which have higher work functions (5.31-6.06 eV), form p-type Schottky contacts with AuS. Additionally, H-TaSe2, H-NbSe2, H-TaS2, and H-NbS2 establish p-type Ohmic contacts. The tunneling probabilities of AuS/m-TMDs heterostructures range from 4.44% to 23.38%. Furthermore, the n-type Schottky contact of AuS/T-TaSe2 transitions to an n-type Ohmic (or p-type Schottky) contact under a biaxial strain of ≤ -4.57% (or an interlayer distance difference of ≤ -0.47 Å). Additionally, the p-type Ohmic contact of AuS/H-TaSe2 (and AuS/H-NbSe2) can be converted to a p-type Schottky contact with an interlayer distance difference of ≥ 0.13 Å (0.24Å), a biaxial strain of ≤ -1.18% (-1.76 %), or an external electric field of ≤ -0.03 V/Å (-0.28 V/Å). The tunneling probabilities of AuS/m-TMDs heterostructures vary significantly with decreasing interlayer distance, while they remain relatively constant when subjected to biaxial strain or an external electric field. Our findings suggest that the contact types and tunneling probabilities of AuS/m-TMDs heterojunctions can be effectively tuned, making them are promising candidates for next-generation electronics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) present a favorable solution to energy storage challenges, offering lower material costs and greater resource availability compared to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Nevertheless, NIBs lack a good anode comparable to what graphite has been for LIBs. The existing anode materials are constrained by their inherent limitations on capacity, rate capability and cycling stability. Herein, we have synthesized 2D-2D heterostructure (FePS3-Ti3C2Tx) by mixing both constituents followed by a freeze drying process. The synergistic combination of higher theoretical capacity FePS3 a two dimensional transition metal thiophosphite and Ti3C2Tx MXene with structural flexibility resulting in an improvement in the overall electrochemical performance. The FePS3, FePS3-Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx was tested for rate performance and cycling stability. Even though the capacity of FePS3 was higher at 1.0 A/g, when it was cycled at 10.0 A/g the heterostructure outperformed FePS3. Additionally, the cycling of FePS3-Ti3C2Tx at 10 A/g was conducted, which showed a capacity of 205 mAh/g at the end of 100 cycles and 195.8 mAh/g at the end of 500 cycles with a capacity retention of about 95% at the end. These results established that the heterostructure exhibit high rate capability and with minimal capacity fading over extended cycles, a potential anode for long-term use in high-power sodium ion battery applications. Furthermore, the enhanced electrochemical kinetics are attributed to the efficient interfacial cum pseudocapacitive storage and structural integrity maintained throughout the galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. Mxene provides a conductive network and accelerate the electrochemical performances by buffering the volume change. The 2D-2D heterostructure facilitates the Na+ ion diffusion and promotes pseudocapapcitive behavior as confirmed from CV and EIS. In addition, the ex-situ TEM analysis shows the well mechanical integration of heterostructure after repeated cycling. These findings show the potential of FePS3-Ti3C2Tx as anode for next generation sodium ion batteries.",

This study investigates the structural and spectroscopic characteristics of MoS 2 NSs, correlating them to show the effects of reduced interlayer interactions on excitons of MoS 2 NSs. The reduction in interlayer interaction arises from two main factors: (1) symmetry-broken mixed stacking due to misalignment between layers and (2) a highly inhomogeneous strain profile generated by the Archimedean spiral geometry with positive eccentricity. Transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation measurements confirm these findings. Low-temperature PL spectroscopy explores the impact of reduced interlayer interactions on exciton properties such as exciton–phonon coupling and oscillator strength.

    "abstract": "Abstract Growing research interests are being devoted to the monolithic integration of complementary field-effect transistors (CFETs), which promise aggressive footprint reduction and improved performance. However, the bottom transistor usually suffers from poor immunity to short channel effects (SCEs), such as a degraded subthreshold swing (SS). The presence of the substrate capacitance imposes a penalty on the electrostatic integrity (EI) for the bottom transistor, yielding asymmetric boundary conditions for each component of CFETs. Herein, MoS2 and MoTe2 are assembled as the n- and p-type channel materials respectively, and the characteristic length&amp;#xD;models for each type of transistor in a CFET are proposed to elucidate the unbalanced immunity to SCEs, stemming from the non-identical dielectric environment that they experience. The derived surface potential exhibits an excellent agreement with Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulations. Furthermore, the effect of characteristic length on the static and dynamic behavior of CFET circuits is systematically studied. To mitigate parasitic effects, we introduce the silicon nitride spacer into CFETs, which is demonstrated to play a pivotal role in implementing high-performant integrated circuits (ICs) by suppressing the fringe capacitance. The oscillation frequency of CFET with the spacer reaches up to 160 MHz at a supply voltage of 2 V, with 2× improvement compared to the one without the spacer. This work highlights the role of substrate in curbing the scaling capability of CFETs and offers design guidelines about material screening, stacking strategy, and structure optimization to enable the scaling and performance enhancement of CFETs at both transistor and circuit levels.",

Furthermore, these vacancies change the stacking sequence of SiC from its original 6H configuration to a 3C structure. After metal intercalation, the topmost SiC layer showed increased HAADF intensity relative to the bulk, suggesting the incorporation of heavier metals into this layer. This top SiC layer showed a sensitivity to e-beam damage, similar to the metallic bonding observed in two-dimensional (2D) metals.

They hold great promise in these fields due to their remarkable properties, such as high surface area, electrical conductivity and modular chemistry. However, they face significant challenges related to biocompatibility, long-term safety, reproducible large-scale production and lack of standardization and clinical protocols, among others. This review presents a comprehensive overview of their application in regenerative medicine and interactions with various biological systems. We comment on the influence of their innate, but tunable properties on biological response. The chemical composition and exfoliation state of these materials also play a critical role in their bioactivity. The high sensitivity of 2D materials to humidity holds a significant promise in sensor development, which is presented here in detail. Combining them with polymer matrices can enhance the flexibility and performance of the sensors, making them suitable for wearable devices and environmental monitoring. However, challenges remain in the search for the best sensing characteristics, which can be addressed through functionalization and combining with alternative materials, like metal oxide nanowires. We critically examined the key challenges (biological interactions, exposure risks, environmental changes and scalability), while assessing their potential for sustainable technologies. Despite the advancements, thorough safety assessments are needed before large-scale production and clinical deployment of 2D materials for health sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Carbon-based supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged as promising candidates for high-power, fast-charging energy storage, bridging the performance gap between traditional capacitors and batteries. This perspective explores the current landscape and future direction of carbon-based electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), focusing on activated carbon, graphene, and their derivatives. We highlight key performance-limiting factors in real-world devices including electrode composition, electrolyte selection, and device form factor. Special attention is given to sustainable materials sourcing, low-temperature and high-temperature operation, and the transition toward greener electrode processing. While curved graphene has already demonstrated successful scalability from lab to commercial device formats, other promising advanced materials, e.g., N-doped graphene and graphdyine, are still in the early stages of this transition. Although these materials offer outstanding performance at the fundamental level, integrating them into practical, scalable SC architectures continues to pose significant challenges. A systems-level optimization, encompassing electrodes’ architecture, manufacturing compatibility, and novel electrolytes, is crucial to unlock the full potential of SCs. By integrating material innovation with scalable engineering, carbon-based SCs can meet the growing energy demands of modern applications, from portable electronics to aerospace and grid storage.",

Various methods have been developed to assemble MXene nanosheets into macroscopic fibers by wet-spinning, coating, electrospinning, and biscrolling. However, the weak interfacial interactions, misalignment, and void defects during the assembly usually degrade the properties of the resultant MXene fibers, limiting their practical applications. Natural nacre shows extraordinary mechanical properties because of the aligned and compact structure with the abundant interfacial interactions between aragonite platelets and organic matrix, which provides inspiration for assembling MXene nanosheets into high-performance macroscopic fibers. In this review, the intrinsic mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of MXene nanosheets are firstly introduced, followed by analyzing the relationship between the structure and mechanical properties of natural nacre. The recent research progress of bioinspired MXene-based nanocomposite fibers (BMNFs) is then reviewed, highlighting how to rationally design the interfacial interactions between adjacent MXene nanosheets, improve the alignment of MXene nanosheets, and remove the void defects in BMNFs. Next, the applications of BMNFs in electrical wires, electromagnetic interference shielding, Joule heating, photothermal conversion, thermoelectric and triboelectric generators, sensors, supercapacitors, and artificial muscles are discussed. Finally, the existing challenges in the field of BMNFs are summarized and a perspective on the future roadmap for BMNFs to promote their practical applications is proposed.",

Due to the asymmetrical device structure of 2D-FETs, the generated stress is distributed non-uniformly, with maximum compressive stress concentrated near the source ‘S’ terminal rather than the drain ‘D’ terminal. Among the studied channel lengths ( L ∼ 0.135 μ m to L ∼ 10 μ m), longer channels exhibit higher stress near the source terminal than the drain side, attributed to proximity effects under a constant applied load. An increase in gate leakage current with increasing MS is consistently observed, suggesting the generation of shallow traps. At the same time, the apparent reduction in the band gap lower the barrier for electron emission, giving rise to behaviour that appears consistent with a low-voltage dependent Poole–Frenkel mechanism approaching ohmic characteristics. Notably, upon removal of the MS, the gate leakage fully recovers. These findings underscore the mechanical sensitivity of HfO 2 gate dielectrics in 2D TMDs semiconductor devices and provide new insights into MS-induced reliability concerns, as well as the potential for mechanically changed electronic responses.",

As the relative twist angle between the layers approaches 0°, referred to as parallel (P) stacking, or 60°, referred to as antiparallel (AP) stacking, reconstructions occur to maximise the area of lowenergy stacking domains, with a lattice of nodes of high-energy stacking connected by domain walls (DWs). We show that Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) can provide sufficiently precise energetics of stacking, strain, shear and varying interlayer distances to be used in place of the corresponding ground-truth vdW-corrected DFT for systems dramatically larger than those that can be treated with ab initio methods. We predict, explain, and quantify the domain reconstruction patterns for all like-chalcogen combinations of the Transition Metal Dichalcogenides MoS 2 , MoSe 2 , WS 2 and WSe 2 down to twist angles approaching 1°. We demonstrate effects including triangular and kagome-like patterns in low-twist P and AP systems, respectively, and twirling around domain nodes in heterobilayers. For homobilayers, we present and parameterize an energy model that decomposes the total energy into contributions from constituent structural units. We further provide an experimental comparison for the MoS 2 homobilayer, which shows strong agreement with observed reconstruction patterns.",

It is predicted that NPG may, despite its molecular structure, work as electron waveguides that display e.g. Talbot wave interference. Here, we demonstrate how the electronic wave guidance may be controlled by the use of electrical fields transverse to the ribbons; at low fields, point-injected currents display spatially periodic patterns along the ribbons, while high fields localize the injected current to single ribbons. This behavior constitutes an electronic version of optical breathing modes of Bloch oscillations, providing a simple mechanism for controlling the current patterns down to the molecular scale. The robustness of the self-repeating patterns under disorder demonstrate that the breathing modes of single-ribbon injections offer exciting opportunities for applications in nanoelectronics, molecular sensing, and quantum information processing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The quest for cleaner, sustainable, and carbon-neutral alternative approaches for energy production has been a key focus of research for the scientific community over the past few decades in response to ever increasing global energy demand and the need to find sustainable solutions to address the same. To this end, semiconductor photocatalysis mediated solar energy harvesting is a highly promising approach. Through this technology, solar energy is transformed into chemical fuels such as hydrogen, methane, ammonia etc. which requires semiconductor photocatalysts that drive redox reactions upon solar illumination. Two-dimensional bismuth oxyhalides have shown their potential in boosting solar to fuel conversion efficacy owing to composition-tunable electronic bandgaps and layer dependent optoelectronic properties. Standalone photocatalysts suffer from the issues of limited absorption in the visible regime of the solar spectrum and sluggish kinetics for charge separation. 2D/2D van der Waals heterojunctions (vDWHs) hold great promise for the production of solar fuels due to superior charge separation, suitable redox potentials, and large interfacial contact areas. The design, construction, and photocatalytic activity of bismuth oxyhalide-based vDWHs for the generation of hydrogen from water splitting, chemical fuels from CO2, and ammonia from N2 fixation have been extensively reviewed herein. We conclude with the prospects and outlook on vDWHs for clean energy harvesting in the future.&amp;#xD;",

    "abstract": "The phase retrieval problem is a fundamental shortcoming of all diffraction-based methods, arising from the inability to measure the phase of scattered waves. The (normal incidence) X-ray standing wave (NIXSW) technique circumvents this issue by introducing a (Bragg-generated) X-ray standing wave field throughout the sample, relative to which any atomic species can be localized by probing its fluorescence or photoelectron yield. In essence, in a single measurement the complex scattering factor (i.e., its amplitude \\textit{and} phase) corresponding to the used Bragg reflection is determined. Performing this for multiple Bragg reflections enables one to reconstruct the scattering density of the sample in three dimensions, straightforwardly as the Fourier sum of all measured (complex) scattering factors. Here, we utilize this technique to reveal the structural key features involved in the formation of the quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene on silicon carbide. In this prominent example, the two-dimensional Bi layer is confined between a 4H-SiC substrate crystal and an epitaxial graphene layer. The key finding is a change in the adsorption site of the Bi atoms underneath the graphene upon hydrogenation, caused by the H-saturation of one (out of three) Si dangling bonds per unit cell. This structural change, clearly revealed by our NIXSW imaging experiment, is the key feature leading to the formation of the characteristic band structure of the 2D bismuthene honeycomb.",

Employing a dimensional reduction framework, we identify the Zak phase along the quadratically dispersing direction as a topological invariant that captures the presence of edge states. In the non-trivial topological regime, systems with finite width exhibit energy-dependent edge states that are topologically protected only at specific momenta. At $k_x=0$, symmetry-protected edge states emerge, analogously to the Rashba-free case. At finite $k_x$, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and band structure gives rise to spin-dependent edge states, localized on specific edges based on its spin and particle-hole character. We computed spin-resolved conductance through these edge channels and observed robust, tunable oscillations—attributable to spin precession induced by the effective Rashba magnetic field. These results reveal how spin-orbit interactions enrich the edge physics of semi-Dirac systems and provide a platform for spintronic control in anisotropic topological materials.",

The emergence of interfacial ferroelectricity generally requires the breaking of spatial symmetries, as demonstrated in parallel-stacked transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) systems. In twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG), previous studies have primarily focused on the anti-parallel stacking configuration (180° + δ twist), where transport signatures of ferroelectricity have been observed. In contrast, in TDBG with parallel stacking (0° + δ twist), however, the system preserves inversion symmetry, thus precluding intrinsic interfacial ferroelectricity. Here, by introducing an h-BN substrate to break these spatial symmetries, we report the first direct observation of interfacial ferroelectricity in parallel stacked TDBG. Using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), we visualize gate-tunable moiré domain expanding and shrinking evolution and reversible interlayer stacking transitions. Our findings reveal that symmetry tuning in TDBG constitutes a promising strategy for investigating interfacial ferroelectricity.",

A germanene (7√7×7√7) superstructure, obtained upon heating at 500 °C followed by cooling at room temperature, transforms into a germanene (√109×√109) superstructure after further annealing at 250 °C and subsequently evolves into the Ag-Ge surface alloy upon annealing at 350 °C, as evidenced from the thorough analysis by scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and core-level (CL) photoemission spectroscopy. Angle-resolved CL spectra reveal that germanium preferentially occupies the topmost atomic layer, forming the (7√7×7√7) and (√109×√109) superstructures. In contrast, germanium is distributed within at least a few layers for the striped incommensurate surface alloy phase. From angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the electronic structures of the (7√7×7√7) and (√109×√109) superstructures appear to be almost the same. Based on these considerations, the surface phase diagram of Ge/Ag(111)/Ge(111) has been constructed. These findings provide insights into the relationship between germanene thermal stability and Ge concentration at the surface region of Ag(111).",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel growth technique, in which graphene is synthesized on capped Cu thin films deposited on c-plane sapphire. The cap is another sapphire plate which is just laid upon the Cu thin film, in direct contact with it. Thanks to this 'contact cap', Cu evaporation can be suppressed at high temperature and the 400 nm-thick Cu films can be annealed above 1000 °C, resulting in (1 1 1)-oriented grains of millimeter size. Following this high temperature annealing, graphene is grown by chemical vapor deposition during the same pump-down operation, without removing the contact cap. The orientation and doping type of the as-grown graphene were first studied, using low energy electron diffraction, as well as high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In particular, the orientation relationships between the graphene and copper thin film with respect to the sapphire substrate were precisely determined. We find that the graphene sheets exhibit a minimal rotational disorder, with ~90% of the grains aligned along the copper high symmetry direction. Detailed transport measurements were also performed using field-effect transistor structures. Carrier mobility values as high as 8460 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been measured on top gate transistors fabricated directly on the sapphire substrate, by etching the Cu film from underneath the graphene sheets. This is by far the best carrier mobility value obtained to date for graphene sheets synthesized on a thin film-type metal substrate.",

The main strategy of the improvement is the composition control of catalytic substrate to copper-nickel alloy (4.25 at% of Ni), via both increasing the initial density of graphitic nuclei and facilitating the rotations of isolated graphene domains during the recrystallization process of 2D graphene. Compared to graphene grown from the pure copper substrate, the areal density of the single-crystal graphene from the alloy increases from 22% to 88%. The improvement of electrical property of graphene is also confirmed by the measurement of sheet resistance and mobility whose value is enhanced to 40% and 17%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Optical and electronic properties of black phosphorus strongly depend on the number of layers and type of stacking. Using first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory, we investigate the electronic properties of bilayer black phosphorus with an interlayer twist angle of 90°. These calculations are complemented with a simple model which is able to capture most of the low energy features and is valid for arbitrary twist angles. The electronic spectrum of 90° twisted bilayer black phosphorus is found to be x-y isotropic in contrast to the monolayer. However x-y anisotropy, and a partial return to monolayer-like behavior, particularly in the valence band, can be induced by an external out-of-plane electric field. Moreover, the preferred hole effective mass can be rotated by 90° simply by changing the direction of the applied electric field. In particular, a 0.4 (−0.4) V out-of-plane electric field results in a ∼60% increase in the hole effective mass along the () axis and enhances the () ratio as much as by a factor of 40. Our DFT and simulations clearly indicate that the twist angle in combination with an appropriate gate voltage is a novel way to tune the electronic and optical properties of bilayer phosphorus and it gives us a new degree of freedom to engineer the properties of black phosphorus based devices.",

    "abstract": "Quantum electrodynamics predicts that heavy atoms ($Z > Z_c \\approx 170$) will undergo the process of atomic collapse where electrons sink into the positron continuum and a new family of so-called collapsing states emerges. The relativistic electrons in graphene exhibit the same physics but at a much lower critical charge ($Z_c \\approx 1$) which has made it possible to confirm this phenomenon experimentally. However, there exist conflicting predictions on the effect of a magnetic field on atomic collapse. These theoretical predictions are based on the continuum Dirac-Weyl equation, which does not have an exact analytical solution for the interplay of a supercritical Coulomb potential and the magnetic field. Approximative solutions have been proposed, but because the two effects compete on similar energy scales, the theoretical treatment varies depending on the regime which is being considered. These limitations are overcome here by starting from a tight-binding approach and computing exact numerical results. By avoiding special limit cases, we found a smooth evolution between the different regimes. We predict that the atomic collapse effect persists even after the magnetic field is activated and that the critical charge remains unchanged.

    "abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP) has emerged as a promising material candidate for next generation electronic and optoelectronic devices due to its high mobility, tunable band gap and highly anisotropic properties. In this work, polarization resolved ultrafast mid-infrared transient reflection spectroscopy measurements are performed to study the dynamical anisotropic optical properties of BP under magnetic fields up to 9 T. The relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carrier is found to be insensitive to the applied magnetic field due to the broadening of the Landau levels and large effective mass of carriers. While the anisotropic optical response of BP decreases with increasing magnetic field, its enhancement due to the excitation of hot carriers is similar to that without magnetic field. These experimental results can be well interpreted by the magneto-optical conductivity of the Landau levels of BP thin film, based on an effective k · p Hamiltonian and linear response theory. These findings suggest attractive possibilities of multi-dimensional control of anisotropic response (AR) of BP with light, electric and magnetic field, which further introduces BP to the fantastic magnetic field sensitive applications.",

The increase in signal allows us to study Raman spectra with high signal-to-noise ratio.

We find excellent agreement between experimental data and simulations describing the spectral dependence of the enhancement and modifications of the polarization anisotropy. The strong field gradients in the optical near-field further allow us to probe the subwavelength coherence properties of the phonon modes in the nanoribbons.

Here, we report a new approach inspired by crack lithography to localize deformation and achieve localized crumpling of 2D materials. As a result, a mixed-dimensional structure composed of flat (2D) and crumpled (3D) structure is formed monolithically in 2D materials. We present structural analysis of our mixed-dimensional structure of graphene, where the localized prestrain was amplified to be 330% of the macroscale prestrain. In addition, we demonstrate the material densification and the strain localizations of our mixed-dimensional structure of monolayer MoS2 and graphene based on Raman and photoluminescence spectral characterizations. Finally, our mixed-dimensional graphene structure is fabricated into a stretchable strain sensor, where it exhibits four times enhanced gauge factor compared to that of delocalized crumpled graphene.",

In the present work, a wrinkled graphene based highly sensitive and stable electric generator has been developed and applied to multiple seawater movements with superior performances. The electric generation mechanism from the mechanical movements of seawater including droplet movement, boundary shift, and continuous flow is explored, and the corresponding electric generation performances are evaluated. The results suggest that the surface wrinkle nanostructure of graphene can enable energy harvesting from continuously flowing ionic liquid due to the drifting of adsorbed ions and ion accumulation in the wrinkles. Based on these results, a miniaturized sea energy harvesting system is fabricated and evaluated with simulated seawater flow and tidal waves.

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides have shown promise for numerous applications because of their potential for a large surface area to volume ratio, while maintaining many of the useful properties of transition metal carbides. Recent work has explored the use of chemical vapor deposition on liquid metal substrates to controllably synthesize transition metal carbides. While alloys have been used to lower the required synthesis temperature, further understanding of the impact of these substrates on the synthesis mechanism is needed for future optimization. This work systematically analyzes the effects of using a Ag-Cu alloy as a substrate for Mo2C synthesis by chemical vapor deposition at a temperature below the melting point of Cu. The impact of parameters, such as time, cooling rate, composition of the alloy substrate, and methane partial pressure, on the synthesis and structure of Mo2C is studied. The results conclusively demonstrate that synthesis of Mo2C is controlled by Mo diffusion through the liquid alloy. Utilizing a Ag-Cu alloy as a substrate successfully reduced the necessary synthesis temperature below the melting point of Cu; however, Mo2C coalescence is limited due to the separation of the Ag and Cu components in the alloy upon cooling. The results show that Ag alone is not a suitable substrate for Mo2C synthesis, and Mo2C flake size decreased with increasing Ag concentration in the Ag-Cu alloy substrate. This is most likely due to the inability of Ag to dehydrogenate methane effectively. Thus, an optimal substrate for Mo2C synthesis should be able to dehydrogenate methane, have a low melting temperate, and, if an alloy, demonstrate solid solubility.",

Herein, the 2D GO laminar membranes were prepared on the modified Nylon-6 substrates via LBL method by employing positively charged P–GO (guanidine modified GO nanosheets) and negatively charged S–GO (sulfonated GO nanosheets) as assembly flakes. This smart strategy was established on the superiority of LBL method by adjusting the assembly layer number and outermost charge when faced up with the different targeted contaminants. Benefited from the compact structures and intense charge, the LBL membranes can almost remove all the employed dyes (above 98% rejection for ML11 membrane).

The membranes can endure the filtration of dye wasterwater and salt solution for above 168 h under cross-flow mode without rejection decline. Also, these versatile LBL membranes reveal high resistance to both chemical corrosion and bacterial attack, which is suitable for the continuous separation even under hostile external environment.",

Atomically thin TMDs can be assembled in vertical stacks that are held together by van der Waals forces, enabling interlayer coupling between the layers. This creates new physical properties that depend on the relative orientation (twist angle) between the TMD monolayers. Accurate and fast measurement of the twist angle is therefore of utmost importance for characterizing a 2D TMD heterostructure. Here, we present a nonlinear imaging technique based on second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy, that enables instantaneous mapping of the twist angle between the two stacked TMD monolayers. By using a polarization beam splitter in the detection path and two detectors measuring two orthogonal SHG polarization components, we acquire with a single-shot measurement the twist angle in a WS 2 /MoS 2 heterobilayer, in real time. Remarkably, the twist angle is measured directly in the overlapping region based on a SHG interference model. The demonstrated technique offers a powerful tool for the rapid, all-optical and spatially resolved twist angle determination in large-area 2D TMD heterostructures.",

Atomistic-scale simulations show that vacancy arrays can result from steric hindrance of bulky gas-phase precursors at narrowly separated growth edges, and that increasing the edge separation leads to various intact and defective growth modes, which are driven by competition between the catalytic effects of the sapphire substrate and neighboring growth edge. Therefore, we hypothesize that the arrays result from combined growth modes, which directly result from film coalescence.

In spite of this promise, the solar energy conversion efficiency of graphene-based devices falls short of the performance of competing solution-processable photovoltaic technologies. Here we address the question of the maximum achievable open-circuit voltage of all-organic graphene: polymer solar cells using a combined theoretical/experimental approach, going from the atomic scale level to the device level. Our calculations on very large atomistic models of the graphene/polymer interface indicate that the ideal open-circuit voltage approaches one volt, and that epoxide functional groups can have a dramatic effect on the photovoltage. Our predictions are confirmed by direct measurements on complete devices where we control the concentration of functional groups via chemical reduction. Our findings indicate that the selective removal of epoxide groups and the use of ultradisperse polymers are key to achieving graphene solar cells with improved energy conversion efficiency.",

In this contribution, by taking advantage of the strong light–matter interaction, a nonlinear diffraction method is demonstrated to identify OAM modes. The nonlinear diffraction device (NDD) composed of WS2 nanosheets is employed to excite the optical Kerr nonlinear effect. Owing to the large Kerr coefficient of layered WS2, the spatial phase shift of VBs are readily regulated, resulting in controllable diffraction rings and tails, from which we can directly identify the magnitude and signs of OAM modes. The incident light intensity also expands the intensity distribution because the enhanced nonlinear phase shift will enlarge the diffraction rings, which provides an efficient way to identify the OAM and intensity of VBs simultaneously. It is anticipated that the optical nonlinearity might afford new opportunities for detecting structured lights and may have great potentials in designing all-optical OAM devices, etc.",

However, the CVD synthesis of other nickel dichalcogenides is still unknown. Here we report the synthesis of NiSe2, NiTe2 and alloy NiSe2−xTex (0 < x < 2) nanosheets through a similar CVD method. We found that the growth temperature has great influences on the shape, size and thickness of as-grown nanosheets. When the growth temperature is about 650 °C, the as-grown NiSe2 and NiTe2 nanosheets are as thin as 2.7 nm and 3.1 nm, respectively, which is equal to three layers of crystal unit. Combining the transmission electron microscopy and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope characterizations, the atomic structures of NiSe2, NiTe2 and alloy NiSe2−xTex are proved to be hexagonal with little differences in the lattice parameters. The energy dispersive spectrometer and Raman spectra demonstrate a wide range of the x in NiSe2−xTex from nearly 0 to almost 2, which proves that the chemical composition can be readily tunable.",

Here, we report the observation of temperature-induced chemical potential shift and Lifshitz transition in a layered type-II Weyl semimetal, TaIrTe 4 . The reversal of the polarity of the Hall resistivity and thermoelectric power (TEP) as the temperature increases clearly signal an appreciable shift of the chemical potential and change of the Fermi surface. It is corroborated by the improving agreement between the experimental TEP and the one calculated with temperature-dependent chemical potential. The complete disappearance of an electron pocket, consistent with the change of the Fermi surface when the chemical potential moves downwards, provides an evident signature of a temperature-induced Lifshitz transition in TaIrTe 4 .",

    "abstract": "Abstract The two-dimensional layered material MoTe 2 has aroused extensive research interests in its rich optoelectronic properties in various phases. One property of particular interest is the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE): a conventional second order nonlinear optical effect that is related to the chirality of materials. It has been demonstrated in T d -MoTe 2 , a type-II topological Weyl semimetal candidate, while it has been unclear so far whether it exists in the semimetallic 1T’ phase, another interesting phase that hosts a quantum spin hall state. In this article, we report a clear experimental observation of in-plane CPGE in 1T’-MoTe 2 . The observation is confirmed under various experimental designs with excitation by normally incident mid-infrared laser, and we find it to be related to an in-plane internal DC electric field. We attribute the circular photogalvanic response to a third-order nonlinear optical effect involving this DC electric field, which is consistent with the crystal symmetry of the lattices and present in both the 1T’ and T d phases of the material.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Density functional theory based calculations and experimental analysis on a limited number of real samples are performed to study how the presence of silver intercalated in the van der Waals gap of few-layer MoS 2 affects the low-frequency Raman active modes of this material. Silver is found to predominantly affect the breathing-like and shear-like vibrational modes of MoS 2 . These modes correspond to quasi-rigid movements of each individual layer with a restoring force (and, in turn, frequency) that is determined by modulations in the weak interlayer interactions. Noticeable red-shifts with increasing Ag concentration are found for all low-frequency modes. This finding indicates the potential for low-frequency vibrations as useful gauges for practical determination of silver concentration using low-frequency Raman spectroscopy. This work also describes a semi-classical linear chain model that allows to extrapolate results to a large number of layers. Further, first-principles calculations show how Raman spectroscopy can be used to characterize the quality of the two-dimensional interface between MoS 2 and a silver substrate.",

In the visible spectrum, the observed single-photon emitters are notoriously heterogeneous, exhibiting a range of properties. To harness these emitters for quantum applications, identification and characterization of the responsible defects are of paramount importance. Towards this end, we characterize the effects of out-of-plane displacements on boron dangling bonds, which have been suggested as the microscopic origin of the emission. We find that the out-of-plane displacements influence the zero-phonon line energy as well as the coupling to phonons.

    "abstract": "The intercalation of a molecule or ion in a layered structure is key to enhancing energy storage, material conductivity, intercalant structural ordering, and the formation of two-dimensional (2D) superconducting states. The process of intercalation modifies the vibrational energy of the host, which can be monitored non-invasively by Raman spectroscopy. However, the detected Raman spectral shifts may originate from a variety of phenomena, generally making the technique an indirect means of identifying intercalation success. Here, we discuss newly discovered low-frequency (LF) (<100 cm−1) Raman features due to the formation of unique 2D polar metals (Ag, Cu, Pb, Bi, Ga, In) or metal alloys (InxGa1−x) intercalated at an epitaxial graphene (EG)/silicon carbide (SiC) interface and demonstrate that 2D-Ag and 2D-Ga can have spatially distinct phases with their own unique Raman responses. Additionally, we establish that the 2D-Ga exhibits a structural evolution as a function of temperature, independent of the SiC and EG, that can lead to nucleation of secondary phases. The newly identified LF Raman responses discussed here lay the foundation for rapid, direct, and spatially resolved evaluation of 2D polar metals in ambient.",

This 2 × 2 reconstructed germanene phase matching an Al(111)3 × 3 supercell has been prepared in large areas upon annealing at 430 °C. Detailed studies have been carried out using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy electron diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy, and synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy. First-principles calculations based on the density function theory along with atomic-scale STM images reveal the atomic structure with one protruding Ge atom per 2 × 2 germanene supercell and a characteristic dispersing band originating from the germanene sheet slightly coupled to the first layer Al atoms underneath. Instead, upon annealing at lower temperatures, multi-phase regions comprise twisted germanene domains in correspondence with an Al(111)√7×√7 R ± 19.1° superstructure as obtained in previous studies.",

Recent advances have demonstrated the experimental self-assembly of GDYs on metal substrates. Here we focus on α- and β-GDYs on Au(111) and Pt(111), and investigate how their electronic and vibrational properties are affected by the interaction with a metal substrate. We adopt hydrogenated GDY, previously characterized experimentally, as a benchmark for density functional theory simulations, that we apply to show that Au and Pt substrates impose a different degree of distortion on both α- and β-GDY. By comparing the adsorbed and the freestanding structures, we evaluate the effect of the surface interaction on the bandstructure and the simulated Raman spectra. Different charge transfers result in different energy shift of the Dirac cone in semi-metallic α-GDY and changes from semiconducting to metallic behavior for β-GDY. These changes in electronic properties are accompanied by characteristic frequency shifts and modifications of Raman active modes. Our results contribute in the understanding of the metal-interaction effects on GDYs and can open a route to the design of novel 2D materials with tailored properties.",

By disentangling low- and high-energy subspaces of the electronic dispersion, we are able to utilize state-of-the-art constrained random phase approximation calculations to reliably describe the non-local background screening from the high-energy s , p x , and p y electron states which we find to be independent of the bilayer stacking and thus of the twisting angle. The twist-dependent low-energy screening from p z states is subsequently added to obtain a full screening model. We use this modeling scheme to study plasmons in electron-doped twisted bilayer graphene supercells. We find that the finite system size yields discretized plasmonic levels, which are controlled by the system size, doping level, and twisting angle. This tunability together with atomic-like charge distributions of some of the excitations renders these plasmonic excitations remarkably similar to the electronic states in electronic quantum dots. To emphasize this analogy in the following we refer to these supercells as plasmonic quantum dots . Based on a careful comparison to pristine AB-stacked bilayer graphene plasmons, we show that two kinds of plasmonic excitations arise, which differ in their layer polarization. Depending on this layer polarization the resulting plasmonic quantum dot states are either significantly or barely dependent on the twisting angle. Due to their tunability and their coupling to light, these plasmonic quantum dots form a versatile and promising platform for tailored light-matter interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Boron dipyrromethene derivates (BODIPYs) are promising photosensitisers (PSs) for cancer treatment using photodynamic therapy (PDT). This study investigates the functionalisation of graphene oxide (GO) with a BODIPY derivate for glutathione (GSH) depletion and PDT. The functionalisation of GO with a 3,5-dichloro-8-(4-boronophenyl) BODIPY via a diol derivatisation with the phenyl boronic acid moiety at the meso position of the BODIPY core, allowed to preserve the intrinsic properties of GO. We demonstrated that both chlorine atoms were substituted by GSH in the presence of glutathione transferase (GST), inducing a relevant bathochromic shift in the absorption/emission features and thus generating the active PS. Ex vitro assessment using cell lysates containing cytoplasmatic GST revealed the intracellular catalytic mechanism for the nucleophilic substitution of the GO-BODIPY adduct with GSH. Confocal microscopy studies showed important differences in the cellular uptake of free BODIPY and GO-BODIPY and revealed the coexistence of GO-BODIPY, GO-BODIPY-GS, and GO-BODIPY-GS 2 species inside vesicles and in the cytoplasm of the cells after 24 h of incubation. In vitro biocompatibility and safety of GO and GO-BODIPY were evaluated in 2D and 3D models of prostate adenocarcinoma cells (PC-3), where no toxicity was observed up to 100 µ g ml −1 of GO/GO-BODIPY in all treated groups 24 h post-treatment (cell viability &gt; 90%). Only a slight decrease to 80% at 100 µ g ml −1 was observed after 48 h of incubation. We demonstrated the efficacy of a GO adduct containing an α -chlorine-substituted BODIPY for the simultaneous depletion of intracellular GSH and the photogeneration of reactive oxygen species using a halogen white light source (5.4 mW cm −2 ) with a maximum in the range of 500–800 nm, which significantly reduced cell viability (&lt;50%) after irradiation. Our study provides a new vision on how to apply BODIPY derivates and potentiate the toxicity of PDT in prostate and other types of cancer.",

Our novel approach is very general and can be easily extended to any commensurate graphene-based heterostructure. Here, we consider three cases: (i) twisted bilayer graphene, (ii) bilayer graphene where triaxial stress is applied to one layer and (iii) bilayer graphene where uniaxial stress is applied to one layer. We show that the resulting superstructures can be divided into distinct classes, depending on the twist angle or the magnitude of the induced strain. The different classes are distinguished from each other by the interlayer coupling mechanism, resulting in fundamentally different low-energy physics. For the cases of triaxial and uniaxial stress, the individual graphene layers tend to decouple and we find significant charge transfer between the layers. In addition, this piezoelectric effect can be tuned by applying a perpendicular electric field. Finally, we show how our approach can be generalized to multilayer systems.",

In this way, XAS/XMCD was performed at selected sample areas, revealing the thickness-resolved spectroscopic and magnetic properties of the flakes, such as the spin and orbital magnetic moments. The spin moment, in line with the saturation field, is decreasing with film thickness, revealing a single-domain and out-of-plane magnetization for the thinnest films. For CST, the electronic properties are governed by the strong covalent bond between the Cr 3 d ( e g ) and Te 5 p states, giving rise to a superexchange scenario. We observed a gradually increasing ratio of orbital to spin moment for thinner flakes, which could be due to a further increase of the covalent mixing.

This represents a first step towards the integration of TMD monolayers with III–V semiconductor nanostructures, which is essential to develop scalable nanophotonic platforms. The strain imposed by the nanomembrane lifts the degeneracy of the exciton states, leading to linearly polarised emission. The principal axis of the linear polarisation of the emission is strictly determined by the orientation of the nanomembranes. This result is fully consistent with the expected broken crystal symmetry resulting from the imposed uniaxial strain.",

It is found that lattice relaxation enhances electron–hole asymmetry, and leads to small reductions of the magic angle values with respect to analytical or continuum model calculations with fixed tunneling strengths that we quantify from few layers to bulk AT-graphite. The twist angle error tolerance near the magic angles obtained by maximizing the density of states of the nearly flat bands expand progressively from 0.05 ∘ for twisted bilayer graphene to up to 0.2 ∘ for AT-graphite, hence allowing a greater twist angle flexibility in multilayers. We further comment on the role of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields in modifying the electronic structure of the system and how the decoupling of t N G multilayers bands allows mapping onto those of periodic AT-graphite’s at different k z values.",

Herein, an anionic cobalt porphyrin (CoP) derivative is electrostatically interfaced with a positively charged modified molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), forming CoP/MoS 2 , which is accordingly employed as nonprecious photo/electrocatalyst for water oxidation reaction (WOR) and selective H 2 O 2 production. According to the results, CoP/MoS 2 shows remarkable bifunctional photo/electrocatalytic performance for WOR and 2e − pathway O 2 reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline electrolyte. Upon visible light irradiation, electrochemical measurements on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass electrode reveal an onset potential of 0.595 mV (ORR) and 1.575 mV (WOR) vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, being improved by approximately 80 mV, in both cases, compared to the dark conditions. Notably, the use of the FTO set-up not only enabled us to evaluate the photo/electrocatalytic activity of the CoP/MoS 2 nanoensemble but also mimics the practical conditions in photo/electrochemical devices. The outstanding bifunctional photo/electrocatalytic performance of CoP/MoS 2 is attributed to (a) the use of CoP as versatile single-atom molecular catalyst and photosensitizer (b) the strong ion-pair interactions between cationic modified MoS 2 and the anionic CoP derivative, which prevent aggregation, ensuring better accessibility of the reactants to cobalt active sites, and (c) the co-existence of 1T and 2H phase at modified MoS 2 , offering improved electrical conductivity and intrinsic electrocatalytic activity along with enhanced intraensemble electronic interactions upon illumination.

    "abstract": "Abstract Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) is a visible light-responsive photocatalytic material with important application prospects in many fields. However, the interaction between g-C 3 N 4 monolayers makes it easy to aggregate and precipitate in aqueous solutions, and it is necessary to prepare stable g-C 3 N 4 aqueous dispersions for their applications. Here we propose a facile, green, and low-cost method for the preparation of stable g-C 3 N 4 dispersions by ultrasonicating g-C 3 N 4 in lysozyme (LYZ) solution. The LYZ was adsorbed on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 through non-covalent interactions such as electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding and π-cation interaction to prevent the aggregation of g-C 3 N 4 nanolayers. The LYZ/g-C 3 N 4 could quickly re-form a uniform aqueous dispersion solution after freeze-drying, and exhibit good stability. Further, the results of photocatalytic sterilization showed that the assisted dispersion of LYZ enhanced the bactericidal activity of g-C 3 N 4 and exhibited promising application prospects in the field of biomedicine and water disinfection.",

These are hybrid quasi-particles inheriting properties of both the constituent photons and excitons. In this work, we investigate the so-far overlooked impact of dark excitons on the momentum-resolved absorption spectra of hBN-encapsulated WSe 2 and MoSe 2 monolayers in the strong-coupling regime. In particular, thanks to the efficient phonon-mediated scattering of polaritons into energetically lower dark exciton states, the absorption of the lower polariton branch in WSe 2 is much higher than in MoSe 2 . It shows unique step-like increases in the momentum-resolved profile indicating opening of specific scattering channels. We study how different externally accessible quantities, such as temperature or mirror reflectance, change the optical response of polaritons. Our study contributes to an improved microscopic understanding of exciton–polaritons and their interaction with phonons, potentially suggesting experiments that could determine the energy of dark exciton states via momentum-resolved polariton absorption.",

Similarly to the ‘ parent ’ WS 2 and WSe 2 MLs, we assign the WSSe MLs to the ML family with the dark ground exciton state. We find that, in addition to the neutral bright A exciton line, three observed emission lines are associated with negatively charged excitons. The application of in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields allows us to assign undeniably the bright and dark (spin- and momentum-forbidden) negative trions as well as the phonon replica of the dark spin-forbidden complex. Furthermore, the existence of the single photon emitters in the WSSe ML is also demonstrated, thus prompting the opportunity to enlarge the wavelength range for potential future quantum applications of S-TMDs.",

Herein the broadband optical anisotropy, one of the most fundamental physical characteristics of α -MoO 3 crystal, was systematically investigated using a combination of spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and reflectance difference spectroscopy (RDS). The centimeter-level high-quality α -MoO 3 crystal was grown by modified physical vapor deposition. The optical refractive indices along three crystalline axes were precisely determined by SE in the broad spectral range (400–1600 nm), and then the in-plane and out-plane birefringence was analyzed. Both the intrinsic and resonant cavity modulated optical anisotropy of α -MoO 3 was studied by polarization-resolved RDS, from which we find the physical origins of linear dichroism are dominated by electronical transitions along the c -axis. Furthermore, the external photonic cavity of SiO 2 enables enhanced sensitivity to view electronical transitions and a high modulation ratio of optical anisotropy reached 30, which provides new opportunities to tune optical anisotropy for polarized photonic devices. Our results can help understand the physical origin of the highly optical anisotropy of α -MoO 3 and establish an effective metrological tool to study other types of vdW crystals.",

The carrier screening effect plays a major role at low fields, and low and intermediate temperatures, where a combination of large occupancy of primary valleys and carrier–phonon interactions dominated by relatively low energy exchange processes results in an enhanced screening of intrinsic scattering. For electrons, degeneracy yields to transport in secondary valleys, which plays an important role in the decrease of the low field mobility at high concentrations and/or at room temperature. The high-field drift velocity is not much affected by carrier screening because of an increased carrier scattering with surface optical polar phonons, favouring larger phonon wavevector interactions with small dielectric function values.",

However, conventional photoconductive infrared detectors commonly suffer from slow response speed and narrow spectral response. Here, we demonstrate a high performance NIR photodetector based on plasmonic sub-stoichiometry molybdenum oxide (MoO 3−x ) nanostructures/graphene heterostructure. Empowered by surface plasmon resonance induced near-field enhancement in MoO 3− x and the subsequent hot-electron injection (HEI), a fast response time (rise time ∼6.7 μ s, decay time ∼12.5 μ s), high responsivity (3.3 A/W), low noise equivalent power (∼4.9 pW/Hz 1/2 ), as well as wide response range from visible light to NIR is obtained at room temperature. The weak carrier–phonon interaction in graphene prevents the relaxation of injected hot electrons and enables efficient electron extraction. The response speed is nearly four orders of magnitude improved compared with other graphene-based hybrid devices with similar device structures. Moreover, the interfacial HEI breaks the bandgap limits of molybdenum oxide and further extends the response spectrum of the device to conventional band (C-band) of optical communication. Our proposed device architecture offers new strategy for developing high-performance infrared photodetectors.",

In the case of two-dimensional (2D) materials, NMS overcomes limitations inherent to conventional optical methods, such as the complications associated with measurements at high magnetic fields and low temperatures. In this work, we develop a protocol for NMS of 2D materials that yields two orders of magnitude improved sensitivity compared to previous approaches, while being simpler to use. To this end, we use mechanical sample actuation, which simplifies the experiment and provides a reliable calibration for greater accuracy.

We unveil that the magnetic field-dependent spin accumulation is in agreement with hole spin dynamics at the longer timescales, indicating that the electron spins have faster relaxation rates. We propose a rate equation model that suggests that lifting the energy-degeneracy of the valleys induces an ultrafast spin-flip toward the stabilization of the valley with the higher valence band energy.

We demonstrate light atoms can now be located in complex 2D materials with picometer precision at doses 30 times lower than previously possible. Moreover we demonstrate this using WS 2 , in which the light atoms are practically invisible to conventional methods at low doses. The key advance is combining the concept of few tilt tomography with highly dose efficient ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy.

    "abstract": "Abstract Point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising candidates as single-photon emitters (SPEs) in nanophotonics and quantum information applications. The precise control of SPEs requires in-depth understanding of their optoelectronic properties. However, how the surrounding environment of host materials, including the number of layers, substrates, and strain, influences SPEs has not been fully understood. In this work, we study the dielectric screening effect due to the number of layers and substrates, and the strain effect on the optical properties of carbon dimer and nitrogen vacancy defects in hBN from first-principles many-body perturbation theory. We report that environmental screening causes a lowering of the quasiparticle gap and exciton binding energy, leading to nearly constant optical excitation energy and exciton radiative lifetime. We explain the results with an analytical model starting from the Bethe–Salpeter equation Hamiltonian with Wannier basis. We also show that optical properties of quantum defects are largely tunable by strain with highly anisotropic response, in good agreement with experimental measurements. Our work clarifies the effect of environmental screening and strain on optoelectronic properties of quantum defects in two-dimensional insulators, facilitating future applications of SPEs and spin qubits in low-dimensional systems.",

Here we directly grow Fe-doped MoS 2 (Fe:MoS 2 ) via chemical vapor deposition that displays pronounced hard ferromagnetic properties even in monolayer form. This approach with monolayer ferromagnets enables full utilization of the strain from the pillar stressor to form QE in WSe 2 deterministically. The Fe:MoS 2 /WSe 2 heterostructures display strong hysteretic magneto-response and high-purity chiral single photons with a circular polarization degree of 92 ± 1% (74% average) without external magnetic fields. Furthermore, the chiral single photons are robust against uncontrolled twist-angle and external stray-fields. This ability to manipulate quantum states and transform linear polarized photons into high-purity chiral photons on-chip enables nonreciprocal device integration in quantum photonics.",

H 2 O 2 was used as the oxygenator and the reduction product was H 2 O, which was environmentally friendly and inexpensive. Carboxyl, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups are formed naturally during the oxidation derivative process. The decreased size increases the specific surface area and provides the possibility for the abundant presence of functional groups.

Compared with natural horseradish peroxidase, the Michaelis constant for H 2 O 2 was ten-fold lower. A cascade catalytic reaction system of glucose oxidase with CDs/TiO x was constructed, and the generated H 2 O 2 could be further used to catalyze the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to NAD + .

By choices of the spacer thickness, versatile surface or interface exciton modes localized at designated layers can emerge out of the cross-dimensional bulk dispersion for a topological origin, which can be mapped to the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger soliton. Moreover, step-edges in spacers can be exploited for engineering lateral interfaces to enable interlayer communication of the topological interface exciton.

Despite this interest, a reliable way of fabricating topological Josephson junctions (JJs) utilizing topological superconductors has yet to be demonstrated. Controllable structural phase transition presents a unique approach to achieving topological JJs in atomically thin 2D topological superconductors. In this work, we report the pioneering demonstration of a structural phase transition from the superconducting to the semiconducting phase in the 2D topological superconductor 2M-WS 2 . We reveal that the metastable 2M phase of WS 2 remains stable in ambient conditions but transitions to the 2H phase when subjected to temperatures above 150 °C. We further locally induced the 2H phase within 2M-WS 2 nanolayers using laser irradiation. Notably, the 2H phase region exhibits a hexagonal shape, and scanning tunneling microscopy uncovers an atomically sharp crystal structural transition between the 2H and 2M phase regions. Moreover, the 2M to 2H phase transition can be induced at the nanometer scale by a 200 kV electron beam. The electrical transport measurements further confirmed the superconductivity of the pristine 2M-WS 2 and the semiconducting behavior of the laser-irradiated 2M-WS 2 . Our results establish a novel approach for controllable topological phase change in 2D topological superconductors, significantly impacting the development of atomically scaled planar topological JJs.",

Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to demonstrate a striking effect of negative electronic compressibility in semiconducting TMD MoS 2 on the charge transfer to and from a partial overlayer of monolayer semimetallic WTe 2 . By systematically monitoring the binding energy shifts in the valence bands of both WTe 2 and MoS 2 during surface transfer doping with donor (K) and acceptor (F4-TCNQ) species, we observe distinct behaviors: (1) for donor doping, increased MoS 2 valence band binding energy is accompanied by a counterintuitive reduction in the binding energy of WTe 2 valence bands and core levels; (2) for acceptor doping, the expected decrease in MoS 2 binding energies contrasts with an unexpected increase in those of WTe 2 . The observations imply a reversal of the expected charge transfer; donor (acceptor) deposition decreases (increases) the carrier density in the WTe 2 adlayer. The charge transfer reversal is a direct consequence of the negative electronic compressibility of the MoS 2 surface layer, for which addition (subtraction) of charge leads to attraction (repulsion) of further charge from neighbouring layers. These findings highlight the importance of many-body interactions for the electrons in transition metal dichalcogenides and underscore the potential for exploring strongly correlated quantum states in two-dimensional semiconductors.",

The basic processes can be divided into energy redistribution leasing to a thermal equilibrium of the electronic and the phononic system, and the recombination of the excited species. Furthermore, the displacive excitation of coherent phonons assigned to the A' 1 Raman mode has been demonstrated employing sufficiently short pump pulses. In this study, we shed light on the ultrafast dynamics of three different 1L-TMDCs using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. We reveal a cascade-like cooling of the excited electronic states, owing to their differing coupling strengths to high- versus low-energy phonons. In addition, the coherently excited lattice vibrations imprint a strong oscillatory contribution onto the signal. We extract a dominating, spectrally broad signature of the A' 1 mode, whose shape challenges existing models. On top of that, we identify a second frequency band matching the E' Raman peak in 1L-WS 2 . Finally, measurements at high pump fluences demonstrate a phonon bottleneck for the cooling cascade. Simultaneously, the dominant A' 1 mode softens, providing a new degree of tunability for these coherent lattice vibrations.

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the decomposition and phase evolution of the molybdenum precursor, MoO₃, during MoS₂ synthesis using H₂S as the sulfur source. Our approach introduces water vapor (H₂O) as a promoter, which plays a crucial role in enhancing the growth efficiency and crystallinity of MoS₂. Through systematic characterizations, including Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), we demonstrate that the introduction of water vapor significantly improves MoS₂ growth by suppressing excessive reduction of MoO₃ and forming volatile Mo₂(OH)₂ intermediates. This promotes large-area, high-crystallinity MoS₂ growth under milder conditions.

Despite many exciting applications for flexible electronics, strain engineering, and heterogeneous integration, an understanding of the fundamental synthesis mechanisms remains elusive. Here we offer a perspective on the synthesis mechanisms, focusing on the foundational assumption of graphene transparency. We identify challenges for quantifying the strength of the remote substrate potential that permeates through graphene, and propose Fourier and beating analysis as a bias-free method for decomposing the lattice potential contributions from the substrate, from graphene, and from surface reconstructions, each at different frequencies. We highlight the importance of graphene-induced reconstructions on epitaxial templating, drawing comparison to moiré epitaxy. We highlight the role of the remote potential in tuning surface diffusion and adatom kinetics on graphene, which are crucial for navigating the competition between remote epitaxy and defect-seeded mechanisms like pinhole epitaxy. In light of this weak remote potential, we re-evaluate the current state-of-the-art experimental evidence, highlighting why it remains challenging to experimentally validate a ``remote'' epitaxy mechanism that cannot be explained by alternatives, such as pinhole-seeded epitaxy or serial van der Waals epitaxy. We end with one experimental example that, to out knowledge, cannot be explained by competing mechanisms: a different long-range epitaxial relationship for GdPtSb films grown on graphene/sapphire, compared to direct epitaxy on sapphire. We suggest for future experiments that directly measure the remote potential and impact of tuneable growth kinetics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A comprehensive first-principles analysis of boron fullerenes and two-dimensional boron sheets is presented, unified by a coordination-based classification with direct experimental relevance. Analysis of over a dozen boron nanostructures, including the experimentally realized B$_{40}$ and B$_{80}$ cages and multiple borophenes, reveals systematic trends in stability, electronic structure, and magnetism as functions of local atomic coordination (4-, 5-, and 6-fold). A size-dependent energetic scaling relation captures the convergence of fullerene cohesive energies toward those of 2D boron sheets, with the fitted exponent distinguishing two structural families. Direct structural correspondences between finite cages and experimentally synthesized borophenes are identified: B$_{40}$ $\\leftrightarrow$ $\\chi_3$, B$_{65}$ $\\leftrightarrow$ $\\beta_{12}$, B$_{80}$ $\\leftrightarrow$ $\\alpha$, and B$_{92}$ $\\leftrightarrow$ $bt$. These links provide a predictive route for designing boron-based nanostructures with targeted properties. Predicted properties include large HOMO--LUMO gaps in B$_{65}$ (1.06~eV) and B$_{92}$ (2.16~eV) and a magnetic moment of B$_{65}$ of $3\\,\\mu_{\\mathrm B}$. By connecting zero- and two-dimensional boron architectures through a chemically meaningful coordination descriptor, the framework offers experimentally actionable guidance for the synthesis and design of boron nanomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Orbital magnetization typically plays a minor role in compounds where the magnetic properties are governed by transition metal elements. However, in some cases, the orbital magnetization may be fully unquenched, which can have dramatic consequences for magnetic anisotropy and various magnetic response properties. In the present work, we start by summarizing how unquenched orbital moments arise from particular combinations of crystal field splitting and orbital filling. We exemplify this for the cases of two-dimensional (2D) VI3 and FePS3, and show that Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling are crucial ingredients for predicting correct orbital moments from first principles calculations. We then search the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) for monolayers having tetrahedral or octahedral crystal field splitting of transition metal d-states and orbital occupancy that is expected to lead to large orbital moments. We identify 112 monolayers with octahedral crystal field splitting and 62 monolayers with tetrahedral crystal field splitting and for materials with partially-filled t2g bands, we verify that inclusion of Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling typically increases the magnitude of predicted orbital moments by an order of magnitude.",

The 2D-overlayer grows unstrained right after deposition of a monolayer.

In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy shows core level shifts that are consistently related to electron transfer from the n-GaN(0001) to the 2H-TaS 2 epitaxial layer as well as the formation of a high concentration of nitrogen vacancies close to the interface. Further, no chemical reaction at the interface between the substrate and the grown TaS 2 overlayer is deduced from XPS, which corroborates the possibility of integration of 2D 2H-TaS 2 with an important 3D semiconducting material like GaN.",

We systematically investigate interfacial stability, band alignment, and Schottky barrier characteristics.&amp;#xD;Two different interface models are compared: (i) α-type, representing ideal junctions with abrupt covalent bonding, and (ii) β-type, characterized by atomic mixing. The effects of chemical composition, hydrogenation, and interface morphology on structural features such as buckling height and electronic band alignment are analyzed. Our results reveal that α-type interfaces are consistently more favorable than their β-type counterparts, exhibiting superior thermodynamic stability and reduced structural perturbation. Among the different heterostructures, fully hydrogenated SiH/GeH interfaces display the lowest formation energy, indicating excellent interfacial compatibility, while pristine Si/Ge interfaces exhibit the strongest cohesive bonding per atom, underscoring their exceptional thermodynamic robustness. In general, partial hydrogenation significantly increases the buckling asymmetry and electrostatic potential steps, leading to enhancement of band offsets. A Type-I band alignment is observed for the fully hydrogenated GeH/SiH heterostructure, resulting in carrier localization and enhanced electron–hole overlap. In contrast, semimetal–semiconductor junctions such as Si/SiH and Ge/SiH exhibit Schottky behavior with tunable barrier heights of up to 1.5 eV, indicative of strong rectification and suppressed carrier injection. The ohmic, rectifying, and charge-confining behaviors of the various junctions are analyzed in relation to their interfacial band alignments and Schottky barrier heights. These findings highlight the critical role of interface engineering in controlling the electronic properties of 2D lateral heterostructures for next-generation nanoelectronic applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnets offer unprecedented opportunities to control magnetism at the atomic scale. Through charge carrier doping---realized by electrostatic gating, intercalation/adsorption, or interfacial charge transfer---one can efficiently tune exchange interactions and spin-orbit-induced effects in these systems. In this work, through a multi-scale theoretical framework combining density functional theory, spin Hamiltonian modeling, and Wannier-function analysis, we choose monolayer CrI 3 to unravel how carrier doping affects the isotropic as well as anisotropic exchange interactions in this prototypical vdW ferromagnet. The remarkable efficiency of hole doping in enhancing ferromagnetic exchange and magnetic anisotropy found in our study was explained through orbital-resolved analysis. Crucially, we demonstrated that unlike the undoped system -- where isotropic exchange interactions govern magnetic long-range order -- the hole-doped CrI 3 exhibits anisotropic terms comparable in magnitude to isotropic ones. In particular, the magnetic anisotropy energy increases from 0.65 meV in undoped to 4.43 meV in strongly hole-doped CrI 3 , with the second-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction increasing from 0.12 meV to 2.01 meV. Finally, we show that a high concentration of holes can increase the Curie temperature from 56 K all the way up to 228 K. This work advances our understanding of doping-controlled magnetism in semiconducting 2D materials, demonstrating how anisotropy engineering can stabilize high-temperature magnetic order.",

These compounds play a critical role as solvents for boron nitride crystal growth, especially for the high-pressure high-temperature process, which provides the most common source of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a cornerstone material in the 2D community. Despite their strategic importance, the understanding of their physico-chemical thermal behavior remains poorly understood. &amp;#xD;Here we investigate the thermal stability of Li3BN2 using in situ characterization techniques at multiple scales. Using complementary global and local-scale analyses, its structural, morphological, and energetic transformations are tracked. TGA/DSC analyses, combined with direct in situ observation of microstructural changes recorded by HT environmental electron microscopy and HT X-ray diffraction, provide essential insights on reactions occurring from moderate to high temperatures.&amp;#xD;They reveal the formation of a lithium intercalated hBN phase above 700 °C, followed by Li3BN2 melting at 863 °C and its progressive vaporization. Additionally, Li3BN2’s thermal expansion coefficients (in both a and c lattice directions) are reported for the first time. Its volumetric thermal expansion is estimated at 82 ± 1 10-6.K-1. Above 1200 °C crystallization of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) occurs, concomitant with a release of N2 and highly reactive lithium-based gaseous species.&amp;#xD;These findings provide fundamental insights into BN-based solvents and highlight their critical role in optimizing hBN synthesis routes for 2D material applications.",

Hexagonal tensegrity modules with different topologies and proportions were analysed using a continuum model of tensegrity with closed-form expressions for equivalent elastic properties. The results reveal the occurrence of extremal mechanical properties, particularly in the rotated configuration of the hexagonal module, enabling significant tailoring of stiffness and deformation behaviour. Based on these findings, several lattice configurations with uniform and graded properties were designed and produced in a medium scale using MultiJet Printing (MJP) technology, taking advantage of its precision and ease of post-processing. Mechanical testing of additively manufactured samples under both uniformly distributed and concentrated compression loads demonstrated that gradation of the module geometry and layer arrangement allows control over stiffness, load-bearing capacity, and the extent of mechanically stable regions. The study establishes a computational-experimental framework for the preliminary evaluation of 2D graded tensegrity-inspired lattices and highlights the potential of additive manufacturing to realise programmable mechanical metamaterials. The results in the scale considered are promising and motivate further research into the static and dynamic properties of such systems for advanced engineering applications.",

Here, we report a breakthrough in lateral heterostructure based on the monolayer square transition-metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M = W, X = S/Se) modules. Our results reveal that the MX2 lateral heterostructure (1S-MX2 LHS) can possess excellent thermal and dynamical stability. Remarkably, the highly desired two-dimensional topological crystalline insulator phase is confirmed by the calculated mirror Chern number . A nontrivial band gap of 65 meV is obtained with SOC, indicating the potential for room-temperature observation and applications. The topologically protected edge states emerge at the edges of two different nanoribbons between the bulk band gap, which is consistent with the mirror Chern number. In addition, a strain-induced topological phase transition in 1S-MX2 LHS is also revealed, endowing the potential utilities in electronics and spintronics. Our predictions not only introduce new member and vitality into the studies of lateral heterostructures, but also highlight the promise of lateral heterostructure as appealing topological crystalline insulator platforms with excellent stability for future devices.",

Also, we found that the inserted 2D materials could modulate the work function of the metal and mitigate the Fermi level pinning, leading to reduced barrier height and, hence, reduced contact resistance of the metal–semiconductor junction. With the insertion of MoS2 and WS2 materials a two-layer thick, we achieved 160 meV reductions in the Schottky barrier height and increased the current density by 14 times for titanium contact to the n-type silicon.

    "abstract": "We present a method to tune the photoluminescence (PL) and exciton dynamics in a family of 2D heterostructures by controllably disrupting the interlayer coupling. Growing 1–3 layers of Bi2Se3 on arbitrary monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including alloys, quenches the TMDs signature PL. Applying controlled doses of energy in air modulates the PL upward in small increments, while thermal annealing in Ar or N2 reverses those changes. This PL-tuning can even be accomplished locally using a low-power laser, allowing complex patterns with submicron features to written. We demonstrate this over a wide-range of emission energy values in the visible (1.5 eV < Eph < 2 eV), suggesting this family of 2D materials is well-suited for applications requiring 'write-read-erase-reuse' capability.",

    "abstract": "Experimentally produced graphene sheets exhibit a wide range of mobility values. Both extrinsic charged impurities and intrinsic ripples (corrugations) have been suggested to induce long-range disorder in graphene and could be a candidate for the dominant source of disorder. Here, using large-scale molecular dynamics and quantum transport simulations, we find that the hopping disorder and the gauge and scalar potentials induced by the ripples are short-ranged, in strong contrast with predictions by continuous models, and the transport fingerprints of the ripple disorder are very different from those of charged impurities. We conclude that charged impurities are the dominant source of disorder in most graphene samples, whereas scattering by ripples is mainly relevant in the high carrier density limit of ultraclean graphene samples (with a charged impurity concentration less than about 10 ppm) at room and higher temperatures. Our finding is valuable to theoretical modelling of transport properties of not only graphene, but also other two-dimensional materials, as the thermal ripples are universal.",

Using this analytical method, the changes in the structural properties of two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) materials according to the synthetic method used were studied. In addition to the monolayer form of a 2D MoS2 material (MoS2 monolayer), multilayered 2D MoS2 materials and MoS2 monolayers doped with the widely used p-type dopants, gold chloride (AuCl3) and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide (TFSI), were prepared by a controlled synthetic process. Through comparative analysis of the SPEM data with those obtained by other techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, auger electron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy, the variation in the chemical/electronic structures of MoS2 2D materials depending on the synthetic process was clarified. From SPEM data acquired from locations where AuCl3 or TFSI dopant molecules were present, all the MoS2 chemical states were confirmed to have relatively lower binding energies than those of an as-grown MoS2 monolayer. These differences are related to the effects of p-type doping on the MoS2 2D material. Separately, the increase in the MoS2 layer number is manifested in the form of brightness difference in the SPEM data. Meanwhile, all the binding energies of the MoS2 chemical states including the onset of the valence band maximum are slightly lower in the bright regions than in the dark regions, and these binding energy differences are presumably due to the change in the bandgap change based on the MoS2 layer number.",

On the other hand, graphene exhibits high desorption/ionization efficiency, good conductivity and optical transparency, specifications of a high-performance component for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) platforms. Besides, the chemical functionalization of graphene increases the adsorption capability of functional biomolecules (e.g. receptors), resulting in very stable interfaces. Taking advantage of the properties of graphene, we developed several modified chemical vapor deposited graphene (CVDG)-based glycan arrays on different substrates including ITO and bare glass, as a potential sensing platform for carbohydrate-lectin interactions, which are involved in a plethora of biological processes. The glycan arrays were fully characterized by MALDI-MS analysis and, in some cases, optical microscopy.",

Heating to ∼325 °C on a time scale of minutes produces a superlattice consistent with the formation of a charge density wave stabilized by nanometer-scale ordering of the copper intercalant. Unlike conventional purely electronic charge-density-wave states which form, reform, and disappear on picosecond scales as the temperature is changed, once it forms the observed structure in Cu–MoO3 is stable indefinitely over a very large temperature range (30 °C to the decomposition temperature of 450 °C). Nanosecond-scale heating to ∼380–400 °C produced a completely different structure, replacing the disordered as-fabricated Cu–MoO3 with a much more crystallographically ordered metastable state that, according to a precession electron diffraction reconstruction, resembles the original MoO3 lattice apart from an asymmetric distortion that appears to expand parts of the van der Waals gaps to accommodate the copper intercalant. Control experiments in Cu-free material exhibited neither transformation, thus it appears the copper is a necessary part of the phase dynamics. This work shows how the combination of high-density metal atom intercalation and heat treatment over a wide range of time scales can produce nanomaterials of high crystalline quality in unique structural states that cannot be accessed through other methods.",

We propose a model based on incorporating different thermal conductance characteristics of edge and inner interacting regions which predicts the observed logarithmic dependence on aspect ratio. We also study the effect of graphene edge roughness, temperature, and strain on out-of-plane thermal conductance and discuss the observed results based on local vibrational characteristics of atoms within interacting region, number of interacting phonons, and the degree to which they interact across the interaction zone.",

The 3D graphene hydrogels (GHs) obtained from GO by the hydrothermal self-assembly are directly annealed in molten sodium at 800 °C. As a result, the D band intensity in Raman spectroscopy is reduced significantly, while 2D band intensity is increased prominently, which is a typical characteristic of highly crystalline graphene. More importantly, the resulting Na-GFs-800 sample exhibits increased surface area and narrow mesopore size distribution (~3.6 nm). The excellent supercapacitive performance of Na-GFs-800 has been demonstrated in an organic symmetric system.

In the laterally diffusive regime, the finite-size correction to conductivity is always positive and goes inversely with the square of the lateral dimension W, which is different from the finite-size correction inversely with W from boundary modes.

Here, we demonstrate a method based on two complementary techniques widely available in transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) to map the layer count of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) films. The mass-thickness contrast in high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) mode allows for thickness determination in atomically clean regions with high spatial resolution (sub-nanometer), but is limited by surface contamination. To complement, another technique based on the boron K ionization edge in the electron energy loss spectroscopy spectrum (EELS) of h-BN is developed to quantify the layer count so that surface contamination does not cause an overestimate, albeit at a lower spatial resolution (nanometers). The two techniques agree remarkably well in atomically clean regions with discrepancies within ±1 layer. For the first time, the layer count uniformity on the scale of nanometers is quantified for a 2D material. The methodology is applicable to layer count mapping of other 2D layered materials, paving the way toward the synthesis of multilayer 2D materials with homogeneous layer count.",

Here we demonstrate the controlled assembly of two-dimensional (2D) colloidal liquid crystals under the influence of gravity and an external magnetic field. Due to the positive anisotropy of diamagnetic susceptibility (▵χ > 0), the colloidal nanoplates of monolayer zirconium phosphate could exhibit intriguing alignment with their normals parallel to the magnetic field, thus transforming the multi-domain nematic phase into a mono-domain superstructure. Interestingly, the quasi-equilibrium states of such 2D soft materials under the prolonged gravity-induced sedimentation were found to generate a rich pattern of interference color bands (referred to as rainbows in a vial) upon under the effect of an aligning magnetic field. The birefringence measurement of the resulting color bands suggested quadratically decreasing volume fraction with sample height. The osmotic pressure (П) as a function of nanoplate volume fraction (ϕ) is found to agree with the theoretical prediction of the equation of state of the nematic phase of hard nanoplates, with a positive deviation at higher volume fractions. To the best of our knowledge, such field-driven dynamic formation of rich interference color bands, imitating almost the full spectrum of Michel-Levy interference bands, which was a pure mathematical representation, is experimentally achieved for the first time in a single sample.",

We investigated this in a family of 2D heterostructures: 1–2 layers of Bi2Se3 grown on different monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), i.e. MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and an alloy MoSe2(1−x)S2x, which enabled us to compare the relative coupling strengths at junctions with not only similar and dissimilar 'nearest-layer' chalcogens, but also with 'next-nearest-layer' transition metals, as well as 'nearest-mixed-layer' chalcogens. We found that while higher e-beam current densities tend to 'disrupt', and lower values 'recrystallize' the crystal structure, TMD-specific intermediate-value-ranges can dynamically twist the layers with respect to each other. From their initial as-grown twist angle, as well as the ease with which they can be perturbed to twist in response to various electron beam current densities, we infer that Bi2Se3/MoSe2 layers have the strongest interlayer strength, followed by Bi2Se3/MoS2, Bi2Se3/WS2, and Bi2Se3/MoSe2(1−x)S2x. Finally, the recipe can be tuned to induce the Bi2Se3 to form nanoparticles that emit a broad photoluminescence and alter the 2D heterostructure's perceived color. Our results reveal that interlayer interactions play a substantial role even in heterostructures of chemically and crystallographically dissimilar 2D materials, where they are traditionally expected to be 'weak'.",

    "abstract": "We describe a detailed experimental investigation of the ultrafast nonlinear response of a voltage-controlled graphene-gold saturable absorber (VCG-gold-SA) by employing femtosecond pump probe spectroscopy. Visible and near-infrared continuum probe pulses covering the spectral range from 500 nm to 1600 nm were used. In the experiments, the saturation fluence, modulation depth, ultrafast relaxation times, and the saturable absorption bandwidth of the VCG-gold-SA were measured as a function of the applied bias. We observed both saturable absorption and multi-photon absorption regimes as the applied bias voltage was varied between 0 and 2 V. Measurements indicate that under bias voltages in the range of 0–2 V, it should be possible to adjust the insertion loss of the VCG-gold-SA and at the same time, maintain a sufficient amount of modulation depth as well as an attainable level of saturation fluence over an ultrabroad spectral bandwidth. In particular, at the bias voltage of 1 V, the VCG-gold-SA exhibited fast saturable absorber behavior with adjustable insertion loss from 630 nm to 1100 nm. These results clearly demonstrate that the VCG-gold-SA can operate as a versatile mode locker for femtosecond pulse generation from lasers operating in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths.",

Here, we investigated the mechanical properties of both bulk and single-layered black phosphorus (BP) during the lithium intercalation process by using the first-principles calculations. Our results show that the Young's modulus of bulk and single-layered phosphorus strongly depends on the lithium intercalation. The mechanical bearing capacities, such as critical strain and stress, are significantly reduced by several times after lithium intercalation in both bulk and single-layered BP, which may reduce the reliability of LIBs. Our findings suggest that this notable mechanical properties deterioration during lithium intercalation should be considered carefully in the mechanical design of LIBs, in order to keep the work reliable and safe in the charge-discharge process.",

To engineer such devices, understanding electronic transport and localization across electrostatically defined interfaces is of fundamental importance. Little is known, however, about how the interplay between the band structure originating from the moir\\'e lattice and electric potential gradients affects electronic confinement. Here, we electrostatically define a cavity across a twisted double bilayer graphene sample. We observe two kinds of Fabry-P\\'erot oscillations. The first, independent of charge polarity, stems from confinement of electrons between dispersive-band/flat-band interfaces. The second arises from junctions between regions tuned into different flat bands. When tuning the out-of-plane electric field across the device, we observe Coulomb blockade resonances in transport, an indication of strong electronic confinement. From the gate, magnetic field and source-drain voltage dependence of the resonances, we conclude that quantum dots form at the interfaces of the Fabry-P\\'erot cavity. Our results constitute a first step towards better understanding interfacial phenomena in single crystal moir\\'e devices.",

Here, we report the observation of optical second harmonic from tetraphenylethylene-graphdiyne (TPE-GDY), a fully conjugated fluorescent 2D material composed of sp and sp 2 hybridized carbon atoms based on the TPE unit. TPE-GDY is mixed with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to prepare TPE-GDY/PVP nanocomposite films, which further improves the stability of TPE-GDY.

    "abstract": "Abstract Graphdiyne (GDY), featured with unique sp 2 , sp-hybridized form and inherent inhomogeneous electron distribution, retains great expectation to be developed into highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the state-of-the-art GDY-based electrocatalysts still suffer from weak catalytic activity and sluggish reaction kinetics originating from the severe scarcity of in-plane active sites and insufficient electrical conductivity. Targeted at this bottleneck issue, electronic structure regulation, recognized as an extremely precise technical route, is promising to improve HER performances of carbon-based electrocatalysts. Herein, a facile controllable chemical etching strategy is well leveraged to introduce sp 2 -hybridized carbon–oxygen bonds (Csp 2 –O) into GDY for precise manipulation both of its electronic and spatial structures. Experimental results and theoretical calculations coherently manifest that Csp 2 –O introduction into GDY can not only induce its electronic structure upheaval to strengthen surface electron transport capability, but also trigger intensive carbon–oxygen p–p orbital hybridization to enhance the catalytic activity of acetylenic bond sites. As a result, the optimal GDY sample after etching delivers excellent HER performance with an overpotential of only 101 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 and a low Tafel slope of 54 mV dec −1 , which surpasses most of reported metal-free based electrocatalysts. This work provides a universal route for precise modulation of inherent electronic structure in GDY, and can be further extended to boost the overall performances of other carbon-based catalysts.",

The band topology originates from the band inversion between the $s-$like and $p-$like orbitals that are contributed completely by the Hg and Te atoms, so the quantized edge states are restricted within the honeycomb HgTe monolayer. Meanwhile, the strong interaction between HgTe and Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) ensures high stability of the atomic structure. Therefore, the TI states may be realized in HgTe/Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) at high temperature.",

The origins of the sulfur (S)-vacancy-controlled phase transition of the synthetic MoS2 films were supported by various transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies as well as density functional theory calculations. Under high-vacuum conditions, transition to the metastable 1T/1T' phases was induced by weak electron irradiation during a TEM observation and explained by the detachment of molecules chemisorbed on the S-vacancy sites, and the subsequent electron-delocalization (charge-transfer) process. In addition, a spontaneous backward transition to a 2H phase could be triggered by exposing the sample to air, which induced electron localization by re-adsorption of ambient molecules on the S-vacancy sites.",

However, compared with the typical thickness of ~5-nm for Si-on-insulator (SOI), the advantage of the ultimate thickness limit of monolayer for the device performance has not been fully proved yet, especially for the on-state at the accumulation region. Here, we present much stronger quantum-mechanical effect at the accumulation region based on the C-V analysis for top-gate MoS2 FETs. The self-consistent calculation elucidated that the electrons are confined in the monolayer thickness, unlike in the triangle potential formed by the electric field for SOI, the gate-channel capacitance is ideally maximized to the gate insulator capacitance since the capacitive contribution of the channel can be neglected due to the negligible channel thickness. This quantum-mechanical effect agreed well with the experimental results. Therefore, monolayer 2D channels are suggested to be used to enhance the on-current as well as the gate modulation ability.",

The swelling phenomenon has been analyzed in terms of a modification of the Flory-Rhener theory. The newly-derived equations proposed herein, can accurately predict the dependence of dimensional swelling (diameter and thickness) on volume swelling, independent of the type of elastomer and solvent. The anisotropic swelling of the samples was also studied in combination with the evaluation of the tensile properties of the filled elastomers. A novel theory that enables the assessment of volume swelling for GNP-reinforced elastomers, based on the filler geometry and volume fraction has been developed.

Here, we report that the hepatoblast (HB) differentiation rate can be promoted by using Ca 2+ -rich coffee bean (CB)-derived GQDs, where the incorporated calcium ions activate the signaling of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)-protein kinase B (AKT). We also found that the human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived HBs from the CB-GQD treatment tend to upregulate the maturation into hepatocyte-like cells and downregulate the differentiation towards cholangiocytes, thereby successfully obtaining a large number of functional hepatocyte-like cells. Moreover, the activation of IGF1R from the CB-GQD treatment enhances the HB differentiation efficiency regardless of growth factors, implying that chelated calcium may play a key role in activating IGF1R. Our findings suggest that CB-GQDs with independent bioactivity can be widely used in place of IGF1 and represent a cost-effective growth factor as well as a potential differentiation factor.",

Three-dimensional hosts are widely used to accommodate lithium metal to solve the above problems.

Here, we used the reduced graphene oxide membrane (rGOM) assembled with small graphene oxide sheets as the host and obtained a compact, ultrathin (&lt;20 μ m) and free-standing lithium metal-rGO composite anode with good flexibility and high volumetric capacity. The overlap sites derived from the stacking of small size of GO act as abundant diffusion channels for the gas release during the spark reduction process, producing narrow interlamellar space in the rGOM and thus enhancing the capillary molten Li infusion to form a compact composite anode. These sites also guide the uniform deposition of Li metal on the surface and interior of the membrane, effectively suppressing the dendrite growth. This compact composite anode delivers a high volumetric capacity (1223 mAh cm −3 ) and stable cycling performance in the symmetrical cells and the full cells coupled with high mass loading LiFePO 4 cathode under a low N/P ratio.",

To overcome these problems, a SiO x @ reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film with porous structure is prepared through vacuum filtration and self-propagation reduction method, which can be directly used as a free-standing anode for LIBs. The self-propagation process of graphene oxide to graphene can be completed rapidly within 1 s, and endows the film with developed pores due to the instantaneous release of substantial gases. The porous structure is beneficial for exposing massive active sites, facilitating fast ion transport and buffering the volume change of the SiO x during charge/discharge. Moreover, the rGO sheets construct a conductive framework for rapid electron transfer in the film. As a result, the SiO x @rGO film exhibits high lithium storage capacity (1189.7 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 ), excellent cycling stability (81.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles) and good rate capability (349.2 mAh g −1 at 3.2 A g −1 ). This study not only provides a high-performance film anode material for LIBs, but also develops a simple and efficient method for constructing porous film electrodes for various energy storage devices.",

However, the lateral arrangement of V 2 CT x lamellae tends to cause the accumulation and collapse of the structure. Herein, the two-dimensional layered V 2 CT x is modified with Ag + and Cu 2+ , the V 2 CT x /Ag/Cu composite is successfully prepared. The Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Cu NPs grown between the layers of V 2 CT x can effectively suppress the accumulation of the lamellae and ensure the smooth transfer of electrolyte ions and electrons between the layers. Meanwhile, the doping of Ag NPs and Cu NPs can enlarge the interlayer spacing of V 2 CT x , which can expose more active contact sites for electrolyte ions, shorten the diffusion path of electrolyte ions, and effectively improve the electrochemical performance of V 2 CT x . The Ag NPs and Cu NPs agglomerate in the delamination of V 2 CT x to form a conductive channel covering multiple layers, which facilitates cross-layer electron transfer and reduces the internal resistance of the V 2 CT x /Ag/Cu composite. Basis on the above reasonable structural designs, the internal resistance of the V 2 CT x /Ag/Cu composite is only 0.72 Ω, showing excellent diffusion ability of K + . The result represents a new step forward in exploring the electrochemical properties of two dimensional materials of V 2 CT x .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Graphene and many 2D carbon allotropes are good support materials for single-atom catalysts (SACs) and have been successfully applied to many catalytic reactions. Herein, based on the egg tray graphene (ETG), a carbon allotrope constructed in our previous report, we designed ETG and three N-doped ETG supported Pd SACs, Pd@ETG-N x ( x = 0–3), for dehydrogenation of formic acid (HCOOH) by density functional theory. Our calculations show that ETG is easier for N doping than graphene, and Pd single atom can be stably adsorbed on the ETG with different N doping concentrations. Major pathways of formic acid dehydrogenation and dehydration were identified. We found that HCOOH dehydrogenation proceeds along the COOH-mediated pathway on each catalyst. With the increased N content in the substrate, the activity and H 2 selectivity of Pd SACs are greatly improved. Especially, among these four SACs, Pd@ETG-N 3 shows the best catalytic performance, which is even better than Pd(111). Furthermore, electronic analysis was made to reveal the metal-support interactions and the origin of the activity trend of Pd@ETG-N x . Our study reveals the unique potential of carbon allotropes in catalyst design, and provides theoretical insights for rational design of efficient catalysts by adjusting the support and the coordination environment.",

The height of the universal interband background conductivity is unaltered, but its onset is changed. However, the non-relativistic term leads directly to particle-hole asymmetry. It also splits the interband magneto-optical lines into doublets. Here, we find that, while the shape of the semiclassical cyclotron resonance line is unaltered, the cyclotron frequency and its optical spectral weight are changed. There are significant differences in both of these quantities for a fixed value of chemical potential or fixed doping away from charge neutrality depending on whether the Fermi energy lies in the valence or conduction band.",

The analysis of bonding, integrated-crystal orbital Hamilton population, and Bader charge uncovers the NRR activity origin of the TM 3 (HAT) 2 monolayers and elucidates the structure–performance correlations. Meanwhile, our results show that a simple descriptor ϕ based on the inherent nature of the TM atoms can be applied to accelerate the screening of candidates without explicit DFT calculations.

In addition, our simulations based on a multilayer relaxation technique reveal uniaxial lattice strains at the edge of PdTe 2 domains, and anisotropic strain distributions throughout the moiré supercell with a net change in lattice strain up to ∼2.9%. Our density functional theory calculations show that this strain effect leads to a narrowing of the band gap at Γ point near the Fermi level. Under a strain of ∼2.8%, the band gap at Γ closes completely. Further increasing the lattice strain makes the band gap reopen and the order of conduction band and valence bands inverted in energy.

    "abstract": "Abstract Identifying environmentally inert, ferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) materials with high Curie temperatures ( T c ) down to the single layer limit has been an obstacle to fundamental studies of 2D magnetism and application of 2D heterostructures to spin-polarized devices. To address this challenge, the growth, structure and magnetic properties of a 2D Cr-silicate single layer on Pt(111) was investigated experimentally and theoretically. The layer was grown by sequentially depositing SiO and Cr followed by annealing in O 2 . Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and low energy electron microscopy all indicated a well-ordered layer that uniformly covered the surface, with STM and LEED indicating that the silicate relaxed to its favored lattice constant. Further experimental characterizations demonstrated that the Cr was nominally 3+ but with a lower electron density than typical trivalent Cr compounds. Comparison with theory identified a Cr 2 Si 2 O 9 structure that resembles a single layer of a dehydrogenated dioctahedral silicate. Magnetic circular dichroism in x-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed a ferromagnetically ordered state up to at least 80 K. Theoretical analysis revealed that the Cr in a dehydrogenated Cr-silicate/Pt(111) is more oxidized than Cr in freestanding Cr 2 Si 2 O 9 H 4 layers. This greater oxidation was found to enhance ferromagnetic coupling and suggests that the magnetism may be tuned by doping. The 2D Cr-silicate is the first member of a broad series of possible layered first-row transition metal silicates with magnetic order; thus, this paper introduces a new platform for investigating 2D ferromagnetism and the development of magnetoelectronic and spintronic devices by stacking 2D atomic layers.",

Remarkably, the photon response pulse amplitude at the same wavelength is linearly related to the incident light power, showing a unique detection capability that is different from the conventional superconducting single-photon detectors. Our results suggest that the energy-sensitive characteristic arises from the Kondo effect observed in the two-dimensional electron gases of the interfacial superconductor, wherein incident photons alter the normal resistance.

    "abstract": "Abstract Synaptic devices with tunable weight hold great promise in enabling non-von Neumann architecture for energy efficient computing. However, conventional metal-insulator-metal based two-terminal memristors share the same physical channel for both programming and reading, therefore the programming power consumption is dependent on the synaptic resistance states and can be particularly high when the memristor is in the low resistance states. Three terminal synaptic transistors, on the other hand, allow synchronous programming and reading and have been shown to possess excellent reliability. Here we present a binary oxide based three-terminal MoS 2 synaptic device, in which the channel conductance can be modulated by interfacial charges generated at the oxide interface driven by Maxwell-Wagner instability. The binary oxide stack serves both as an interfacial charge host and gate dielectrics. Both excitatory and inhibitory behaviors are experimentally realized, and the presynaptic potential polarity can be effectively controlled by engineering the oxide stacking sequence, which is a unique feature compared with existing charge-trap based synaptic devices and provides a new tuning knob for controlling synaptic device characteristics. By adopting a three-terminal transistor structure, the programming channel and reading channel are physically separated and the programming power consumption can be kept constantly low (∼50 pW) across a wide dynamic range of 10 5 . This work demonstrates a complementary metal oxide semiconductor compatible approach to build power efficient synaptic devices for artificial intelligence applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The low crystal symmetry of rhenium disulphide (ReS 2 ) leads to the emergence of dichroic optical and optoelectronic response, absent in other layered transition metal dichalcogenides, which could be exploited for device applications requiring polarization resolution. To date, spectroscopy studies on the optical response of ReS 2 have relied almost exclusively in characterization techniques involving optical detection, such as photoluminescence, absorbance, or reflectance spectroscopy. However, to realize the full potential of this material, it is necessary to develop knowledge on its optoelectronic response with spectral resolution. In this work, we study the polarization-dependent photocurrent spectra of few-layer ReS 2 photodetectors, both in room conditions and at cryogenic temperature. Our spectral measurements reveal two main exciton lines at energies matching those reported for optical spectroscopy measurements, as well as their excited states. Moreover, we also observe an additional exciton-like spectral feature with a photoresponse intensity comparable to the two main exciton lines. We attribute this feature, not observed in earlier photoluminescence measurements, to a non-radiative exciton transition. The intensities of the three main exciton features, as well as their excited states, modulate with linear polarization of light, each one acquiring maximal strength at a different polarization angle. We have performed first-principles exciton calculations employing the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, which corroborate our experimental findings. Our results bring new perspectives for the development of ReS 2 -based nanodevices.",

The experimental observations are analyzed based on ab initio one-step theory of photoemission. Off-normal emission is studied in detail and its relation to the standing-wave character of the valence band states is discussed. Excellent agreement with the earlier experiment (Senkovskiy et al 2018 2D Mater. 5 035007) is obtained. Rapid variations of the intensity with the ribbon-transverse photoelectron momentum are predicted from the ab initio theory, which are at variance with the prediction of the tight-binding rigid-wall model. These findings can help interpret angle-resolved photoemission measurements of similar systems. Moreover, the strong enhancement of the photoyield could trigger the GNR application as narrow-band photodetectors and contribute to the design of novel photocathodes for vacuum ultraviolet photodetection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The true character of physical phenomena is thought to be reinforced as the system becomes disorder-free. In contrast, the two-dimensional (2D) superconductor is predicted to turn fragile and resistive away from the limit I → 0, B → 0, in the pinning-free regime. It is intriguing to note that the very vortices responsible for achieving superconductivity by pairing, condensation, and, thereby reducing the classical dissipation, render the state resistive driven by quantum fluctuations in the T → 0. While cleaner systems are being explored for technological improvements, the 2D superconductor turning resistive when influenced by weak electric and magnetic fields has profound consequences for quantum technologies. A metallic ground state in 2D is beyond the consensus of both Bosonic and Fermionic systems, and its origin and nature warrant a comprehensive theoretical understanding supplemented by in-depth experiments. A real-time observation of the influence of vortex dynamics on transport properties so far has been elusive. We explore the nature and fate of a low-viscous, clean, 2D superconducting state formed on an ionic-liquid gated few-layered MoS 2 sample. The vortex-core being dissipative, the elastic depinning, intervortex interaction, and the subsequent dynamics of the vortex-lattice leave transient signatures in the transport characteristics. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transient nature and the noise characteristics of the magnetoresistance confirm that quantum fluctuations are solely responsible for the Bose metal state and the fragility of the superconducting state.",

We find these technologically–appealing features to be combined with an exotic microscopic origin of magnetism in doped CdOHCl, a van der Waals material from which 2D layers may be exfoliated. By means of first principles simulations, we predict homogeneous hole–doping to give rise to p -band magnetism in both the bulk and monolayer phases and interpret our findings in terms of Stoner instability: as the Fermi level is tuned via hole–doping through singularities in the 2D-like density of states, ferromagnetism develops with large saturation magnetization of 1 µ B per hole, leading to a half-metallic behaviour for layer carrier densities of the order of 10 14 cm −2 . Furthermore, we put forward electrostatic doping as an additional handle to induce magnetism in monolayers and bilayers of CdOHCl. Upon application of critical electric fields perpendicular to atomically–thin-films (as low as 0.2 and 0.5 V Å −1 in the bilayer and monolayer case, respectively), we envisage the emergence of a magnetic half-metallic state. The different behaviour of monolayer vs bilayer systems, as well as an observed asymmetric response to positive and negative electric fields in bilayers, are interpreted in terms of intrinsic polarity of CdOHCl atomic stacks, a distinctive feature of the material. In perspective, given the experimentally accessible magnitude of critical fields in bilayer of CdOHCl, one can envisage p band magnetism to be exploited in miniaturized spintronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Based on the concept that microenvironment and physical stimuli regulate the cell behaviors like proliferation, migration, and differentiation, this study was conducted to investigate whether nanoscale spacing by stacked graphene film affect osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hADSCs). The graphene films were synthesized by a chemical vapor deposition method, followed by etching and rinsing process to fabricate single or 3-, 5-, and 7-multilayers. The height and width of wrinkles of the graphene were confirmed by SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM), ranging from 1.5 to 12.5 nm and from 30 to 100 nm, respectively. Osteogenic differentiation was significantly ( p &lt; 0.0001) promoted as the stacking layer increased. Immunofluorescent imaging and osteogenesis-related gene expression showed which increment was saturated from three layers. The calcium deposits and expression of osteogenesis-related genes ( Runt-related transcription factor 2 and Osteocalcin ) were highest in the three layers. In the hADSCs cultured on the three layers, the intensity of protein expression levels of filamentous actin (F-actin) was significantly increased ( p = 0.0319) and focal adhesion kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal related genes were concomitantly activated. These results demonstrated that multilayer-stacked graphene creating nanoscale spaces promotes calcium deposit and cytoskeletal integrity in hADSC-related, in vitro -osteogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Coulomb interactions play an essential role in atomically-thin materials. On one hand, they are strong and long-ranged in layered systems due to the lack of environmental screening. On the other hand, they can be efficiently tuned by means of surrounding dielectric materials. Thus all physical properties which decisively depend on the exact structure of the electronic interactions can be in principle efficiently controlled and manipulated from the outside via Coulomb engineering. Here, we show how this concept can be used to create fundamentally new plasmonic waveguides in metallic layered materials. We discuss in detail how dielectrically structured environments can be utilized to non-invasively confine plasmonic excitations in an otherwise homogeneous metallic 2D system by modification of its many-body interactions. We define optimal energy ranges for this mechanism and demonstrate plasmonic confinement within several nanometers. In contrast to conventional functionalization mechanisms, this scheme relies on a purely many-body concept and does not involve any direct modifications to the active material itself.",

Interestingly, we find that the emergent charge density wave has a topologically non-trivial electronic structure, leading to a coexistent quantum valley Hall insulating state.

We show the in-plane anisotropy of their bond-breaking reactions is governed by their structure and strongly material-dependent among four TMDs. The facet-resolved analysis directly revealed that the reactions proceed fastest (slowest) for chalcogen (metal)-terminated zigzag edges with armchair edges in the middle. The degree of the anisotropy inducing trigonal oxidation patterns was much higher in MoS2 and MoSe2 than WS2 and WSe2. Kinetic Wulff construction based on edge-specific reaction rates verified the material-dependent mesoscopic reaction patterns.

    "abstract": "The field of two-dimensional materials has been developing at an impressive pace, with atomically thin crystals of an increasing number of different compounds that have become available, together with techniques enabling their assembly into functional heterostructures. The strategy to detect these atomically thin crystals has however remained unchanged since the discovery of graphene. Such an absence of evolution is starting to pose problems because for many of the 2D materials of current interest the optical contrast provided by the commonly used detection procedure is insufficient to identify the presence of individual monolayers or to determine unambiguously the thickness of atomically thin multilayers. Here we explore an alternative detection strategy, in which the enhancement of optical contrast originates from the use of optically inhomogeneous substrates, leading to diffusively reflected light. Owing to its peculiar polarization properties and to its angular distribution, diffusively reflected light allows a strong contrast enhancement to be achieved through the implementation of suitable illumination-detection schemes. We validate this conclusion by carrying out a detailed quantitative analysis of optical contrast, which fully reproduces our experimental observations on over 60 WSe$_2$ mono-, bi-, and trilayers. We further validate the proposed strategy by extending our analysis to atomically thin phosphorene, InSe, and graphene crystals. Our conclusion is that the use of diffusively reflected light to detect and identify atomically thin layers is an interesting alternative to the common detection scheme based on Fabry-Perot interference, because it enables atomically thin layers to be detected on substrates others than the commonly used Si/SiO$_2$, and it may offer higher sensitivity depending on the specific 2D material considered.",

Under finite electric fields, non-adiabatic interband transition processes are expected to play significant roles in the associated Hall conduction. Here through an exemplified study on the valley Hall conduction in AB-stacked bilayer graphene, we show that the contribution arising from non-adiabatic transitions around the bands near the Fermi energy to the Hall current is not only quantitatively about an order-of-magnitude larger than the contribution due to adiabatic inter-manifold transition with the non-Abelian Berry curvatures. Due to the trigonal warping, the former also displays an anisotropic response to the orientation of the applied electric field that is qualitatively distinct from that of the latter. We further show that these anisotropic responses also reveal the essential differences between the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the non-Abelian Berry curvature matrix in terms of their contributions to the Hall currents. We provide a physically intuitive understanding of the origin of distinct anisotropic features from different Hall current contributions, in terms of band occupations and interband coherence. This then points to the generalization beyond the specific example of bilayer graphenes.",

It is well known that while a single layer is a trivial semiconductor, multiple layers (typically a minimum of ≈7) turn into a semi-metal with a nontrivial topological invariant featuring protected and decoupled surface states. We employ the finite-size Kubo formalism based on density functional theory calculations to show that the conductivity is amply dominated by the topological surface states even without bulk disorder. More importantly, the conductivity of the surface states does not show traces of a metal-insulator transition while the bulk ones can be driven towards an insulating phase in presence of only surface disorder. These results suggest that few-layered antimonene, despite not being insulating in the bulk, can present many of the advantages attributed to topological insulators under very general experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Area-selection reactions have been extensively investigated to control or change physicochemical properties of substances with micro- or nanoscale precision. Several polymeric materials called photoresists have been used to mask and pattern the specific region, which can block chemical reactions or deposition. However, they are not suitable for certain chemical reaction since they are vulnerable to high temperature. Here, we report the graphene mask to achieve area-selective chalcogenization, which is performed at high temperature by chemical vapor deposition method. Due to its physicochemical properties, graphene does not allow chalcogen precursor gases to penetrate into metal films. Several characterizations are performed to prove the successful sulfurization and selenization of molybdenum and tungsten films. As an application, WS 2 field-effect transistors with graphene mask are fabricated, and they show the typical characteristics of transistors successfully. Therefore, we expect that graphene-assisted area-selective reaction can be utilized for various fields such as semiconductors, sensors, and etc.",

Meanwhile, the influence of twisting angle ( θ ) and interlayer interaction strength on the electronic structures and the C q of the MD vdWH are systemically explored based on tight binding model. With the fitted hopping integral parameters, it is found that the linear dispersion of the graphene is basically preserved but the bandwidth is decreased with modulating twisting angle and interlayer interaction, and the C q of mixed dimensional vdWH is improved 5–19 times compared with graphene at zero bias. Moreover, the compressed strain could enhance the C q of mixed dimensional vdWH to 74.57 μ F cm −2 at zero bias and broaden the low working voltage window of mixed-dimensional vdWH with considerable C q . Our results provide suitable tight-binding model parameters and theoretical guidance for exploring the twisted MD vdWH of graphene/C 2 H and offer an effective strategy to modulate the electronic structures and the C q of graphene through constructing the MD vdWH.",

We performed density-functional-theory calculations to explore inducing ferroelectric-like distortions through incorporation of isovalent substitutional impurities that are larger than the host atoms. This disparity in bond lengths causes a buckling of the h-BN, either up or down, which amounts to a dipole with two equivalent energies and opposing orientations. We tested several impurities to explore the magnitude of the induced dipole and the switching energy barrier for dipole inversion. The effects of strain, dipole–dipole interactions, and vertical heterostructures with graphene are further explored. Our results suggest a highly-tunable system with ground state antiferroelectricity and metastable ferroelectricity.

However, the application of this strategy in van der Waals (vdW) piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics has been limited, largely due to challenges in achieving phase coexistence and enabling possible polarization rotation. In this study, we address this gap by synthesizing a Selenium doped vdW ferroelectric, CuInP 2 (S 1− x Se x ) 6 , with a doping range of 0 ⩽ x ⩽ 0.15, to create an MPB. Our findings indicate the presence of an MPB near x = 0.05, situated between monoclinic and trigonal phases. This boundary was confirmed using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope techniques. Remarkably, the composition at x = 0.05 shows a high dielectric constant ( ϵ r = 13.8) and an impressive local effective piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33eff = 51 pm V −1 ) at 80 K. Additionally, an unusual softening of the Young’s modulus was observed near MPB. These results are crucial for enhancing electromechanical coupling in vdW layered materials and herald new avenues for the design and optimization of piezoelectric and electromechanical properties in these materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Excitons in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides have strongly modified dispersion relations due to the formation of periodic moiré potentials. The strong coupling to a light field in an optical cavity leads to the appearance of moiré polaritons. In this paper, we derive a theoretical model for the linear absorption spectrum of the coupled moiré polariton–phonon system based on the time-convolutionless (TCL) approach. Results obtained by numerically solving the TCL equation are compared to those obtained in the Markovian limit and from a perturbative treatment of non-Markovian corrections. A key quantity for the interpretation of the findings is the generalized phonon spectral density. We discuss the phonon impact on the spectrum for realistic moiré exciton dispersions by varying twist angle and temperature. Key features introduced by the coupling to phonons are broadenings and energy shifts of the upper and lower polariton peak and the appearance of phonon sidebands between them. We analyze these features with respect to the role of Markovian and non-Markovian effects and find that they strongly depend on the twist angle. We can distinguish between the regimes of large, small, and intermediate twist angles. In the latter phonon effects are particularly pronounced due to dominating phonon transitions into regions which are characterized by van Hove singularities in the density of states.",

As demand for compact, multifunction, and high-efficiency Internet of Things applications continues to rise, novel configuration designs and manufacturing methods, such as neural network integration and 3D stacking have been implemented to enhance the CMOS image sensor’s (CIS) performance. However, the progress of image sensors based on silicon CMOS technology would eventually be limited by the intrinsic optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of silicon material. This has led to the exploration of two-dimensional materials (2DMs) and the emergence of 2DMs as promising candidates for the next generation of optoelectronic devices. In this article, we discuss the current advancements and challenges associated with silicon CISs and the potential benefits of incorporating 2DMs in the image sensor. We highlight three critical opportunities for 2DMs, including Si CMOS/2DMs hybrid structure and direct growth techniques of 2DMs on Si for back-end-of-line integration, 2DMs-based neuromorphic photodetectors (PDs) and optical neural networks for in-image-sensor-processing, and curved image sensor based on 2DMs PDs for bionic detection. With the growing maturity of 2DM technologies, we anticipate that the device scaling and the increase of integration density of 2DM electronics in the image sensor will continue, leading to the development of highly efficient, compact, intelligent, and versatile 2DM image sensors in the near future.",

It is also shown that the alignment of orbital moments with respect to the spin largely follows the predictions from Hund’s rule and that deviations may be explained by the d-band splitting originating from the crystal field—for example in the important case of CrI3. Finally, we show that for certain insulators, Hubbard corrections may lead to large and fully unquenched orbital moments that are pinned to the lattice rather than the spin and that these moments can lead to enormous magnetic anisotropies. Such unquenched ground states are only found from density functional theory calculations that include both Hubbard corrections and self-consistent spin-orbit coupling and largely invalidates the use of the magnetic force theorem for calculating magnetic anisotropies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract WSe 2 is a p-type 2D-semiconductor that can be mechanically exfoliated down to atomic layers. Unlike the Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, the two layers in a bilayer WSe 2 flake are weakly coupled. The electric displacement field can easily break the layer degeneracy of the bilayer WSe 2 . Together with the strong spin–orbit coupling, it exhibits many novel quantum physical properties. In this work, we fabricate high quality dual-gated bilayer WSe 2 devices and observe twofold degenerate Landau levels(LLs) and density-dependent quantum Hall states which show transitions between even and odd filling. When introducing carriers into the system from the valence band edge by gating, two WSe 2 layers are filled independently and the bottom layer WSe 2 shows negative compressibility at the crossover point. Above 9 T, we observe the degeneracy of LLs is completely broken and there are two sets of LL crossings in the top WSe 2 layer at Zeeman-to-cyclotron energy ratio <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi> <mml:mi>Z</mml:mi> </mml:msub> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi> <mml:mi>N</mml:mi> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ≈ 4 and <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi> <mml:mi>Z</mml:mi> </mml:msub> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi> <mml:mi>N</mml:mi> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ≈ 5.

To overcome this limitation, we break these symmetries in bilayer TMDCs using electrostatic gating and circularly polarized light as external means. For non-gated WSe 2 bilayers, circularly polarized light breaks TR symmetry, creating a finite Berry curvature signal in both conduction and valence bands, controllable by light intensity and its polarity. In gated WSe 2 bilayers, where inversion symmetry is also broken, we observe a sign reversal in Berry curvature within the conduction bands, the extent of which depends on the relative strengths of the electric gating and light intensity. Overall, under finite bias and light intensity, the 2H bilayers of WSe 2 exhibits finite spin Hall, valley Hall, and anomalous Hall conductivities, which depend on the strengths of the applied perturbations.",

Central to this domain, two-dimensional capillaries have risen as a pivotal research platform, marked by their angstrom-level precision, unparalleled wall surface smoothness, and clearly defined surface charge states. Their advent has profoundly deepened our understanding of mass transport dynamics, spanning gases, water molecules, and ions, shedding light on the complex interactions among various influencing factors and revealing a range of previously undiscovered physical phenomena. This review delves into the development of 2D capillaries, the principal fluid transport phenomena observed within, and the critical elements that affect these processes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Doped semiconductors are a central and crucial component of all integrated circuits. By using a combination of white light and a focused laser beam, and exploiting hexagonal boron nitride ( h BN) defect states, heterostructures of h BN/Graphene/ h BN are photodoped in-operando , reproducibly and reversibly. We demonstrate device geometries with spatially-defined doping type and magnitude. After each optical doping procedure, magnetotransport measurements including quantum Hall measurements are performed to characterize the device performance. In the unipolar (p + –p–p + and n–n + –n) configurations, we observe quantization of the longitudinal resistance, proving well-defined doped regions and interfaces that are further analyzed by Landauer–Buttiker modeling. Our unique measurements and modeling of these optically doped devices reveal a complete separation of the p- and n-Landau level edge states. The non-interaction of the edge states results in an observed ‘insulating’ state in devices with a bi-polar p–n–p configuration that is uncommon and has not been measured previously in graphene devices. This insulating state could be utilized in high-performance graphene electrical switches. These quantitative magnetotransport measurements confirm that these doping techniques can be applied to any two-dimensional materials encapsulated within h BN layers, enabling versatile, rewritable circuit elements for future computing and memory applications.",

Here, by time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (Tr-PEEM) measurements, we reveal the layer-dependent ultrafast electronic dynamics of monolayer (1 ML), bilayer (2 ML), 4 ML graphene as well as bulk graphite. In contrast to 2 ML and thicker graphene, photo-excited electrons in 1 ML graphene relax much faster, which is attributed to the unique massless linear Dirac cone dispersion, allowing electrons to relax by continuously emitting phonons. Moreover, transient photoelectron redistribution shows an energy shift between 1 ML and 2 ML graphene, highlighting the critical role of the bandgap in 2 ML graphene on the carrier relaxation dynamics. Our work demonstrates the power of Tr-PEEM in revealing the ultrafast dynamics of 2D materials and heterostructures with spatial-temporal information, and provides information for the layer-dependent ultrafast relaxation dynamics in few-layer graphene.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quantum devices, which rely on quantum mechanical effects for their operation, may offer advantages, such as reduced dimensions, increased speed, and energy efficiency, compared to conventional devices. However, quantum phenomena are typically observed only at cryogenic temperatures, which limits their practical applications. Two-dimensional materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures provide a promising platform for high-temperature quantum devices owing to their strong Coulomb interactions and/or spin–orbit coupling. In this review, we summarise recent research on emergent quantum phenomena in vdW heterostructures based on interlayer tunnelling and the coupling of charged particles and spins, including negative differential resistance, Josephson tunnelling, exciton condensation, and topological superconductivity. These are the underlying mechanisms of energy-efficient devices, including tunnel field-effect transistors, topological/superconducting transistors, and quantum computers. The natural homojunction within vdW layered materials offers clean interfaces and perfectly aligned structures for enhanced interlayer coupling. Twisted bilayers with small angles may also give rise to novel quantum effects. In addition, we highlight several proposed structures for achieving high-temperature Majorana zero modes, which are critical elements of topological quantum computing. This review is helpful for researchers working on interface engineering of vdW heterostructures towards energy-efficient quantum devices operating above liquid nitrogen temperature.",

Here, we examined the impact of graphene layers on the formation of oxygen vacancies in SrTiO 3 (STO) during high-temperature annealing. Our findings, supported by Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicate that increasing the number of graphene layers progressively leads to a reduced oxygen vacancy content in STO, demonstrating the efficacy of graphene in modulating oxygen vacancy formation in bulk STO. Additionally, using photoluminescence, we showed that graphene layers can tune the in-gap states induced by oxygen vacancies in STO. Our first principal calculations further revealed that graphene layers increase the energy barrier for the outward diffusion of oxygen atoms, thereby inhibiting the formation of oxygen vacancies in STO.

These emerging techniques have the potential to produce large-area defect-free films with controllable thicknesses.

Towards the controllable ionic transport in GO membranes, physical fields or external driving forces are induced to control the behavior of ionic migration in situ . However, the adjustable ionic transport regulated by temperature and osmotic pressure in GO materials is still absent. Herein, we report the anomalous temperature dependence of ion transport under osmotic pressure in GO membranes. The ions can diffuse spontaneously along the concentration gradient or the temperature gradient. Intriguingly, it is found that the reverse temperature difference can promote ion transport driven by osmotic pressure. Theoretical analysis reveals that the anomalous temperature dependence of ion transport stems from the thermal-diffusion-assisted ion concentration polarization (ICP). The high temperature in the low-concentration side largely enhances the ionic thermal diffusion and suppresses the ICP, which eventually strengthens the ion current along the concentration gradient. The finding can be developed into the temperature sensor for aqueous solutions and bring inspiration to the application involving ion transport under thermodynamic and osmotic driven forces.",

Here, we predict, based on first-principles calculations that an Eu-substituted rare-earth halide GdI 2 monolayer showcases ferromagnetism, ferroelasticity while being polar and a fully spin-polarized semi-metal at the same time. The ferroelasticity and polarity are shown to be coupled making it possible to switch the polar direction using external mechanical stress. Further, it is observed that an application of biaxial tensile strain of 5% causes the spin easy-axis to shift from out-of-plane to in-plane direction. Thus, spin easy axis gets coupled with the direction of polarization in the strained monolayer making the switching of magnetization also possible using external strain. Simultaneous coexistence and coupling of the ferroic orders in a metallic 2D material makes the Eu substituted GdI 2 monolayer an incredibly rare material for nano-electronics and spintronics applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Flat bands are known to produce highly correlated phases, leading to superconductivity and charge fractionalization. In two-dimensional systems, they have been extensively studied in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). However, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, MATBG remains a challenging system. Here, we present an alternative untwisted Moiré system to avoid such difficult twists. This system reproduces many of the interesting physical effects observed in Moiré systems, particularly flat bands and electron–electron pairing via a repulsive mechanism. The system consists of a graphene nanoribbon with periodic strain or corrugation, induced by a suitable substrate, such as a crenellated h-BN substrate. The strain is periodic with a single harmonic, but the key is to apply a spatial frequency slightly detuned from the condition that changes sign between neighboring sites. This produces a deformation that changes sign between neighbors in graphene while introducing a long-wavelength deformation visible only on each of the graphene’s bipartite lattices. This induces a spatially dependent effective mass, obtained using one harmonic. The system maps onto a Jackiw–Rebbi model, with flat-band modes identified as topological soliton modes. Electron–electron interactions are included in the system using the Hubbard Hamiltonian. The main result is the emergence of an effective attraction between electrons, accompanied by spin polarization coupled to the electron pseudospin. These observations align with the Kohn–Luttinger theory of superconductivity in other bipartite lattices, such as high-Tc cuprates. Since the Jackiw–Rebbi model exhibits charge fractionalization, similar phases are also expected to appear, as observed in MATBG.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The attractive properties of 2D materials and transition metal dichalcogenides hold great potential for their use in future, ultra-scaled electronic applications. Although growth processes are increasingly trending towards highly scalable, industry compatible procedures, a fast, reliable, and efficient characterization method for pristine samples is still missing. In this study, we propose the use of back-gated micro four-point probe (M4PP) as a qualitative characterization technique for the early screening of pristine samples. We develop a custom procedure to probe MoS 2 samples with different numbers of layers and grain orientations, showing the effects of probe landing and giving an interpretation of the electrical contact between the probe pins and the material. Using the M4PP data we employ a simple and effective parallel capacitor model to extract the charge carriers’ concentration ( n c ) and the field-effect mobility ( μ FE ). The model is then tested by comparing it with data obtained from back-gated field-effect transistors manufactured on the same material. The comparison provides a striking qualitative similarity, proving the usefulness of back-gated M4PP as characterization method for MoS 2 samples.",

The conception and development of graphene electroactive nanofluids (ENFs) reported here for the first time provides a novel way to 'form' graphene electrodes and demonstrates proof of concept for the use of these liquid electrodes for energy storage in novel flow cells.Astabilized dispersion of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in aqueous sulfuric acid solution was shown to have capacitive energy storage capabilities parallel to those of solid electrode supercapacitors (169 F g-1(rGO)) but working up to much faster rates (from 1mV s-1 to the highest scan rate of 10 V s-1) in nanofluids with 0.025, 0.1 and 0.4 wt% rGO, featuring viscosities very close to that of water, thus being perfectly suitable for scalable flow cells. Our results provide proof of concept for this technology and include preliminary flow cell performance of rGO nanofluids under static and continuous flow conditions. Graphene nanofluids effectively behave as true liquid electrodes with very fast capacitive storage mechanism and herald the application not only of graphenes but also other 2D materials like MoS2 in nanofluids for energy storage and beyond. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In such a system, the external ac-field is coupled to the relatively slow mechanical vibrations via plasmonic oscillations in the isolated graphene sheet. We show that the electrical field generates an effective pumping of the mechanical modes. It is demonstrated that in the case of underdamped plasma oscillation, a peculiar kind of geometrical resonance of the mechanical and plasma oscillations appear. The efficiency of pumping significantly increases when the wavenumber of the mechanical mode is in close agreement with the wavenumber of the plasma waves. The intensity of the pumping increases with the wavenumber of the mode. This phenomenon allows selective actuation of different mechanical modes, although the driving field is homogeneous.",

We observe strong emission from charged excitons with circular polarization opposite to that of the pump and demonstrate contrasting response to left and right circularly polarized excitation, associated with finite out-of-plane magnetization in the substrate.

The secondary resistance patterns around the secondary gaps move away from the primary one with increasing twist angle ( θ ) between graphene and BN and their detailed patterns also depend on the orientation of the 1D potential with respect to that of the superlattice. The 2D periodic potentials can further split the subbands between CNP and the secondary gaps, depending on the commensurability of the moiré superlattice and the 2D potentials, and additional resistance peaks appear as a function of the gate voltages.

However, the role of topological fluctuations in quantum transport through artificially-stacked junctions of 2D superconducting materials, and the resulting energy dissipation, remain elusive. In this research, unique phase-slip centers are designed in artificially-stacked junction areas, where nonequilibrium quasiparticles are formed and relaxed with energy dissipation. The phase slips are observed as voltage steps (peaks or valleys) in transport measurements across a junction between two exfoliated NbSe 2 flakes, and at a distance of 4 μ m from the junction using local and nonlocal chemical potential probes. Accordingly, two types of energy dissipation modes are newly identified in the artificially-stacked NbSe 2 when subjected to an in-plane magnetic field, which implies distinct vortex formation and current flow in the superconducting junction under magnetic fields.",

While Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations are predictably suppressed in the presence of the Hall field, a set of fresh magneto resistance oscillations emerge near the charge neutrality point as a function of dc current. Two branches of oscillations with linear dispersions are evident as we vary carrier density and dc current, the velocities of which closely resemble the transverse acoustic (TA) and longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon modes, suggestive of phonon-assisted intra-Landau level transitions between adjacent cyclotron orbits.

We study the influence of the local field enhancement in the vicinity of nanoantennas on the photoluminescence blinking. We observe a clear correlation between the blinking amplitudes and the plasmonic enhancement. For non-resonant metal nanostructures the blinking vanishes almost completely. Our results allow us to conclude that the blinking is an intrinsic feature of the emission from the graphene nanoribbons.

    "abstract": "Abstract Functional inks based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have potential application in building new and commercially viable photonic devices via different printing techniques. Printed photonics using 2D material-based inks brings together the unique optical properties of 2D materials via different printing techniques for fabricating photonic devices that can revolutionize various sectors in telecommunication, information technology, sensors and computing. Understanding the need for a comprehensive guide for researchers in the field of printed photonics based on 2D material inks, we have brought together the essential concepts in this field. The review begins with discussion on optical properties of commonly used 2D materials in photonic applications. Since different printing techniques demand different ink rheological properties for efficient printing, we have discussed it for different printing techniques. The substrates compatible for printed photonics application are also listed. Mechanisms of common printing methods in device fabrication are explained with more focus on the most commonly demonstrated method in printed photonics, i.e., inkjet printing. We have discussed a few examples of photonic devices where printed photonics is already demonstrated with 2D material functional inks. Finally, our perspective on future prospects of 2D materials, with excellent optical properties, that are yet to be formulated into inks for new and efficient photonic device fabrication as well as devices with potentially new functionalities are listed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Grain boundary (GB) roughness can affect electronic and mechanical properties of two-dimensional materials. This roughness depends crucially on the growth process by which the two-dimensional material is formed. To investigate the key mechanisms that govern the GB roughening, we have performed kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of a simple model that includes particle attachment, detachment, and diffusion. We have studied the closure of the gap between two flakes during growth, and the subsequent formation of the GB for a broad range of model parameters. The well-known near-equilibrium (attachment-limited) and unstable (diffusion-limited) growth regimes are identified, but we also observe a third regime when the precursor flux is sufficiently high to saturate the gap between the edges with diffusing species. This high deposition rate regime forms GBs with spatially uncorrelated roughness, which quickly relax to smoother configurations. Extrapolating the numerical results (with support from a theoretical approach) to edge lengths and gap widths of some micrometres, we confirm the advantage of this regime to produce GBs with minimal roughness faster than near-equilibrium conditions. This suggests an unexpected route towards efficient growth of two-dimensional materials with smooth GBs.",

    "abstract": "We theoretically investigate atomic frustrated states in diatomic molecules hosted by the bilayer graphene setup twisted by the first magic angle and with broken inversion symmetry in the Dirac cones of the system mini Brillouin zones. Such states show local spectral features typically from uncoupled atoms, but counterintuitively, they also exhibit nonlocal molecular correlations, which turn them into atomically frustrated. By considering a particle-hole symmetric molecule in the Moir\\'e superlattice length-scale, we reveal distinctly from the metallic Weyl counterparts, a molecular zero mode atomically frustrated at the spectral densities of the dimer's atoms. To this end, a strong metallic phase with a plateau in the density of states established by the broken inversion symmetry, together with pronounced blue and red shifts in the molecular levels, due to the magic angle condition, should occur synergistically with atomic Coulomb correlations. Consequently, an entire collapse of these molecular peaks into a single one atomically frustrated, taking place exactly at the Fermi energy, becomes feasible just by tuning properly opposite gate voltages attached to the graphene monolayers. Therefore, we propose that unusual molecular bindings can be engineered via the twistronics of the bilayer graphene system, in particular, if its metallic phase is fully established.",

Interestingly, a large group of CNDs are fluorescent in the visible spectrum and possess single dipole emitters with potential applications in super-resolution microscopy, quantum information science, and optoelectronics. There is a large diversity of CND's size as well as a strong variability of edge topology and functional groups in real samples. This hampers a direct comparison of experimental and theoretical findings that is necessary to understand the unusual photophysics of these systems. Here, we derive atomistic models of finite sized (<2.5 nm) CNDs from high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) which are studied using approximate time-dependent density functional theory. The atomistic models are found to be primarily two-dimensional (2D) and can hence be categorised as graphene quantum dots (GQD). The GQD model structures that are presented here show excitation energies in the visible spectrum matching previous single GQD level photoluminescence studies. We also present the effect of edge hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups on the absorption spectrum. Overall, the study reveals the atomistic origin of CNDs photoluminescence in the visible range.",

Herein we design a cross-linked framework of reduced graphene oxide anchored with Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles (Cu 2− x Se@rGO) by building an electrolyte/Cu 2− x Se/graphene triple-phase interface to be a high-efficiency electrocatalyst for Li–S batteries. Importantly, this three-dimensional conductive network possesses a large specific surface area with high ion transport capability, meanwhile providing strong physical constraint for efficient adsorption of soluble polysulfides. Further, this triple-phase catalytic interface provides strong chemical adsorption and abundant Cu 2− x Se nanoparticle sulfiphilic active sites, effectively inhibiting the dissolution of polysulfides and guaranteeing the efficient polysulfide adsorption catalysis as well as rapidly uniform Li 2 S nucleation. Consequently, with the Cu 2− x Se@rGO separator, a lower capacity decay rate about 0.059% per cycle after 500 cycles at 2 C is obtained. What’s more, with a higher areal sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm −2 , the capacity is still maintained at 805 mAh g −1 over 100 cycles. Therefore, this work will open new avenue to construct 2D transition metal selenide for superior performance Li–S batteries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although crystalline black phosphorus (c-BP) is attracting enormous interest in the past few years for a wide range of applications, studies on amorphous BP (a-BP) have been quite rare due to the difficulty in its controllable synthesis. The reason lies in that the elemental phosphorous precursor favors to form c-BP, which is the thermodynamically stable phase. Herein, we report a facile ethylenediamine intercalation-and- deintercalation strategy to realize gram-scale preparation of a-BP. The atomic disordering in a-BP can be handily tuned by controlling the reaction time. Interestingly, the a-BP demonstrates atomic disordering-dependent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The a-BP with higher atomic disordering delivers higher OER performance. Such enhanced OER activity is ascribed to more low-coordination sites and unpaired electrons which usually served as active sites, as verified by electrochemically active surface area measurement results and electron spin resonance. Density functional theory calculation further reveals the enhancement for OER activity is mainly attributed to boosting conversion from O* to OOH*. Our results not only create a controllable wet-chemical approach to scalable production of a-BP but provide insights into structure-property relationship and its underlying mechanisms.",

However, the effect of surface adsorbates and surface oxidation on the carrier density profile along the thickness of 2D multilayers is not well known, particularly for a substantial interruption in the formation of the top-surface channel. Here, we uncover a hidden surface channel in p-type black phosphorus and n-type rhenium disulfide multilayers originating from undesired ambient adsorbates and surface oxides that not only populate hole density (or reduce electron density) but also suppress carrier mobility. The absence of a second peak in the transconductance curve under ambient conditions indicates the disappearance of the top-surface channel inside the 2D multilayers, which is a possible indicator for the cleanliness of the top surface and can be used in gas sensor applications. Moreover, the negligible variation in the drain bias polarity-dependent turn-on voltage for the bottom channel under ambient conditions validates the exclusive contribution of surface adsorbates to the formation of the top channel in 2D multilayers. Our results provide a novel insight into the distinct carrier transport in 2D optoelectronic devices and diverse sensors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Like many 2D materials, numerous properties of MXene multilayers, and especially the most popular one Ti 3 C 2 T x , have been shown to significantly depend on their architecture, i.e. the number of layers and interlayer distance. These structural parameters are thus key elements to be characterized for the analysis of MXene properties. Focusing on valence electron energy-loss spectroscopy (VEELS) as performed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), and using density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we here analyze the layer dependent large changes in the VEEL spectra of Ti 3 C 2 T x multilayers as a probe of their total thickness, and emphasize the bulk plasmon energy sensitivity to interlayer distance. Together these findings allow to directly quantify the absolute number of layers in a Ti 3 C 2 T x stack up to ∼10 nm thickness and give access to interlayer distance modifications with sub-angström sensitivity, evidencing VEELS as a powerful method for the characterization of MXene multilayers on the nanometer scale. We expect these results to be relevant for the study of structure/properties correlations in this class of materials, especially with the development of in situ or environmental TEM experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The recent observation of room temperature spin-dependent photoluminescence (PL) emission from hexagonal boron nitride’s (h-BN’s) defect centers motivates for performing a complementary low-temperature photophysical study of quantum emitters under relatively high magnetic fields. Here, we investigate the PL emission dynamics of h-BN’s visible single-photon emitters under an applied out-of-plane magnetic field at cryogenic temperatures. The PL intensity of the emitters in our work strikingly exhibits strong magnetic field dependence and decreases with the increased magnetic field. A substantial decrease in the integrated PL intensity of the emitters by up to one order of magnitude was observed when the applied field is increased from 0 T to 7 T. The observed reversible photodarkening of PL emission due to the applied magnetic field is in very well agreement with the predictions of a recent joint experimental and theoretical study and can happen only if the spin-selective, non-radiative, and asymmetric intersystem crossing transitions proceed from the triplet excited state to the lowest-lying spin-singlet metastable state and from the metastable state to the triplet ground state. Our results not only shed more light on the light emission paths of defect centers in h-BN but also show the use of the magnetic field as an efficient control knob in the development of magneto-optical devices.",

However, formation and distribution of MTBs in hybrid TMDC materials such as heterojunction remain scarcely studied. Herein, we investigate the spatial distribution, lattice registry and formation mechanism of MTBs in molecular beam epitaxy grown monolayer WSe 2 –MoSe 2 lateral heterojunctions using atomic-resolution annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM). MTBs manifest a much higher density in MoSe 2 than in WSe 2 domains with a few of them spanning coherently across the domain interface. Compositionally, a Mo-dominant rather than W-dominant configuration was observed in those MTBs located in WSe 2 domains and its origin can be attributed to the preferable Mo substitution to W along the MTBs occurring at the later MoSe 2 growth period. This proposed mechanism is supported by ab-initio density functional theory calculations and substitution dynamics captured by in-situ ADF-STEM. The present study deepens our understanding of MTBs in heterostructured TMDCs, which may also serve as an excellent platform for the exploration of intriguing 1D physics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract MXene, an ultra-thin two-dimensional conductive material, has attracted considerable interest in various fields due to its exceptional material properties. In particular, Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene exhibits distinct optical properties, enabling it to support surface plasmons in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region. However, it is challenging to enhance the field confinement of MXene surface plasmons in a single-interface structure due to the substantial intrinsic absorption of Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene. Herein, we explore various multilayer structures capable of supporting high field confinement of Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene plasmons, including insulator–MXene–insulator (IMI), MXene–insulator–MXene (MIM), and insulator–MXene–insulator–MXene (IMIM) configurations. We observe that the field confinement of MXene plasmons improves as the thickness of either the MXene or insulator layers decreases, which is attributed to the strong coupling between plasmons at the multilayer interfaces. Furthermore, the IMIM structure demonstrates the most substantial enhancement in field confinement. In an IMIM structure with a 1.3 nm-thick MXene monolayer and a 1.0 nm thick SiO 2 layer, the wavelength and effective field size of the plasmon at a frequency of 150 THz ( λ 0 = 2.0 μ m) are calculated to be 24.61 nm and 1.50 nm, respectively. These values demonstrate a reduction by factors of 55 and 596, respectively, compared to those obtained in a single SiO 2 –MXene interface structure. Multilayer-based MXene plasmons provide a solution for enhancing the field confinement of MXene plasmons in the SWIR region, and we expect them to play a crucial role in a variety of 2D material-based SWIR plasmonic applications.",

Defects within these materials significantly impact their optoelectronic response to strain. In this study, we investigate the influence of strain on the electrical properties of monolayer MoS 2 , emphasizing the pivotal role played by intrinsic defects in shaping the material’s electrical and optoelectronic response under strain. We observed an enhancement in photocurrent and persistent photoconductivity at specific strains, indicating the activation of defects at these strain values, thus enhancing the photoresponse. Moreover, our device exhibits diodic behavior at specific strain values after prolonged measurements under a static field, suggesting a reduction in the migration energy of defects caused by the applied strain. This finding holds significant implications for memory, logic, and flexible devices. Additionally, we observe an increase in electron mobility under tensile strain, with our flexible field-effect transistor exhibiting higher mobility (∼38 cm 2 (V·s) −1 ) at 0.4% strain. Our study provides insight into the role of strain in the activation and migration of defects in monolayer MoS 2 and opens up new avenues for the development of multifunctional ultra-thin flexible devices and memory applications.",

We observe a significant polarization dependent PC response at the interface between metal electrode and MnBi 2 Te 4 , while the PC response remains polarization-independent at MnBi 2 Te 4 layer steps. The polarization dependent PC at the MnBi 2 Te 4 -metal electrode interface, which is attributed to the polarization dependent light absorption at the interface, preserves in the whole tested wavelength range. The responsivity of the device is 80 μ A W −1 . This responsivity as well as PC polarity is consistent with the results calculated based on a photo-thermoelectric generation mechanism, thus we infer that photo-thermoelectric effect dominates in the PC generation at MnBi 2 Te 4 -metal interface.

To physically and compactly cover both cases, a quasi-Fermi-level phase space (QFLPS) approach was proposed, but it still involves complicated integration operations. This article aims at improving the numerical efficiency of the QFLPS model by several orders of magnitude so that it can readily be implemented in a standard circuit simulator. We first rigorously derive the integral-free formula for the drain-source current to achieve this goal. Besides computationally benign, it explicitly gives the correlation terms between the electron and hole components. Secondly, to work out the boundary values required by the new expressions, we develop an algorithm for the channel electrostatic potential based on the zero-temperature limit property of the 2DM-FET system. By calibrating the model with the realistic device data of black phosphorus and monolayer molybdenum disulfide FETs, the algorithm is tested against practical cases. Two orders of magnitude improvement in time consumption can be achieved compared with the integral-form QFLPS approach, and it is even four orders of magnitude faster than the traditional continuity-equation based approach.",

We find that its electronic structure involves an atomic obstructed insulator related to higher-order topology, which is a consequence of the selenium-selenium bond dimerization along with inversion and time-reversal symmetry). By means of first-principles calculations and the analysis of symmetry indicators and topological invariants, we also characterize the electronic corner states associated with the atomic obstruction and compute the corresponding corner charge for a finite geometry, which is found to be not quantized but still inversion-protected. Applying tensile strain to the finite geometry we verify the robustness of the corner states and also achieve a strain-controlled variation of the corner charge magnitude.",

This discovery brought under the spotlight the interlayer Cr–Cr exchange interaction, which despite being much weaker than the intralayer exchange, plays an important role in shaping the magnetic properties of bilayer CrI 3 . In this work we delve into the anisotropic part of the interlayer exchange with the aim to separate the contributions from the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DMI) and the Kitaev interactions (KI). We leverage the density functional theory calculations with spin Hamiltonian modeling and develop an energy mapping procedure to assess these anisotropic interactions with <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mi>μ</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mml:mi> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">V</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> accuracy. After inspecting the rhombohedral and monoclinic stacking sequences of bilayer CrI 3 , we reveal a considerable DMI and a weak interlayer KI between the sublattices of a monoclinic bilayer. We explain the dependence of DMI and KI on the interlayer distance, stacking sequence, and the spin–orbit coupling strength, and we suggest the dominant superexchange processes at play. In addition, we demonstrate that the single-ion anisotropy in bilayer CrI 3 is highly stacking-dependent, increasing by 50% from monoclinic to rhombohedral bilayer. Remarkably, our findings prove that iodines are highly efficient in mediating the DMI across the van der Waals gap, much owing to spatially extended 5 p orbitals which feature strong spin–orbit coupling. Our study gives promise that the interlayer chiral control of spin textures, demonstrated in thin metallic films where the DMI is with a much longer range, can be achieved with similar efficiency in semiconducting two-dimensional van der Waals magnets.",

However, reactivity of FLBP flakes with ambient species limits its direct applications. Among various methods to passivate FLBP in ambient environment, nanocomposites mixing FLBP flakes with stable matrix may be one of the most promising approaches for industry applications. Here, we report a simple one-step procedure to mass produce air-stable FLBP/phospholipids nanocomposite in liquid phase. The resultant nanocomposite is found to have ultralow tunneling barrier for charge carriers which can be described by an Efros–Shklovskii variable range hopping mechanism. Devices made from such mass-produced FLBP/phospholipids nanocomposite show highly stable electrical conductivity and opto-electrical response in ambient conditions, indicating its promising applications in both electronic and optoelectronic applications. This method could also be generalized to the mass production of nanocomposites consisting of other air-sensitive 2D materials, such as FeSe, NbSe2, WTe2, etc.",

STM images of polydomain hBN monolayers, grown via dissociative chemisorption of borazine on Pd(1 1 1)/Al2O3(0 0 0 1) thin films, are acquired as a function of tunneling current and bias. The images reveal moiré patterns with four periodicities λ = 0.6 ± 0.05 nm, 1.8 ± 0.14 nm, 2.7 ± 0.20 nm, and 2.8 ± 0.14 nm, corresponding to different orientations on Pd(1 1 1). We find that the apparent surface corrugation Δz in STM changes little with tunneling current, exhibits an oscillatory dependence on the bias voltage, and increases from Δz ≈ 14 pm for domains with λ = 0.6 nm to Δz ≈ 200 pm for λ = 2.8 nm. We attribute the observed tunneling-parameter dependence in Δz to the electronic structure of the hBN/Pd(1 1 1) system. Unlike any other monolayer hBN-on-metal system, we suggest that hBN/Pd can have either mainly geometric or mainly electronic corrugation, depending on the domain orientation. Furthermore, for the largest periodicities, we observe a bifurcation behavior in which some domains are nearly flat, and others develop significant hill-and-valley geometric corrugations. We expect a similar behavior for other substrates for which the interaction energy with hBN is intermediate, i.e. neither mostly chemical nor van der Waals binding: for these substrates, a similar approach can help identify interlayer interactions and electronic structure modifications.",

    "abstract": "Ripples and impurity atoms are universally present in 2D materials, limiting carrier mobility, creating pseudo–magnetic fields, or affecting the electronic and magnetic properties. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) generally provides picometer-level precision in the determination of the location of atoms or atomic 'columns' in the in-image plane (xy plane). However, precise atomic positions in the z-direction as well as the presence of certain impurities are difficult to detect. Furthermore, images containing moiré patterns such as those in angle-mismatched bilayer graphene compound the problem by limiting the determination of atomic positions in the xy plane. Here, we introduce a reconstructive approach for the analysis of STEM images of twisted bilayers that combines the accessible xy coordinates of atomic positions in a STEM image with density-functional-theory calculations. The approach allows us to determine all three coordinates of all atomic positions in the bilayer and establishes the presence and identity of impurities. The deduced strain-induced rippling in a twisted bilayer graphene sample is consistent with the continuum model of elasticity. We also find that the moiré pattern induces undulations in the z direction that are approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the strain-induced rippling. A single substitutional impurity, identified as nitrogen, is detected. The present reconstructive approach can, therefore, distinguish between moiré and strain-induced effects and allows for the full reconstruction of 3D positions and atomic identities.",

    "abstract": "Graphene is known effective as a short-term solution to protecting metals from oxidation. Past studies have shown that more layers and fewer defects (e.g. grain boundaries) enhance the antioxidation ability of graphene. However, it has remained unanswered which of these two parameters, namely, number of graphene layers and crystallinity of graphene, is more important when it comes to protecting metals. Herein, we aim to study this subject by comparing the oxidation behaviors of Cu covered by two different types of graphene. One is multilayered but contains a high density of grain boundaries, while the other is free of grain boundaries but comes with only one layer. Through oxidizing experiments in air and water-rich vapor conditions, failure mechanisms of graphene and change of underlying Cu (and Cu oxides) are thoroughly investigated using a wide range of analytical tools, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that the single-crystalline, monolayer graphene is more effective than the counterpart in polycrystalline, multilayer format for protecting Cu against oxidation in both air and water-rich vapor conditions. Especially in air oxidizing case, the former graphene raises the temperature barrier by at least 100 °C as compared to the latter graphene. Our results therefore suggest that the crystallinity of graphene deserves more considerations when using graphene as the antioxidizing barrier.",

Meanwhile, the GNR size (length, width), PE chain length and CNT size (length, diameter) significantly influences the self-assembly process. The chirality has a little effect on the final structure. In addition, multiple GNRs and PE chains confined inside CNTs and the spiral wrapping of the PE chain and the GNR onto the CNT are also researched.

This is attributed to gate-induced charge carrier redistribution between the two layers in 2LG. Hall cross devices were fabricated from epitaxial graphene 6H-SiC(0001) and were covered by 1LG/2LG with the area ratio of 85: 15%, respectively. Local electric-field sensitivity maps of the devices were obtained in two different measurement geometries using electrical SGM with a conductive tip, where it was observed that the voltage of 2LG islands was inverted relative to anticipated reference maps. Finite element modelling of the current densities and voltage response showed good qualitative agreement with the SGM maps when the effect of the gate was reversed for 2LG. The behaviour is attributed to gate-induced charge carrier redistribution between the two layers in 2LG. The model can be used generally as a tool to predict mixed 1LG/2LG response to electric field. Moreover, regions near the corners of the device show the highest sensitivity when the local electric field was applied to the scanning probe microscopy tip. These regions are capable of detecting highly local electric fields down to 110 kV cm-1.",

With a combination of electron diffraction and photoemission techniques we demonstrate that the NaCl overlayer dissociates upon a short exposure to an X-ray beam. As a result, chlorine desorbs while sodium intercalates under the graphene, inducing an electronic decoupling from the underlying metal. Low energy electron diffraction shows the disappearance of the moiré pattern when Na intercalates between graphene and iridium. Analysis of the Na 2p core-level by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows a chemical change from NaCl to metallic buried Na at the graphene/Ir interface. The intercalation-decoupling process leads to a n-doped graphene due to the charge transfer from the Na, as revealed by constant energy angle resolved X-ray photoemission maps. Moreover, the process is reversible by a mild annealing of the samples without damaging the graphene.",

In two-dimensional materials, however, these processes can be self-driven as shown in previous studies on folded twisted bilayer graphene nanoribbons produced by spontaneous tearing and peeling from a substrate. Here, we use atomic force microscopy techniques to generate and characterize the geometrical structure of naturally self-grown folded nanoribbon structures. Measurements of nanoribbon width and interlayer separation reveal similar twist-angle dependences possibly caused by the anisotropy in the bilayer potential. In addition, analysis of the data shows an unexpected correlation between the height of the folded arc edge -parameterized by a radius R-, and the ribbon width, suggestive of a self-growth process driven by a variable cross-sectional shape. These observations are well described by an energy minimization model that includes the bilayer adhesion energy density as represented by a distance dependent Morse potential. We obtain an analytical expression for the radius R versus the ribbon width that predicts a renormalized bending rigidity and stands in good agreement with experimental observations. The newly found relation between these geometrical parameters suggests a mechanism for tailored growth of folded twisted bilayer graphene -- a platform for many intriguing physics phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Heterostructures of low-dimensional semiconducting materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2), are promising building blocks for future electronic and optoelectronic devices. The patterning of one MX2 material on top of another one is challenging due to their structural similarity. This prevents an intrinsic etch stop when conventional anisotropic dry etching processes are used. An alternative approach consist in a two-step process, where a sacrificial silicon layer is pre-patterned with a low damage plasma process, stopping on the underlying MoS2 film. The pre-patterned layer is used as sacrificial template for the formation of the top WS2 film. This study describes the optimization of a cyclic Ar/Cl2 atomic layer etch process applied to etch silicon on top of MoS2, with minimal damage, followed by a selective conversion of the patterned Si into WS2. The impact of the Si atomic layer etch towards the MoS2 is evaluated: in the ion energy range used for this study, MoS2 removal occurs in the over-etch step over 1–2 layers, leading to the appearance of MoOx but without significant lattice distortions to the remaining layers. The combination of Si atomic layer etch, on top of MoS2, and subsequent Si-to-WS2 selective conversion, allows to create a WS2/MoS2 heterostructure, with clear Raman signals and horizontal lattice alignment. These results demonstrate a scalable, transfer free method to achieve horizontally individually patterned heterostacks and open the route towards wafer-level processing of 2D materials.",

We also extent previous approximate treatments [A. Fetter Phys. Rev. B 32, 7676 (1985)] to include anisotropy and hyperbolic systems, elucidating its predictions for the existence of edge modes. A thorough assessment of the approximate description is carried out, comparing its spin-momentum coupling features in the near field with exact results from Wiener-Hopf techniques.

Thus, the detailed structural information is relevant for creation of 2D materials with desired properties. Here, we explore the capabilities of photoelectron diffraction and holography for structural analysis of atomically thin layers using as examples such systems as h-BN, graphene, and modified graphene with boron impurities. We show that for planar 2D crystals with commensurate interface to the substrate, it is possible to visualize the interface and impurities with high spatial resolution, and to distinguish possible non-equivalent structural units. Our approach applied to B-doped graphene on Ni(1 1 1) and Co(0 0 0 1) surfaces has allowed to reveal asymmetry of boron concentrations in the two carbon sublattices and established its dependence on the applied synthesis procedure and chosen substrate. The obtained results suggest that such approach can be widely applied for studies of various 2D systems, where the structures of interfaces and defects are of remarkable importance.",

While monolayer exfoliation and vapor phase growth produce extremely high quality 2D materials, direct fabrication at wafer scale remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a method that we call ‘lateral conversion’, which enables the synthesis of patterned TMD structures, with control over the thickness down to a few layers, at lithographically predefined locations. In this method, chemical conversion of a metal-oxide film to TMD layers proceeds by diffusion of precursor propagating laterally between silica layers, resulting in structures where delicate chalcogenide films are protected from contamination or oxidation. Lithographically patterned WS 2 structures were synthesized by lateral conversion and analyzed in detail by hyperspectral Raman imaging, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The rate of conversion was investigated as a function of time, temperature, and thickness of the converted film. In addition, the process was extended to grow patterned MoS 2 , WSe 2 , MoSe 2 structures, and to demonstrate unique WS 2 /SiO 2 multilayer structures. We believe this method will be applicable to a variety of additional chalcogenide materials, and enable their incorporation into novel architectures and devices.",

The photo-induced spin current is proportional to the light intensity, and originates from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in TMDs. The spin current spectrum is strongly influenced by electron-hole interactions, i.e. excitonic effects, analogous to the optical absorption. Remarkably, excitons change the temperature dependence of the induced spin current, to the point that the current direction can even be reversed by varying the temperature. This peculiar excitonic behavior is shown to emerge from the relative strength of two distinct mechanisms contributing to the optical response, i.e. a purely interband part and a mixed inter/intraband contribution. Our findings pave the path to the generation of dc spin currents in ordinary TMDs without external static electric or magnetic fields.",

The structures are imaged at atomic resolution with scanning transmission electron microscopy and further characterized with spectroscopic techniques. While the 2D structures are stable over months in vacuum, electron irradiation in the microscope provides sufficient energy to cause a phase transformation—atoms are released from their lattice sites with the gold atoms eventually forming face-centered cubic nanoclusters on top of 2D regions during observation. The presence of copper in the alloy enhances sticking of gold to the substrate, which has clear implications for creating atomically thin electrodes for applications utilizing 2D materials.

    "abstract": "Among the most common few-layers transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), WSe2 is the most challenging material from the lattice dynamics point of view. Indeed, for a long time the main two phonon modes (A1g and ) have been wrongly assigned. In the last few years, these two modes have been properly interpreted, and their quasi-degeneracy in the monolayer has been used for its identification. In this work, we show that this approach has a limited validity and we propose an alternative, more general approach, based on multi-phonon bands. Moreover, we show and interpret all the peaks (about 40) appearing in the Raman spectra of monolayers, bilayers, and trilayers of WSe2 by combining experimental wavelength- and polarization-dependent Raman studies with density-functional theory calculations providing the phonon dispersions, the polarization-resolved first-order Raman spectra, and the two-phonon density of states. This complete study not only offers a method to distinguish between monolayers, bilayers, and trilayers with no need of optical images and atomic force microscopy, but it also sheds light on the interpretation of single and multi-phonon bands appearing in the inelastic light scattering experiments of layered WSe2; some of these bands were never observed before, and some were observed and uncertainly assigned. We promote the full understanding of the lattice dynamics of this material that is crucial for the realization of optoelectronics devices and of novel phononic metamaterials, such as TMDs superlattices.",

However, this new type of electrode still demonstrates poor mechanical contact across interface and low capacity retention, and the improved performance is usually obtained by simply comparing the results to the conventional electrodes containing MoS2 powders and binders. Therefore, it is worth to study deeply on how to rationally design microstructure of MoS2 nanosheets anchored for achieving high-performance sodium storage. Herein, two types of MoS2 nanosheets with different microstructures, including thin and crinkled MoS2 nanosheets (TC-MoS2) and the other thick and flat type (TF-MoS2), are directly grown on carbon cloth, respectively. Compared with TF-MoS2, TC-MoS2 achieves higher reversible capacity and better cycling stability since it can provide much shorter ion transport pathways, larger surface area and better contact to substrate. For instance, TC-MoS2 can deliver high reversible capacities of 593.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, showing a high capacity retention of 88.7% over 100 cycles.",

However, their development is limited by a large Schottky barrier at the contacts because of the strong Fermi-level pinning at the metal-semiconductor interface. Here, we demonstrate that 2D metallic Mo1−x W x Te2 alloy, bonded to the 2D semiconductor channel MoTe2 via van der Waals (vdW) force, can alleviate the Fermi-level pinning at the contacts. By using asymmetric contacts consisting of low work function Ti and high work function Mo1−x W x Te2 alloy, ambipolar transistors were created, showing superior transport for both electrons and holes. The MoTe2 transistor with asymmetric contacts is unidirectional and shows prominent rectifying behavior. Moreover, this asymmetric contact scheme breaks the mirror symmetry of the built-in potential profile within the channel, which enables the device to serve as an efficient solar cell and a sensitive photodetector with low dark current. This work uncovers the great potential of 2D metallic contacts for device applications and offers a new route toward tailoring 2D electronics and photonics in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mutual relative orientation and well defined, uncontaminated interfaces are the key to obtain van-der-Waals heterostacks with defined properties. Even though the van-der-Waals forces are known to promote the ‘self-cleaning’ of interfaces, residue from the stamping process, which is often found to be trapped between the heterostructure constituents, can interrupt the interlayer interaction and therefore the coupling. Established interfacial cleaning methods usually involve high-temperature steps, which are in turn known to lead to uncontrolled rotations of layers within fragile heterostructures. Here, we present an alternative method feasible at room temperature. Using the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM), we locally control the activation of interlayer attractive forces, resulting in the global removal of contaminants from the interface (i.e. the contaminants are also removed in regions several µ m away from the line touched by the AFM tip). By testing combinations of various hydrophobic van-der-Waals materials, mild temperature treatments, and by observing the temporal evolution of the contaminant removal process, we identify that the AFM tip triggers a dewetting-induced hydrophobic collapse and the van-der-Waals interaction is driving the cleaning process. We anticipate that this process is at the heart of the known ‘self-cleaning’ mechanism. Our technique can be utilized to controllably establish interlayer close coupling between a stack of van-der-Waals layers, and additionally allows to pattern and manipulate heterostructures locally for example to confine material into nanoscopic pockets between two van-der-Waals materials.",

Highly crystalline stage 1 and 2 were prepared by a proton-driven ion-introduction method.A simple water-soaking process was employed to achieve the stage-3 structure by deintercalation of Ag ions from lower stage structures.Besides, we developed a general stacking rule to determine the crystal structure, and it can predict any higher-order stage structure of AgxTaS2.The superconducting transition temperature was enhanced from 1.7 K for a stage-2 structure to 3.8 K for a stage-3 structure, which is more than four times that of the pristine TaS2 (0.8 K).This enhancement is attributed to the increase in density of states at the Fermi level, which was calculated by density functional theory.Also, the water-soaking process reconstructs the stage-2 into the stage-3 structure while deteriorating its crystallinity.Such a structural distortion is one of the potential reasons for the suppression of charge density wave in stage-2, resulting in the enhancement of superconductivity despite the structural degradation.",

Many of these defects can be created by top-down methods such as electron irradiation or chemical etching, while a few of them are created along bottom-up processes, in particular during the growth of the material, in which case avoiding their formation can be challenging. This occurs e.g. with dislocations, Stone-Wales defects, or atomic vacancies in graphene. Here we address a defect that has been observed repeatedly since 2007 in epitaxial graphene on metal surfaces like Ru(0001) and Re(0001), but whose nature has remained elusive thus far. This defect has the appearance of a vacant hill in the periodically nanorippled topography of graphene, which comes together with a moir{\\'e} pattern. Based on atomistic simulations and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we argue that such defects are topological in nature and that their core is a stacking fault patch, either in graphene, surrounded by loops of non-hexagonal carbon rings, or in the underlying metal. We discuss the possible origin of these defects in relation with recent reports of metastable polycyclic carbon molecules forming upon graphene growth. Like other defects, the vacant hills may be considered as deleterious in the perspective of producing high quality graphene. However, provided they can be organized in graphene, they might allow novel optical, spin, or electronic properties to be engineered.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 2D materials are considered enabling constituents in future large-scale electronics, but current production by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) proceeds at significantly lower rates than for traditional semiconductors and limits their usefulness in many envisioned applications. Analysis of previous research indicates that the current 2D materials production-scale is restricted by the low conversion efficiency between precursor and product. We here demonstrate the enhanced efficiency and speed of 2D materials growth by introducing a route to reach the reaction-controlled growth regime. Computational fluid-dynamics highlights the importance of gas-phase kinetics even in LPCVD growth and suggests that reaction-controlled growth can be achieved through optimization of the interaction between precursor and substrate. Applying this new restriction to graphene, growth rates were increased by ∼10 4 times and graphene synthesis proceeded without limitations from precursor supply even in atomic-scale pores. This advance enabled the synthesis of graphene at areas of several square-meters within 10 min using a research-grade 3″ furnace. The achieved conversion efficiency and production rate surpass existing growth methods by several orders of magnitude and extend 2D materials’ synthesis beyond silicon production capabilities, opening new routes for their application.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Synthesizing active and durable catalysts for oxidizing benzene to phenol through benzene oxidation reaction (BOR) is of great significance for the next-generation phenol industry. The appearance of graphdiyne (GDY) brings us a very excited discovery that we can systematically study on theoretically and experimentally the exact location of active sites and reaction mechanisms of BOR using GDY as the model system. The results give us a clear understanding on the active sites responsible for BOR and sp-hybridized acetylenic bonds in GDY guarantees the activation of benzene molecule by forming new type of ‘–COO/–COOH’ active centers and efficient O transport of BOR kinetics, leading to efficient catalytic performances. The catalytic mechanism and process of GDY are clear and are the first class of metal-free catalysts capable of directly oxidizing benzene to phenol at ambient pressure and room temperature. The catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity with the average value of selectivity to be 82.29 ± 2.69% and the conversion to be 8.30 ± 0.66% at low temperature, superior to reported carbon materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides, normal strain can modulate electronic band structures, yet leaving the optical selection rules intact. In contrast, a shear strain can perturb the spin-valley locked band structures and possibly induce mixing of the spin subbands which in turn can transfer oscillator strength between spin-allowed bright and spin-forbidden dark excitons. Here, we report a novel scheme to manipulate photoluminescence (PL) in a monolayer WSe 2 -MoSe 2 lateral heterostructures, controlled by an external bending method in which strong out-of-plane shear strain (OSS) of up to 5.6% accompanies weak in-plane normal strain up to 0.72%. The spectra revealed a striking dependence on the bending direction that is stagnant in the negative (compressive) strain region and then rapidly changes with increasing positive (tensile) strain. The dependency of the PL signal under tensile bending was represented not only by the large energy shift ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math> 40 meV) of the lowest excited states of both the WSe 2 and MoSe 2 monolayers, but also by the tendency to violate the optical selection rules that brightens (darkens) the excitons of the WSe 2 (MoSe 2 ) side. The analyses on the observed energy shifts and PL intensity changes confirm the different origins in compressive bending compared with tensile bending. The well-established band-anticrossing is identified to be affecting only the compressive deformation region. The spectral changes in the tensile region, on the other hand, originates mainly from the generation of an off-diagonal perturbation to a spin-specific Hamiltonian induced by OSS. The degree of spin-state mixing, which correlates precisely with the spin-flip coefficient of the theoretical model, is further represented by the OSS matrix elements, the spin splitting energy, and the shear deformation potential.",

Here we report a rationally substituting sp -C strategy for the synthesis of methyl- and hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (MGDY, HGDY) nanowires arrays as 3D porous flexible metal-free electrodes for AOER. Methyl group in MGDY with stronger electron-pushing effect makes electrons around the acetylenic carbon atoms more delocalized, resulting in more uneven distributed surface charge, and higher intrinsic catalytic activities for AOER than HGDY, with the smaller overpotential of 406 mV at 10 mA cm −2 than HGDY and previously reported metal-free electrocatalysts. Our results reveal that the modulation of the electronic structure of GDY by selectively substituting sp -C allows for facilitating charge transfer kinetics, improving adsorption of reaction intermediate, and thereby accelerating the sluggish kinetics of AOER.

It can be generally shown that, the valley filter effect has an angular dependent polarity and vanishes under angular integration, by the same constraint from time-reversal symmetry that leads to its absence in one-dimension. These findings are demonstrated for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene using tight-binding calculations. We further show that junction along chiral directions can concentrate the valley pump in an angular interval largely separated from the bias direction, allowing efficient havest of valley polarization in a cross-bar device.",

Here, we experimentally demonstrate an enhanced polarization sensitive photoelectric PR in graphene sheets containing interface junctions as compared to homogenous graphene sheets in the visible, infrared, and THz spectral regions. Our numerical simulations show that highly localized electronic states are created at the interface junctions, and these states exhibit a unique energy spectrum and enhanced probabilities for optical transitions.

    "abstract": "Flexible interconnects are attracting significant attention owing to their key role in flexible electronic devices as well as their tendency to carry high frequency to all areas of electronics. The radio frequency (RF) characteristics of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were measured to determine its transmission properties in various bending states. The results obtained for the original flat state were compared with those obtained for a progressively bent state and for a post-measurement, flat recovery state. Both the bent and flat states exhibited a small difference in real and imaginary impedance. De-embedding was performed to exclude the background signal from the substrate and electrodes without using the rGO. In the case of high-frequency transmission and reflection signals, the difference between the bent and flat states was noteworthy; however, there was a small difference in impedance. The impedance gradually increased with the degree of bending of the rGO film up to a small difference from the flat state. It then returned to its initial level when the film returned to its flat state (i.e. the recovery state). The cause of these impedance changes was analyzed by studying the wrinkles, adhesion, strain, and defects of rGO using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The impedance increased with bending due to defects between the flakes. However, the degree of increase in impedance was compensated for by the presence of wrinkles and the reduction in the interlayer distance. This approach is readily adaptable for use in flexible RF interconnects.",

We show that such interlayer orbital hybridization widely exists in many 2D layered materials involving extensively out-of-plane orbitals. This interlayer orbital hybridization greatly enriches the physical properties of this class of 2D layered materials compared to pure van der Waals 2D layered materials. More importantly, we demonstrate that these properties are easily tunable by controlling the interlayer distance or stacking, making them very promising in meeting the desired requirements in practical applications.",

These schemes consist in measuring fluctuations in the mechanical response of the resonator, such as fluctuations of its displacement spectrum, induced by minute changes in its environment. The accuracy of detecting such changes depends on how accurately the temperature of vibrations is known. However, using light to measure the mechanical response modifies vibrational temperature, making this detection challenging. We propose two complementary detection schemes that may enable us to measure the response of the resonator optically with optimal accuracy. The first scheme is based on minimizing the absorbance of the monolayer while ensuring that the reflectance of the resonator strongly varies with displacement. This scheme minimizes absorptive heating of the monolayer and optomechanical cooling and heating of its flexural vibrations, while preserving the capability of using reflectometry to detect vibrations. The second scheme is based on maximizing the derivative of the absorbance with respect to monolayer displacement. This scheme utilizes the modulation of absorbed energy and may relate modulations of photoluminescence intensity to the modulations of displacement. Both schemes can be controlled by tuning the equilibrium position of the monolayer using electrostatic pressure.",

After triethylamine treatment, the field effect transistors (FETs) based on monolayer WS2 exhibit enhanced mobility up to 28.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much larger than that of the pristine one (9.8 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, the n-doping via triethylamine treatment can also improve the photoresponsivity of the device, i.e. from pristine 6.4 × 10−3 AW−1 to the doped 21 AW−1. Interestingly, the electron transport properties of the doped WS2 can be recovered to be close to that of the intrinsic WS2 via acetone immersion. Moreover, the electron doping and reversibility are evidently observed in Raman, photoluminscence, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

However, important aspects of its device characteristics are not fully understood, including in particular, the mechanism of electrical noise in its gapped state, which is essential to its operation. Here, we present the first systematic study of 1/f noise in conductance G in a dual-gated BLG as we tune the Fermi energy inside its large band gap. The normalized conductance noise /G(2) initially increases dramatically by over an order of magnitude, which our analysis indicates, as arising due to percolative charge transport. When the Fermi energy reaches the charge neutrality point, we observe a remarkably constant irrespective of the magnitude of band gap, even though G decreases exponentially with band gap. We discuss that this is likely to be consequence of fluctuations in activated charge carriers far from the Fermi energy, enabled by charge traps of the substrate. Our results provide a coherent description of low frequency electrical noise in gapped BLG, paving the way for its implementation in the next-generation devices as well as representing benchmark for other gapped 2D materials.",

Here, an optical microfiber interferometer is employed to explore the impact of MoS2 supporting interface on the photothermal-induced deformation of gold nanoshells. Upon analyzing the optical spectra recorded by the microfiber and transmission electron microscopy images, it appears that the MoS2 supporting interface enhances the photothermal effect of the gold nanostructures and confines the electric field oscillation to the nanoshells. Thus, the shape and size evolution of the gold nanoshells are greatly affected by the presence of MoS2 supporting interface. The facile photothermal-induced transformation of the gold nanoshell-MoS2 nanohybrids indicates their technological applications, including catalysis and electronic/optical devices. Furthermore, this transformation process was monitored by an optical microfiber through its evanescent field. This demonstrates the feasibility of using optical fibers to study the inner mechanisms of material transitions in situ, providing a fundamental basis for smart material development at the nanoscale.",

    "abstract": "Due to unique properties arising from its 2D nature, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been studied widely toward its application for biosensing. While MoS2 field effect transistor has been utilized for electrical detection of biological events in many studies, photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of MoS2 have been poorly employed. MoS2 PL can provide not only information of interactions between biological moieties and the surface, but also their spatial distribution. In this work, we utilized PL of single-layer MoS2 as a label-free bioimaging sensor. To fabricate the imaging device, we synthesized MoS2 by chemical vapor deposition and transferred it on a glass substrate with patterned electrodes. We employed Lactobacillus known as a probiotic microorganism to demonstrate the ability of bioimaging. We found that the MoS2 PL can be modulated by the concentration of lactic acid. Finally, we succeeded in monitoring PL image of MoS2 modulated by Lactobacillus, which can be correlated with the production of lactic acid by Lactobacillus.",

Here we show that spontaneously buckled graphene can yield a correlated state, emerging from an elastic pseudo Landau level. Our results build on top of recent experimental findings reporting that, when placed on top of hBN or NbSe 2 substrates, wrinkled graphene sheets relax forming a periodic, long-range buckling pattern. The low-energy physics can be accurately described by electrons in the presence of a pseudo-axial gauge field, leading to the formation of sublattice-polarized Landau levels. Moreover, we verify that the high density of states at the zeroth Landau level leads to the formation of a periodically modulated ferrimagnetic groundstate, which can be controlled by the application of external electric fields. Our results indicate that periodically strained graphene is a versatile platform to explore emergent electronic states arising from correlated elastic Landau levels.",

However, previously proposed methods based on Raman spectroscopy or optical imaging after chemical etching are unable to provide non-invasive and fast analysis of large-area graphene films as grown on Cu foil substrates. Here we report that the reflection mode of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) provides a high-contrast image of graphene on Cu, enabling the real-time evaluation of the coverage and quality of graphene. The reflectance contrast, Rc , was found to be dependent on the incident laser wavelength, of which the maximum was obtained at 405 nm. In addition, Rc decreases with increasing defect density of graphene. The dependence of Rc on the graphene’s quality and laser wavelengths were explained by the tight-binding model calculation based on the Fresnel’s interference formula. Thus, we believe that the reflection mode CLSM would be a very powerful quality-assessment tool for the mass production of CVD graphene films grown on Cu.",

First, a surface magnon-plasmon polariton whose dispersion is radically changed by the carrier density of the graphene layer, including a change of sign in the group velocity. Second, a surface plasmon-magnon polariton formed as a linear superposition of graphene surface plasmon and the antiferromagnetic bare magnon. This polariton has a dispersion with two branches, formed by the anticrossing between the dispersive surface plasmon and the magnon.

Materials with a field-effect tunable band, such as bilayer [1] and rhombohedral trilayer graphene [2, 3], are more flexible for electronic applications. Here, on dual-gated twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) samples with small twist angle around 1 ∘ , we observe vertical electric-field-tunable bandstructures at multiple moiré fillings with bandgap values continuously varying from zero to tens of mili-electron volts. Moreover, within the first moiré filling on both electron and hole sides, the carrier transport deviates from Fermi liquid behavior, with measured resistivity exhibiting linear temperature dependence between 1.5 K and 50 K. Furthermore, under a vertical magnetic field, the coupling between the two bilayer graphene layers can also be turned on and off by a displacement field. Our results suggest TDBG with small twist angle is a platform for studying the evolution of multiple electric field tunable moiré bands and the resulting emergent correlated electronic phases.",

The findings demonstrate that with incrementally applied voltage, electrostrictive deformation and highly vertical current occur more significantly. Additionally, using a 2D fast Fourier transform power spectra, we demonstrate that the horizontal distribution of topography and current is more inhomogeneous than the vertical distribution, and that their monolithic spatial correlation weakens with increasing applied voltage. Moreover, we discovered that electrostrictive deformation has a sizable effect on the monolithic vertical resistance. Furthermore, local hollow positions are more conductive than bulge positions, as demonstrated by the ‘resistor’ model and local current–voltage curve.

Here, we design an optoelectronic device consisting of single-layer graphene electrically contacted with thin graphite leads, seated on an atomically flat hexagonal boron nitride substrate and gated with an ultra-thin gold layer. We show that this device is optically transparent, has no background optical peaks and photoluminescence from the device components, and no generation of laser-induced electrostatic doping (photodoping). This allows for room-temperature gate-dependent Raman spectroscopy effects that have only been observed at cryogenic temperatures so far, above all the Kohn-anomaly phonon energy normalization. The new device architecture, by decoupling graphene optoelectronic properties from the substrate effects, allows for observing quantum phenomena at room temperature.",

We use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study a single quintuple layer (QL) of the van der Waals magnet Fe 3 GeTe 2 (FGT) that is grown on Bi 2 Te 3 via molecular beam epitaxy. STM topographic images show that the FGT grows as free-standing islands on Bi 2 Te 3 and outwards from Bi 2 Te 3 steps. Atomic resolution imaging shows triangular lattices of 390 ± 10 pm for FGT and 430 ± 10 pm for Bi 2 Te 3 , consistent with the respective bulk crystals. A moiré pattern is observed on FGT regions with a periodicity of 4.3 ± 0.4 nm that can be attributed solely to this lattice mismatch and thus indicates zero rotational misalignment. While most of the surface is covered by a single QL of the FGT, there are small double QL regions, as well as regions with distinct chemical terminations due to an incomplete QL.

We confirm the capability of XPD to distinguish different proposed structural models and, unambiguously, determine the true surface structure. Also, our findings provide reliable in-plane and interlayer distances. We observed expansions of the perpendicular distances between atomic planes within the monolayer and between monolayers of 3%–5%.

Here, the power factor K , which can characterize the excitonic behaviors, was determined for InSe with varying thicknesses. The photoluminescence results suggest that defects play a dominant role in the recombination of excitons with varying thicknesses. Consequently, the free exciton peak at 931 nm, which is linked to the double exciton emission behavior, becomes obscured by the presence of a bound exciton peak at 980 nm resulting from defect-induced recombination. However, at specific thicknesses and power levels, the enhancement of quantum confinement effect coupled with a reduction in defect proportion enables the observation of the peak corresponding to free exciton. Furthermore, the extracted K values from the InSe photodetectors corroborated the aforementioned findings. The results presented here provide an in-depth understanding of exciton behavior in InSe and provide theoretical underpinning for the development of InSe-based optoelectronics.",

The material’s structural strength, superior thermal and electrical conductivity, anti-corrosion properties, and versatile sensor capabilities has made it an exceedingly desirable option for various functions in the nuclear industry. However, despite the increasing interest in graphene’s potential uses in the nuclear industry, a comprehensive and detailed review of its possible applications in this context is still missing. This article endeavours to bridge this gap by presenting a thorough analysis of the potential applications of graphene in the nuclear industry. Specifically, its applications to pre-reactor treatments, fuel enrichment, heavy water preparation, filtration, radionuclide waste conditioning, monitoring through sensors, augmented heat transfer and corrosion prevention. These areas offer numerous opportunities for graphene-based materials to enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of nuclear power plants. This article not only illuminates the exciting opportunities of graphene usage in the nuclear field but also serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers and stakeholders seeking to leverage the unique properties of graphene to drive innovation and advancement in the nuclear industry.",

Here we combine STM/STS with basic machine learning to develop a method for screening out the vortices pinned by embedded disorder in iron-based superconductors. Through a principal component analysis of large STS data within vortices, we find that the vortex-core states in Ba(Fe 0.96 Ni 0.04 ) 2 As 2 start to split into two categories at certain magnetic field strengths, reflecting vortices with and without pinning by subsurface defects or disorders.

Thus, this work presents an experimental study on dielectrophoretic assembly of pristine MXene flakes at the level of screen-printed interdigitated microelectrodes. The development of MXene uniaxial ‘bridges’ across electrode micro-gaps can be controlled by convenient dielectrophoretic parameters such as voltage and frequency, which are thoroughly discussed.

By modulating the percentage of transition metal and transition metal oxide in the composite, the largest current density values of methanol and ethanol oxidation of the composite reach 20.18 and 7.83 mA cm −2 , respectively. In addition, the composite catalyst exhibits excellent stability and conductivity, and the catalyst greatly reduces the experimental cost relative to the noble metal catalysts, indicating that the composite is a potential fuel cell catalyst candidate and provides an innovative concept for creation non-precious metal catalysts.",

In this study, we develop a microscopic formalism for Ising superconductors that captures the superconducting instability arising from a momentum-dependent spin- and charge-fluctuation-mediated pairing interaction. We apply our pairing model to the electronic structure of monolayer NbSe2, where first-principles calculations reveal the presence of strong paramagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations provide a quantitative measure of the mixing between the even- and odd-parity superconducting states and its variation with Coulomb interaction. Further, numerical analysis in the presence of an external Zeeman field reveals the role of Ising spin–orbit coupling and mixing of odd-parity superconducting state in influencing the low-temperature enhancement of the critical magnetic field.",

By stacking different layers into homo- or hetero-structures, an extra degree of freedom is involved in further tuning their properties, thereby boosting scenarios in twistronics, moiré photonics and optoelectronics. However, interfacial imperfections such as contaminations and cracks, frequently occur during the layer stacking sequence and accumulate layer by layer, greatly degenerating the interface quality. In this study, we developed a multiple conformal-contact transfer method to construct TMD stacks with crack-free intrinsic interfaces. The design of a deformable buffer layer is crucial to guarantee the conformal contact and intact transfer of each layer, contributing to the successful construction of centimetre-scale TMD stacks up to 8 layers. Precise control over spatial location and interlayer twist angle is also feasibly achieved, evidenced by the stacking-dependent interlayer exciton (IE) effects in WS 2 -WSe 2 heterostructures. This work provides a facile and precise approach for architecting 2D stacks with perfect interfaces, which will further accelerate the customized design for their device functionalization.",

With the enhanced stress effect of CO 2 molecules, the contents of oxygen vacancies O V , aluminium vacancies Al V , and AlO 4 in the 2D structure are elevated, and then the ferromagnetic properties of LaAlO 3 appeared to be significantly enhanced due to defects and spatial symmetry breaking of the octahedron. Notably, the 2D intrinsic ferromagnetic LaAlO 3 exhibited a Tc above 350 K.

Here, we demonstrate the electrically reconfigurable behavior in MoO 3 /indium selenide (InSe) vdW heterojunction with a type-III broken-gap band alignment. The electrical reconfigurability is enabled by the ambipolar transport property of InSe, which is achieved through the use of Pt as contact electrodes. By electrostatically doping the InSe, the reconfigurable MoO 3 /InSe heterojunctions can be converted between p-n and n + - n junctions. As a current rectifier, the MoO 3 /InSe heterojunction shows rectification ratios of ∼10 7 and ∼10 4 for forward and backward bias conditions, respectively. As a photodetector, the MoO 3 /InSe heterojunction shows stable photo-switching behavior with a ∼10 5 on/off ratio and an ultralow dark current (≈10 fA). The response time is measured to be 500 μ s and 300 μ s for rise and fall processes, respectively.

However, from the computational point of view, understanding correlated matter in these systems requires solving models with several millions of atoms, a formidable task for state-of-the-art methods. Conventional wavefunction methods for correlated matter scale with a cubic power with the number of sites, a major challenge for super-moiré materials. Here, we introduce a methodology capable of solving correlated states in super-moiré materials by combining a kernel polynomial method with a quantics tensor cross interpolation matrix product state algorithm. This strategy leverages a mapping of the super-moiré structure to a many-body Hilbert space, that is efficiently sampled with tensor cross interpolation with matrix product states, where individual evaluations are performed with a Chebyshev kernel polynomial algorithm. We demonstrate this approach with interacting super-moiré systems with up to several millions of atoms, showing its ability to capture correlated states in moiré-of-moiré systems and domain walls between different moiré systems. Our manuscript puts forward a widely applicable methodology to study correlated matter in ultra-long length scales, enabling rationalizing correlated super-moiré phenomena.",

We identify an electric dipole at the GaSe/graphene interface, with electrons accumulating on the GaSe, that cannot be compensated by p-type doping through the creation of defects formed by annealing in ultrahigh vacuum. Additionally, we demonstrate that both as-grown and defective GaSe layers are remarkably resilient to oxidation in a pure O 2 environment, and chemisorption of O 2 molecules on the surface can effectively electronically neutralise the doping in the layer.

By comparing different non-vdW and vdW growth substrates, we demonstrate that ultra-flat graphene films provide an atomically smooth surface and effectively isolates oxygen-dangling bonds, and finally promote the superconducting behaviours of monolayer NbSe 2 and TaS 2 films. This growth strategy could also be extended to other wafer-scale TMD films and be of both fundamental and technological significance in the development of wafer-scale monolayer TMD-based devices.",

Nevertheless, the interesting properties that arise as the number of layers is reduced, do not necessarily persist when the nanosheets are printed on substrates to form networks. Therefore, research on the networks and the influence of the nanosheets’ dimensions is valuable for scaling up prospects. It is known that strain alters the band structure of TMDs and also tune transitions between different crystal structures. The figure of merit that measures how much the resistivity changes when strain is applied is the gauge factor ( GF ). In networks, this is modeled as a sum of the nanosheet intrinsic GF and the change of the junction resistance between nanosheets due to strain. In this work we obtain the GF of devices printed on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filters through their transport characteristics when applying uniaxial strain, both at a tensile and a compressive setup, by using a three-beam bending machine. We report a transition from a positive GF to a negative one, when applying uniaxial strain to WS 2 networks as the lateral size increases, and a transition from negative GF to a positive one, when compression is applied to MoS 2 networks as lateral size increases.",

Colloids in bulk can be assessed by light scattering and diffraction to investigate features such as their hydrodynamic size, charge and concentration. However, the main drawback of such techniques lies in the application of analytical and computational methods based on models assuming particle sphericity which are not representative for 2D materials. Resonance mass measurement (RMM) is a technique which can enable the analysis of 2D materials in suspension without the assumptions of spherical models. Here, we report the application of RMM to measure particle mass and concentration for three types of graphene oxide (GO) aqueous dispersions. Using micro- and nano-suspended resonating sensors, we were able to decipher gravimetric differences between GO and graphitic materials. Our results support the urge for proper definitions and standardisations of graphene based materials, and offer a new method of characterisation for 2D material colloids in liquid suspension.",

    "abstract": "Studying the interplay between superconductivity and quantum magnetotransport in two-dimensional materials has been a topic of interest in recent years. Towards such a goal it is important to understand the impact of magnetic field on the charge transport at the superconductor-normal channel (SN) interface. Here we carried out a comprehensive study of Andreev conductance under weak magnetic fields using diffusive superconductor- graphene Josephson weak links. We observe that the Andreev conductance is suppressed even in magnetic fields far below the upper critical field of the superconductor. The suppression of Andreev conductance depends on and can be minimized by controlling the ramping of the magnetic field. We identify that the key factor behind this suppression is the reduction of the superconducting gap due to the piling of vortices on the superconducting contacts. In devices where superconducting gap at the superconductor-graphene interface is heavily reduced by proximity effect, the enlarged vortex cores overlap quickly with increasing magnetic field, resulting in a rapid decrease of the interfacial gap. However, in weak links with relatively large effective superconducting gap the AR conductance persists up to the upper critical field. Our results provide guidance to the study of quantum material-superconductor systems in presence of magnetic field, where 'survival' of induced superconductivity is critical.",

However, their low electrical conductivity and mechanical instability result in limited power density and poor cycle life. This work proposes a unique two-layered film made of polyetheretherketone-derived MPCs and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an electrode for supercapacitors. Electrochemical characterizations of films show that such a layered structure is more effective in increasing the accessibility of ions to the hydrophilic MPCs and establishing conductive paths through the rGO network than a simple mixed composite film. The two-layered structure increases the capacitance by ~124% (237 F g−1) with excellent cycling stability (~93% after 6000 cycles). More importantly, we demonstrate that such performance improvements result from an optimal balance between electrical conductivity and ion accessibility, which maximizes the synergistic effects of MPC and rGO. The MPCs, which are exposed to the surface, provide a highly accessible surface area for ion adsorption. The rGO serves a dual function as a conductive filler to increase the electrical conductivity and as a binder to interconnect individual MPC particles into a robust and flexible film. These findings provide a rational basis for the design of MPC-based electrodes in high performance supercapacitors.",

These modes are shifted by local doping in the defect region, resulting in large contrast in the ballistic conductance of graphene sheet. In general it is found that sensitivity is strongly dependent on temperature due to smoothing out of the defect-induced peaks and transport gaps. This temperature dependence, however, offers the added capability for sub-mK temperature sensing resolution, and thus an opportunity towards ultra-sensitive combined electrochemical-calorimetric sensing.",

Motivated by experimental results, we construct a model capturing the delicate interplay of Coulomb interactions, inter-dot tunneling, Zeeman splittings, and intrinsic spin–orbit coupling in a double quantum dot (DQD) structure to simulate the Pauli blockades. Analyzing the relevant Fock-subspaces of the generalized Hamiltonian, coupled with the density matrix master equation technique for transport across the setup, we identify the generic class of blockade mechanisms. Most importantly, and contrary to what is widely recognized, we show that conducting and blocking states responsible for the Pauli-blockades are a result of the coupled effect of all degrees of freedom and cannot be explained using the spin or the valley pseudo-spin only. We then numerically predict the regimes where Pauli blockades might occur, and, to this end, we verify our model against actual experimental data and propose that our model can be used to generate data sets for different values of parameters with the ultimate goal of training on a machine learning algorithm. Our work provides an enabling platform for a predictable theory-aided experimental realization of single-shot readout of the spin and valley states on DQDs based on 2D-material platforms.",

Here, we present our investigation of the electronic and topological properties of a square-octagon Sb monolayer with Mo atoms adsorbed (Mo@so-Sb) using first-principles calculations. Our studies reveal how a trivial insulator can be first engineered into an unusual bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS) and then further tuned by strain into a spintronics-favorable half semiconductor (HS) or half metal. Remarkably, with 3.7% compressive strain applied, we achieve a QAH state in Mo@so-Sb with a high Chern number ( C = 4) which is much larger than that ( C = ±1 or ±2) of the previously predicted Chern insulators. This QAH state is characterized by the appearance of four gapless chiral edge states within the nontrivial band gap, enabling a robust multi-channel low-power-consumption transport. Its nontrivial topology primarily originates from the band inversion between the non-degenerate Mo 4 d and Sb 5 p orbitals. Additionally, we demonstrate the interesting BMS, HS, and QAH states can be controlled by the Mo adsorption concentrations. Our findings not only provide a versatile means of transforming trivial insulators into the desired spintronics-favorable and topological states, but also open new possibilities for high-performance electronic devices.",

The tight-binding modeling reveals that rotation symmetry ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>C</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">z</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:math> ) breaking splits the Dirac point and preserves the nodal loop.

Here, we theoretically study a model for a single layer of graphene subject to a smooth moiré electrostatic potential, induced by an insulating substrate layer. For sufficiently large moiré unit cells, we find that ultra-flat bands coexist with a triangular network of chiral one-dimensional (1D) channels. These channels mediate an effective interaction between localized modes with spin-, orbital- and valley degrees of freedom emerging from the flat bands. The form of the interaction reflects the chirality and 1D nature of the network. We study this interacting model within an SU (4) mean-field theory, semi-classical Monte-Carlo simulations, and an SU (4) spin-wave theory, focusing on commensurate order stabilized by local two-site and chiral three-site interactions. By tuning a gate voltage, one can trigger a non-coplanar phase characterized by a peculiar coexistence of three different types of order: ferromagnetic spin order in one valley, non-coplanar chiral spin order in the other valley, and 120 ∘ order in the remaining spin and valley-mixed degrees of freedom. Quantum and classical fluctuations have qualitatively different effects on the observed phases and can, for example, create a finite spin-chirality purely via fluctuation effects.",

In this study, we investigate the catalytic properties of single-atom doped graphene as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) using first-principles calculations. We consider several elements, including Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, P, As, and Sb, which were interstitially doped into single and double C vacancies in graphene. Our density functional theory calculations show that all the considered doped graphene, except for As-doped graphene, can be highly active for HER, with hydrogen adsorption free energies (Δ G H* ) close to the optimal value (Δ G H* = 0), ranging from −0.19 to 0.11 eV. Specifically, Δ G H* of Al, Ga, In, and Ge are much closer to zero when doped in the single vacancy than in the double vacancy. In contrast, Δ G H* of Sb and Sn are much closer to zero in the double vacancy. Si and P have Δ G H* values close to the optimum in both vacancies. Interestingly, the vacancy numbers play a crucial role in forming orbital hybridizations, resulting in distinct electronic distributions for most dopants. As a result, a few doped graphenes show distinctive ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic orders, which is also an important factor for determining the strength of H adsorption. These findings have important implications for designing graphene-based HER catalysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Graphene absorption from the visible to infrared spectrum has great potential and broad applications in miniature of modern optoelectronic biosensors and photodetectors. However, graphene has zero bandgap energy, which limits its absorption to 2.3% in the visible and infrared spectrums. Here, we propose a metastructure to optimize graphene absorption in the visible to near-infrared frequency regions. The metastructure, comprising an array of aluminum square blocks (Al-SBs) on a graphene layer, a silica spacer, and an Al reflector, is investigated for absorption enhancement. This work deciphers the effect of the periodicity of decorated Al-SBs on the evolution of dual-band absorption in single-layer graphene under normal incidence. The electromagnetic signatures of two excited modes indicate that surface plasmons and magnetic dipole plasmons are mediators of absorption. The investigation into the impact of geometrical parameters illustrates that the coexisting phenomena of a relative broad peak and a relative sharp peak have been achieved simultaneously with high efficiency. The dynamic manipulation of surface plasmons and magnetic dipole plasmons presents great potential for a diverse range of applications, such as sensing and imaging. By controlling the periodicity of Al-SBs, it is possible to achieve active control of surface plasmon resonance, and a detection range of 300 nm is observed. Dynamic control of the magnetic dipole plasmon is successfully achieved by modifying the electrical environment of the graphene layer, which is realized by altering the underlying spacer material. Collectively, the findings of this study demonstrate the significant potential of the suggested metastructure for its prospective applications in optoelectronic devices, including biosensors, photovoltaics, and photodetectors that rely on the dynamic control of surface and magnetic plasmon resonances.",

In this work, graphene membranes with superior filtration properties are fabricated by stacking up to three graphene layers on a porous support and exploiting the intrinsic nanopores of graphene to filter diclofenac (drug), and methylene blue (dye). The rejection improves increasing the number of the stacked graphene layers, with the best results obtained with three graphene layers. Mass diffusion properties depend on the size of the probe molecule, consistently with the existence of intrinsic nanometer-sized pores within graphene. From the results of an in depth transmission electron microscopy analysis and molecular dynamics simulations it is inferred that graphene stacking results in a decrease of effective membrane pore sizes to about 13 Å diameter which corresponds to 97% rejection for diclofenac and methylene blue after one hour filtration.",

However, upon contact with metals for such applications, the Fermi level pinning effect may occur, where states are induced in its band gap by the metal, hindering its intrinsic semiconducting properties. We propose the insertion of graphene at the contact interface to alleviate the metal-induced gap states. By using gold (Au) as the electrode material and monolayer SnO (mSnO) as the channel material, the geometry, bonding strength, charge transfer and tunnel barriers of charges, and electronic properties including the work function, band structure, density of states, and Schottky barriers are thoroughly investigated using first-principles calculations for the structures with and without graphene to reveal the contact behaviours and Fermi level depinning mechanism. It has been demonstrated that strong covalent bonding is formed between gold and mSnO, while the graphene interlayer forms weak van der Waals interaction with both materials, which minimises the perturbance to the band structure of mSnO. The effects of out-of-plane compression are also analysed to assess the performance of the contact under mechanical deformation, and a feasible fabrication route for the heterostructure with graphene is proposed. This work systematically explores the properties of the Au-mSnO contact for applications in FETs and provides thorough guidance for future exploitation of 2D materials in various electronic applications and for selection of buffer layers to improve metal-semiconductor contact.",

Systematic adjusting of the performance can be achieved by introducing organic components into the carbon supporter.

Although its linear and nonlinear optical properties have been extensively studied, the interaction of hBN with high-intensity laser pulses, which is important for realizing high-harmonic generation, creating deterministic defects as quantum emitters, and resist-free patterning in this material, has not been investigated. Here we report the first systematic study of dielectric breakdown in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown hBN monolayers induced by single femtosecond laser pulses. We report a breakdown fluence of 0.7 J cm −2 , which is at least 7× higher than that of other monolayer 2D materials. A clean removal of hBN without leaving traces behind or causing lateral damage is demonstrated. The ablation features exhibit excellent fidelity with very small edge roughness, which we attribute to its ultrahigh fracture toughness due to its heterogeneous nature with three-fold symmetry. Moreover, even though defects are known to be abundant in CVD-grown hBN, we show experimentally and theoretically that its nonlinear optical breakdown is nearly intrinsic as defects only marginally lower the breakdown threshold. On top of this, we observe that hBN monolayers have a 4–5× lower breakdown threshold than their bulk equivalent. The last two observations can be understood if the carrier generation in monolayers is intrinsically enhanced due to its 2D nature. Finally, we demonstrate laser patterning of array of holes and lines in hBN with sub-wavelength feature sizes. Our work advances the fundamental knowledge of light-hBN interaction in the strong field regime and firmly establishes femtosecond lasers as novel and promising tools for resist-free patterning of hBN monolayers with high fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The family of 2D ferromagnets is in the center of research for novel spintronics applications. Among the various 2D ferromagnets, Fe 3 GeTe 2 has drawn significant attention since it combines a high Curie temperature with a van der Waals structure, which allows easy exfoliation, and a high spin polarization/large spin–orbit coupling. The presence of interfacial DMI in 2D ferromagnets have a significant impact on the behavior of magnetic domain walls, which are fundamental in magnetic memory and logic devices. By controlling the interfacial DMI, it is possible to manipulate the motion of domain walls and the magnetic domain configuration, which is essential for the development of efficient and reliable magnetic devices. In this study, we investigate the effect of an, inversion symmetry breaking, oxidized layer on the magnetic domain structure of Fe 3 GeTe 2 flakes due to the emergence of interfacial DMI. By combining magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy images and micromagnetic simulations, we study the formation of a circular double wall (CDW) domain lattice in oxidized flakes under specific field cooling and magnetic field sweeping protocols. Their formation is attributed to a competition between the exchange interaction both symmetric and antisymmetric (associated to interfacial DMI), magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the external magnetic field. The CDW domains have a diameter of several microns, a magnetic structure resembling that of a skyrmionium and are arranged in regular lattice that survives thermal fluctuations close to T c . Our results suggest that these CDW domains transition to Néel type skyrmions after a magnetic field threshold. These findings could have important implications for the design and optimization of 2D ferromagnetic materials for spintronic applications.",

This work presents a detailed spectroscopic study of α -MoCl 3 , 2D van der Waals material with covalently bonded Mo 2 dimers, with a particular focus on the Mo–Mo bonding. Raman spectra of α -MoCl 3 were studied with multiple excitation laser lines chosen in different parts of the absorption spectrum, while polarization measurements aided in the symmetry assignment of the observed modes. Furthermore, far-IR measurements and (Density Functional Theory) DFT phonon computations were performed to complete vibrational assignment. Polarized absorption, PL, and photoelectron spectroscopy supported by DFT calculations were employed to understand the consequences of the Mo–Mo bonding for the electronic structure and the localization/delocalization balance in d 3 –d 3 interactions. A coupling of dimerization-related structural and electronic properties was revealed in the strong resonance Raman enhancement of the Mo–Mo stretching mode at 153 cm −1 when the excitation laser matched the electronic transition between σ -bonding and antibonding orbitals of the Mo 2 dimer ( σ → σ *). The deeper understanding of the metal–metal bonding and identification of the vibrational and electronic spectroscopic signatures of the dimerization will be of great use for the studies of electron delocalization in magnetic van der Waals materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Silicon dioxide’s potential for having magnetic properties is fascinating, as combining its electronic capabilities with magnetic response seems promising for spintronics. In this work, the mechanisms that drive the change from diamagnetic behavior in pure silicates like SiO 2 to paramagnetic behavior in transition metal-doped silicates like Rhodonite silicate (CaMn 3 Mn(Si 5 O 15 )) are explored. This naturally occurring Rhodonite (R)-silicate was thinned down while retaining its magnetic properties by liquid-phase scalable exfoliation. Exfoliating R-silicate into the two-dimensional (2D) structure by LPE increases magnetic coercivity, and the internal resistance to demagnetization (ΔHc) up to ∼23.95 Oe compared to 7.08 Oe for its bulk phase. DFT spin-polarized calculations corroborate those findings and explain that the origin of the magnetic moment comes mainly from the Mn in the doped 2D silicate due to the asymmetrical components of the Mn d and Si p states in the valence band. This result is further illustrated by the spin component differential charge densities showing that Mn and Si atoms display a residual up spin charge. Rhodonite’s unusual magnetic behavior has considerable potential for spintronics, data storage, and sensing technologies. Understanding the complex relationships between the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of silicates is essential for developing new materials and composites as well as for driving future research.",

Moreover, the C60 molecules are adsorbed without major crystallographic and charge modifications at the interface between germanene and the Al(1 1 1) substrate. The predicted charge transfer from the Al(1 1 1) substrate to the C60 molecules is very small, which means that the germanene layer acts as an electronic buffer between the highly electron attractor C60 molecules and the large electron reservoir Al(1 1 1). This leaves the C60 layer quite uncharged, and so preserves its electron attractor properties for further layers grown on it, in the design of new molecular sensors.",

    "abstract": "The Kondo effect due to a magnetic atom adsorbed on graphene is investigated using two theoretical approaches, including the non-equilibrium Green's function method within the slave-boson mean-field approximation and a newly developed tight-binding (TB) model with an effectively infinite Hubbard U term. Both methods reveal the presence of a Kondo peak in the local density of state (LDOS) of graphene near the Fermi level. A sharp Kondo peak is only observed in the odd-neighboring C sites of the C atom directly below the magnetic atom placed in top position. The peak intensity is found to decay quickly with respect to the distance between the C site and the magnetic atom. A theoretical model of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) of graphene is presented as a means to identify the manifestation of the Kondo effect via direct topographic STM measurements. STM simulations show that in the proximity of the magnetic atom, only the C atoms of one sublattice are visible at low bias potential and thus a triangular lattice can be seen, in agreement with recent experiments. Further away from the magnetic atom, the Kondo effect dies down and eventually both sublattices are visible, leading to the recovery of the hexagonal lattice. This work not only provides a new TB method to study the Kondo effect in graphene, but also presents both scanning tunneling spectroscopy and microscopy fingerprints of the Kondo effect to facilitate its experimental verification.",

By a detailed scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study that combined with van der Waals heterostructure fabrications, we find the pseudospin degeneracy can be continually lifted that materialized as the gradual wavefunction polarization on the two sublattices by changing graphene's curvature through a bump. Strikingly, the sublattice polarization shows a linear dependence on the geometry of bumps, which enables to extract a pseudo-g-factor to characterize the pseudospin splitting and geometry.

    "abstract": "Abstract NaYF 4 is an efficient host material for lanthanide-based upconversion luminescence and has attracted immense interest for potential applications in photovoltaics, lasers and bioimaging. However, being a non-van der Waals (non-vdW) material, there have been thus far no reports on exfoliation of bulk NaYF 4 to nanosheets and their upconversion luminescence properties. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the fabrication of lanthanide-containing NaYF 4 2D nanosheets using a soft liquid-phase exfoliation method and report on their optical, electronic and chemical characteristics. The nanosheets exfoliated from NaYF 4 :Yb,Er microcrystals consisting mainly of β -NaYF 4 become enriched in α -NaYF 4 post exfoliation and have a large micron-sized planar area with a preferential (100) surface orientation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms that both Yb and Er doping ions are retained in the exfoliated nanosheets. Through centrifugation, NaYF 4 2D nanosheets are successfully obtained with thicknesses ranging from a monolayer to tens of layers. Optical analysis of individual nanosheets shows that they exhibit both optical down-conversion and upconversion properties, albeit with reduced emission intensities compared with the parent microparticles. Further exploration of their electronic structure by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the formation of surface F atom defects and a shrinkage of the electronic bandgap in ultrathin nanosheets. Our findings will trigger further interest in non-vdW 2D upconversion nanomaterials.",

In this work, we developed a pre-protection strategy by adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) as the protective agent into TiS 2 nanosheets aqueous dispersions. The introduction of EDTA-2Na can effectively slow down the adsorption and decomposition of confined water molecules and enhance the oxidation resistance of TiS 2 nanosheets in the colloidal solution. Compared with the untreated TiS 2 nanosheets, the storage time of the pre-protected nanosheets in aqueous dispersions can be significantly improved, and the electrical conductivity of prepared laminar films as thermoelectric materials also increased from 2.43 × 10 3 S m −1 to 1.51 × 10 4 S m −1 .

On bare Ru, a Stranski-Krastanov growth is observed, with first the formation of an atomically flat and monolayer-thick wetting layer, followed by the nucleation of three-dimensional islands. In sharp contrast, when Cu is deposited on a graphene-covered Ru surface under the very same conditions, Cu intercalates below graphene and grows in a step-flow manner: atomically-high growth fronts of intercalated Cu form at the graphene edges, and extend towards the center of the flakes.

GR was produced by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and the physical and chemical characteristics of the GR film, which was functionalized with HAp mineralization following ultraviolet-ozone (GR_UVO) treatment, were subsequently validated. Results of scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy showed GR_UVO for 5 min yielded applicable GR coverage (97.98 ± 0.85%), conversion of chemical composition ratio (29.78% C–O, 18.34% C=O and 8.49% O–C=O) and degree of oxidation, ( I 2D / I G ratios 2.22) with maximal density of HAp-GR layer. In vitro -cell proliferation, viability and adhesion of hASCs after being cultured on HAp-mineralized, GR-coated glass (HAp/GR) with the optimized GR_UVO treatment (5 min) demonstrated a significant increment of proliferation (1.56 ± 0.1 vs 1–1.13 ± 0.1, p &lt; 0.05) without changing in viability (94.83 ± 1% to 95.3 ± 1.6%, p = 0.9651) compared with the control (intact glass).

Osteogenic differentiation of hASCs was significantly improved on the HAp/GR with increasing of osteogenesis-related genes ( Runx2 and Osteocalcin ). The hASCs culture with the HAp/GR glass promoted phospho-SMAD1/5/9 and SMAD4 expression with increased patterns of BMP/Smad signal-related genes, regardless of differentiation induction or not. These results demonstrated that HAp-mineralized GR film prepared by CVD method and optimal ultraviolet treatment promoted osteogenic differentiation of hASCs, which BMP/Smad signaling was involved.",

    "abstract": "Graphene-based moir\\'{e} systems have attracted considerable interest in recent years as they display a remarkable variety of correlated phenomena. Besides insulating and superconducting phases in the vicinity of integer fillings of the moir\\'{e} unit cell, there is growing evidence for electronic nematic order both in twisted bilayer graphene and twisted double-bilayer graphene (tDBG), as signaled by the spontaneous breaking of the threefold rotational symmetry of the moir\\'{e} superlattices. Here, we combine symmetry-based analysis with a microscopic continuum model to investigate the structure of the nematic phase of tDBG and its experimental manifestations. First, we perform a detailed comparison between the theoretically calculated local density of states and recent scanning tunneling microscopy data [arXiv:2009.11645] to resolve the internal structure of the nematic order parameter in terms of the layer, sublattice, spin, and valley degrees of freedom. We find strong evidence that the dominant contribution to the nematic order parameter comes from states at the moir\\'{e} scale rather than at the microscopic scale of the individual graphene layers, which demonstrates the key role played by the moir\\'e degrees of freedom and confirms the correlated nature of the nematic phase in tDBG. Secondly, our analysis reveals an unprecedented tunability of the orientation of the nematic director in tDBG by an externally applied electric field, allowing the director to rotate away from high-symmetry crystalline directions. We compute the expected fingerprints of this rotation in both STM and transport experiments, providing feasible ways to probe it. Rooted in the strong sensitivity of the flat bands of tDBG to the displacement field, this effect opens an interesting route to the electrostatic control of electronic nematicity in moir\\'{e} systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We report a deterministic 2D material (2DM) transfer method to assemble any-stacking-order heterostructures incorporating suspended ultra-thin 2DMs, such as single-layer graphene (SLG) and bilayer graphene (BLG). The transfer procedure relies on a single-step preparation nitrocellulose micro-stamp, which combines both outstanding adhesion and softness. It permits the dry pick-up of naked 2D crystals (graphene, MoS 2 , and hBN) directly from a SiO 2 substrate, and to precisely transfer them on substrates or trenches. Optical and Raman data show that no significant defect is introduced upon transfer, even in suspended SLG and BLG. The areas transferred range up ∼1000 µ m 2 on substrate. High-yield transfer of suspended ultra-thin 2DMs does not require critical point drying for areas up to 15 µ m 2 or suspension heights down to 160 nm. To demonstrate the method’s capabilities, we assembled on-substrate and suspended optical cavities tuning BLG’s Raman scattering intensity by factors of 19 and 4, respectively. This resilient and rapid 2DM transfer procedure will accelerate the fabrication of many heterostructures and permit versatile suspension of 2DMs for research in twistronics, straintronics, and nano-opto-electro-mechanical systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The implementation of graphene in nanoelectromechanical systems and electronic applications requires not only techniques to fabricate high-quality monolayers, but also methods to process these layers. Nondestructive processing is especially challenging in the case of fragile suspended graphene membranes. In this work, we present a direct writing method for graphene grown on germanium that yields suspended layers without the need to transfer the graphene layer. To this end, we employ laser-induced photoelectrochemical etching which is highly selective and dissolves only germanium leaving the graphene layer intact. Only a focused continuous wave laser beam and water (or an aqueous solution) are required for the etching to proceed. Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed in-situ to monitor the etching process. These measurements reveal a dramatic increase of the graphene-related Raman bands as the graphene layer detaches from the substrate. This substantial increase indicates that the commonly observed weak Raman signal for graphene on germanium is not an inherent material property but is due to the interaction of the germanium substrate with graphene. Together with the established graphene growth on germanium, the presented direct writing method builds a complete toolbox for graphene membrane-based applications.",

In this way we obtain chemically consistent two-dimensional quasicrystal approximants of both barium and titanium oxides. In the proposed structures, the metallic sites occupy the vertices of the aperiodic square-triangle tiling, while the oxygen atoms decorate the interior of the polygons.

The fold gives rise to a local minimum in conductance which does not shift with applied perpendicular magnetic field. Regardless of twist angle the fold favors electron doping attributed to compressive strain at the kink geometry. The curvature of the folded structure provides for a systematic explanation, which is also in agreement with the observed correlation between twist angle and interlayer distance.

The extend to which these modes are coupled depends on the TMD composition and structure, but also on the plasmons’ properties. By performing realistic simulations that account for the contribution of each layer of the vdWh separately, we calculate how the strength of plasmon-phonon coupling depends on the number and composition of TMD layers, on the graphene Fermi energy and the specific phonon mode. From this, we present a semiclassical theory that is capable of capturing all relevant characteristics of the SPPPs. We find that it is possible to realize both strong and ultra-strong coupling regimes by tuning graphene’s Fermi energy and changing TMD layer number.",

In this regard, the combination of monolayer and multilayer properties in one device (on a single flake) is an important and fruitful task that needs to be solved. In this work, we demonstrate the use of local anodic oxidation to improve the optical properties of multilayer MoSe 2 flakes on a gold-covered substrate. Using this method, we fabricated nanostructures demonstrating extraordinarily enhanced photoluminescence (PL), with an intensity up to three orders of magnitude compared to that of the original structure. Low-frequency Raman spectroscopy showed that the nature of this PL enhancement is that the bindings between the layers inside the nanostructures are severely disrupted. This means that the nanostructures consist of quasi-monolayers, which is in good agreement with the intensity and the position of PL peak. Here, we also propose a mechanism of forming these quasi-monolayers. Therefore, this method allows using multilayer TMDC flakes on a conductive substrate to fabricate areas with quasi-monolayer optical properties, exhibiting an enhanced PL intensity.",

Van der Waals (vdW) layered magnetic materials may provide an essential platform for deeply understanding the detailed mechanism of the EB owing to its ideal interface structure. Here we first observed the positive exchange-biased anomalous Hall effect with a hopping switching behavior in the FeGeTe vdW nano-flakes. After systemically studying the cooling field dependence properties of the EB effect, we propose that the coexistence of stable and frustrated surface magnetization of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase will modify the total interface coupling energy density between the ferromagnetic and AFM phases. This model could provide a consistent description for such unusual EB effect based on microspin simulation.",

Here, we propose a novel GNR device concept, enabling the control of both charge and spin signals, integrated within the simplest three-terminal device configuration. In a conventional FET device, a gate electrode is employed to tune the Fermi level of the system in and out of a static bandgap. By contrast, in the switching mechanism proposed here, the applied gate voltage can dynamically open and close an interaction gap, with only a minor shift of the Fermi level. Furthermore, the strong interplay of the band structure and edge spin configuration in zigzag ribbons enables such transistors to carry spin polarized current without employing an external magnetic field or ferromagnetic contacts. Using an experimentally validated theoretical model, we show that such transistors can switch at low voltages and high speed, and the spin polarization of the current can be tuned from 0% to 50% by using the same back gate electrode. Furthermore, such devices are expected to be robust against edge irregularities and can operate at room temperature. Controlling both charge and spin signal within the simplest FET device configuration could open up new routes in data processing with graphene based devices.",

The PVE has maximal efficiency for TIs with high occupation of the upper Dirac cone (DC) states and the Dirac point located inside the fundamental energy gap. For TIs with low occupation of the upper DC states and the Dirac point located inside the valence band the generated surface photovoltage is significantly reduced. We have shown that the observed giant PVE is related to the laser-generated electron–hole asymmetry followed by accumulation of the photoexcited electrons at the surface. It is accompanied by the 2D relaxation process with the generation of zero-bias spin-polarized currents flowing along the topological surface states (TSSs) outside the laser beam spot. As a result, the spin-polarized current generates an effective in-plane magnetic field that is experimentally confirmed by the kII-shift of the DC relative to the bottom non-spin-polarized conduction band states. The realized 2D PVE can be considered as a source for the generation of zero-bias surface spin-polarized currents and the laser-induced local surface magnetization developed in such kind 2D TSS materials.",

By simultaneously supplying a Se flux from a Knudsen cell and Pt atoms from an electron-beam evaporator, crystalline (001)-oriented PtSe 2 films were formed between 200 °C and 300 °C. The long separation between substrate and electron beam evaporator of about 60 cm ensured minimal thermal load. At optimum deposition temperatures, a ten times or even higher supply rate of Se compared to Pt ensured that the pronounced volatility of the Se was compensated and the PtSe 2 phase was formed and stabilized at the growth front. Postgrowth anneals under a Se flux was found to dramatically improve the crystalline quality of the films. Even before the postgrowth anneal in Se, the crystallinity of PtSe 2 films grown with the co-deposition method was superior to films realized by thermal assisted conversion. Postgrowth annealed films showed Raman modes with narrower peaks and more than twice the intensity. Transmission electron microscopy investigations revealed that the deposited material transitioned to a two-dimensional layered structure only after the postgrowth anneal. PtSe 2 growth was found to start as single layer islands that preferentially nucleated at atomic steps of the substrate and progressed in a layer-by-layer like fashion. A close to ideal wetting behavior resulted in coalesced PtSe 2 films after depositing about 1.5 PtSe 2 layers. Detailed Raman investigation of the observed PtSe 2 layer breathing modes of films grown under optimized co-deposition conditions revealed an interlayer coupling force constant of 5.0–5.6 × 10 19 N m −3 .",

Optical transmittance measurements on monolayers that are directly synthesized on sapphire substrates reveal that the transmittance, as well as the real and imaginary parts of the optical dielectric constants of Janus SMoSe obtained from the Kramers–Kronig constrained analysis, show strong dependence on the polarization direction of the incident light. Meanwhile, the transmittance of the unpolarized light of Janus SMoSe becomes insensitive to light at incident angles up to 30°. The intrinsic dipoles induced by the structural asymmetry of Janus SMoSe are believed to produce these distinct optical properties. By estimating the optical absorption of the intrinsic dipoles and tracing their dependence on the light incident angles, we speculate that the dipoles are not perpendicularly aligned to the in-plane direction of the monolayer, but rather tilted by a small angle between 0° and 10°.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The demands of the energy storage market for better performing lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are enormous and ever-increasing. Following this trend, new electrode materials with higher energy and power densities should be developed to reach the electrode requirements of next-generation batteries. With this in mind, we present a novel composite (CrPSe 3 -G-MWCNT@NiB) that combines diverse characteristics of the excellent Li storage properties of 2D layered chromium selenophosphate (CrPSe 3 ), the high conductivity and specific surface area of carbon-based materials [graphite (G) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)], and the abundant coordinative unsaturated sites of Ni–B nanoflakes. The composites were synthesized via a process involving three stages: (a) a one-step high-temperature solid-phase 2D CrPSe 3 preparation, (b) high-energy ball milling integration with the carbon materials, and (c) a fast interface chemical reduction coating with the Ni–B nanoflakes. It is demonstrated that the optimized CrPSe 3 -G-MWCNT@NiB composites exhibit a remarkable electrochemical response in lithium half-cells, delivering around 657 mAh g −1 after 200 cycles, as well as a significantly longer cycle life, higher rate capability and lower charge/discharge polarization in comparison with the bulk CrPSe 3 . Galvanostatic studies also revealed that the CrPSe 3 -G-MWCNTs@NiB electrode displays a remarkable electrochemical property, which enable its application in lithium full cells, with a capacity of 123 mAh g cathode −1 after 40 cycles and a high Coulombic efficiency (over 99.1%). Thus, the integration of the carbon materials and Ni–B nanoflakes into the presented composite makes it a particularly promising candidate anode for use in high performance LIBs.",

The results show the disappearance of long-range atomic correlations, in both cases, confirming the production of single and few-layer graphene. In addition, a considerable ring distortion has been observed as compared to graphite, irrespective of the solvent used: the normal surface angle to the sheet of the powder sample should be less than 6°, compatible with ripples formation observed in suspended graphene.

    "abstract": "Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common type of cancer in men worldwide. Metabolic reprogramming is an important factor in its pathogenesis. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have tremendous potential for cancer treatment owing to their unique physicochemical properties. However, very few studies have focused on the metabolic reprogramming mechanisms of PCa using 2D nanomaterials. In this study, for the first time, 2D graphdiyne (GDY) was used as a template to immobilize copper (Cu) ions to form a novel nanocomposite (GDY–Cu). GDY provides a large π -conjugated architecture that spatiotemporally restricts Cu ions spatiotemporally to realize the functional moiety of Cu ions as tumor therapeutics. The GDY–Cu nanocomposite with a 2D morphological structure was characterized using a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy. The distribution of Cu loaded on the GDY was confirmed by high-resolution TEM with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analysis. In vitro and in vivo , GDY–Cu exhibits a good antitumor effect and is associated with specific metabolic reprogramming characteristics of PCa. In this study, the effect of GDY–Cu on the metabolic reprogramming of PCa cells was analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. Differences in metabolites in DU145 cells treated with GDY–Cu were analyzed by clustering and target analysis using bioinformatics methods. GDY–Cu inhibited the growth of PCa cells by decreasing the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA synthase, which inhibits the synthesis of related fatty acids and lipid metabolism. These results indicated that GDY–Cu inhibits the growth of PCa cells mainly via lipid metabolic pathways. At present, combinatory therapeutic modalities based on GDY and Cu are in their infancy. Further exploration is required to promote the development of 2D nanocomposite combinatory therapeutic modalities based on metabolic reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Designing 2D-materials that exhibit half-metallic properties is crucially important in spintronic devices that are used in low-power high-density logic circuits. The large pores in the C 2 N morphology can stably accommodate various configurations of transition-metal (TM) atoms that can lead to ferromagnetic (FMC) and anti-ferromagnetic coupling interactions among them, and thus paving the way for achieving half-metallic characteristics. In the present study, we use manganese ‘Mn’ as a promising catalyst and the spin-polarized density-functional theory to search for suitable configurations of metal atoms that yield half-metallicity. Test samples comprised of single-atom catalyst (SAC) and double-atom catalyst (DAC) of Mn embedded in a C 2 N sample of size 2 × 2 primitive cells as well as their combinations in neighboring large pores (i.e. SAC–SAC, SAC–DAC, and DAC–DAC). Tests were extended to screen many other TM catalysts and the results showed the existence of half metallicity in just five cases: (a) C 2 N:Mn (DAC, SAC–SAC, and SAC–DAC); (b) C 2 N:Fe (DAC); and (c) C 2 N:Ni (SAC–DAC). Our results further showed the origins of half-metallicity to be attributed to FMC interactions between the catalysts with the six mirror images, formed by the periodic-boundary conditions. The FMC interaction is found to have strength of about 20 meV and critical length scale up to about ∼21–29 Å, dependent on both the type of magnetic impurity and the synergetic effects. The potential relevance of half-metallicity to spintronic device application is discussed. Our theoretical results have been benchmarked to the available data in literature and they were found to be in good agreements.",

    "abstract": "Schottky-like barriers are an important limitation of the performance of single-layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) transistors; because of the small number of charge carriers in a 2D semiconductor, the screening of metal contacts is inefficient leading to large depletion zones and enhanced reduction of performance compared to conventional bulk Schottky Barriers. Here we demonstrate that lithographic pre-patterning of a growth substrate prior to chemical vapor deposition of a TMD film can shape the TMD material into nanoscale hybrid 2D/3D structures whose bulk-like (3D) portion can be used for metal contacts and efficient charge injection into the single-layer (2D) areas which serve as transistor channels with excellent mobilities and on-off ratios. We observe mobilities of nearly 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio >105 for bottom-gated devices (through 300 nm of oxide) at realistic operation temperatures near 100 °C using comparatively long channels (>5 microns) and absent other contact optimization. Our process involves lithographic patterning of a hafnium (IV) dioxide film onto the SiO2/Si substrate prior to TMD growth. Bulk-like 3D WSe2 is observed to grow at the location of the hafnia, while 2D single-layer material is grown in regions of bare SiO2. Systematic evaluation of transport data allows us to extract Schottky barrier heights and other fundamental properties of our hybrid devices.",

Here, a new layered compound RhI 3 is discovered to be an above-room-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor. This compound crystallizes in a monoclinic crystal system of space group C 2/ m , with the unit cell of a = 6.773(8) Å, b = 11.721(2) Å, c = 6.811(8) Å and β = 108.18(4) °. The structure consists of honeycomb rhodium layers separated by iodine–iodine van der Waals gap. Chemically stable RhI 3 possesses an optical bandgap of 1.17 eV. Its robust ferromagnetism with a T c of above 400 K, which is far higher than 61 K for the well-known CrI 3 and the highest among the bulk 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors. The robust intrinsic ferromagnetic response is attributed to the Rh 2+ and exchange interactions between I- p and Rh- d electrons induced by iodine vacancies. This work reveals that RhI 3 is a prime candidate for spintronic devices above room temperature and provides a strategy to obtain high temperature 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors by introducing vacancies.",

Here, we show that an osmotic pressure difference forms across a suspended graphene membrane as a response to a sucrose concentration difference, providing evidence for its semi-permeability. This osmotic pressure difference is detected via the deflection of the graphene membrane that is measured by atomic force microscopy. Using this technique, the time dependence of this deflection allows us to measure the water permeation rate of a single 3.4 µ m diameter graphene membrane. Its value is close to the expected value of a single nanopore in graphene. The method thus allows one to experimentally study the semi-permeability of graphene membranes at the microscale when the leakage rate is minuscule. It can therefore find use in the development of graphene membranes for filtration, and can enable sensors that measure the concentration and composition of solutions.",

Most applications demand that hydrogen adsorption and desorption can be controlled at room temperature. Here we report an element-specific study on the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, in a low coverage regime, of a quasi-free standing 2D heterostructure (h-BNG) in the form of coexisting lateral domains of isostructural hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and graphene (Gr) on Pt(111). At very low hydrogen coverage a selective and partial hydrogenation of the Gr domains is observed in h-BNG. At the same time no changes are detected in the h-BN domains, indicating a preferential hydrogenation of Gr rather than h-BN domains. At higher coverage, hydrogenation of both Gr and h-BN domains is detected. A thermally facile hydrogen release from h-BN domains near room temperature is observed. Furthermore, the hybrid h-BNG 2D heterostructure enables also a much easier H 2 thermal release from Gr domains when compared with a full Gr monolayer grown on the same Pt(111) substrate. These results suggest that the presence of coexisting hydrogenated h-BN domains could destabilize C–H bonds in Gr.",

Here, we analyze free-standing nanoribbons milled into single-layer graphene by focused ion beam processing. Using transmission electron microscopy, we show that the length L of the structures determines their morphology. Nanoribbons with L below 300 nm remain mainly flat, whereas longer ribbons exhibit uni-axial crumpling or spontaneous scrolling, a trend that is well reproduced by molecular dynamics simulations. We measure the strain of the ribbons as well as their crystallinity by recording nanometer-resolved convergent beam electron diffraction maps, and show that the beam tails of the focused ion beam cause significant amorphization of the structures adjacent to the cuts. The expansive or compressive strain in the structures remains below 4%. Our measurements provide experimental constraints for the stability of free-standing graphene structures with respect to their geometry, providing guidelines for future applications of patterned graphene.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) materials have become a new territory for exploring novel properties and functionalities because of their superior tunability. The unprecedented tunability of 2D materials is also accompanied by many and equally great challenges, as they are susceptible to defects and disorders. The presence of defects and disorders induces the inhomogeneity of electronic states, often making it difficult to directly probe the intrinsic properties of materials. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to improve the electronic homogeneity, for example, by reducing the density of defects and disorders in the materials and at the interface. However, little attention is paid to the disorders embedded in underlying substrates. Here we investigate how individual dopants in substrate interact with 2D materials and give rise to the electron–hole puddles by low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy. Specifically, we take the epitaxial bilayer graphene grown on nitrogen doped silicon carbide (SiC) substrates as a model system, which has played the essential roles in many applications and fundamental studies. The nitrogen dopants inside SiC substrate were imaged over the epitaxial graphene by STM for the first time. The charged nitrogen dopants from the substrate induce the electron-lack puddles in graphene with a diameter of ∼2 nm, via electrostatic Coulomb interaction. The Fermi level with respect to the Dirac point is modulated by the puddles with an amplitude of ∼40 meV, causing the electronic inhomogeneity of epitaxial graphene. Our findings on this prototype material are expected to facilitate the quality improvement of graphene and other 2D materials in general.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Proximity to heavy sp -elements is considered promising for reaching a band gap in graphene that could host quantum spin Hall states. The recent report of an induced spin-orbit gap of 0.2 eV in Pb-intercalated graphene detectable by spin-resolved photoemission has spurred renewed interest in such systems (Klimovskikh et al 2017 ACS Nano 11 , 368). In the case of Bi intercalation an even larger band gap of 0.4 eV has been observed but was assigned to the influence of a dislocation network (Warmuth et al 2016 Phys. Rev. B 93 , 165 437). Here, we study Bi intercalation under graphene on Ir(111) and report a nearly ideal graphene dispersion without band replicas and no indication of hybridization with the substrate. The band gap is small (0.19 eV) and can be tuned by ±25 meV through the Bi coverage. The Bi atomic density is higher than in the recent report. By spin-resolved photoemission we exclude induced spin-orbit interaction as origin of the gap. Quantitative agreement of a photoemission intensity analysis with the measured band gap suggests sublattice symmetry breaking as one of the possible band gap opening mechanisms. We test several Bi structures by density functional theory. Our results indicate the possibility that Bi intercalates in the phase of bismuthene forming a graphene-bismuthene van der Waals heterostructure.",

    "abstract": "The transformation of the stripe domain structure of spontaneously-formed epitaxial silicene on ZrB2 thin film into a single-domain driven by the adsorption of a fraction of a monolayer of silicon was used to investigate how dislocations react and eventually annihilate in a two-dimensional honeycomb structure. The in-situ real time STM monitoring of the evolution of the domain structure after Si deposition revealed the mechanisms leading to the nucleation of a single-domain island into a domain structure through a stepwise reaction of partial dislocations. After its nucleation, the single-domain island extends by the propagation of edge dislocations at its frontiers. The identification of this particular nucleation-propagation formation of dislocation-free silicene sheet provides insights into how crystallographic defects can be healed in two-dimensional materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we evaluate the variation of the work function of phosphorene during thermal oxidation at different temperatures. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy results show an N-shaped behaviour that is explained by the oxidation process and the dangling-to-interstitial conversion at elevated temperatures. The exfoliation degree and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm the formation of native oxides in the top-most layer that passivates the material. Ex-situ XPS reveals the full oxidation of monolayers at temperatures higher than 140 °C, but few-layer phosphorene withstands the thermal oxidation even up to 200 °C with slight modifications of the A 2 g / A 1 g and A 2 g / B 2g vibrational mode ratios and a weak fluorescence in the Raman spectra of the heat-treated samples.",
