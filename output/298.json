    "abstract": "There are few explicit discussions in nursing literature of how qualitative research can be made as rigorous as it is relevant to the perspective and goals of nursing. Four factors complicate the debate about the scientific merits of qualitative research: the varieties of qualitative methods, the lack of clear boundaries between quantitative and qualitative research, the tendency to evaluate qualitative research against conventional scientific criteria of rigor, and the artistic features of qualitative inquiry. A framework for understanding the similarities and differences in research approaches and a summary of strategies to achieve rigor in qualitative research are presented.",

    "abstract": "Changes in health and illness of individuals create a process of transition, and clients in transition tend to be more vulnerable to risks that may in turn affect their health. Uncovering these risks may be enhanced by understanding the transition process. As a central concept of nursing, transition has been analyzed, its components identified, and a framework to articulate and to reflect the relationship between these components has been defined. In this article, the previous conceptual analysis of transitions is extended and refined by drawing on the results of five different research studies that have examined transitions using an integrative approach to theory development. The emerging middle-range theory of transitions consists of types and patterns of transitions, properties of transition experiences, facilitating and inhibiting conditions, process indicators, outcome indicators, and nursing therapeutics. The diversity, complexity, and multiple dimensionality of transition experiences need to be further explored and incorporated in future research and nursing practice related to transitions.",

The data were composed of group interviews in which nurses gave narrative accounts of exemplars from their practice and close observations and intensive personal history interviews of a subsample of nurses. Two interrelated aspects were found to distinguish four levels of practice, from advanced beginner through expert. First, practitioners at different levels of skill literally live in different clinical worlds, noticing and responding to different directives for action. Second, a sense of agency is determined by one's clinical world and shows up as an expression of responsibility for what happens with the patient.",

Also, the manner in which self-care monitoring and self-care management are associated was thought to need refinement. As both of these issues relate to symptoms, we decided to enrich the Middle-Range Theory with knowledge from theories about symptoms. Here, we propose a revision to the Middle-Range Theory of Self-Care of Chronic Illness where symptoms are clearly integrated with the self-care behaviors of self-care maintenance, monitoring, and management.",

It utilizes conventional, phenomenologic, critical, and feminist pedagogies, along with postmodern discourses to revision nursing education. Narrative Pedagogy emanates out of interpretive phenomenology. The Concernful Practices of Schooling Learning Teaching are common experiences that belong together and co-occur and provide a new language for students and teachers. They will be explicated in the context of three narratives. Narrative Pedagogy is described as a research-based, innovative alternative for reforming nursing education.",

In this article we explicate the theoretical and methodological issues that came to the forefront in our attempts to use this concept in our research with different populations in Canada. We argue that this concept prompts us to \"think critically\" about ourselves and our patients, and to be mindful of our own sociocultural, economic, and historical location. This critical reflection has implications for how we live, relate to one another, and practice in our various professional disciplines. On the basis of our findings, we discuss how the concept might be rewritten within a critical postcolonial and postnational feminist discourse.",

The theory described in this article explains the mechanisms through which suffering affects an individual's sense of community and connectedness with others. The intricate patterns are explained to provide a basis for prescriptive nursing to prevent or reverse this loss of connectedness. First, the article develops the concept of suffering and its influences on relationship with the self and with others and the relationship of others with the sufferer. Then, the concept of alienation is developed in this context, its philosophical roots explored, and a continuum described that encompasses alienation through connectedness. Related concepts of separation, shame, and stigma are briefly described as partial cases of alienation of the sufferer that also show the pervasiveness of the phenomenon. Next, the personal characteristics of an individual who might help are developed through the concept of wisdom. Last, an explanation is given as to why care is the contextual framework through which alienation is reversed and connectedness achieved. Although suffering, alienation, and care have gone by many names, the essences of these phenomena have been recurrent theme in descriptions of human response.",

Our review proposes explanations for repeated failures to find reliably superior performance for nurses with longer professional experience.

The development of a knowledgebase for culturally competent care is constrained by substantive and methological issues, such as the limited view of culture as a unit analysis and limitations in designs and methods that could capture the intergrative nature of participants' experiences. Therefore, I propose that components of foundational knowledge in nursing may include, but should not be limited to, populations and their cultures; culture-specific nursing phenomena; and responses to diversity, marginalization, vulnerability, and transitions. To develop culturally competent knowledge, researchers, theoreticians, and reviewers are urged to address eight criteria to ensure rigor and credibility in scholarship: contextuality, relevance, communication styles awareness of identity and power differentials, disclosure, reciprocation, empowerment, and time.",

Drawing on a qualitative ethnographic approach within an overarching collaborative framework, we sought to gain an understanding of what constitutes culturally safe care for people who use(d) illicit drugs. The findings illustrate that illicit substance use in hospitals is often negatively constructed as (1) an individual failing, (2) a criminal activity, and (3) a disease of \"addiction\" with negative impacts on access to care, management of pain, and provision of harm-reduction supplies and services. These constructions of illicit substance use impact patients' feelings of safety in hospital and nurses' capacity to provide culturally safe care. On the basis of these findings, we provide recommendations and guidance for the development of culturally safe nursing practice.",

These include 7 attributes necessary for effective implementation. Implementation of CPGs in health care settings requires an ongoing iterative process that considers these attributes and is inclusive to administrators, clinicians, and patients to ensure guidelines are understood, accepted, implemented, and evaluated for continued adoption of best practices. Ongoing efforts inclusive at all steps of implementation across multiple levels are needed to effectively change practice.",

Extending primarily from the Illness Constellation Model and Preserving Self, a five-stage model, Responding to Threats to Integrity of the Self, was developed. The theory focuses on the individual (and to a lesser degree on the individual's family) and how the individual seeks self-comforting strategies to mediate the experience.

Shifting boundaries in caring work leads to changes in nurse-family caregiver relationships, which can be categorized as four distinct, yet interconnected, types: (1) nurse-helper, (2) worker-worker, (3) manager-worker, and (4) nurse-patient.

It favors a process, or way of being, that challenges modernist conventions and highlights the power of relationships. By reaffirming the nature of nursing's work as relationship-centered, the blended model describes the 2 dominant relationships that comprise professional encounters. Relationships characterized by caring are theorized to influence positive outcomes for patients/families, health care providers, and health care systems. Model components are clarified, assumptions described, and propositions stated. Conceptual–theoretical linkages in the model are identified and ties to empirical indicators provide the logical consistency necessary for validation. Clinical practice and research applications of the model are offered. The Quality-Caring Model© helps to translate the hidden work of nursing into objective terms that can be tested. Scientifically demonstrating its worth will advance professional nursing while simultaneously improving the quality of health care.",

    "abstract": "One result of the historical division of labor between nurses and physicians is that nurses became the eyes and ears of the physician, extending their perceptual capabilities across space and time. This \"gaze of medicine\" has evolved with the rise of technology, hospitals, and the medical profession to a sort of scientific totalitarianism. Protecting and enhancing patient agency, which is part of the moral work of nursing practice, can be difficult under such circumstances. Yet the geography of sickness is changing as patients move from the hospital back to the home. Because home is thought of as private, as the patient's domain, nurses may think that supporting patient agency will be easier with this transformation of health care. But that assumption may not be warranted since the gaze of medicine will follow patients and change the landscape of the home. The challenge for nursing will be to sharpen the \"gaze of nursing,\" which is an antidote to the strictly biomedical understanding of disease.",

An interpretive phenomenological design was used to obtain and analyze interviews of 13 obese individuals and 5 of their family members. A convenience sample was used to recruit the subjects who participated in the audiotaped interviews. The interviews used open-ended questions. Audiotapes were transcribed and analyzed for identifying the major themes within each transcript, and patterns of meaning across narratives. The major themes and patterns were described through written essays and group discussions about the transcripts. The participants revealed frequent experiences of stigmatization and discrimination on the basis of their obesity. Those who are obese are reminded through their everyday encounters with family members, peers, healthcare providers, and strangers, that their being deviates from social norms, and that they are inferior to those who are not obese. Obese subjects experience a pattern of denigration and condemnation that is so pervasive as to constitute what Harvey has called civilized oppression. A discussion of the social construction of obesity and the elements of civilized oppression, as they are experienced by those who are obese, offers new insights into interpersonal relationships that can provide a foundation for more effective care of the obese population.",

Increasing evidence supports the link between broad societal influences on health inequities. Relative and absolute poverty are significant influences on health and contribute significantly to differential health statuses of populations within and between countries. Nurses, who practice at the intersection of public policy and personal lives, are, therefore, ideally situated and morally obligated to include political advocacy and efforts to influence health public policy in their practice.

We present a society-to-cells nursing theory that formalizes and extends this holistic view of patients by delineating factors that contribute to resilience potential based on the society, community, and family environment in which people live, as well as individual variables that influence psychological, physiological, and cellular coping abilities. We also summarize how this perspective is essential to optimize patient care and to inform future nursing research.",

    "abstract": "Aim To outline the main tenets of critical realism (CR), its use, and future application in nursing. Background Little work has been done to discuss how CR can be applied to nursing research. Findings The tenets of CR include recognition of reality independent of human perceptions, a generative view of causation in open systems, and a focus on explanations and methodological eclecticism using a postdisciplinary approach. Critical realism is useful for (1) understanding complex outcomes, (2) optimizing interventions, and (3) researching biopsychosocial pathways. Such questions are central to evidence-based practice, chronic disease management, and population health. Conclusions Critical realism is philosophically strong and potentially useful for nursing research.",

Several of the most commonly held misconceptions in nursing, particularly those related to the meanings and derivations ascribed to \"grounded theory,\" \"symbolic interactionism,\" and \"ethnography,\" are examined. The interpretive research approaches not only have gained broader acceptance across disciplines, but also have shifted in more radical and often less structured directions during the past decade. Several pivotal areas of these ongoing shifts are analyzed for their relevance to nursing research: the influence of critical and feminist theory and postmodernism, the ambiguity inherent in both everyday life and the research enterprise, the importance of locating the researcher, power and status inequities, the problematic aspects of language, meaning, and representation, and the emphasis on reflexivity and context as constitutive of meaning.",

In-depth interviews with 9 self-identified Chinese nurses were conducted in English and transcribed verbatim. Using Colaizzi's (In: Valle RS, King M, eds. Existential-Phenomenological Alternatives for Psychology. New York: Oxford University Press; 1978:48–71) 7-step procedure, the narrative data were independently analyzed by a team of researchers. Five primary themes emerged from the data: (a) communication as the most daunting challenge, especially during initial transition of their first job; (b) different and even conflicting professional values and roles/expectations of the nurse between the United States and China; (c) marginalization, inequality, and discrimination; (d) transformation through clinging to hope, (un)learning, and resilience; and (e) cultural dissonance. To a large extent, this study supported the findings in the general literature on international nurses, especially those from Asia. It also documented the uniqueness of this group of Chinese nurses, namely their ingenuity to turn challenges into opportunities, their high-level job satisfaction in spite of adversity, their desire for learning and execution of strategic plans for performance and career enhancement through further education, and their proactive measures to adapt to workplace demands. In addition, this study revealed both real and potential risks to patient safety and quality of care during the transition of these Chinese nurses. In light of these findings, implications for both practice and future research are elaborated, particularly in the context of the accreditation standards of healthcare organizations and national agenda for patient safety research.

We articulate the philosophical, theoretical, and empirical scaffolding required for equity-informed palliative care and draw on a current study to illustrate such an approach to the care of people who experience structural vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this article was to present a detailed analysis of the concept of cyberbullying. Research on the topic of cyberbullying is growing exponentially, but not all studies use the same definition to examine this concept. A concept analysis in the style of Walker and Avant was used to analyze cyberbullying. Literature was retrieved from the databases of CINAHL and PubMed between the years 2009 and October 2014 using the key word \"cyberbullying.\" Twenty-five English-language articles were located that delineated a definition of cyberbullying. First, articles were analyzed to discover the defining attributes of cyberbullying. Second, antecedents, consequences, and related terms of cyberbullying were examined. Third, an operational definition of cyberbullying is proposed on the basis of a consensus of the review. This review proposes that the defining attributes of cyberbullying are: (1) electronic form of contact (2) an aggressive act (3) intent (4) repetition (publicity), and (5) harm of the victim. The antecedents most often mentioned were lower self-esteem, higher levels of depression, and social isolation and the consequences were academic problems and affective disorders. A single concise definition of cyberbullying was created that can be utilized by health care providers to educate their patients and families about cyberbullying. This definition also can be used to guide research to develop effective interventions.",

    "abstract": "We wish to advance a theory of nursing that intentionally engages in questions of politics and economics, centering equity and justice as a foundation for the provision of nursing care. As health care costs rise and health disparities widen, nurses have a clear imperative to develop alternative health care delivery models unmoored from the conventional employment and profit-driven structures that now disappoint us. This mandate arises from our disciplinary focus that emphasizes social justice as a social and moral good linked to the human services nurses provide. This kind of sociopolitical engagement is not auxiliary to nursing but rather central to our ethos. A health care environment that prioritizes profit over the well-being of people is an anathema to our disciplinary focus which, we believe, should center communities and people. The health care system that has forged nursing in the United States, transforms nursing into a commodity. This reinscribes inequality for those who are unable to access care, contributes to environmental harm through profligate hospital pollution and waste, and exploits nursing staff as workers. Nurses have a history of both upholding oppressive systems that disenfranchise segments of the public, usually poor, often People of Color, and engaging in innovative alternatives to the status quo. We wish to foster revolutionary alternative care delivery models that free us from the neoliberal confines of for-profit health care. Ultimately, we argue, nursing as a discipline and a science cannot neglect our role as whistleblowers and change agents. Nor can we presuppose that our dysfunctional and harmful health care structure in the United States is a foregone conclusion. Health care is constructed, which means it can be reconstructed. If we wish to realize our emancipatory potential as nurses, critically examining our role in upholding oppressive structures is a critical step toward a more robust future of nursing.",

The proposed integrative approach to developing situation-specific theories includes (1) a nursing perspective, (2) a linkage among theory, research, and practice, and (3) a conceptual scheme based on internal and external dialogues.",

Strengths of these youth that contribute to their health and well-being are seldom acknowledged. The purpose of this secondary analysis of qualitative data was to identify strengths that protect homeless youth. Two types of strengths emerged: resources and self-improvement. Resources served as the foundation for survival whereas self-improvement served as a process that enabled youth to consider a more healthy future. By recognizing the many strengths of homeless youth, nurses may develop community-based programs to help this population reenter society.",

According to the model, the central goal of nursing is to maintain, strengthen, and develop the patient's health by actively engaging him or her in a learning process. Because health is a learned phenomenon and the family is considered the primary socializer in this learning, the family is the focus of nursing. The nurse strives to structure a learning environment that enables the patient to participate as fully as possible. The nurse and patient together set goals and, building on the patient's strengths and resources, devise means of achieving them.",

    "abstract": "The timing of the literature review in grounded theory has been debated for decades, with previous recommendations to delay the review now under question. Mounting evidence suggests that a preliminary review can enhance theoretical sensitivity and rigor and may lead to innovative insights. However, researchers must acknowledge the influence of prior knowledge during data analysis and theory development to avoid bias. This article critically examines the ongoing debate and recommends that we should not seek to avoid preconceptions but ensure that they are well grounded in evidence and always subject to further investigation, revision, and refutation. If used reflexively, a preliminary literature review may well enhance grounded theory research.",

Appreciating is actualized through a praxis approach used for research and practice--unitary pattern appreciation--created to bring the theoretical principles of unitary science into practical reality. It is essentially a praxis for exploration of the wholeness within human/environmental pattern. Healing is conceptualized as the realization, knowledge, and appreciation of the inherent wholeness in life that elucidates prospects of clarified understanding and opportunities for action. The essential features of the process of pattern appreciation are a synoptic stance toward pattern information, a participatory engagement with people in the exploration of wholeness, and the transformative nature of the process that illuminates the possibilities in wholeness. A case demonstrates the nature of the unitary pattern appreciation process and its healing qualities.",

An in terpretive analysis of \"Mike's story\" attempts to capture some of the fundamental assumptions of a relational ethic of care.

The examined discourse was that contained in the works of 41 nursing scholars published between 1860 and 1992. The analysis revealed five distinct conceptualizations that can be identified as the art of (1) grasping meaning in patient encounters, (2) establishing a meaningful connection with the patient, (3) skillfully performing nursing activities, (4) rationally determining an appropriate course of nursing action, and (5) morally conducting one's nursing practice.",

The argument is developed that, although the home care and self-care movements can be seen as directed toward providing more humanistic care and promoting the independence of the client, the economic and sociopolitical factors that influence their development should not be overlooked. Furthermore, the \"cost of caring\" must be reckoned with in both human and economic terms.

Drawing on deconstructive hermeneutics, we contend that to understand and affect the interconnection of theory, evidence, and practice, an ontological inquiry at the action level is required. Using a nursing practice example, we illustrate the complexities of knowledge translation and how effective integration of knowledge into practice involves an embodied process of ontological inquiry and action. This inquiry process draws on theory and evidence to enlarge and imagine possibilities for action in particular moments, situations, and contexts and rests in a way-of-being in which the interconnection of theory, evidence, and practice is embodied.",

Many of the conditions that affect access to healthcare, such as racism and oppression, also shape inequities in health outcomes. We propose a conceptualization of social justice that is consistent with addressing the conditions that influence health inequities. We also discuss the implications of a critical and feminist conception of social justice for nursing action, education, practice, research, and policy.",

Objections to the dominance of evidence-based practice are reviewed, and the reasons for it are examined. It is argued that it is partially the result of weaknesses in the alternative patterns of ethical, personal, and esthetic knowing, the ineffability of which compromises accountability. This ineffability can be countered only by introducing a wider form of empirics than countenanced by evidence-based practice into all patterns of knowing, to demonstrate their salience and to make their use in practice transparent.",

Thus, it is an important concept for upstream health promotion and culturally safe and relevant nursing care. Whilemany researchers acknowledge the importance of the social, cultural, and political context in the lives of newcomeryouths, little research has examined the sociopolitical processes inherent in immigrant and refugee youths'experiences of belonging. By employing an intersectional and postcolonial perspective, this study explored newcomeryouths' gendered, racialized, and class experiences of inclusion and exclusion that ultimately influencedtheir sense of belonging in their country of resettlement. Through an examination of online blogs in the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom, Australia, and secondary analyses of transcribed interviews from a previous studyconducted in Canada, experiences of belonging were revealed to be shaped by complex and multifaceted structures ofoppression. Through individual and collective efforts of resistance and resiliency, newcomer youths worked toconstruct a sense of belonging in their daily lives. Despite these participants' demonstrated strengths, itis evident that more work is needed to support newcomer youths' sense of belonging and well-being throughoutresettlement. Implications for nursing practice and research are discussed.",

Inequities in health within and across nations demand that nursing students examine the interconnectedness between local and global health challenges and contribute to the development and implementation of solutions to these challenges. In this article, we examine concepts related to global citizenship, globalization, social responsibility, and professionalism and link them to curricular innovation in nursing education. We argue that the development of global citizenship is a fundamental goal for all nursing students and that to achieve this, nurse educators must move beyond the creation of international placement opportunities or the use of global examples within existing courses. Nurse educators must develop strategies and design innovative curricula to provide opportunities for all students to become engaged with the concept of global citizenship and the role of nurses in a global world.

The classic steps described by Walker and Avant are used for the analysis. Literature from several disciplines is reviewed including vocational psychology, Christian career counseling, sociology, organizational management, and nursing. The analysis provides an operational definition of a calling to nursing and establishes 3 defining attributes of the concept: ( a ) a passionate intrinsic motivation or desire (perhaps with a religious component), ( b ) an aspiration to engage in nursing practice, as a means of fulfilling one's purpose in life, and ( c ) the desire to help others as one's purpose in life. Antecedents to the concept are personal introspection and cognitive awareness. Positive consequences to the concept are improved work meaningfulness, work engagement, career commitment, personal well-being, and satisfaction. Negative consequences of having a calling might include willingness to sacrifice well-being for work and problems with work-life balance. Following the concept analysis, philosophical assumptions, contextual factors, interdisciplinary work, research opportunities, and practice implications are discussed.",

Parents of children aged 9 to 13 years participated in focus groups held in rural community contexts. Religiosity (ie, participation in religious social structures) was a recurring and important theme when discussing HPV vaccination. Spirituality (ie, subjective commitment to spiritual or religious beliefs) was found to influence the ways in which parents perceived their control over and coping with health issues potentially related to HPV vaccination.

In addressing racism, however, health care has primarily focused on interpersonal racism rather than institutionalized forms of racism that are deeply entrenched and contribute to racial inequities in health. In order to meaningfully address health inequities, health care must extend its focus beyond the interpersonal level. The purpose of this integrative literature review is to identify how and to what extent peer-reviewed nursing literature and professional nursing organizations have explicitly addressed institutionalized racism. A systematic search of relevant nursing literature published since 2008 yielded 29 journal articles that focused on black Americans' experience of institutionalized racism in health and health care; the articles explicitly named racism as institutionalized, institutional, systemic, systematic, or structural. This review summarizes author-identified implications of institutionalized racism for nursing education, research, and practice, and offers suggestions for use by the nursing profession to dismantle racist policies, practices, and structures.",

    "abstract": "The Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms was developed to enhance understanding of relationships among multiple symptoms and symptom experiences. Although the theory has been used to guide research, no formal critique of the theory has been published since 2000. This article comprehensively analyzes and evaluates the theory using Fawcett and DeSanto-Madeya's framework. Although its semantic clarity, semantic and structural consistency, and parsimony could be improved, the theory demonstrates good social and theoretical significance, testability, and empirical and pragmatic adequacy. Understanding multiple patient symptoms is essential, and the theory demonstrates that nurses should focus on multiple rather than individual symptoms.",

Nine of the 12 studies testing interventions to decrease mothers' stress related to their NICU experiences reported significant results. Content analysis of the qualitative studies' findings revealed 5 themes: stark contrast to images of joyous motherhood, cultural overlay, issues of ownership and control, support, and learning to be a NICU mother.",

This construct is analogous to the belief that nursing theory and nursing practice should be incorporated, and both should reflect a common central phenomenon. The pursuit of nursing knowledge by women of \"thought\" is not viewed as a central phenomenon but is an outcome of scholarly inquiry. Outcomes pursued by practicing nurses, women of \"action,\" depend on their particular role and scope of practice. A number of outcomes are possible ranging from prevention, public health and policy, alleviation of pain and suffering, and individual health promotion and healing to palliative care. These outcomes are not viewed as the source of unity to guide nursing since they may vary, especially with developments in science, technology, and philosophy. A more unifying central phenomenon could be viewed as the respect for, or the restoration of, human dignity, our being in community, our being in the world, and our sea of a moral imperative. Consilience, a way to unify the knowledge that is needed to support this phenomenon, is suggested as an example of an approach to a philosophy of nursing that embraces multiple forms and sources of knowledge in all-encompassing morality that ultimately ennobles the lives of all human beings in covenantal relationships with nurses both in theory and in practice.",

In response to the strong reaction to articles, which critically examined the evidence-based movement in health sciences, we believe that it is essential to offer a perspective that is capable of resisting the progress of such discourses, which currently prevail in nursing and thus shape our profession. We believe that the biomedical model/ideology is a form of colonial patronage that is becoming more and more influential in nursing. Such colonization takes the forms of powerful discourses (eg, evidence-based medicine) and institutional practices that pervade all spheres of nursing: practice, research, education, and administration. In previous articles, we have criticized this trend; consequently, the objective of this article is not to replicate our previous arguments but rather to demonstrate that to what extent a postcolonial approach to nursing constitutes an efficient tool for disrupting the colonizing effects of the biomedical discourse.",

Nursing assessments and interventions situated within the Roy Adaptation Model take into consideration how weight restoration does not occur in isolation but rather reflects an adaptive process within external and internal environments, and has the potential for more holistic care.",

    "abstract": "This study examined patterns, variations, and existential turning points in young mothers' narratives of self and their visions of the future as part of a larger hermeneutic, longitudinal study. The study was philosophically based in the phenomenology of everyday practices as inherently meaningful, situated, and historically derived and drew on dialogical views of the self. The sample consisted of 13 (of the original 16) young mothers and family members who had been interviewed 4 years earlier. For the present study, data consisted of life history accounts of the intervening 4 years, stories of caregiving routines, and recent coping episodes of parenting elicited through in-depth interviews. Findings offer a situated understanding of young mothering and highlight meaningful distinctions in the ways young mothers experience the self and project themselves into the future. The discovery of patterns and variations in the young mother's sense of self and future have implications for guiding clinical practice and are preliminary to designing programs and interventions that are tailored to the practical understanding and situated possibilities of young mothers.The prevailing view that an early pregnancy jeopardizes a young woman's emotional development disregards the social nature of the construction of self and others. Although parenting can be a stressful life experience, it also has the potential to create new ways of coping and to contribute to a revised understanding of the self. For many impoverished African-American teens, with few opportunities to establish an identity through education or a career, motherhood provides the route to adulthood. The present study investigated patterns in young mothers' narratives of self and their visions of the future. In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 US adolescent mothers 4 years after the birth of their first child at an average age of 15.6 years. In the majority of cases, mothering was described as a generally positive experience that engendered a sense of responsibility and supplied a social identity consistent with family and cultural meanings of becoming a woman. The mothers' efforts to become a responsible parent tended to transform their sense of identity and provide a sense of future possibility not previously available. Those who lived in conditions of extreme poverty and danger, without social support, were less able to turn motherhood into an opportunity for reconstruction of the self. Instead, mothering diminished the self and exacerbated feelings of powerlessness, frustration, and conflict. These findings suggest that motherhood is adversely affected by the conditions associated with poverty rather than maternal age per se. Needed, to improve the outcomes of adolescent pregnancy, are interventions that focus on ethical and political questions rather than technical issues.",

At the same time, many educators, researchers, foundations, and government officials are touting the benefits of service learning. In particular, service learning offers ways to enhance partnerships between academia and community agencies and to extend learning beyond the traditional classroom. We present a model for educating nurses as advanced practice nurses in health policy that links service learning with a framework for the political development of nurses. Under the rubric of service learning, the curriculum is based on the overlap among health policy, the role of the nurse as consultant, and community-based care. After discussing the importance of health policy for graduate nursing education and reviewing the essentials of service learning, we describe a three-semester graduate sequence in health policy service learning. The focus is on the clinical and classroom components of both individual and group practica and their relationship to stages of nursing's political development.

    "abstract": "The number of incarcerated persons in the United States has been increasing dramatically over the last two decades. Incarcerated men and women have increased rates of serious and chronic physical and mental illnesses and therefore require substantial health care efforts. Caring for prisoners is a difficult and often unrewarding experience for health care providers, particularly within a social climate that encourages noncaring behaviors. This article critically analyzes three philosophic stances toward nursing care with prisoners and suggests their philosophic commensurability within traditional nursing practice. Implications for nursing practice, research, and education are discussed.",

    "abstract": "As the World Wide Web has become more prominent as a mode of communication, it has opened up new possibilities for research data collection. This article identifies measurement issues that occur with Internet data collection that are relevant to qualitative and quantitative research approaches as they occurred in a triangulated Internet study of perimenopausal women with migraine headaches. Issues associated with quantitative data collection over the Internet include (a) selecting and designing Internet data collection protocols that adequately address study aims while also taking advantage of the Internet, (b) ensuring the reliability and validity of Internet data collected, (c) adapting quantitative paper-and-pencil data collection protocols for the Internet, (d) making Internet data collection practical for respondents and researchers, and (e) ensuring the quality of quantitative data collected. Qualitative data collection over the Internet needs to remain true to the philosophical stance of the qualitative approach selected. Researcher expertise in qualitative data collection must be combined with expertise in computer technology and information services if data are to be of ultimate quality. The advantages and limitations of collecting qualitative data in real time or at a later time are explored, as well as approaches to enhance qualitative data collection over the Internet. It was concluded that like any research approach or method, Internet data collection requires considerable creativity, expertise, and planning to take advantage of the technology for the collection of reliable and valid research data.",

In part, this is due to prevailing Western ideology that constructs children as passive, presocial, innocent, and vulnerable. The dominant discourse is further characterized by the treatment of children as a homogeneous group, devoid of race, class, or gender. While many investigators have described strategies for the conduct of research that is situated in the interpretive paradigm, there has been no comparable articulation of ideas regarding the conduct of critically grounded research when our participants are children. The purpose of this article is to put forth a historical and contextual analysis of childhood, including a discussion of evolving perspectives about childhood. The manner by which changing social, political, and environmental landscapes have contributed to the marginalization and disenfranchisement of children is examined. Finally, strategies for conducting nursing research that is grounded in the critical paradigmatic perspective, with the simultaneous aims of action, change, and empowerment, are proposed.",

Unitary appreciative inquiry provides a way of giving fullest attention to important facets of human life that often are not fully accounted for in current methods that have a heavier emphasis on diagnostic representations. The participatory, synoptic, and transformative qualities of the unitary appreciative process are explicated. The critical dimensions of nursing knowledge development expressed in dialectics of the general and the particular, action and theory, stories and numbers, sense and soul, aesthetics and empirics, and interpretation and emancipation are considered in the context of the unitary appreciative stance. Issues of legitimacy of knowledge and credibility of research are posed and examined in the context of four quality standards that are deemed important to evaluate the worthiness of unitary appreciative inquiry for the advancement of nursing science and practice.",

Nurses who could most contribute to challenging social injustices that underpin health disparities are relegated to the margins of mainstream nursing by internal processes of discrimination.

Each dimension included multiple descriptors identified through content analysis of the women's verbatim responses. The women's images of health were consistent with Smith's and Laffrey's four conceptions, but the eudaemonistic category included multiple dimensions.

    "abstract": "In Brief Poor access to prenatal care for Aboriginal people is well documented, and is explicated as an unethical barrier to care resulting from colonial and neocolonial values, attitudes, and practices. A postcolonial standpoint, participatory research principles, and a case study design were used to investigate 2 Aboriginal organizations' experiences improving care for pregnant and parenting Aboriginal people. Data were collected through exploratory interviews and small-group discussions with purposefully selected community leaders, providers, and community members. The study found that safety in healthcare relationships and settings, and responsiveness to individuals' and families' unique experiences and capacities must be brought into the forefront of care. Results suggest that the intention of care must be situated within a broader view of colonizing relations to improve early access to, and relevance of, care during pregnancy and parenting for Aboriginal people.

In 1973 statistics listed homicide as the second leading cause of death for all women from 15 to 24 years of age. Homicide must therefore be regarded as a major health problem of women, a problem that needs further study. It can be viewed as a disease of society— and it needs to be analyzed in that context so that the direction that primary prevention should take can be identified.

Measurable differences in clinical status and functional ability were related to the duration that patients received home health care services until rehospitalization, with the likelihood of rehospitalization increasing proportionately to the magnitude of the differences. Social environmental factors contributed to rehospitalization (self-care deficit) through functional ability (self-care agency) by altering the balance between self-care demand (clinical status) and self-care agency.",

The web constricts through the partner's control as violence emerges or worsens with pregnancy. Young mothers become increasingly isolated, and live with the physical and psychological consequences of IPV. Trauma-informed nursing practice is needed to support teen mothers in violent intimate relationships to spin a new web.",

Nursing responded to the pandemic with heroic commitment and new politicization. But public engagement with systemic racism is forcing a reckoning in nursing. The profession has its own history of racism and of alliance with systems of state control with which to contend. In this article, we argue nursing must adopt an ethics of abolitionism to realize its goals for health and justice. Abolitionism theorizes that policing and prison systems, originating from systems of enslavement and colonial rule, continue to function as originally intended, causing racial oppression and violence. The harms of these systems will not be resolved through their reform but through creation of entirely new approaches to community support. Nursing as a collective can contribute to abolitionist projects through advocacy, practice, and research.",

Pragmatism emphasizes pluralism and diversity, and depends on an ethical base for determination of what is reasonable.

This article compares two conceptual approaches to inclusion: cultural responsiveness and resource provision. Several issues are raised as to why women and ethnic people of color are not involved in health intervention research. For each of these issues, an appraisal is made as to whether cultural responsiveness or resource provision would more successfully address the problem. It is concluded that cultural responsiveness facilitates participation in research but is not sufficient. An equally important, if not more important, approach may be the provision of resources to empower participants to address problems of access and burden.",

A step-by-step approach to the search for personal connections is presented, including an example of the process of facilitating this search. A table of guidelines that includes specific points for the act of bracketing as well as the content to be bracketed is intended as a tool for the development of phenomenological description.",

The data were derived from a national survey, conducted from 1984 to 1986, of 2,787 respondents using consolidated health services for high-risk youths. A broad range of health habits, risk behaviors, and social activities are examined, including leisure activities, social relations, sexual behavior, substance use behavior, violent social behavior, seat belt use, dental hygiene, sleep behavior, weight, and preventive medical care. Factor analysis and multidimensional scaling are used to determine the empirical patterns among these behaviors. The analyses show two major modes of behavior, health-promoting and health-compromising, while a third pattern can be interpreted as group or social activity. Implications of these life-style distinctions are discussed in relation to health promotion.",

Examination of the concept of caring resulted in the identification of five epistemological perspectives: caring as a human state, caring as a moral imperative or ideal, caring as an affect, caring as an interpersonal relationship, and caring as a nursing intervention. Two outcomes of caring were identified: caring as the subjective experience and as the physiologic responses in patients. The authors concluded that knowledge development related to caring in nursing is limited by the lack of refinement of caring theory, the lack of definitions of caring attributes, the neglect to examine caring from the dialectic perspective, and the focus of theorists and researchers on the nurse to the exclusion of the patient",

This was predicated in part on a review of social-support theoretic premises, other theories germane to social support, and existing conceptual frameworks for the nursing discipline. Sixteen assumptions were developed and the four components of nursing's metaparadigm were defined to reflect primary health care premises of professional partnership with laypersons. Twenty core concepts were derived from social-support supplementary theories. A connecting structure was developed through creation of 20 relationship statements and 2 figures.

Findings revealed 9 themes: universal hope, uncertain hope, hope as a turning point, the power of hope, boundless creative and flexible hope, enduring hope, despairing hope, body-related hope, and existential hope. The conceptual model was derived from these themes, illustrated as The Battle between Hoping and Suffering and The Road of Hope. The interpretations also revealed a distinction between being in hope and having hope, and having a hope of improvements was the main focus at the early stage of rehabilitation, whereas being in hope as being just fine was the main focus after 3 to 4 years of rehabilitation.",

Tuning into the general shift in thought about our human condition across disciplines and nations, we consider features of a participatory paradigm, which, when refocused on the humanness of the health circumstance, informs our approach to a practice discipline. Knowledge is personal and participatory, evolving in the here-and-now of health systems. Research integral to practice and service innovation illustrates the way of looking and talking about a new phase in discipline development. The discipline is relational and creative in practice, evolving in the forums for dialogue. Each one of us as nurses has responsibility in participation.",

Based on the concept synthesis, connectedness in community-dwelling older adults can be defined as engaging life by self-regulating, facing aging, being part of a family, having friends, and being spiritual.",

We draw on findings from Almutairi's doctoral research with health care providers in Saudi Arabia to argue for what he has identified as critical cultural competence for health care providers. In so doing, we explicate the complexity of cultural and linguistic issues and power relations induced by race, class, and gender that can contribute to vulnerabilities for health care providers and recipients alike.",

The TBI scale has strong internal reliability (Cronbach α: 0.95 [face-to-face]; 0.90 [distance]). Statistically significant differences were found between delivery system TBI mean scores, indicating fewer barriers with distance treatment.

The theory was generated by first conducting a concept analysis that yielded 12 attributes of the concept of culture brokering. The concept analysis was accomplished using the anthropology, health-related, and business literature. In addition, data from an interpretive ethnographic study were used to further develop the concept of culture brokering. The theory was then generated from four grounded theory studies. Each study was used to frame the grounded theory model and to strengthen and refine the categories and links between categories within the basic social process of culture brokering. The culture brokering theory can guide the practice of nurses in situations where conflict is present in the health care interaction. The theory is grounded in the experiences of nurses attempting conflict resolution in the context of health care interactions.",

However, there is no single, universally accepted measure or methodology for operationalizing problem behaviors, and variations in definition and measurement across studies complicate drawing meaningful conclusions about these behaviors. This article is an overview of five factors that have complicated accurate and dependable measurement of problem behaviors in dementia: the shifting domain of problem behaviors, slippage across research constructs, unexplored rater bias, scoring bias, and the absence of benchmarking studies. A methodological agenda is discussed for future investigations in this rapidly growing area of gerontological research.",

The estimation of reliability and validity was accomplished through a sample of 940 children.

Despite the scientific evidence for the low risk of occupational exposure to this infection, many health care workers appear to demonstrate highly fearful behavior. Social and cultural values, which attach a deep symbolic meaning to AIDS, combine with misperceptions about transmission to create this stress response. This article suggests education on cross-cultural, sexual, and death-related issues, as well as factual information on AIDS to decrease this fear. Implications for nursing research are included.",

Although there is a great deal of theoretical writing and research that substantiates the relationship of social supports to help seeking and evidence that nurses in practice are providers of support, there is very little research on nursing interventions that provide support. The article argues that one of the reasons for the lack of tested interventions is the lack of an adequate typology for categories of lack of support. The article argues that, because different categories require different types of interventions, development and testing of interventions can be assisted by a typology. Six categories of lack of support are proposed. Interventions are discussed for each category.",

This study used a cross-sectional design to investigate the psychosocial and biological risks in acculturating pregnant women of Hispanic origin (n = 470). Psychosocial risks-depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress-were assessed by self-report, whereas biological measures included stress-related and reproductive hormones. Mental health deteriorated across generations, with worsening depression, anxiety, and stress with successive generations. Stress and reproductive hormone levels decreased across generations, whereas body mass index and number of sexual partners increased. These data provide potential biobehavioral explanations of the relationship between acculturation and declining health among Hispanic women in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Compliance with prescribed therapeutic regimens is a construct that begs for consideration from an ethical perspective.This article offers a dialectical study of the nurse-client relationship, derived from Gadow's framework of ethical knowledge, that provides an alternative to compliance as context for nursing therapeutics. The dialectic move from compliance as thesis to isolated autonomy as antithesis is explored. Gadow's notion of engagement is elaborated on and offered as a synthesis that transcends the paternalistic and coercive assumptions underlying compliance and overcomes the dilemmas presented by the issues of power, consumerism, and beneficence that are inherent in isolated autonomy.",

The BNBAS and sucking behavior measurements were completed on 104 preterm infants at 40 and 44 weeks PCA. The Orientation (p = .001), Motor (p = .001), Range of State (p = .001), Autonomic Regulation (p = .01), and Reflexes (p = .00) clusters were significantly more mature at 44 weeks PCA than at 40 weeks. Infants that were extremely early born (n = 24) had a significantly larger change in BNBAS scores over time as compared to the more mature preterm infants (n = 77), largely catching up with their more mature preterm counterparts. At 40 and 44 weeks PCA, the BNBAS cluster scores for orientation (p = .02), motor (p = .048), range of state (p = .048), and regulation of state (p < .001) were significantly related to the average maximum pressure, adjusted for gestational age and weeks PCA. Significant neurobehavioral maturation takes place between 40 and 44 weeks PCA in preterm infants, with the greatest changes occurring in the most preterm infants.

Furthermore, at 6-month follow-up, the status of 182 patients was maintained or improved (P = .001). A comparison group, tested prior to and after a waiting period, showed no improvement.",

The nurse-patient covenant in cancer care is defined as an enduring relationship, embodying caring benevolence and contextually negotiated reciprocity. It is preceded by the demonstration of nursing competence as a manifestation of nursing tradition and leads to patients' trusting and entrusting nurses, the emergence of personhood and professionhood, and benefits and obligations.",

    "abstract": "Spirituality is a key focus and ethical obligation of nursing practice, but many nurses express uncertainty or discomfort with this aspect of their role. The purpose of this article is to explore the domains of religion, spirituality, and culture as commonly conceptualized by chaplains, as a framework for nurses to provide spiritual care interventions to patients in acute care hospitals. Using anecdotes and illustrations from palliative care practice, this article discusses the enhanced benefits to patients and families when spiritual needs are addressed, with specialty-level chaplain interventions, primary spiritual interventions provided uniquely by nurses, or interventions that require the cooperation of both professions. Lessons learned from the inpatient palliative care team experience can also apply to chaplaincy and nursing care for patients in settings beyond the acute care hospital and in disciplines beyond palliative care.",

Yet nursing has been slow in adopting this new technology as a research method, and the use of the Internet in nursing research rarely has been discussed and critiqued. In this article, use of the Internet in nursing research is analyzed and critiqued from a feminist perspective. The analysis indicates that use of the Internet in research frequently brings about selection biases because of a limited pool of potential participants, it usually does not provide contextual data on research encounters, it might not uncover women's subjective experiences under marginalized situations, and it tends to raise power issues related to the relationships between researchers and participants. Despite the limitations, use of the Internet in research provides better communication channels for research participants, more flexibility in time and place of data collection, and less expense for data collection. Based on the critique, feminist challenges for future use of the Internet in nursing research are proposed.",

    "abstract": "A nursing therapeutics requires that nurses literally act for patients, and they do so in three domains:the physical, the psychological, and what the authors calls the \"integrity of the self.\" Acting for the patient is a matter of inherent ethical significance. Acting for another carries the risk of instrumentality; that is, one person becomes the means to another's end. This can result in a variety of moral problems depending on who determines what the ends will be; the degree to which the ends are agreed on among nurse, patient, significant others, and physicians; and whether nurses are acting for their patients, for themselves, or for institutionalized medicine. A therapeutics exists to do something to and for another, and therefore several knowledges are relevant. While the knowledge of physiology, disease, and interventions is necessary, it is not sufficient, nor perhaps even the most important. Also required for an ethical therapeutics is the knowledge of the social and political place occupied by nurses, self-knowledge, knowledge of the person, and the knowledge of the worthiness of ends to be ends of human life.",

The Abuse Pathways model was developed from a critical disability life history research study conducted with 37 women who had simultaneously experienced abuse and physical disability. The model begins to address the complexity of abuse of women with physical disabilities by identifying the interactive components of the phenomenon. These components include (1) the social context of disability; (2) women's abuse trajectories; and (3) vulnerability factors for abuse. The article concludes by discussing potential applications and limitations of the model.",

However, little research has been directed toward understanding the dynamics of nutritional health in community-dwelling elders using a multidimensional theory approach. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of nutritional health within the context of Roy Adaptation Model. Factors associated with nutritional health of community-dwelling elders were cross-examined. Depressive symptoms, functional status, oral health, and income emerged as independent predictors of nutritional health adjusting for confounders. This finding lends support to the notion that multidimensional biopsychosocial factors contribute to the dynamics of nutritional health.",

Data were collected from intensive interviews of 37 white middle-class and working-class women to explore how women interpret and use health information in the practice of self-care related to weight management. The findings indicated that all women develop personalized norms or categories of physical identity for weight and criteria for knowing if they weigh too much or too little. These norms and criteria represent creative self-care tactics devised without professional assistance in weight management and without regard for the cultural pressure to be thin. The results of this study have relevance for theory development and nursing practice related to women's health. In addition, they support the need for more community-based studies of women to understand the cultural and physical environments in which women conduct their lives and maintain their health.",

The philosophic categories of humanism, theism, and monism can be used to illustrate the different understandings of the spiritual dimension, and the implications of these understandings for the competence of the nurse and the nature of the nurse-patient interaction in the context of spiritual care.",

The proposed theory includes transition conditions, patterns of response, and nursing therapeutics as major concepts and explains the relationships among these major concepts. This theory should be further validated and developed in intervention studies and nursing practice with this specific population.",

Grounded in semistructured interviews, this article casts a critical light on the tensions and contradictions experienced by nurses, arguing that instead of a more accountable, effective, or efficient system, this path is jeopardizing nurses' ability to provide needed care within healthy, supportive work environments, setting into motion a fundamental transformation of nursing practice.",

The findings revealed that the professionalization of care work was often reinforced by societal, familial, and self-expectations. Setting Limits and Making Connections were the dialectical overarching processes shaping the professionalizing of care while 6 interdependent substrategies emerged: assessing, advising, advocating, collaborating, coordinating, and consulting. These findings will help inform refinement of policies and practices for nurses who provide care for an older relative.",

Whistleblowing can be understood as resulting from the improper transmission of critical knowledge in an organization (eg, knowledge about poor care or wrongdoing). Using the sociology of ignorance, we wish to rethink whistleblowing and the failures it brings to light. This article examines how nurses get caught in the strategic circulation of knowledge and ignorance, which can culminate in acts of whistleblowing. The sociology of ignorance helps understand how whistleblowing is borne out of the complex and strategic circulation of knowledge and ignorance that spells multiple and intersecting epistemic positions for nurses. In particular, various organizational blind spots position nurses as untrustworthy and illegitimate speakers in the “business” of the organization. Organizational failings therefore remain concealed while nurses become hypervisible, both as faulty care providers and as problematic information brokers.",

Qualitative analysis of interviews with a purposive sample of family caregivers indicated that caregivers of stroke survivors practice situational vigilance for the stroke survivor, create solutions for problems associated with functional losses of a stroke, construct the reality of recovery for themselves and the stroke survivor, and seek to find personal meaning in the caregiving experience. Implications for practice and future research are proposed.",

In creating unified identities to form community, differences are suppressed and border communities are built.

The construction of border communities in terms of class and race/ethnicity are considered through exemplars from research on the meaning of community. A deeper understanding of community calls for us to live with uncertainty and unfamiliarity.",

Regression analyses indicated declines in physical health rarely affected the self; increase in depression was related only to concurrent physical health; and prior depression did not predict subsequent physical health.

Assessment of the current state of nursing research resulted in identification of three major issues: (1) elimination of obstacles to nursing research, (2) acceptance of multiple modes of inquiry, and (3) utilization of nursing research findings in clinical practice. the successful resolution of these issues should represent three future hallmarks of success in nursing research.",

The use of computer-assisted survey interviewing is an alternative that has both advantages and disadvantages. Lessons learned in the first wave of a longitudinal study of approximately 1161 children in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades illustrate both the strengths and limitations of this method.",

Macro-level variables associated with political, economic, and social aspects of the work environment have received less attention. Philosophical issues are considered. Person-Environment Congruence Theory is proposed as a framework capable of addressing environmental incongruence in hospital nursing work environments.

Addressing each problem in turn, we argue that inclusion of patients at all stages of evidence-based practice can counter or ameliorate these problems.

Employing a constructionist research methodology with participant engagement in co-construction of findings, data were collected via 2 separate cycles comprising 4 consecutive sessions followed by a nationally advertised miniconference. Empirical, ethical, personal, and esthetic knowing was considered evident in junior nurses. Junior nurses in the UK seem to lack a previously unrecognized domain of organizational knowing without which they cannot overcome hegemonic barriers to the successful development of nursing praxis.",

Advocates claim that nursing education is dominated by a \"feminine\" perspective, resulting in unhappy male students and marginalized male faculty. This is puzzling, as a close reading of the literature finds little support for these claims; and a persistent discounting of male advantages. Portraying men in nursing as victims distorts the nature of systemic oppression, and distracts us from more serious diversity struggles.",

Elements of a theoretical rationale for blending the roles of clinician and researcher in an essentially qualitative methodology are developed. A nursing practice research method is conceptualized not as merely a technical activity with a focus on narrative data, but also as an explicit recognition of research as practice with an emphasis on intersubjectivity and dialogue in the research process as constitutive of reality. Research and knowledge development are thus envisioned as taking place from within the nursing situation and contingent on the quality of the nurse-client relationship. The nurse and client are recognized as the authors of the nursing-research situation in which meanings of health experiences are explored and chosen, and opportunities for enhanced quality of life are presented to both. Nurse and client each lend a unique perspective in the shared nursing-research situation. Regardless of the facticities of the client's medical status, both nurse and client have the potential for positive growth and change when these unique perspectives of nurse and client are joined. The proposed nursing practice research methodology capitalizes on these features of the practice situation, and thus, speaks directly to the concerns of the clinician.",

This has enhanced the ease with which highly personal information such as genetic makeup can be revealed about individuals, families, and communities. In addition, a change in the societal value of human biological tissue from waste to commercial resource has occurred. A new model of stewardship is developed that can be used as a guide for protecting human research participants who are involved in studies that include collecting and handling human biological samples. Nursing implications to ensure protection of human research participants are discussed.",

Dyspnea research, however, has largely used a unidimensional, sensory model of dyspnea devoid of the affective and motivational dimensions that uniquely characterize this sensation in clinical populations. Dyspnea might be more comprehensively viewed as a nociceptive phenomenon which, like pain, has affective dimensions expressed as distress in response to aversiveness. A multidimensional, ecologic model of the dyspnea experience is presented that incorporates nociceptive sensation properties and is suggestive of new directions for dyspnea research uniquely relevant to nursing science.",

In this article, the role of a paradigm in delineating the nature of and solutions to significant problems within a scientific community is explored. I posit that the current eschewal of behaviorism by nurse educators stems not from its failure to solve significant problems in nursing education but rather from an apparent shift in value orientation—a shift from effecting learning (and health) outcomes to effecting social change. Despite this seeming shift in values, effecting learning outcomes is still held to be an essential aspect of nursing education, and it is because of this, I argue, that the behaviorist paradigm is so difficult to unseat.",

The merits of three competing paradigms-normal science, historical facts, and social facts-are discussed. None of these paradigms is adequate for discovery in nursing science. Efforts to develop knowledge around the phenomena of central concern to nursing may advance more rapidly if theory building follows a set of rules, as yet undefined, that incorporates the methods of both normal science and historical tradition.",

This article presents the results of a concept analysis of self-neglect as a first step toward further theory development, research, and eventual practical applications. The literature review addresses suicidology and noncompliance as areas significant to analysis of the concept Ethical, personal, and esthetic as well as empirical sources of knowledge are included as relevant to the conceptualization of self-neglect. Several case examples are constructed to distinguish self-neglect from other health-related behaviors that are potentially harmful. Measures designed to address the complexity of the concept are outlined as the empirical referents. It is concluded that the concept analysis of self-neglect can help to extricate nurse theoreticians and clinicians from conceptual ruts so that new answers to old but challenging problems related to self-care will be discovered.",

In this article, I present a situation-specific theory that explains the unique cancer pain experience of Asian Americans. Unlike other existing theories, this situation-specific theory was developed on the basis of evidence, including a systematic literature review and research findings, making it comprehensive and highly applicable to research and practice with Asian American patients with cancer. Thus, this theory would strengthen the interconnections among theory, evidence, and practice in pain management for Asian American cancer patients.",

Nurses acknowledged that they need to share their attention between the patient and the computer. They stated that prioritizing patients' needs while completing the required electronic documentation was demanding. Stationary computers challenged the logistics of the exchange. Understanding the adaptation of caregiving necessitated by bedside electronic documentation will have a positive impact on developing systems that interface seamlessly with nurses' workflow and encourage patients' active participation in their care.",

The argument is made that when refracted through critical, intersectional lenses, religious and spiritual traditions can be rich sources of theoretical foundations and practical services that could inform nursing's recent re/turn toward social justice.",

An individual's perceptions and the likelihood of taking action are the focus of HBM. SCT is regarded as important sociostructural and personal determinants in the regulation of human behavior. Finally, HPM centers on the unique characteristics and experiences of an individual that motivate him or her toward positive health behavior. The analysis suggests that HPM is a better fit to explore the relationship among sociocultural factors, lifestyle practices, and the positive perceived affect of Hispanic women engaging in healthy behaviors and utilizing health care in the United States. HPM can guide the design of both health-enhancing and disease-prevention strategies that specifically address Hispanic women's unique health needs.",

Regression-based paths from treatment type→early change in self-regulation→later change in self-efficacy→6- and 12-month change in both diet and physical activity/exercise were significant, but not when change in self-efficacy was, reciprocally, entered as the predictor of self-regulation change. Findings indicated advantages in focusing on self-regulation skill development for behavioral changes and weight reduction.",

    "abstract": "Nursing research and the scientists who conduct it currently face considerable viability challenges. With the current changes taking place across academia and research funding, it is imperative that the world recognizes that professional legitimacy is built through knowledge generation. The importance of conducting nursing research and our profession's ability to contribute distinctive insights into health and care by creating its own science, rather than borrowing wholesale from other fields, cannot be underplayed. We reflect back on a thought-provoking editorial published in 1983 in Advances in Nursing Science, in which the author, Susan Gortner, discussed \"The History and Philosophy of Nursing Science and Research\" and traced nursing science's development from its origins starting with methodology-focused efforts to a fully established discipline grounded in its own theory and research.1 She emphasized the importance of defining nursing science – not merely as research methodology, but as a distinct body of knowledge built through cumulative theory development and rigorous testing. In this editorial, it was emphasized that nursing's identity and professional legitimacy were rooted in its capacity to generate scientific knowledge that addressed patient care, family dynamics, and community health, rather than relying solely on imported models from other disciplines. Nursing science needed to be nurtured through systematic inquiry, not just through isolated studies. While we have moved forward beyond Gortner's argument that deductive theory testing and inductive discovery both play crucial roles in advancing robust nursing science, we still support the crucial interdependence of theory and research, the importance of valuing both paradigms, and the continued need to foster a scholarly culture characterized by communality, collegiality, cumulative knowledge, and scientific rigor. At that writing, nursing research had emerged not only to advance knowledge but also to transform bedside care, elevate professional autonomy, and meet complex health needs. Gortner's vision was clear: sustained funding and institutional support were essential to realize the full potential of nursing science. Fast forward to 2025, and Gortner's call feels more urgent than ever. The second Trump administration's FY 2026 budget blueprint proposes a nearly 40% cut to National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding – slashing roughly $18 billion and dismantling several Institutes, including the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR). This is coupled with a unilateral 15% cap on indirect cost reimbursements – an abrupt policy that disregards decades of negotiated rates averaging 30–60%. Moreover, changes to reviews of grant announcements through newly created layers (eg, Department of Government Efficiency and Health and Human Services reviewers) curtail NIH's traditional peer-based decision-making. Hundreds of ongoing grants and notices of funding opportunities targeting vaccine hesitancy, health disparities, LGBTQ+ health, and gender identity research have already been frozen or terminated. The fallout at the very least includes a hold on the clinical trial timelines and public health studies in process, and at the worst, a complete shutdown of such work, coupled with layoffs or career closures of the scientific minds developing, testing, and disseminating such work. WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR NURSING SCIENCE? Nursing research programs – many of which are housed in academic medical centers – rely heavily on indirect cost funding for infrastructure. The abrupt 15% cap jeopardizes labs, faculty, and nurse-scientist career pipelines. Gortner's warning still rings true: without institutional and workforce stability and support, the discipline's integrity is compromised. If there is an erosion of research autonomy, the peer-review process is undermined. Nursing scientists focusing on frontline patient care, home-based interventions, or social determinants stand to lose voice. Gortner may have been likely to warn us against conflating science with ideology. Reduced funding in nursing sciences trickles down directly to patient outcomes: fewer evidence-based interventions, gaps in nursing education, and slowed innovation in chronic disease management, infection control, and adult care. The impact on public health and health care must be recognized. This is not just a loss for nursing; it is a loss for public health as well. Think about the millions of Americans who rely on the evidence produced from nursing research to answer many questions: How do patients manage complex chronic conditions at home? What interventions are needed to improve maternal health outcomes for Black women? How can older adults age with dignity and safety in their communities? The evidence generated from the findings of nursing research has shaped public health guidelines, informed hospital practices, reduced preventable harm, and improved health outcomes, especially for disenfranchised populations. NINR has been central to this work, funding nurse-led studies that advance health equity, community care models, and culturally responsive interventions. Eliminating the NINR would not only set back decades of progress but also erase the only discipline-specific institute within the NIH. Nursing is a profession that transcends care settings, has a life span focus, looks holistically, and focuses on determinants of health. The value of nurse-led research cannot be overstated; nursing research enhances population health and informs health policy, ultimately improving health outcomes across populations, particularly the most vulnerable. We urge Congress to intervene to protect NINR and restore full NIH funding. The parallels with 1983 are clear: while nursing science has matured significantly, today's budget threats echo past struggles for recognition and support. The nursing profession must mobilize, leveraging alliances with academic institutions, patient advocacy groups, and unions to highlight how nursing research drives health outcomes and cost savings. The 1983 editorial envisioned nursing science as an integral and respected component of national health leadership. Today, that vision is imperiled by these sweeping budget cuts and administrative overreach. Upholding Gortner's legacy means fighting not only to preserve funding, but also to champion a nursing research agenda grounded in autonomy, equity, and scientific excellence. As we face this policy crossroads, the nursing profession – and Congress – must choose: retreat from a proven, vital field, or redouble our investment in nursing science and its promise to transform health care and build capacity for the next generation of nurse scientists. The Friends of the National Institute of Nursing Research (ie, FNINR) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing public awareness and support for NINR's programs and services, as well as to supporting nurse researchers in their efforts to improve population health. As Friends, we are concerned about the proposed changes to NINR. As Friends, we value rigorous nurse-led nursing research, promoting and supporting public awareness of nursing research, the ability of nursing research to improve population health, and expanding the number of nurse scientists capable of generating compelling science. We are at an inflection point and must continue to champion a nursing research agenda grounded in autonomy, equity, and scientific excellence to ensure that the voice and value of nursing scientists shape health outcomes and policy for the American public. This is a call to action: write your legislators, form coalitions with your professional organizations, and amplify the stories and evidence that depict how nursing science saves lives, improves healthcare quality and safety, and reduces costs. The public deserves healthcare that has been shaped by evidence from a profession that listens, learns, and leads from the bedside to the boardroom. —Dianne Morrison-Beedy, PhD, RN,CGNC, FESNO, FFNMRCSI, FNAP,FAANP, FAAN FNINR Board Member and Chair,Advocacy Committee The Ohio State University, College ofNursing, Columbus, Ohio —Teri A.

    "abstract": "Self-care is essential in the management of chronic illness. In 2012, we published a middle-range theory addressing self-care as a process of maintaining health through health-promoting practices and managing chronic illness. Three key concepts in the theory were self-care maintenance, self-care monitoring, and self-care management. Self-care maintenance refers to those behaviors performed to improve well-being, preserve health, or maintain physical and emotional stability. Self-care monitoring is the process of routine vigilant surveillance, self-awareness, and body monitoring or body listening. Self-care management involves the response to signs and symptoms when they occur. In 2019, we updated the theory, specifying the important contribution of symptoms to self-care. Assumptions and propositions of the theory were specified in the original publication; both are expanded in this update. Here, we update the theory to reflect changes in our thinking and what has been learned from published literature and discussions with others. An important addition is a detailed discussion of 6 essential intrapersonal requirements for self-care: experience, knowledge, skills, reflection, decision-making, and motivation. These requirements interact dynamically; the order in which they are presented is not meant to reflect the order in which they are developed. These factors are particularly important in guiding the development of self-care interventions. Readers can now refer to this version instead of the 2012 publication.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The health and illness experiences of children and their families are often characterized by intense emotions that reflect suffering and vulnerability. Across children's different development stages, illness and clinical procedures pose emotional challenges that may cause considerable distress.1,2 Consequently, pediatric nursing care involves specific strategies and tools to help children regulate their emotional responses, distinguishing it from the care provided to adults and older clients. Evidence from psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience underscores the fundamental role of affection in supporting healthy and harmonious child development; therefore, pediatric nursing emphasizes emotionally attuned and sensitive practices grounded in a culture of affection.2-4 Building on this understanding, nurses who care for children and their families—with the therapeutic aim to alleviate emotional burdens and support emotional regulation—consider emotional needs equally as important as physiological and other health care requirements. Moreover, nurses place significant value on positively transforming the child's and family's health care experiences, recognizing these moments as opportunities for learning and development.1 Emotional care involves understanding children's emotions across developmental stages, recognizing how these emotions are shared within families, and supporting adaptive emotional regulation.2 However, nurses frequently absorb the intense emotionality and suffering of their clients, which can impact their well-being and contribute to emotional exhaustion.2,3,5,6 The last global pandemic, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has exacerbated these challenges, generating profound emotional experiences—marked by anxiety, fear, distress, anger, loneliness, and isolation—for children and their families. This situation further underscores the crucial importance of emotional nursing care in pediatric settings, as well as the necessity for nurses to manage their own emotions effectively.5 The emotional dimension of nursing is grounded in a holistic and integrative approach to the human being.2 Children and their families are multidimensional individuals who experience a wide range of emotions that significantly influence their well-being, reinforcing the necessity of rejecting Statement of Significance What is known or assumed to be true about this topic? Pediatric nursing is often marked by significant emotional complexity, which requires nurses to engage in emotional management. Providing compassionate care relies on understanding the emotional experiences of clients, including children and their families, as well as the nurses' ability to handle those emotional responses. Establishing practice guidelines based on nursing research and theoretical frameworks is essential for enhancing clinical outcomes, health services, and health care economics. What this article adds? Health care institutions and nurses must recognize and value the emotional aspects of nursing. By doing so, the emotional labor involved in nursing can be integrated into reflective practice and supported by scientific evidence. It is essential to develop models of care that guide and empower nurses in addressing emotional challenges specific to pediatric nursing and health care. The application of the Emotional Labor Model in Pediatric Nursing has the potential to encourage discussions, research, and changes in practice among pediatric nurses, administrators, researchers, and nursing education programs.fragmented or reductionist perspectives. A humanized approach to care—rooted in the ethical principle of human dignity—emphasizes emotionally attuned and compassionate support.3 In light of these principles, the notion of emotional neutrality in nursing practice is increasingly challenged. Contemporary nursing science recognizes the centrality of human emotions in health care.3,5-7 Consequently, care provision demands an attentive and emotionally responsive approach, with the nurse-client relationship playing a pivotal role in facilitating both the expression and management of emotions.1-3,7 Emotional labor in nursing8 represents the operationalization of this emotional dimension. It is defined as an autonomous intervention and/or a set of strategies or tools aimed at facilitating clients' emotional regulation, managing nurses' own emotions, expressing emotions appropriately, and cultivating the capacity to provide emotional care.9,10 To achieve this and enhance care quality, emotional labor should be integrated into nursing education and training programs,1,8-10 fostering the development of nurses' emotional competencies. Research on emotional labor in nursing has yielded several conceptual models and frameworks to guide understanding and practice, including the Healthcare Model of Emotional Labor,11 the Four Typologies of Emotional Labor,12 the Emotional Labor Process Model,13 and the Authentic Emotional Labor Model.14 However, in pediatric care, the unique characteristics of clients and nurse-client interactions require a distinctive model.2,11,15 Considering this gap, this paper introduces the Emotional Labor Model in Pediatric Nursing (ELMPN), outlining its foundation, key care categories, expected outcomes, and applicability in strengthening the emotional dimension of pediatric care. THE ELMPN: A MODEL OF CARE The ELMPN is characterized by its comprehensive approach to conceptualizing and operationalizing emotional labor within the field of pediatrics. The model encompasses 5 categories of care, each imbued with an affective-emotional dimension and designed to consciously facilitate the management of emotionality among clients (children and families) and nurses. These categories are as follows1: Promote a safe and affectionate environment. Nurture care with affection. Facilitate clients' emotional management. Build stability in the relationship. Regulate own emotional disposition to care (see Figure 1) Figure 1.: Schematic representation of the ELMPN: relationship among the 5 care categories.1 The 5 care categories of the ELMPN are adaptable to different pediatric settings and children's developmental stages, making the model a flexible framework for enhancing nursing practice with children and families. Its distinctiveness lies in the management of both clients' and nurses' emotions, supporting nurses' personal and professional development, promoting emotional well-being and humanized care, and embodying the concept of triple centrality. Here, triple centrality refers to the emphasis placed on 3 interrelated domains: (1) the child/family, (2) the nurse, and (3) the child/family-nurse relationship. In domain (1), centrality is reflected in care categories such as Promote a safe and affectionate environment, Nurture care with affection, and Facilitate clients' emotional management. In domain (2), it is represented by the category Regulate own emotional disposition to care. In domain (3), centrality is evident in the category Build stability in the relationship. The ELMPN serves as both a conceptual and practical framework for pediatric nurses, guiding the management of emotionality throughout the health-disease continuum. It emphasizes the emotional well-being of pediatric clients, acknowledges nurses' own emotional responses, and promotes the regulation of emotions during nurse-client interactions. The model highlights the potential for emotional experiences to be transformed into opportunities for positive growth and personal development, thereby enhancing the quality of care and fostering a more humanizing health care environment. When applying the ELMPN, pediatric nurses tailor their interactions according to the children's developmental stage. For example, within the category Facilitate clients' emotional management, 2 primary emotional management strategies are employed: anticipatory and reactive. In anticipatory emotion management, nurses take proactive steps to prevent emotional distress during care procedures. For infants, this may involve approaching the crib slowly, using gentle touch, maintaining a calm tone of voice, and smiling to convey safety. Nurses may also ask the mother to hold the baby with affective restraint during procedures such as medication administration, minimizing fear or irritation. Toddlers, who are beginning to assert independence and engage in symbolic play, often benefit from imaginative approaches. For instance, if a toddler is playing with a toy stroller, the nurse might join the game, comment on the stroller's color, or introduce the procedure by saying something like, \"We're going to energize your stroller with a magic liquid through this little tube,\" to explain intravenous medication. Preschoolers, who are more verbal and imaginative, can be engaged by initiating conversations about their drawings, pets, or favorite games. Treatments or procedures may be framed as part of a play scenario—such as checking a doll's temperature or giving medicine to a teddy bear—to promote cooperation through storytelling and role-play. School-aged children, possessing increased cognitive abilities and curiosity, benefit from clear, age-appropriate explanations. Nurses can use simple vocabulary, books, or illustrations to explain procedures and encourage questions. In addition, nurses promote trust and reduce anxiety by showing openness and honest responses. Adolescents, capable of abstract thinking and often emotionally sensitive, require verbal explanations. Nurses create space for questions, clarify doubts, and support emotional expression, while also observing emotional lability, which is common during this stage. The ELMPN has been demonstrated to foster stability within the nurse-child-family relationship, thereby creating an environment characterized by safety, empathy, and affection. This, in turn, positively influences the emotional management of all parties involved.1,2,6 Moreover, the application of the ELMPN promotes professional performance among nurses through education, training, and supportive debriefing. These processes enable nurses to incorporate presence, availability, emotional involvement, and positivity into their care, balancing caring for others while protecting themselves from emotional exhaustion. The ELMPN has been officially registered as intellectual property with the General Inspection of Cultural Activities (IGAC) in Portugal, bearing registration number 1349/2019 as of May 15, 2019. METHODS A Grounded Theory study16 was conducted as part of a doctoral thesis entitled \"Work with the Emotions in Pediatric Nursing: A Process of Metamorphosis of the Emotional Experience in the Act of Caring\".17 This study provides insights into how nurses manage emotions in their care for children and families, and how such emotional management is transformed into a therapeutic intervention that enhances pediatric clients' well-being through the re-signification of their experiences. The research also highlights often invisible, unconscious, and undervalued nursing interventions that promote health gains, underscoring the critical importance of the emotional dimension in nursing practice. This qualitative research aligns with the naturalistic (interpretive) paradigm, aiming to explore the complexity of human experiences directly and holistically. An exploratory, descriptive approach was adopted, involving the collection and analysis of narrative and subjective data within a pediatric ward. Participants included nurses (n = 12), children (from infants to school-aged, n = 10), adolescents (aged 11 and 16 years, n = 2), and family members (mothers, fathers, and grandparents, n = 21). Participants were recruited by the head nurse or shift manager, and informed consent was obtained from both nurses and families. To explore phenomena in depth and collect richness, descriptive data, 3 methods were employed: interviews, observations (participant and nonparticipant), and written narratives. In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 nurses, 5 parents (mothers and fathers), and 1 adolescent. Observations focused on various interactions, including: mother-father-nurse (1), child-grandmother-nurse (2), child-mother-nurse (5), adolescent-nurse (1), mother-nurse (2), adolescent-mother-nurse (1), mother-father-grandmother-nurse (1), child-nurse (3), and child-mother-father-nurse (2). Additionally, written narratives were obtained from 4 nurses. Data analysis was conducted using NVivo software. The study demonstrated how emotions are employed therapeutically in pediatric nursing, showing that emotional management can be structured into interventions that enhance client well-being. The development of a logical, systematic, and explanatory model emerged from this middle-range theory16,17 and is grounded in the nursing body of knowledge, particularly the concept of emotional labor.8,9 The model was subsequently validated in other pediatric contexts through research and reflective practice.1 Consequently, it serves as a theoretical framework derived from inductive research rooted in nursing practice. It functions not merely as a representation of reality but also as a practical guide for pediatric nurses and an educational resource. According to the pioneers of Grounded Theory,16 the model represents the operational aspect of the middle-range theory and is considered a practice model, in contrast to a conceptual model, which possesses a higher level of abstraction.18 A practice model, or model of care, is defined as a schematic representation that is directly applicable, specific, and concrete.19-21 Models are developed to represent theories; thus, a middle-range theory can give rise to a diagrammatic representation that reveals relationships between concepts.22 The middle-range theory underlying this study produced the ELMPN, illustrating the interconnections among 5 care categories and explaining emotional nursing phenomena derived from inductive reasoning.23 In summary, the ELMPN evolved from the middle-range theory developed in the author's doctoral thesis (2005-2010),17 as well as quantitative and qualitative studies conducted in diverse pediatric contexts to validate the model,1 and through reflective practice with expert pediatric nurses and discussions with researchers and academic peers.2,3,5 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK The ELMPN is grounded in several theoretical foundations. First, it reflects the nursing metaparadigm, which encompasses the concepts of environment, person, health, and nursing intervention.24 Second, it incorporates the transformative nursing paradigm,25 with caring as its central concept, drawing on Watson's Theory of Human Caring7 and related theorizing on caring.26 Third, it integrates the concept of \"personal knowledge\" within the context of nursing knowledge patterns.27,28 Finally, it embraces a holistic7 and humanistic29 perspective in health care. This conceptual framework is based on the concept of emotional labor in nursing, a construct that has received substantial scholarly attention.8,9,30 It is precisely this concept of emotional labor that underpins the designation of the ELMPN. In addition, the model incorporates principles of family-centered care and atraumatic care in pediatric nursing. THEORETICAL CONCEPTS Based on the nursing metaparadigm,24 the ELMPN is grounded in 5 fundamental concepts. - The Person-Client is defined as the child or family member who experiences intense emotionality within the context of health-disease processes. This emotionality is both inherent to the children's developmental stage and shaped by the care experience itself, which may exacerbate suffering and increase vulnerability. The Person-Client is understood as a complex, unique, sensitive, and vulnerable being—one who may attribute negative emotional meanings to illness and health care experiences. However, this individual also possesses the capacity for emotional reorganization and for mobilizing both internal and external resources to cope and adapt positively. Whether this adaptive ability is activated depends significantly on the conditions and environment surrounding the individual, as well as the presence of supportive care and meaningful relationships. - The Person-Nurse is adept at recognizing and interpreting the emotional needs of each child and family (Person-Client) and is attuned to their emotional responses to health challenges and the care process. This nurse is committed to supporting and empowering the client's emotional management in a manner appropriate to the children's developmental stage. The Person-Nurse demonstrates empathy and emotional closeness, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of the client's emotional state. The emotional responses elicited through interactions with clients experiencing distress and suffering contribute to the development of emotional competence in the nurse. However, it is essential that nurses also have the capacity for introspection and articulation of their experiences—particularly within the context of teamwork and their own emotional well-being. Regular reflection on practice and the use of supportive debriefing are recommended strategies within the ELMPN to sustain nurses' emotional well-being and foster professional growth. - The Pediatric Environment is understood as a relational and emotionally homely atmosphere that begins at the point of reception and continues throughout the continuum of care. It is characterized by interactions grounded in trust, affection, calmness, and comfort for all individuals involved. The creation of this therapeutic environment is facilitated by engaging the child's imagination and emotional world through affection, singing, appropriate language, and play. This environment is affective and secure, thoughtfully adapted to the children's developmental stage, and intentionally designed to support emotional regulation and reduce distress throughout the care experience. - The nurse-client relationship is characterized by emotional connection and caring; it serves as a space for expression and sharing, where clients experience intense emotionality and nurses respond empathetically to the suffering of those in their care. Managing this emotional flow is essential to the therapeutic process. Therapeutic relationships are built on empathy, trust, compassion, proximity, and emotional reciprocity. For these relationships to be effective, both communication and emotional regulation strategies must be carefully adapted to the children's developmental stage, ensuring that emotional needs are addressed in a developmentally appropriate and supportive manner. - The concept of emotional labor in pediatric nursing is defined in both general and specific terms. General Definition: Emotional labor in pediatric nursing refers to the intentional management of emotionality—both of clients (children and families) and nurses—to positively transform emotional experiences, interpersonal relationships, and the care process itself. This transformation seeks to relieve suffering, enhance well-being, and support the personal growth of all individuals involved. To protect themselves from emotional exhaustion, nurses employ individual strategies (eg, reflective writing, meditation, relaxing walks) as well as collective strategies (eg, case analysis, supportive debriefing, group recognition, and praise). These practices are designed to promote emotional well-being and resilience. Specific Definition: Emotional labor in pediatric nursing involves a set of therapeutic strategies and tools mobilized by nurses—individually and collectively—during the care process. These are operationalized through the 5 care categories of the ELMPN: Promote a safe and affectionate environment; Nurture care with affection; Facilitate the management of clients' emotions; Build stability in the relationship; Regulate own emotional disposition to care. These strategies aim to promote the emotional well-being and health of children and families, as well as the emotional balance and professional satisfaction of nurses. THE 5 CARE CATEGORIES OF ELMPN Nurses recognize the profound emotional experiences faced by pediatric clients, understanding these as intrinsic to nursing practice.1-3,5 They actively seek to transform these experiences positively and therapeutically through the application of 5 care categories (Figure 1), which reflect the intentionality of emotional care. The following examples illustrate these categories in practice: - To cultivate a secure and nurturing atmosphere, nurses introduce themselves by name and communicate in a tone that is both compassionate and reassuring. They often wear colorful uniforms to create a friendly environment and guide children through the playroom to foster a sense of safety. Additionally, they initiate conversations and moments of play, using characters from fairy tales or cartoons to engage the child's imagination and promote emotional comfort (Figure 2). Figure 2.: Defining characteristics of the care category \"Promote a safe and affectionate environment\".1 - To nurture care with affection, nurses demonstrate their warmth through various expressive and relational behaviors. First, their smiles, calm and gentle tone of voice, soft gaze, and comforting speech—often enriched by affectionate language or nickname and accompanied by soothing head movements—reveal their ability to provide tenderness and reassurance. Second, this affection is also conveyed through physical expressions of care, such as gentle stroking, light touches, hugs, and offering a lap for comfort and emotional containment (Figure 3). Figure 3.: Defining characteristics of the care category \"Nurture care with affection\".1 - To facilitate the management of clients' emotions, nurses adopt a calm and compassionate demeanor, instill hope, and reassure families of their availability and support. They use a range of strategies and tools to prepare children for treatments or procedures, including visual aids such as puppets or books to enhance understanding. Additionally, nurses teach children simple relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, whistling, blowing, and guided imagery, to help reduce anxiety and promote emotional regulation. Children are also encouraged to keep comfort objects—such as a stuffed toy or blanket—during procedures and are supported in expressing their emotions through conversation or drawing. Parents are encouraged to be present during all procedures and are actively invited to participate in the care process (Figure 4). Figure 4.: Defining characteristics of the care category \"Facilitate clients' emotional management\".1 - To build stability in the relationship, particularly during the initial encounter, nurses strive to establish rapport with children by asking about the identity of their doll or teddy bear, engaging in conversations about shared interests—such as close friends, school experiences, or pets—and creating a foundation of trust. This trust is fostered through physical and emotional proximity, expressions of affection, transparent communication, and a collaborative approach to decision-making with parents or other family members (Figure 5). Figure 5.: Defining characteristics of the care category \"Build stability in the relationship\".1 - To regulate their own emotional disposition to care, nurses can draw on resources available within the team context. These include group support, reflective practice, sharing emotional management strategies, and facilitating discussion groups or forums focused on emotions related to health care. In addition to team-based strategies, individualized emotional regulation resources are developed through workshops and webinars. These include relaxation techniques, reflective writing, meditation, mindfulness, dance, and yoga—all of which support positive emotional regulation during highly affective care experiences (Figure 6). Such formative strategies—particularly training and supportive debriefing—are essential components of the ELMPN and play a crucial role in fostering the development of emotional competencies among nurses. Figure 6.: Defining characteristics of the care category \"Regulate own emotional disposition to care\".1 The 5 care categories are inherently interrelated, with nurses' emotional regulation being essential to their presence and availability in providing affectionate care. The following example illustrates how the ELMPN care categories enhance the provision of emotional care: When a child exhibits signs of distress related to fear of hospitalization, and the mother displays anxiety and apprehension about her child's health, the nurse recognizes the emotional vulnerability of both clients. Demonstrating empathy, affection, and availability in communication, the nurse fosters a supportive environment that promotes emotional well-being. To create a therapeutic atmosphere, the nurse warmly introduces the child and mother to the bedroom and playroom, adopting a friendly and welcoming demeanor. The therapeutic relationship is marked by hopeful dialogue and positive interactions, facilitating the emotional management of both child and mother, and nurturing feelings of trust, respect, and consideration. The nurse's approach is multifaceted: empowering the mother by providing essential information and involving her in the child's care; offering the mother a safe space to express her emotions and find meaning in the experience; and providing opportunities for the child to engage in play, painting, and recreational activities, including interaction with hospital clowns. During treatments, the nurse teaches the child deep breathing techniques and guides them through positive imagery to alleviate fear and stress. To ensure continuity of care and knowledge sharing, nurses hold practice analysis meetings to disseminate emotional management strategies used in their care. They also participate in mindfulness exercises and listen to soothing music to foster calm and reduce stress. Collectively, these strategies have proven effective in helping families cope with the emotional challenges associated with their children's health conditions. A PRACTICAL CASE—REFLEXIVE RECORDING OF NURSE-CHILD INTERACTION IN THE CONTEXT OF PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY During the morning, while James (a fictitious name) was alone in the room after his mother had left the ward, I considered it appropriate to approach him. Before this interaction, James had been playing a game of Four in a Row with his mother. Upon approaching him, I invited him to continue the game, which he graciously accepted. James has had cancer since the age of 2 and has undergone multiple chemotherapy protocols. He is now 5 years old. His facial expression reflects the prolonged time he has spent in the hospital and does not easily lend itself to smiling. Over time, he has developed strong defense mechanisms that shield him from external influences. As a result, interpersonal interactions—both verbal and nonverbal—pose a significant challenge. Table 1 demonstrates how ELMPN can be applied, as described in a nurse's reflective journal. Table 1. - Description of the Nurse-child Interaction and Correlation With the Categories of ELMPN. Nurse-child interaction Emotional changes Strategies and tools employed in the ELMPN ELMPN categories of care The investment of time in interpersonal relationships has been shown to facilitate the overcoming of communication barriers. The game began following a negotiation regarding the color of the pieces. During play, Jim's gaze occasionally fell upon me, particularly when he anticipated risky moves. In response, I displayed subtle signs of internal deliberation, reflecting a state of uncertainty in my decision-making process. In turn, he exhibited a playful expression, suggesting the presence of a hidden strategy. - Fear - Play and playthings - Facilitate clients' emotional management - Feeling - Presence - Empathy uncomfortable - Friendly relationships - Inhibition - Openness to emotional expression - Promote a safe and affectionate environment I looked at him, perplexed, and responded in a playful manner: \"James, what is the meaning of that expression? I am certain you are attempting to deceive me\". He smiled in return, but making an effort to suppress his laughter, aware that any overt display of amusement might be interpreted as an indication of intimacy in the relationship—something he did not yet feel sufficiently confident to convey. - Shame - Affectionate humor - Build stability in the relationship - Active listening - Feeling uncomfortable - Openness to emotional expression - Promote a safe and affectionate environment - Confidence building In some instances, the correct move was chosen, while in others, a deliberate mistake was made to elicit a response from the child during the interaction. When the outcome was favorable, the child exhibited a positive response in the form of laughter and increased engagement. Conversely, when I won, the child displayed a smile that was partially forced but still restrained. - Happiness (albeit restrained) - Humor- Affectionate humor - Nurture care with affection - Facilitate clients' emotional management - Empathy At one point, a recreation specialist entered the room with a DVD player and a selection of movies, in response to a prior request made by Jim. I then asked Jim whether he would prefer to watch the DVDs or continue playing \"Four in a Row\" with me, and he chose to continue the game. This response demonstrated that these moments of play with the nurse were a source of pleasure and enjoyment for him. Given the challenging nature of the hospital environment and the prolonged duration of hospitalization, the ability to provide a moment of tranquility and enjoyment for a child is undoubtedly beneficial for facilitating em",

A brief overview of emerging approaches for enhancing nursing science in the area of SES and health disparities is presented.",

The article is composed of 2 parts. Part I is a portrayal of the US economic and health care system as it is, one that enacts an ideology of never-ending profit, inequality, and exclusion based on class, color, and ability to pay. Initially, I outline the wealth gap in our society and deconstruct the popular myth that most US families benefited from the stock market gains of the 80s and 90s; next I discuss the process of corporatization and globalization of business and the resultant attack on the ideals of participatory democracy. Finally, I briefly trace the history of the corporatization of US health care and outline its impact on costs, access, quality, and population health. Part II is a more philosophical discussion of ways out of the dilemmas portrayed in Part I. Among other things, I discuss how a deepening of our political commitment is needed, a process that entails a move away from the current politics of the Prince toward a politics of the people. This deeper way of living our politics makes every act a political act, enabling us to resist what we are told, denounce that which is unacceptable, unite around common ground, and enact previously unimagined alternatives.",

This CST lens is applied to Sumner's theory The Moral Construct of Caring in Nursing as Communicative Action and its instrumentation. The pilot testing data are discussed using Fontana's CST process: critique, context, politics, emancipatory intent, democratic structures, dialectic analysis, and reflexivity. Ideal communication in the nurse-patient relationship is bidirectional, multifaceted, complex, and difficult to achieve.",

Historically, metaphors have been used to create a public acceptance of policies of discrimination, racism, and even genocide of targeted social groups, including immigrants. This article examines the use of such metaphors, juxtaposing an analysis of nursing journal articles regarding immigrant health, and of major nursing organizations for policy statements that might support immigrant healthcare.",

Viewing the EHR as relying solely on the use of standardized languages begets a number of questions and furthers the dilemma for nurses. Through a discussion that draws on the Indian tradition of the tetralemma, authors transcend the EHR/nursing dilemma.",

Clearly, the health care system is not succeeding in improving the health of the US population with its focus on illness care for individuals. A new theoretical approach, critical interactionism, combines symbolic interactionism and critical social theory to provide a guide for addressing health care problems from both an upstream and downstream approach. Concepts of meaning from symbolic interactionism and emancipation from critical perspective move across system levels to inform and reform health care for individuals, organizations, and societies. This provides a powerful approach for health care reform, moving back and forth between the micro and macro levels. Areas of application to nursing practice with several examples (patients with obesity; patients who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; workplace bullying and errors), nursing education, and research are also discussed.",

Adolescent pregnancy is a major public health challenge for the United States. Existing community resources need to be considered for their potential to impact teen pregnancy and STI prevention efforts. SBHCs are one such community resource to be leveraged in these efforts. They offer adolescent-friendly primary care services and are responsive to the diverse needs of the adolescents utilizing them. However, current restrictions on contraceptive availability limit the ability of SBHCs to maximize opportunities for comprehensive reproductive care and create missed opportunities for pregnancy and STI prevention. A clinical case explores the current models of health care services related to contraceptive care provided in SBHCs and the ability to meet or miss the needs of an adolescent seeking reproductive care in a SBHC.

    "abstract": "Nurse practitioners are a vital and growing body of primary healthcare providers. The ever-changing advancements in science and technology and the increasing complexities in health care delivery are significant factors culminating in the expanding role of nurse practitioner-led care. Nurse educators are striving to develop nurse practitioner curricula to keep pace with the increasingly sophisticated knowledge and competencies nurse practitioners must possess to render safe quality care as independent primary health care providers. However, nursing theory is losing its place as a formative foundation in nurse practitioner curricula. Multiple factors such as content-laden, competency-based, medically focused education have caused a diminishing presence of nursing theory, shrinking the philosophical basis for nursing in nurse practitioner education. The loss of the central unifying focus of the discipline and discipline-specific knowledge (nursology) risks losing the very identity that forms the basis and relevance for nurse practitioner practice. Moreover, the loss of the nurse in the nurse practitioner unmoors nurse practitioner practice from its theoretical and scientific basis, losing discipline-specific attributes that lead to higher levels of patient satisfaction and improved patient outcomes. Keeping the nurse in the nurse practitioner is a moral imperative in nurses' ethical and social contract with society. This article discusses relevant literature and offers recommendations to keep the nurse in the nurse practitioner.",

We used constructivist grounded theory methodology to guide this study and recruited 30 participants with an active DFU attending a wound care clinic in Ontario, Canada. The study's findings indicate that participants' engagement in self-management of DFU was influenced by internal and external factors. While some factors contributed to enhance participants' engagement in everyday self-management, others seemed to have prevented them from achieving engagement and hence the desired DFU outcomes.",

Individuals with diabetes must manage the complexity of the disease, its treatment, and complications to avert deleterious consequences associated with the illness. However, not all patients with diabetes successfully gain mastery to positively impact self-management. A new middle-range theory is proposed that merges 2 extant theories, theory of mastery and organismic integration theory, to better understand this human response. The theories' philosophical, theoretical, and conceptual perspectives were examined and relational properties synthesized to provide a conceptual representation of the phenomenon of interest.",

With no existing instruments to measure prejudice directed toward nurses, the primary goal of the current study was to report the results and validation of the newly developed Workplace Prejudice toward Nurses (WPtN) scale. Participants (1692 nurses, 65% whom identified as an underrepresented racial or ethnic group) completed an online survey assessing WPtN. Participants reported on the types and frequency of WPtN they experienced, who directed the prejudice toward them, and the impact it caused on their job satisfaction and retention. Results supported the fit of a 1-factor model assessing general workplace prejudice, and 4-factor model comprising WPtN directed from different groups (ie, patients, their family members, coworkers, and administrators). More than one-third (34%) of participants reported experiencing WPtN. Those reporting WPtN indicated this prejudice was directed toward them from patients (45%), family members (41%), coworkers (42%), and administrators (14%). Experiencing WPtN negatively impacted job satisfaction and retention. Together, findings indicate that the WPtN scale is a reliable measure of WPtN of underrepresented backgrounds. The development of this tool is an important step to combating prejudiced behavior and attitudes, which can often be covert and difficult to validate.",

Other selected Rogerian perspectives that can be used to understand the illness experience are presented and briefly discussed.",

Metamodernism enables movement in nursing knowledge development between empiricism and rationalism, standardization and context, skepticism and sincerity, and systems innovation and disciplinary orthodoxy. Through its oscillating logic, metamodernism cultivates a layered epistemology grounded in relational ontology, reflexivity, pluralism, and ethical discernment. This framework allows nursing to develop knowledge with intentionality, adaptability, and moral presence, equipping the discipline to meet the demands of an increasingly complex and uncertain world.",

    "abstract": "Recently, I was attending a leadership meeting at Washington DC. There were intense discussions about recent development across the nation such as changes at the National Institute of Health (NIH), shifts in state policies, and other significant updates. Within the current sociopolitical contexts, one of the important questions that the leaders discussed was \"what is nursing science?\" In 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, there were great discussions on ontological and epistemological questions on nursing.1 Then, over time, we have taken the existence of nursing science for granted, and unlike in the past, we rarely discuss foundational questions on nursing science – except occasionally in PhD classes. With the upcoming possible changes at National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), nursing leaders began to worry about the existence of nursing science. Our early generation of researchers challenged and advanced nursing research and established NINR within NIH,2 and celebrated the victory of nursing science as the fruition of our own efforts to advance nursing science. The official reason for the establishment of NINR within the NIH shows a little bit different story though. According to the NINR website,2 NINR was established because of two landmarking reports: (a) a 1983 report by the Institute of Medicine (the former National Academy of Medicine) that strongly proposed to include nursing research in biomedical and behavioral science, and (b) a 1984 report by the National Institute of Health (NIH) Task Force on nursing research activities that are relevant to the NIH mission. Subsequently in 1986, the National Center for Nursing Research (NCNR; a former NINR) was established first within NIH according to Public Law 99-158, the Health Research Extension Act of 1985. Then, in 1993, NINR was established based on NCNR and elevated to an NIH institute with the signing of the NIH Revitalization Act. As I understand, the establishment was based on strong acceptance and understanding of what nursing science is and why nursing research needs to be supported. However, with the current wave of both expected and unexpected changes sweeping across the national research enterprise, the question that we need to ask at this time is not if we need NINR, but rather, what nursing science is. As I previously mentioned in a previous editorial,3 in a PhD theory and philosophy class that I taught for the first year PhD students, one of the PhD students posed a thought-provoking question: what is nursing perspective and what is nursing science within the current contexts of interdisciplinary collaborative research environments. The student was a student with a bachelor degree in a different field but sought to be a nurse with a PhD. I invited her to co-author a literature review paper exploring \"what a nursing perspective is.\" Although she eventually withdrew from the work, it was interesting experience to me because I had never expected encountering such a fundamental question about the existence of nursing perspective and nursing science in a nursing PhD class. At that time, since they were PhD students in nursing science, I just assumed that they would not have a question on the existence of nursing perspective and nursing science. Dr. Peggy Chinn also shared similar experience related to nursing theory, in the Nursology blog at https://nursology.net/2019/07/09/what-makes-a-theory-or-model-nursing/. The reality is harsh though. Not only in the classrooms, but also in local, national, and international interdisciplinary conferences, grant review meetings, and university meetings, I frequently met the same question over and over again. Especially with increasingly blurred boundaries among different health disciplines, this question has frequently been raised not only by outsiders, but also by insiders. Even within Schools of Nursing, I frequently face this question while collaborating with non-nurse faculty. Even at national and international meetings of professional nursing organizations, the same question has been asked. Are we able to answer this question with clarity and confidence or are we even questioning to ourselves? Our research landscape continues to evolve, and the uniqueness of nursing science may be complicated by all interdisciplinary works that involve interprofessional teams of researchers. Amid shifting healthcare environments and sociopolitical dynamics, it may be the time for nursing scholars to re-raise ontological and epistemological questions on nursing. Maybe, the re-visit would help clarify what nursing science is in this changing landscape of interdisciplinary healthcare and sociopolitical environments. We may need to go back to our old fundamental ontological and epistemological questions and critically re-define what we have long taken for granted. How is nursing science different from other health sciences? What is nursing science in this ever-changing interdisciplinary environment? —Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "The issue of female circumcision takes on special significance as more women migrate to the United States from countries where the practice has religious and traditional underpinnings. Female circumcision is a problem unfamiliar to most Western health care practitioners. This article describes an ethnographic study of the types of female circumcision, the reasons for and against the practice, the health implications of this practice, and cultural attitudes of circumcised women both in Western Africa and as migrant refugees living in the United States. Ethical dilemmas in dealing with this practice and implications for nurses and health care providers are discussed.In San Diego, California, health-care providers to a rapidly growing community of 3000-4000 Somali refugees have been confronted with female genital mutilation (FGM) for the first time. In order to help Western practitioners devise ways to deal with this phenomenon, this article describes the history of FGM, the various types of mutilation, attitudes towards the procedure, early attempts to abolish it, reasons why the practice is continued, and reasons why it should be ended. The article then describes the results of an ethnographic study of the procedure using data gathered in Liberia and Kenya and the results of a needs assessment among Somali refugees in San Diego. In Kenya, the Kpelle tribe conducts the Sande Bush School every few years. This school removes all the young girls from the villages for 6-12 weeks' training, which includes the secret ritual of FGM. Not all of the girls survive this ordeal. In order to reduce the incidence of mortality, a local hospital sent physicians and nurses into the bush to perform the least destructive type of mutilation in a mobile van. In Kenya, respondents favored the least destructive type of circumcision and adamantly supported the practice. The Somali refugees in the US are undergoing stress adjusting to economic difficulties that make it necessary for women to work outside of the home and make large families prohibitively expensive. All of the interviewed women had the most severe type of infibulation performed, with many of the mutilations taking place in hospitals when they were 5-10 years old. Most of the women believed the practice was mandated by Islam and were distressed by the refusal of US medical personnel to perform FGM. While health care providers need to understand the cultural forces that support FGM, there is no doubt that it would be unethical as well as illegal to perform the procedure. Cultural diversity must be accepted while cultural change is promoted.",

Moreover, if nurses are to practice within the context of health promotion, focusing on community as a relational experience, new patterns of community health promotion practice will need to emerge. This pattern of practice most honor people's experiences of community including power relations present in community. A new pattern of community health promotion nursing practice encompasses the four components of listening and critical reflection; participatory dialogue and critical questioning; pattern emergence and recognition; and movement to action.",

Components of the model include philosophy, organizational theory, nursing theory, economics, and human care. An understanding of the model components allows the nursing administrator to approach his or her role with a deeper understanding of the complexities of being a nursing leader in an organizational setting. An empirical study was conducted that led to modifications of the theoretic model to reflect the current practice of nursing administration. The revised model is intended to serve as an integrative model for the practice of nursing administration.",

Twenty-five women aged 55–65 years were interviewed 2 to 4 times regarding their life course experiences and the meaning they assigned to aging. Field notes, audiotaped interviews, life course charts, and demographics were used in thethematic analysis that produced 5 themes: Bodies Change, Disrupted Meaning, The Unpredictibility of Aging, Slowing Down, and Changing Perspective. Overall, the findings indicate that the experiences of disability due to the result of paralytic polio could not be separated from the experiences of aging, which ultimately led the author to question policies that distribute and fund benefits based on age and disability status without an understanding of the varied experiences of women with disabilities.

The purpose of this article is to critically analyze the concept of symptom disclosure in the context of cancer. Rodgers' evolutionary approach was applied to analyze the concept of symptom disclosure. Concept analysis indicates that symptom disclosure is a decision-making process in which a person chooses to tell significant others and a healthcare provider about self-identified symptoms. Characteristics of the concept include symptom interpretation, weighing the risks and benefits of disclosure, and taking action. Influencing factors are knowledge, cancer risk perception, personal or family history of cancer, socioeconomic and cultural factors, and access to care. The concept analysis of symptom disclosure provides guidance for developing strategies to promote healthcare-seeking behavior in practice and suggest areas for future research.",

It conceptualized ethical responsibilities in the practice of systematic collection and storage of biospecimens in biobanks for future healthcare genetic research. Since the article's publication 8 years ago, genetic biobanks have grown in number around the world and discernible biobank relational conceptualizations were published. Nursing leadership adopted competency standards for all genetic nursing practices. The involvement of nurses has increased and is projected for further significant increase as biobank practices emerge from research into clinical care settings. This assessment of current viability of this previously established stewardship model offers fresh insights to existing and future nursing research and practice. The purpose of this article was to analyze the original stewardship model's components, the relational parties, and characteristics; by contrasting those with proposed conceptualizations and existing biobank practices developed subsequent to its publication. The model's current viability and theoretical development status are assessed for its ability to support a future nursing evidence base for best practices. Proposals for the model's expansion are suggested. The \"stewardship model\" of ethics relationships in genetic biobank interactions is a conceptual framework proposed in Advances in Nursing Science in 2001. Since then, biobank numbers have increased dramatically and have generated ethics controversy. Nursing's involvement is projected to increase as genetic biobank practices emerge from research into clinical settings. This assessment critiques the stewardship model's current viability.",

The sample included 451 participants: African Americans (15.74%), Afro-Caribbeans (25.5%), European Americans (36.36%), and Hispanic Americans (22.4%). Compared with others, European Americans and Hispanic Americans favored quality of life over a lengthy life. Sociodemographic factors, acculturation, ethnicity, health status, and spirituality accounted for variations of decisions. The variability of decisions calls for multiple care options to explore the value of different trade-offs in order to avoid predetermined clinical practice guidelines, especially in nursing.",

    "abstract": "NEOLIBERALISM AND HEALTH In the past few years, nursing research and practice has been profoundly impacted by the effects of neoliberalism, particularly from the ways that this economic system shifts attention away from social determinants of health and puts the blame for health problems squarely on individual behavior. Neoliberalism is a confusing term because it has nothing to do with liberal views in the political sense but, instead, is associated with conservative political viewpoints. Neoliberalism is the primary ideology driving our government, economy, and health care delivery today. It involves an erosion of government regulation and funding of health and human services and replaces government funding and oversight with a private market economy. This for-profit orientation shifts the system from an emphasis on human rights and quality to one of cost-savings and efficiency and makes all variety of health services into goods for sale. For readers who are not familiar with the history of neoliberalism, it stems from liberalism on the basis of Adam Smith's book, The Wealth of Nations, in the mid-1770s and was the dominant system of Europe and much of the industrialized world for 200 years. In the United States, it was replaced briefly in the early 1900s with a more humane system of safety nets and efforts to help the most disenfranchised and marginalized with employment, welfare, Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security, Headstart, and many other programs. Beginning in the 1970s and jump-started in the 1980s by Ronald Reagan's policies, this new liberalism (now called “neoliberalism”) or the “trickle-down economics” as Reagan called it, started dismantling our health care system as we know it (and education, business, and the media as well).1 In this system, economic growth is valued over any ethical principles, such democracy, social justice, compassion, or sustainability. What Reagan and now contemporary proponents of neoliberalism have accomplished is a shift in government expenditures. In 1980, 38% of federal expenditures went to individuals, 41% to the military, and 21% to private enterprise. By 2007, money to individuals decreased to 32% and increased to the military (45%) and private enterprise (23%). This was prior to bailouts of the auto industry and banks approved by Congress in recent years. In medicine, funds have shifted to public and private investments in biomedical, biotech, and pharmaceutical solutions to disease and away from less profitable prevention, caring, or healing activities.2 Neoliberalism is based on 3 principles: individualism, privatization, and decentralization.1 Whereas they are all important, the rest of this editorial will focus on the effects of individualism on health research and practice. An overemphasis on the individual capitalizes on our evolutionary drive to survive when put in competitive, threatening situations. Think of all the reality shows in the past 10 years that set up individuals against each other to win some prize. Is their behavior ethical and exemplary? In reality, our survival is more enhanced by cooperation than competition, but neoliberalism has no rewards for collaboration. When health is recast as a commodity or a good to be purchased, we are pitted against each other to obtain the scarce resources. Individuals are valued over the family or the community, and ethical considerations get lost. A neoliberal approach focuses on equal access to health care services, not fairness. In this vein, welfare is considered inappropriate because not everyone has equal access to it. When we focus so predominantly on individual accountability and responsibility for one's own health, it is easy to blame the most marginalized segments of society for their own health problems. Homeless individuals, teen parents, those addicted to drugs, and people who are obese become those who did not take responsibility for their health, whether they are blamed for tipping the salt shaker too many times, eating those Mickey D's fries, not mastering the English language, using a mood-altering drug to feel some pleasure in life, or choosing not to exercise every day. The social structural barriers and environmental circumstances that pushed them to those individual behaviors are ignored and lost in the efforts to “empower” the disempowered to take responsibility for their health. The solution to any health problem is to buy some product or service: drugs to regulate cholesterol, weight watchers to lose weight or worse yet, bariatric surgical procedures to remove the fat, treadmills that become clothes hangers in the basement after a week of use, and nicotine patches to bolster one's “will power.” The cost of health-related products has skyrocketed in recent years because of this for-profit orientation. As I drafted this piece, a new drug to treat hepatitis C was released at a mere cost of $1000 per day or $84 000 for the full course of treatment. The pharmaceutical company that makes it, Gilead, posted a $2 million profit in the quarter following its release. But along with high prices, neoliberal focus on the individual has had another less obvious impact on how we think of health in the United States. Barbara Ehrenreich, in Bright-Sided,3 described her personal experience with the new individualism as it has manifest in many components of health care as “positive thinking” when she was treated for breast cancer. She noted: Breast cancer, I can now report, did not make me prettier or stronger, more feminine or spiritual. What it gave me, if you want to call this a “gift,” was a very personal, agonizing encounter with an ideological force in American culture that I had not been aware of before—one that encourages us to deny reality, submit cheerfully to misfortune, and blame only ourselves for our fate. Ehrenreich found a system that focused on breast cancer survivors banding together to “empower” themselves through positive thinking and pink ribbons, rather than getting angry and challenging the environmental toxins in our food, water, medications, and air that might be responsible for increasing rates of cancer. In another example, Braslow4 critiqued the mental health recovery movement as another example of how neoliberalism has affected health care. Based on the idea that medically based mental health care fosters dependency and hopelessness, the recovery movement makes the individual responsible for his or her own recovery as an independent, autonomous being, and government support is increasingly cut. This system of peer recovery networks, like George W. Bush's famous “1000 Points of Light” campaign, relies on mostly unpaid volunteers to do the work. This message of dependency is often repeated in the neoliberal discourses. One of the most famous historically was Reagan's address in 1987 about his rationale for cutting welfare, “It's now common knowledge that our welfare system has itself become a poverty trap—a creator and reinforcer of dependency.” Welfare has certainly not provided enough resources to raise the majority of its recipients out of poverty, but to consider it a cause of poverty is nonsensical. What the reduction in welfare has done is to create a class of potential workers who are desperate for a job, and who will take the lowest paying work in unsafe working conditions without complaint, because they have no other choices. The current resistance to raising the minimum wage is a ploy to maintain this lower class of workers to increase the profit margins of big business where the CEOs and higher management folks have been getting richer and richer since the 1980s. In relation to the practice of nursing, Krol and Lavoie5 described a “neoliberal tide” threatening to flood the discipline of nursing, washing away a caring orientation and leaving behind a barren, ethics-free consumer health philosophy. Some of the developments that show the influence of neoliberalism are the increased emphasis on evidence-based practice, which emphasizes cost-effectiveness over innovation; increase in competition-based programs, such as fitness programs that show data from all group members or group weigh-ins that are meant to increase individual accountability but actually contribute to shame and guilt; and focus on technology rather than humanizing, personal care. I don't want to imply that we do not address the individual at all, or that some degree of individual autonomy and responsibility is not appropriate. I'm not saying that technology or evidence-based practice is all bad. In fact, they have been responsible for many positive gains in health care. The problem arises when our solutions are not balanced between the individual and the community or greater good, when we do not consider the social determinants of health that drive individual behaviors. When equal access replaces social justice, and the already marginalized in society are further denied humane services, we are violating nursing ethics. In many aspects of nursing education and practice, it is easier to focus solely or primarily on the individual. Upstream influences on health are harder to change, more difficult to measure, and are often in the policy or activist arenas where many nurses do not feel comfortable. Structural barriers to health care often stem from forces of oppression such as racism, sexism, classism, and heterosexism, concepts we are not trained to address in our nursing education programs, and that make us uncomfortable. But it is our ethical obligation to address the whole person, and that person is imbedded in families, neighborhoods, and societies. All of those levels contain factors that influence an individual's behavior, whether that behavior is smoking, nutritional patterns, physical activity, or meditating. Unless we address societal stigma, cultural norms, all the forces of oppression that divide people, zoning laws, food production systems, advertising, urban planning, neighborhood safety, food deserts, pollution, and a host of other factors, our individual level interventions will not be successful in the long run. Until we question why basic human services have become profit-based industries, health disparities will continue to grow along with the widening income disparities. I urge all researchers to consider the larger context when interpreting results of their studies and at least consider how their interventions might be influenced by social determinants of health. It is not “bad” to study individual interventions, but for these to be successful, they must be imbedded in multilevel interventions that address the upstream factors. What each author of a research paper can do is to imbed his or her own study in the bigger picture and show what community, institutional, legal, and policy solutions are also needed to tackle the health problem he or she studies. As one prominent public health researcher noted, “The study of why some people swim well and others drown when tossed into a river displaces the study of who is tossing whom into the current—and what else might be in the water.”6(p607) When we focus on the microlevel, the individual devoid of context, such as who drowned, and particularly if we put all the impetus on the individual to take responsibility for getting swimming lessons, we are maintaining neoliberalism in health care.

    "abstract": "Pause for a moment and try to think of a time when you are not in relation. If you think carefully, you will probably realize that regardless of whether you are seemingly alone in a solitary activity (eg, walking in a forest or shopping by yourself at the mall) or visibly interacting with other people you are always relating to yourself, to others, and to your surroundings in some way. Think of how, even at the physiological level, we are relationally interconnected. For example, breathing is a relational process—as we inhale and exhale, we are communing with whatever is in the air be it visible or invisible. Moreover, as we interact by breathing, we are being shaped by the air we inhale and affecting the air others breathe by what we exhale. Simply put, as living, breathing beings, it is impossible to not relate.1 I begin my discussion with this simple observation because it has profound implications for how we understand relationships and health and what I am inviting you to consider as you ponder the articles in this Advances in Nursing Science issue on Relationships and Health. For example, if at our very core as human beings we live and exist relationally, would it not be vital to consider that relational interplay if we are to promote health? As nurses, might we need to move beyond the decontextualized, individualist orientation that currently dominates health care? Family offers a simple example. The field of family nursing has been developed on the basis of the understanding that families exert real effects on people and those effects can be positive or negative. However, when we consider family in light of the relational nature of human existence, it becomes evident that we need to go further than considering family in its literal sense. Given that family is a central organizing structure for society, people and their health experiences are highly influenced by their relational experience of “family,” regardless of the extent to which they are involved with any actual family.2–4 While it is vital to consider the relational world of the people/families we care for, I wish to focus my attention most concertedly on how nursing relationships have the potential to affect health. While the impact of decontextualized neutrality (central to Western neoliberal ideology) on nursing knowledge and practice has received a fair bit of attention and critique throughout the past decade, critically considering its legacy in shaping how we typically understand relational practice in nursing is crucial.4–6 For example, relational practice is most often understood within the confines of an individualist perspective that focuses on the interpersonal level of the nurse-patient relationship apart from the ideologies and norms of the larger health care context. Relational concepts such as trust, empathy, and presence are neither conceptually nor practically linked to issues of social justice, equity, ethics, or safe, competent practice.6,7 Moreover, there is the assumption that nursing relationships are health-promoting (at best) or neutral (at worst). However, interpersonal nursing relationships are anything but neutral, in terms of both experiential impact and health outcomes.5 They can have very real beneficial or deleterious effects on people's/families' health. Yet, often we go about our nursing work in relational oblivion, ignoring relationships or assuming that they are somehow separate from other aspects of nursing. Relationships are often discussed and understood as the “soft” part of nursing—the touchy, feely stuff that one does when one has time. This understanding stands in stark contrast to the rich history of scholarship in nursing that illuminates how nursing is a skillful relational process (eg, the “all-at-once” of nursing so eloquently described by Josephine Paterson and Loretta Zderad8 and Margaret Newman's9 theory of health as expanding consciousness). How is it then that after 40 years of relational scholarship and discussion we still hear nurses say “I don't have time to relate to my patients?” Moreover, how is it that we nursing faculty are ourselves unclear about how relational knowledge is integral to every nursing action including the translation of any “hard, evidence-based, empirical” knowledge? I believe that to consider relationships and health in nursing requires that we take an up close and personal look at how we relate. It also requires that we consider what is shaping and informing our understanding and enactment of relational practice in nursing. Importantly, we need to look beyond the interpersonal level to the interrelationship between intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual domains.4,7 We need to more consciously consider how meaning, intersubjectivity, and context are integrally related and how broader ideologies, norms, and discourses shape and influence relational action. Meaningful health-promoting nursing action can occur in any amount of time—it all depends on how you relate in the time you have. At its very core, skilled relational action is a practice of attention—honed, informed, conscious attention that involves the highly reasoned ability to simultaneously (a) enlist observational, analytic, and clinical skills to discern the most significant aspects of the situation, (b) enlist multiple forms of knowledge as we interact with patients/families across contexts of care, and (c) respond in an informed and compassionate manner.4,10 As you read the articles in this issue and seek to further your knowledge about relationships and health, I invite you to consider 2 basic contentions: (a) relating is not an option—it is a core function of every moment; and (b) how we relate shapes everything we experience, do, accomplish, and contribute in the moments we live (and practice as nurses). Who/what are you bringing to the relational moment? What assumptions about the nature of being and the nature of reality are embedded within you and shaping how you relate? What do you focus your attention on and privilege? Are you conscious of what, who, why, when, and where you are relating and whether your nursing actions are aligned to your health-promoting goals? Do you focus your attention on the interrelatedness of people's experiences—on how their health concerns are related to their personal aspirations and life situation? Do you notice how your responses and actions flow out of your own (intrapersonal) values, beliefs, and imperatives? How might your interpersonal actions be promoting/impeding health? Can you see how normative ideologies and systemic (contextual) forces are shaping you and the patients/families you care for? As you ponder these relational questions of nursing, I invite you to join me in reimagining (and hopefully re-creating) current understandings of relational nursing knowledge/practice. What if we understood relating as the most fundamental, yet simultaneously advanced, aspect of nursing practice? What if we understood relating as an act that requires the skill to integrate and translate multiple forms of knowledge, discern what is most salient, and make the “best” clinical decisions? What if we understood the process of relating as the site where the art and science of nursing become one action? What if we understood relational practice as nursing competence in its fullest sense?4 Roach11 has described competence as having the knowledge, judgment, skills, energy, experience, and motivation to respond adequately. If nursing is seen as a relational practice, competence is clearly person/context-dependent and is determined by what relationally transpires in particular health care situations.4 In this view, reimagining relational practice requires that we both look beyond an individualist view of patients/families and reconsider our understanding of competent nursing practice. We are called to move out of relational oblivion and heighten our response-ability, becoming practitioners who continually scrutinize ourselves and our surroundings—including the knowledge and sensibilities we are drawing upon to enact ourselves as knowledgeable, compassionate, and competent nurses. Cultivating relational consciousness as the foundational intelligence that orients and guides us as nurses,10 we see that we do not have a choice about whether we relate. However, we always have a choice about how we relate. And those relational choices are perhaps the most impactful health-promoting decisions we will ever make as nurses. —Gweneth Hartrick-Doane, PhD, RN Editor",

However, at the same time, theoretical concepts such as power arising from ascendant theories of SUHB are often used with little to no critical reflection for past and present-day histories of racism and power inequities in nursing and in society writ large. Using concepts related to SUHB such as integrality, turbulence, power, and patterning, we critically explore the potential of developing anti-racism reflections and actions through 3 theories: Barrett’s Knowing Participation in Change; Butcher’s Kaleidoscoping in Life’s Turbulence; and Smith’s Turbulence-Ease in the Rhythmic Flow of Patterning. We acknowledge that SUHB was/is largely developed within a framework of whiteness by scholars who were/are working from academic positions and social identities of societal safety and privilege. This requires nurses to reflect on how that history shapes SUHB. We also acknowledge the urgent need for ongoing anti-racism and justice work by nurses. As a call to action, we suggest a start by critically building upon existing theoretical foundations in SUHB to develop a more explicit anti-racist theorizing-praxis in nursing for the wellbecoming of humans and nonhumans alike.",

The potential cost impact of the nursing center is significant because of the nurses' ability to forestall hospital admissions and readmissions, decrease prolonged lengths of stay, provide medically supportive outpatient treatments, care for clients at a low cost per client per year, attract professional and nonprofessional volunteer services and donations, and increase job satisfaction, thus reducing costly nurse turnover. The 1991 to 1992 costs of HIV/AIDS health care in the United States were used to estimate conservatively that the center has saved more than $700,000 in 1991 and over $1 million in 1992 in hospital charges for HIV/AIDS care. A rationale for the cost savings estimates is supplied by results of quantitative and qualitative evaluation research projects conducted at the center. Finally, implications of this analysis for future directions in nursing practice and education are discussed.",

Results were consistent with the hypothesis that BP levels during reactivity testing would be better predictors of ambulatory BP than levels of BP measured at rest using a standard protocol. Ethnic group differences in ambulatory BP were statistically significant. The findings warrant further study and may provide a means for early identification of adolescents at risk for developing high BP.",

Sue and Becky related to one another through a sense of shared humanity that not only relieved some of Becky's pain, but also created some possibilities for changing patterns in her life that had been built up over a long period. The article suggests that nurses and patients relate to one another through their affinity as humans. Within the context of caring, nurses such as Sue are ordinary people perceived as being extraordinarily effective by the very ways in which their humanness shines through their knowledge and skills to make their whole being with patients something more than just professional helping. An implication for nursing knowledge arising from Sue's and Becky's interaction, and from the study generally, is the need to reconceptualize the nurse as person, so that nurses are described not only in terms of their professional roles and functions but also as people who share the everyday human qualities of their patients.",

Health effects are one important consequence of race, particularly related to quality, access, marginalization, and privilege.

Despite awareness of violence, mental healthcare providers feel powerless to combat the problem. This article synthesizes 2 previous interpretive studies that examined violence perpetrated against women diagnosed with schizophrenia. This synthesis critically examines the perspectives of women who experience violence and schizophrenia and case managers who care for them. Stigma was an overarching theme in participants' stories but each group differed in its understanding of how stigma impacted women's lives. This disconnection perpetuates stigma and allows violence to remain invisible.

    "abstract": "Although most women find it difficult to provide care to an older family member, some women face additional challenges and health risks because the care recipient is abusive or aggressive toward them. This study tested a 12-week psychoeducative nursing intervention intended to decrease the frequency and intensity of physical and verbal/psychological aggression toward older caregiving wives and daughters by care recipients and improve selected abuse-related outcomes. The intervention, which focused on pattern identification, advocacy counseling, reframing of the caregiving situation, and nonconfrontational caregiving strategies, was individualized and highly interactive with emphasis placed on mutual problem solving and mutual planning. Subjects included women older than 50 who provided care to elders older than 55. Subjects were randomly assigned to group (intervention, N = 38; control, N = 45) and data collectors were \"blinded\" to group assignment. Findings indicated the intervention significantly reduced frequency of verbal/psychological aggression, and feelings of anger for caregivers providing care to fathers or husbands. It was not effective for caregivers providing care to mothers, and it did not reduce burden. Implications for nursing include raising awareness about the special vulnerabilities of older caregivers, providing provocative new information about the gender-based power dynamics in caregiving situations and underscoring the need for nurses to assume a stronger leadership role in building science with regard to family caregiving.",

The development of a model for nursing practice for an urban nurse-led drop-in center for individuals experiencing marginalization provides an opportunity for student nurses to learn transcultural nursing skills that shifts care from acknowledging the need of others to accompanying others on their health journey. The practice model provides the opportunity for undergraduate and graduate nursing students at Augsburg University to de-emphasize tasks and build relationships. Students learn to listen to others' stories and acknowledge their struggles in the margins. Four stages of nursing practice skills, acknowledging others' needs, attending to their struggles, affirming strengths, and ultimately accompanying others, are taught and experienced. At the core of the nursing practice model is the concept of \"hospitality.\" The nursing practice model serves as guide for student nurses to learn to suspend disbeliefs, withhold judgment, and ultimately reduce stereotypes and stigma to offer a safe space for individuals living in the margins seeking care. The future of nursing requires essential knowledge, skills, and attitudes that shift care from need-based care to accompaniment to address health inequities and provide culturally appropriate care.",

Definitions and the relationship between concepts are key information that clinicians and researchers need to measure the correct concept when they are assessing the effectiveness of interventions in nursing practice. Concept analysis findings are grounded by the notion that movement occurs when the body causes its own displacement and is explained by the basic principles of physics, human anatomy, and physiology. Mobility is then distinct because it is affected by the environment that the individual is in and can be assisted by any type of mobility aid. Mobility does not need to be generated by the individual's muscles but does need to be controlled by the individual who is mobile. An individual's mobility in his or her environment is important to his or her well-being and needs to be understood in relationship to his or her movements.",

The aim of this study was to describe the development and testing of the Nurse Practitioner Holistic Caring Instrument, a new, investigator-developed measure of the preservation of holistic nursing values in NP care. Results suggest that NPs provide patient-centered, comprehensive, and clinically competent care, rendering them ideally suited to leading primary health care delivery. However, further testing in more diverse populations and settings is needed to strengthen preliminary findings.",

Despite this, little is known about whether or how social withdrawal as a self-management strategy for episodic migraine might contribute to the more severe symptom burden in this group. In this article, we explore the potentially cumulative, deleterious effect that this strategy may have in modulating migraine-depression symptom severity in this population and argue that further theoretical and empirical work from nursing and complexity science perspectives is needed to better understand this phenomenon.",

Less attention has been devoted to developing expertise about social, economic, and political contexts that produce ill health around the world. The purpose of this article is to offer a transnational feminist critique of the World Development Report: Gender Equality and Development and to illuminate implications such reports may have in the lives of the world's most marginalized women and girls. We examine the political economy idealized in the report, raising questions about the capitalist framework underpinning its agenda. Second, we examine the assumptive language used in the report, suggesting that it discursively constructs a problematic representation of women in low-income countries. We contend that the report perpetuates a hegemonic discourse of patriarchy and inequality for women in the Global South through the use of an uncontested economic framework and universalist reasoning. We conclude the article with discussion about a transformative policy making that could be more inclusive of the wisdoms, values, and everyday experiences of women living in the Global South and about the vital role nurses can play in advancing gender equity through their active collaboration in policy critique and policy formulation.",

    "abstract": "NURSING THEORIES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY Nursing models, theories, and philosophic frameworks have now been emerging for more than 50 years. Over the years, nursing's theoretical and philosophic heritage has been discounted, even deleted from nursing curricula in favor of content deemed to be more essential. Several months ago, I heard a discussion at a conference that disparaged nursing theories as irrelevant, inadequate, and naive, with an admonition from the speaker to discard nursing theories altogether and replace them with theories from other disciplines. In response to this discussion, I coined the term “nursesogyny” to name an underlying disdain and discounting of nursing that is expressed in discussions such as this one and in actions everyday that discount the value of nursing. Of course, “nursesogyny is closely connected to misogyny in that the ideas and the achievements of nursing's theoretical past were put forth by women. In academic discourse, a critical analysis of any and all ideas is welcomed as a means of refining, developing, and furthering the knowledge of the discipline. One would expect that such analysis would reveal shortcomings that need to be addressed—errors of logic, failure to incorporate significant insights, and inadequacies rooted in time and space. However, the expected outcome of such analysis is not to disparage or throw out the ideas but to recognize the foundational achievements of the past and revise, rebuild, even reconstruct ideas that move disciplinary knowledge forward. Many of the early constructions that are commonly (and loosely) referred to as “nursing theory” do have shortcomings when judged from the perspective of current understandings of theory. However, they remain vital building blocks of nursing's heritage. They provided a starting point and still represent a significant philosophic cornerstone upon which nursing rests and from which nursing practice arises. My own favorite definition of “theory” is that theory is a vision—a mental construction of what could be in human experience. In nursing, these mental constructions provide a roadmap, a path to follow in shaping human experience toward wholeness and well-being. This issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) includes current thinking in nursing that clarifies how and why nursing theories are essential to nursing practice, as well as articles that illustrate current theoretical developments in nursing. Most important, I believe this issue of ANS points in the direction of meaningful connections between theory, research, and practice. This issue begins with a Guest Editorial by our new Associate Editor, Mona M. Shattell, PhD, RN, FAAN. Dr Shattell's clinical specialty is psychiatric and mental health nursing, and she received her PhD in nursing from the University of Tennessee Knoxville.

SBW was positively correlated with undesirable coping behaviors (eg, self-silencing, maladaptive perfectionism) and negatively associated with self-compassion and help-seeking. The most common method of assessing SBW was using a structured questionnaire (n = 21). Longitudinal studies to examine the impact of SBW belief on Black women's coping with hardship were lacking.",

This article presents Parse's theory of human becoming as a model for practice; explicates the beliefs, values, and ethic of the practice method; analyzes the logical coherence of theory and method; illustrates the pragmatics of the method, and gives evidence of its soundness. The theory-research-practice triad developed by Parse articulates a paradigmatic view of the discipline as a whole with a view of the human being as a living unity freely choosing personal meanings in life situations. Parse's practice methodology provides nurses with a way of practicing with a focus on the quality of life as it is humanly lived. It is presented here as the practice component of an emergent theory-research-practice tradition on the cutting edge of nursing science.",

    "abstract": "The reinstatement of social activism as a central feature of nursing practice has been advocated by nursing scholars and is consistent with contemporary conceptualizations of primary health care and health promotion that are rooted in critical social theory's concept of empowerment.Advocacy oral history from a feminist postmodern perspective offers a method of research that has the potential and purpose to empower participants to transform their political and social realities and may, therefore, be considered social activism. A recent study of public health nurses who had experienced significant distress through the reduction and redirection of their practice is provided as an exemplar of advocacy oral history. Philosophies underpinning the research method and characteristics of feminist postmodern research are reviewed and implications for the use of this methodology for social activism in nursing are drawn.",

Problematization consists of two phases: recognition and response. Recognition involves problem indicators varying by type (cumulative vs immediate) and source (personal vs environmental). Movement from recognition to response is hindered by perceptual and enviromental constraints. Response consists of interrelated processes of construction, interaction, action, and validation. On the basis of validation, problems are reconstructed and new problems are recognized as the cycle continues.",

Applying concepts from nursing and general ethics to administrative practice provides a basis for developing an ethical framework for management.

    "abstract": "Women's experiences of sexual assault are rooted in and informed by a history that nurses need to understand in order to provide meaningful and effective care. In this article, we present a comprehensive literature review guided by intersectionality theory to deepen our understanding of the historical role that hegemonic masculinity plays in shaping ethnic minority women's experiences of sexual assault. Final sources included were analyzed using thematic analysis. On the basis of our analyses, we identified 4 themes: social order hierarchies, \"othering\" dynamics, economic labor divisions, and negative media/mass communication depiction. Our findings contribute to our understanding of these important histories that speak to the trauma of sexual violence inflicted upon the bodies of ethnic minority women, which we can incorporate into nursing education curricula. Incorporating this knowledge would equip nurses and allied health professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills that would enable them to help patients navigate multiple systems of oppression as they engage in help seeking following a sexual assault experience. This knowledge also acknowledges rather than dismisses the historically acceptable use of sexual violence against ethnic minority women. In addition, acknowledging these histories enables us to move forward as a society in engaging in an urgently needed cultural shift to address the hegemonic masculinities that perpetuate violence against women in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Chronic illness is a fact of life for many people, but, ironically, the medical system remains ill-prepared to address the experience. For centuries pundits and poets have turned their pens to speculate about causes, to provide a window into understanding the experience. But with the dramatic rise in the incidence of chronic illness, many people now have stories to tell and commonsense wisdom to share about what to do and how to cope. In my own experiences related to coping with chronic illness, I keep asking recurrent rhetorical questions that will not go away, and I think some of the questions deserve consideration in efforts to shape a future for nursing and health care. First, I wonder, why in the face of clear inability to \"cure\" a disease do nurses and other medical care providers continue to move within a frame of reference oriented toward cure? I am not the first to ask this question, and so it seems timely to begin to ponder some responses. As a \"why\" question, some of the first responses seem quite obvious. They don't know what else to do. They have been taught to seek cure at all cost. Patients want cures. However, my experience suggests that actually many do know what else to do, and many patients state clearly and eloquently their realization that cure is not likely to be in their future. To me, the forces that keep many nurses and medical care workers trapped in a frame of reference of cure probably run much deeper, having to do with economic factors, political factors, and perhaps even self-concept and self-esteem issues. If you imagine that it is possible for skilled and intelligent humans to break free of deeply rooted forces that entrap them in a single idea, then the next question might be, What other frames of reference could care providers move toward? A single definitive response to this question is neither possible nor desirable, and this is precisely why it is important to consider every possible response imaginable. One of the starting points needs to be the development of viable frameworks that keep the interests, the experience, and the voice of the person with chronic illness in the center. Here is a dramatic example: Consider what really happens if I approach the current cure-oriented system with the final decision that I do not want further diagnosis and treatment. Even if my care providers (read \"cure\" providers) have carefully explained all of the medical alternatives to me and have stated in words that they will support me whatever my decision, once I declare my decision, what do they offer me? Perhaps they offer me pain relief medication. Perhaps they offer me a referral to a social worker or hospice. But the fact that they essentially consider their job done is a blatant clue that cure is really what they are all about. So what more could they (we) do? If we move to a framework that keeps the person in the center, then I believe that one change in this scenario would be to not simply lay medical information at someone's feet, asking them to now decide. Instead, the discourse around options would include the patient's voice loudly and clearly. If the patient's voice were central, the issues to be considered would not consist only, or even primarily, of medical options and prognostications. The issues would include the philosophic and ethical perspectives of the person, the person's story or narrative, what the person hopes for, who else figures most prominently in what the person is facing, and how all these people together see the situation. This would be a truly shared discourse, not a closed-door conference among the \"professionals.\" Some medical care providers might not need or want to sustain this discourse, but as the discourse emerges, it would be apparent as to who needs to stay. The point would be that someone would stay. There would be a clear, logical, well-suited social and professional role for some care providers to stay. They would have important skills or talents to offer, some knowledge to share, and some healing modalities (not curing modalities) to contribute. This shift requires a shift in framework-a shift that brings everyone's thinking to include an image of how to engage this type of discourse, what the discourse consists of, and who could and would stay given any number of possible discourses. There are several important clues in this issue of ANS (18:3) that can help to build these frameworks. I invite you, the reader, to carefully consider these ideas and to begin to consider how to break into a different kind of caring and healing. I am confident we can do it together. Peggy L.

Since the 1960s, the US health care system has been moving toward increased competition between providers and toward care-avoidance incentives. These incentives created by the Medicate Prospective Payment Systems based on diagnosis related groups, health maintenance organizations, and preferred provider organizations reward the minimization of service. In this context, nurses are not rewarded for trying to care. However, nurses can employ various strategies in nursing education, health care policy formation, and social activism to insist that caring is a nonnegotiable component of nursing work.",

Thus, evolutionary viability within the social context (personal contribution to one's social network) is a crucial health factor; life events, life style determiners, control perceptions, and viability emotions are other important concepts within the model. This model points to the possibility that the full scope of clinical practice may require assisting patients in regaining a sense of viability; nursing may be particularly relevant to this need because of the opportunity for intense interpersonal contact with patients.",

We demonstrate Beck's progression from identification of a clinical problem to exploratory-descriptive research, to concept analysis and midrange theory development, and finally to the application and testing of the theory in the clinical setting. Through ongoing refinement and testing of her theory, Beck has increased its generalizability across various practice settings and continually identifies new issues for investigation. Beck's program of research on PPD exemplifies using nursing outcomes to build and test nursing practice knowledge.",

The public arenas model is used to explore how gender-based power is currently defined and how its definitions can be expanded.

In this article, there is an approach to the science of communication, empathy, and interdependent communication. Drawing from a previous article on the \"space between\" in communication spirals, this article uses mandalas as preparation for and instrument of diverse communication. Emphasis is on mandala usage within reflective practice to consider depth interiority and then using the mandala as metaphor for engaging and sharing with others externally in dialogue. How to construct the mandala is included in this article, and there is an exercise for observation and assessment of mandalas. This novel structure for reflective practice supports developing transformational leaders and communication skill through expressive arts, narratives, and stories in journaling. This article considers the function of mandalas, interruptions in communication patterns, mirror neurons, possible paths, and collaborative outcomes for understanding and achieving interprofessional wisdom. This transformational discovery pathway and narrative exercises can be used for creating professional learning communities. This form of reflective practice has innovative possibilities for increased self-awareness and self-care. Included in this article is a list of awareness/mindfulness behaviors to act as a guide and encourage readers to undertake the reflective journaling process. The discovery pathway journal creates a permanent record of thoughts and anchors through the expressive art. The process refers to the Sigma Theta Tau International's Scholarship of Reflective Practice as important to the practice of nursing.",

The implications for knowledge development as driven by international exemplars, diverse experiences, and narration of stories are discussed.",

The methodology used is social history. The data for the analysis were derived from oral history interviews, archival material, and secondary sources. The study concludes that powerful social contextual factors, such as work force and economic issues, architectural changes, and an increasingly complex hospital population-rather than new technology-supported the development of critical care. The study also provides parallels to contemporary nurse work force issues.",

Carried out in 2002 using a Gadamerian hermeneutic phenomenological approach, the study explored meanings that young people ascribed to their experiences of hope. It was clear from original analysis that the participants expressed hope as a driving force characterized by a necessity for human connectedness and the need to have options and choices in life which when experienced produced feelings of at-one-with. However, missing from this description is the acknowledgement of hope as an embodied experience that enabled resolution of grieving and loss. Reimmersion in the data added new dimensions to my understanding of hope and how it functions in people's lives. In this sense, engagement in secondary analysis fulfilled the goal of philosophic hermeneutics, which is to understand what is involved in the process of understanding itself.",

After the literature review, a concept analysis and a definition of frailty among older PLWH emerged. Implications for further practice, education, public policy, and research are presented to use the concept consistently, develop interventions to prevent frailty, and improve health outcomes.",

More than 20 years later, many of these women are still suffering devastating psychological, social, and physical effects of these experiences and remain in need of effective interventions that address their complex trauma. This article develops the theory of genocide rape trauma management as a conceptual framework for promoting the holistic health and recovery of female genocide rape survivors. A qualitative study using grounded theory explored the lived experiences of genocide rape survivors and led to the development of this model. The need for a contextually appropriate model is highlighted, with historical and current data regarding the Rwandan context and the experiences of genocide rape survivors. The research details the complex dynamics of emotional, physical, existential, and psychosocial sequelae related to genocide rape trauma, and how these interact with both local community and broader political attitudes toward survivors, as well as the serious interrelated economic challenges and limitations in current public health and welfare services. The research demonstrates the necessary elements of a holistic approach encompassing a synergistic combination of skilled psychological care, self-help strategies, collaborative support groups, community education, social reintegration, advocacy, accessible medical care, and economic empowerment. These interacting elements form the basis of the theory of genocide rape trauma management, offering an encompassing integrated framework that can be adapted to, and evaluated in, other similar contexts.",

Thirty Hispanic and black trainees between 17 and 21 years of age were selected to participate in an eight-week, 20-h/w program emphasizing women's health education, health advocacy skills, and career awareness. This project has many implications for nursing practice with young, inner-city women. Enhancing the self-care and advocacy skills of these women maximizes their potential for use of available health services and their ability to influence the expansion of the services required to meet their own and their families' health care needs. Problems in funding and conducting such demonstration projects are discussed.",

Nursing theorizing, whether it occurs primarily at the outset or emerges during the process of inquiry, is inescapably linked to the theorist's value choices and beliefs about human beings, the environment, and health. These choices are reflected in the conceptual frame of one's research. The normative commitment of the conceptual frame is explored using examples from nursing and nonnursing research. Elements of critical ethical reflection are outlined. It is suggested that the discipline's understanding of what constitutes health and how best to promote health, as well as solutions to ethical dilemmas posed by research, may be enhanced by purposeful ethical inquiry that occurs as an integral component of theorizing activities.",

Patients, families, and health professionals are faced with decisions about which treatments and interventions may be futile, but such questions as who decides; how do competing values get resolved; what value is placed on human life; how are decisions balanced according to reason and, in some circumstances, faith; and who decides effect, benefit, and burdens of treatments are often difficult to answer. The naïve reality of medical futility is explored in the natural attitude to expose presumptions and facts related to both physiologic (fact-based) and evaluative (value-based) futility components. Highlights from the bioethical and clinical literature, a review of 3 landmark cases, and implications for nursing practice are presented. This natural attitude description could serve as what ought to be bracketed for a future phenomenology.",

The aim of this article was to bring to the attention of the nursing community the inner workings of mandatory HIV testing and its implications for HIV-positive prisoners. Building on a recent report published by Human Rights Watch, we critically examine the deployment of mandatory HIV testing in state correctional facilities located in Alabama and South Carolina. We, therefore, intend to situate this practice within a bio-political logic and explore its human rights consequence.",

When thinking of smoking with children around, parents engaged in a process of weighing the importance of the need to smoke and adverse effects from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, a consideration based mostly on their experience. A pattern of correspondence was identified between family's level of concern and promoting change among smokers. Many strategies participants used to prevent children's environmental tobacco smoke exposure were relatively ineffective and needed to be addressed.",

This discourse creates the question \"Can we live longer or better?\" and encompasses issues of quality versus quantity, dependency versus autonomy, and risk versus benefit. By positing this discourse as a dichotomous tension, the development can be traced through the examination of select examples of influential studies in the field of aging. For nursing, the risk of these continued oppositions is potential oversimplification that may limit discernment of the complexities of care of older adults. Through understanding of the evolution and imposition of this dichotomizing discourse, nursing can provide older adult care within the reality of the aging experience, and develop frameworks, theories, and multidisciplinary discursive practice to optimize nursing care in the real-world spaces that exist between antiaging and healthy aging boundaries.",

Hypotheses deduced from the model were tested using multiple regression. The Cox model received partial support, in that some client singularity variables were interrelated; they explained nearly half of the variance in health status, but less than 25% of the variance in health risk. Demographic characteristics were not effective predictors in the present study, perhaps because of the homogeneous sample. The model has potential utility for providing baseline information for preventive health programs in occupational settings.",

The vein was a portal of entry for nurses, but one with limited access. What was ultimately ceded to nurses was not full jurisdiction over a domain of nursing practice, but rather a limited settlement in a domain of medical practice.

Results indicate that nurses should be included in health system reconstruction processes and that support for the development of the nursing profession should be included in the plan for overall reconstruction.",

Their article inspired a review of the Canadian Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses, using a Social Justice Gauge developed by the Canadian Nurses Association. The article outlines the development of the gauge and its use in this review. Although some evidence of generic and outdated language is evident in the Canadian code, the text appears well aligned with social justice ideals overall. That being said however, there still remains significant possibility for enlarging the application of social justice, especially in relation to the place of nurses in healthcare institutions and in nontraditional nursing settings, in future revisions of the code. Work to further examine, adapt, and test the Canadian Nurses Association's Social Justice Gauge is encouraged.

This is a story about the workings of gender, race, religion, and nursing.

The article examines Catholic nurses' work with African Americans in the mid-20th century that took place amid the prevailing social conditions of poverty and racial disempowerment, conditions that were linked to serious health consequences. Historical methodology is used within the framework of “bearing witness,” a term often used in relation to the civil rights movement and one the sisters themselves employed. Two situations involving nurses in the mid-20th century are examined: the civil rights movement in Selma, Alabama, and the actions for racial justice in Chicago, Illinois. The thoughts and actions of Catholic sister and brother nurses in the mid-20th century are chronicled, including those few sister nurses who stepped outside their ordinary roles in an attempt to change an unjust system entirely.",

Even when nurses attempt to actively resist racialized stereotypes, most participate in essentialized nursing practice by using racialized institutional practices. Nursing theory needs to expand to help the nurse navigate and understand both the nurses' and client's local histories as well as individual-to-systems level constraints and supports that may impede, or promote, a mother's ability to breastfeed.",

With more than 17% of children and adolescents classified as overweight, the healthcare community must find evidence-based practices to help this population manage their weight and thus lower healthcare costs. The systematic review that the authors conducted analyzed more than 246 possible articles to determine whether there was evidence supporting the use of the Internet in helping this population manage their weight. Of the 246 articles, 8 met the researchers' criteria for inclusion. These studies used interventions such the Internet, e-mail, interactive Web-based programs, or a combination of personal communication along with technology-based interventions to help adolescents regulate their weight. The authors also indicate that Web-based weight management programs may also be beneficial to adolescents in that they may help \"remove social barriers and provide anonymity\" (An, Hayman, Park, Dusaj, & Ayres, 2009, p 237). As more and more consumers become technologically savvy, we in the healthcare profession need to identify more efficient methods to help our clients. One such method could be the inclusion of an Internet-based program to help with the carry-over of education implemented in therapy. The research is indicating that a combination of in-person interventions supplemented by Internet-based programs may be beneficial to helping children and adolescents lose weight. Internet-based programs offer continuation of education at home and can offer a quick way to access answers to common questions. Further research needs to be conducted in order to determine the long-term effects as well as the cost-effectiveness of such programs. Andrea O'Brien, BA Utica College, Utica, New York",

Hypertension in African Americans is less likely to be controlled and this problem is further complicated by failure to adhere to prescribed hypertension management regimens. Oftentimes, health care providers give African American patients with hypertension multiple health \"rules\" to follow that may arouse reactance behaviors: that is, patients may choose to do the opposite of what they are told to do. The theory of psychological reactance offers a framework for understanding the relationship between freedom of choice and adherence to hypertension regimens in African Americans.",

    "abstract": "The Global Nursing Shortage and Healthcare There is growing concern worldwide that the current nursing shortage has far-reaching effects, not only for the people worldwide who need expert nursing care but also for nurses and nursing. A project spearheaded by the International Council of Nurses and the Florence Nightingale International Foundation1 provides a preliminary summary of many of the professional issues arising from the global crisis. The issues are wide-ranging, including political and economic effects of the crisis, ethical challenges, quality-of-care concerns, and professional standards of licensure and registration worldwide. As the current information from the International Council of Nurses initiative shows, specific evidence concerning the extent of recruitment and migration of nurses across national boundaries is lacking and remains inconclusive. However, since it is clear that there are serious professional and ethical issues involved, the best nursing scholarship is needed if responsible actions are formed for the foreseeable future. The historical colonization and exploitation by the most privileged nations has left a blatant trail of evidence concerning the harm to human well-being that results from irresponsible, uninformed, and ill-advised dominance. Nurses, particularly nurse leaders and nurse scholars, remain culpable as participants if they ignore the looming harm created by the worldwide nursing crisis, and fail to bring their perspectives to bear in debates and the decision-making arenas. If more powerful nations sustain the historical trend to exploit the less powerful nations in relation to the nursing and healthcare crisis, then the most capable nurses from all areas of the world will gradually migrate to the more privileged and powerful countries, leaving those less privileged with a serious deficit in healthcare. The standards of care will begin to reflect even wider disparities, with higher standards of care for those most privileged, and lower, even unacceptable, standards of care for those with the greatest needs. The challenges seem so large that it is tempting to retreat. However, I believe that it is possible to take important steps that could create a shift that will benefit nurses and those they serve. Discussion and debate of the issues in each nursing community to raise awareness of the issues is an important first step toward creating this shift. In today's world, every nurse has some contact with nurses and patients from other countries, and serious discussion about the issues as seen from each individual's perspective contributes to mutual awareness and understanding. If nurse leaders and scholars make a serious commitment to explore the issues involved, and to create well-informed and well-designed proposals for implementation, then they can make important contributions in the direction of worldwide equity and justice. They can renew a commitment to bring the best of nursing education to nurses worldwide. They can engage in exchanges with nurses across international boundaries to better understand the real challenges of nursing and healthcare in cultures that differ from their own. They can use evidence of best practices from nursing scholarship to inform policy-makers and health-related decision makers worldwide. Nurses worldwide have a wealth of knowledge, insight, talent, and ingenuity. What is needed now is a growing sense of the global significance of what they have to offer, and the will to bring their talents to the table. Peggy L. Chinn PhD, RN, FAAN, Editor",

Nonetheless, problems abound in combining 2 dissimilar data sets from 2 different methodologies. One way that numerical and textual data can be merged is through a research method called statistical triangulation. The purpose of this article was to describe the statistical triangulation of a simultaneous, between-methods causal model and grounded theory investigation that explained psychological adaptation in dying persons. The statistical triangulation involved the analysis of selected patterns of dying from the grounded theory study with the variables used in the causal model investigation. A 1-way analysis of variance confirmed that the variables of social support, physical function, and religious preference impacted end-of-life patterns. Post hoc comparisons validated the conceptualization of 3 patterns of dying (becoming, anguishing/agonizing, avoiding) that emerged from the qualitative data. Although there are limitations to this analysis, statistical triangulation shows promise as a research method for enriching qualitative description.",

    "abstract": "The idea of “discipline” has been on my mind recently, having spent some extended time with 2 different sets of toddlers and their parents over the past several weeks. Of course, each set of parents deals with discipline in entirely different ways, but their balancing act is the same—the ever-present tension between constraint and freedom. It occurred to me that in fact, this is the same tension that could be thought of as characterizing the different but related concept of a scientific discipline. The discipline is distinguished by the social and cultural constraints that are imposed both externally and internally. The definition of the science, the phenomena on concern, the group's collectively accepted knowledge, the accepted methods and practices—all form a structure, without which the discipline would be indistinguishable. At the same time, if these constraints were sufficiently restricting the freedom to explore, respond to societal change, and propose and act on cutting-edge inspirations, the discipline would wither and die. The group can sustain itself over time only if there is a considerable value placed on the work of those who demonstrate the creativity and capability to branch out into uncharted territory and explore that which at first lies outside the accepted norms. This issue of ANS represents a particularly strong contribution to the kind of exploration that challenges many of the constraints of our discipline. Several of the articles advance perspectives that are not yet widely familiar within nursing, and some elicit strong controversy, even objection. There is a particularly important collection of articles in the electronic section of this issue that addresses the focus of the discipline of nursing. Here you will find the most recent work of several scholars who have written classic works on the focus of the discipline, with new insights that advance their prior thinking. In addition, you will find the work of scholars whose work has not previously been published on this topic, bringing important challenges, critiques, and possibilities to light for all to consider. The kind of debate and controversy that exists related to matters such as the focus on the discipline of nursing is a signal of the vital health of our discipline. It signifies the fact that nursing is not stagnant and overly constrained by preconceived assumptions. It signifies an intellectual maturity that is required collectively to advance the discipline. Not all perspectives put forth in a journal article find a receptive audience. But the fact that all of these perspectives are expressed and available for open debate gives the entire audience the opportunity to weigh the merits of each. It is the collective audience that determines the emerging standards and the accepted and prevailing points of view and, over time, reshapes the constraints of the discipline. Surely this issue of ANS will inspire many readers to lend their points of view to the discussions that are presented here. Send us your letters! We will publish them in future issues of the journal.

The ethnographic method was used. The research participants were persons with PIMD and their mothers, nurses, and welfare workers. The results indicated that care aims at autonomy based on intentions in response to signs. These findings suggest that this practice emancipated persons with PIMD and their mothers from the Japanese “culture of shame” and enable their autonomy.",

    "abstract": "NURSING MODELS FOR THE FUTURE: ACKNOWLEDGING THE POLITICAL NATURE OF NURSING What are models of care? Why do they matter? And what models do we need for the future? I think it is important for nurses to consider these questions on at least 3 levels: the individual practitioner at point of care, the employment context in which that care is provided, and the sociopolitical environment that influences both health and health care delivery. At all 3 levels, I would argue that the practice of nursing is inherently political. At the point of care, common issues requiring nursing advocacy include the imperative for human-centered caring and the right to work to full scope of practice. I am a strong believer in the need for strong and well-articulated nursing models of care that are useful in guiding nursing practice and in helping to define the scope of that practice. Although, legally, nursing is a self-regulating profession in many jurisdictions, in reality, the scope of nursing practice is most often defined by employers and underutilizes the full potential of nurses. A nursing model can provide both the language and a theoretical basis that enables nurses to advocate clearly, confidently, and credibly both for optimal patient care and for healing environments. For example, a nursing model can assist nurses in communicating the nature, scope, and value of nursing's contribution to the multidisciplinary team and serve as an educative tool in nurses' advocacy for full scope of practice. At the point of care, situation- and/or setting-specific models need to be made accessible to nurses, for example, as apps on smartphones. Models of the future need to be researchable so that evidence of their effectiveness can be linked to positive patient outcomes. It will be important for nurses at point of service to be involved in developing nursing practice models if they are to be embraced as relevant and helpful practice tools. Nurses work in environments of competing paradigms, most prominently the biomedical and corporate models. A nursing model can make visible to nurses themselves, the unique contribution, and value of nursing care and thus provide a reference point from which to recognize and evaluate competing paradigms. While conducting research for my dissertation in the mid-1990s, I spoke to a number of public health nurses who told me that many programs that traditionally had been their responsibility, for example, prenatal classes, were no longer considered appropriate because they were secondary prevention whereas the new direction for public health was focused on primary prevention. Notwithstanding the questionable administrative interpretations of the levels of prevention, I asked these study participants the origins of these terms. The common perception was that they came from government directives; not one participant recognized them as concepts from a medical model of health promotion. A nursing model can serve as a reference point against which to critically evaluate the congruence of new and emerging trends, often based on dominant models that may be incongruent with nursing values and may compromise patient care. The uncritical acceptance and unwitting assimilation of such models may lead nurses into inadvertently becoming complicit in devaluing and limiting their own scope of practice. Nursing care is strongly influenced by the employment environment in which nurses work. Models of care delivery determine how nursing care is assigned and may facilitate or create barriers to a human-centered, relational approach to care. Likewise, the mission and philosophy of a health care agency are important for communicating its values and priorities. An agency's philosophy may or may not be informed by a nursing conceptual framework/philosophy creating an environment that supports excellence in nursing care. Furthermore, inconsistencies may exist between an agency's published mission/philosophy statements and workplace realities. Dominant paradigms, such as the biomedical and business models, may play a much more significant role than an organization's public statements acknowledge. For example, in practice, medical diagnosis and treatment may be a much higher priority than human-centered patient care. When that is the case, the aspects of nursing practice that overlap or directly support medical practice become more highly valued than relational caring actions. Provision of excellent nursing care may also be compromised by an organizational priority of meeting profit-margin goals to satisfy investors. Furthermore, meeting those goals commonly earns bonuses for already highly paid chief executive officers. Both these realities may compete with patient care resources and result in fewer nurses per patient and/or reductions in services and/or supplies. Working in such realities, it is important for nurses not to assimilate the dominant paradigms, for example, that optimal nursing care is not affordable. A nursing model that grounds nurses in nursing ideals can provide a basis for resisting trends that compromise patient care. The third level to examine in considering models of care for the future is the sociopolitical context in which we live and in which care is provided. It has been more than 35 years since representatives from countries around the world gathered in Alma-Ata, USSR, and concurred that health was about more than health care. The Alma-Ata conference formed the basis for identifying social, economic, and political factors that influenced health, factors that became widely known as social determinants of health. The Declaration of Alma-Ata, which emerged from this conference, the numerous others that have followed from the World Health Organization, and a vast body of subsequent research, have shaped an understanding of what it means to be healthy and identified which socioeconomic factors influence health. Addressing those factors, such as income, equity, shelter, food, and education, occurs through the enactment of public policies. Examples include policies related to the provision of affordable housing, a fair minimum wage, equitable employment, affordable education, and universal health care. And yet governments continue to vary in their willingness to adopt such policies. An analysis of political traditions on health outcomes indicates that countries such as Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, whose governments have adopted social policies focused on reducing social inequities, fare better on health outcomes, particularly infant mortality rates and life expectancy, than countries whose governments do not such as Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.1 Government policy decisions thus have implications not only for nursing practice in terms of the focus of health promotion efforts but also for funding of nursing services to vulnerable populations that are more likely to become ill and less likely to be able to afford health care. Future models of care must consider all 3 levels. To assist nurses to value and make visible nursing knowledge and practice, they must be grounded solidly in the nursing discipline. Yet, to serve nurses as a tool of resistance to policies that damage health or limit the public's access to nursing services, I believe they must also be informed by critical social theories. Conceptual models and grand theories will continue to be important for providing a philosophical basis for practice and may also serve as frameworks for health care and academic settings, for example, to guide development of institutional standards for patient care or curriculum development. Furthermore, they provide a solid nursing anchor from which situation- and setting-specific models can be developed, models that may also be based on congruent theories from other disciplines and that can be used by nurses and other health care professionals. What models we need depends on our values and vision for a preferred future, not only for nursing but also for humanity! To support a vision that nurses play a critical role in promoting health and healing for all, nursing models must move beyond the premise that health is an individual responsibility, acknowledge the important role played by socioeconomic determinants, and include political activism as a means to redress them. —Adeline Falk-Rafael, PhD, RN, FAAN ANS Advisory Board Senior Scholar School of Nursing York University Toronto, Ontario, Canada",

I argue that renewed attention to hermeneutics would help us focus on the \"situatedness\" of nursing scholars, the class politics of academia, and a better balance in interpretative work between faith and suspicion. Critical hermeneutics also offers a more robust understanding of praxis and phronesis, and links to pragmatism and social studies of science.",

Guided by the unitary caring theory and unitary-caring hermeneutic-phenomenological research method, this study was conducted among 15 family caregivers of persons in the hospital who have survived strokes through in-depth semi-structured interviews. Five essences emerged from the analysis: living in a dark reality; yearning for professional support; enduring a life full of tribulations; attempting resolution; and creating new patterns of living. Each of the 5 essences was interpreted from Smith's unitary caring theory perspective.",

    "abstract": "It seems quite amazing to me that the health of the environment has become a contentious political issue in the United States and much of the developed world. Certain norms where health and protection are concerned are relegated to a purely personal level, but environmental health involves matters that are political and that directly affect the social and interpersonal aspects of living and in turn are shaped by social and interpersonal dynamics of the culture. The earth, our physical environment, is in fact our fundamental home. It is a home we all share with one another and with a vast assortment of other living creatures. I wonder why it is that as a society, as a culture, we do not assume that taking care of this home is a given and why social and cultural norms of respect and protection fail to prevail. Instead, people who are concerned about the health of the environment or who have a vision of what is required to restore and protect the health of the environment carry the burden of entering the public arena of debate and action that is called politics. Nurses, like any other people who claim a social role of \"health care provider,\" can and do enter this public arena of debate and action. Nurses do not need to be, nor should we be, uniquely involved in political action to protect the environment. This is a challenge that requires a broad spectrum of attention, moving outside the boundaries of professional lines. What we can offer to the debates because of our perspective as nurses could, however, bring about some noticeable changes. The authors of the collection of articles in this issue of ANS (18:4) provide important suggestions. A central theme in the work of these authors is an issue that I see as primary, which is to conceptualize and reconceptualize the scope of phenomena we are addressing and how we view the phenomena of environment. The perspective that nurses tend to bring to the conceptualization of environment is a broad, inclusive, and holistic perspective. Nursing's concept of environment includes the physical environment as well as the interrelated social and psychological environment. It is the world we live in, how it is constituted, and how it constitutes us. Another contribution that nursing can develop is to the research and knowledge that grow from inquiry grounded in a comprehensive, holistic stance. As a discipline, we have made some important moves toward developing the methods and the designs, as well as creative modes of inquiry, to bring to light that which is hidden from view within a particularistic stance. The insights that we are capable of bringing to light could make significant differences in the direction of future political debates and public discourses. Nursing's concept of environment is not the environment currently in vogue on the political football field. Consistent with the dominant view of the modern world, the current political debates center around an isolated body of water, or a selected endangered species, or a planned project to dam a river. These are all worthy issues and deserve their constituents' attention. However, the failure of this approach is inherent in the individualistic, cellular, particularistic view that brings the issues to the table. If the primary discourse assumed a grasp of the essential interrelatedness of our earth and life, I believe the debates could evolve to a level of discourse concerning broad and sweeping shifts that would lead to true caring for earth and life. I challenge each reader of this issue of ANS to consider the views and perspectives of these authors as they relate to your own work and life. Consider what next steps we can all take to more fully bring these perspectives to the public discourse tables and to the political debate arenas. Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "Sometimes I wonder what nursing theory will look like in the future. What if nurses truly viewed our mission in society as deeply connected with the healing arts? My perspective on nursing as a healing art has begun to change over the past several months as I have been teaching beginning nursing skills to entering nursing students and at the same time completing a study on the art of nursing. Ironically, what I find I am called on to teach as \"nursing skills\" and what practicing nurses reveal as their \"skills\" are drastically different. In my nursing skills classes, we address things that nurses in the acute care setting are called on to do. Despite many theoretical and philosophical perspectives that defy defining nursing by what we do, the entering students still encounter the \"doing\" of nursing. Their questions, wisely, usually enter into the realm of being and knowing. They imagine various circumstances and wonder how to adapt their approach to the circumstances. They recall their own experiences as patients and imagine how their experience might have been different. They typically begin with a desire to make a deep connection with the people they encounter in the \"doing\" and keep probing for ways to imagine how this connection might be fulfilled while they are \"doing\" the acts of bathing, giving medications, or assisting with walking. Indeed, I encounter the beginner's concern with becoming practiced and skilled with the various nursing acts, but their concern is much more complex than simply wanting to have the psychomotor skills in place. In my study of the art of nursing, the concern for connection is even more evident. We found a deep, heartfelt reaching out that was expressed in words and movements as the nurses responded to the experience in the moment. We observed nurses looking deeply into the situation using their eyes, their touch, their words, their moves in and out of a situation to create a connection. The \"doing\" of tasks seemed like the ability to play a scale on a musical instrument, making it sound like a symphony. What came through was the experience of deep connection, of a nurse giving meaning to a situation through her way of being and acting in the situation. It was never the prescribed ways that might be implied in physician's prescriptions; rather, it was a way of creating experience that spoke through the situation. In my recent experience, both beginning students and experienced nurses are challenging the predominance of epistemologic primacy and calling for a way of being that conveys both personal and professional meaning to their experiences in interaction with other people. What I have experienced in these two aspects of my work-my teaching and my research-is reflective of the challenges raised by Silva, Sorrell, and Sorrell. [1] In the future, they state, \"both nurses and nursing students must understand how to learn rather than how to hoard knowledge, how to critique rather than how to accept, how to expand rather than how to contract.\" [1] (p12) The theories of the discipline will begin to change drastically if these shifts are to occur. Theories will become avenues for learning, for critical thinking, for expanding possibilities beyond that which can be predicted and into realms that can be created. There are many aspects of the articles collected for this issue of ANS (19:3) that point in the direction of emerging possibilities. The very definitions of middle-range theory implied in this collection defy a single, limited perspective. Together, the articles in this issue point to a number of possibilities for the future of nursing as a healing science-art. Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

The processes of sex education are governed by parents' perceptions of providing protection for the child through the identification and control of boundaries. Major variables moderating the quality of protection are mutuality, knowledge, and values. Using the theory of protection, suggestions are offered for clinical practice, parent teaching, and further investigation.",

Discussion focuses particularly on inference, probability, and cause and effect, significant components of empiricism, as they have influenced the direction of the mind/body debate in health care during the 20th and early 21st centuries.

    "abstract": "Nurses published dialogues on wisdom; yet, a conceptual model is unavailable. We present the development process for a theory of wisdom-in-action for clinical nursing developed in 3 phases: (1) a deductively derived model using derivation and synthesis; (2) inductively, a constructivist grounded theory captured the experience of wisdom in nursing practice; and (3) the 2 theories were synthesized into a nascent theory. The theory describes 2 antecedent dimensions, person-related and setting-related factors, and 2 types of wisdom, general and personal. The theory provides a framework for translating wisdom in nursing practice, depicting both the science and art of nursing.",

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how the Identity, Research, and Health Dialogic Open-Ended (I-ReH-DO) Interview was used across 3 separate research topics to enhance emancipatory knowledge development. Three featured research topics focus on health issues relevant to populations worldwide, including asthma management, hypertension management, and preconception care. The use of the I-ReH-DO Interview across multiple studies supports the power of participants to define identity and its health significance, contextualizes research analysis, and advances emancipatory understandings.",

Implications reflect the importance of creating methodologies that incorporate the ways of knowing of the group being studied, which is best accomplished by a researcher who comes from within the ranks of the population being studied.",

The purpose of this study was to use focused ethnography to explore the co-cultural communicative practices that African American women use when seeking depression care. The concept of intersectionality was used to contextualize 5 domains that explained the depth and breadth of African American women's experiences and communication strategies when seeking care for depression.",

We illustrate through case studies how epistemic injustice is manifested in the delivery of reproductive health care services for women from Somalia, even though it may not be intended or recognized as injustice. Testimonial injustice occurs when women are not believed or are discredited in their aim to receive care. Hermeneutic injustice occurs when a significant area of one's social experience is obscured from understanding owing to flaws in group knowledge resources for understanding. For example, women from Somalia may not receive full disclosure about the diagnostic or treatment services that are recommended in the reproductive health care setting. We explore how the many intersections in a person's identity can give rise to epistemic injustice and we suggest more expansive ways of evaluating the validity of diverse epistemologies in patient-centered care. Structural competency is recommended as a way nurses and other health care providers can mitigate the social determinants of health, which contribute to epistemic injustice.",

And yet, this utilitarian tool has attracted considerable controversy and polarized opinions. This article uses Blumer's adaptation of symbolic interactionism as a theoretical roadmap to examine the various meanings ascribed to the facemask and its usage.

Situated within Foucault's theories of power, we review how the power of organizations reaches into the fabric of everyday life and explore how philanthropic foundations have influenced a diverse array of disciplines, including nursing. Through a genealogic lens, we examine nursing history and professionalization and conclude with concerns surrounding nursing's exercise of its collective agency during one of the most significant, discipline-shaping activities of modern times—Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Future of Nursing initiatives.",

    "abstract": "As the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the health disparities that existed prior but with a widening gap, there is a call to us in the profession of nursing to take an introspective view on how research has been conducted with a focus on positionality. The communities in most need of quality, community-driven research have not been represented in research, nor in health care in general. Research teams have typically excluded those communities in which we are studying; yet, we as a profession have not held researchers accountable to declaring our positionality to the research being conducted. As a scientific community, we have not fostered individuals in marginalized communities to become researchers who would add immense and nuanced insight into the understanding of health equity research by virtue of their positionality and lived experience. Therefore, though National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) pour billions of dollars into research every year, our health outcomes are not any better because we have failed to address this issue of positionality. Based on a recent analysis of NIH funding based on applications submitted from 2011 to 2015, there remains a huge gap in African American/Black scientists, and topic choice alone explained 20% of the funding gap after controlling for other factors.1 The lack of diversity of those receiving the most amount of money from federal funders like the NIH or NSF2 directly reflects the fact that researchers are not asking the kinds of questions most relevant to underserved communities and are not typically including members of these communities in their research proposals. More importantly, they are not in positions of power like on the Scientific Review Groups that evaluate proposals and can significantly affect funding decisions. By forcing researchers to declare their positionality to the topic or community in which they are researching, as a profession and as a science community, we are forcing researchers to think about their own limitations and the lens they bring to their research. This is imperative not only in funding decisions but also in editorial boards as it relates to publishing. I had the privilege of serving on a task force with Advances of Nursing Science journal when we revised our submission guidelines and specifically asked authors to state positionality in relation to their work. Contextualizing the researcher in relation to the topic or research being conducted is essential because it could expose limitations of the results of the research and how it should be interpreted. A great example of this was highlighted by Lett et al in coining the term \"health equity tourism,\" which they define as \"researcher without prior experience or commitment to health equity research—parachuting into the field in response to timely and often temporary increases in public interest and resources.\"3(p2) We must expect better from nursing scholars and the scientific community if we are truly going to do research that actually addresses health inequity and improves health outcomes for all. —Jennifer Woo, PhD, CNM, WHNP, FACNM Assistant Professor Texas Woman's University Denton, Texas",

The analysis led to a comprehensive list of the antecedents, attributes, and consequences of precision medicine in multiple settings. With this understanding, precision medicine becomes part of the broader practice of precision health, an important process proposed by nursing scholars to provide complete, holistic care to our patients.

    "abstract": "The issue topic “Advances in Research Methods” drew a strong response from authors, resulting in the extension of this topic for 2 issues. The articles in this, and the previous, issue of ANS demonstrate the significant work that nurse scholars have accomplished in developing methods that are well suited to our discipline. Unlike the early debates over the merits of borrowing from other disciplines versus developing our own theories and methods, nurse scholarship today reflects a maturity that acknowledges the worth of a wide array of approaches to develop knowledge needed for excellent, evidence-based nursing practice. The quest for new and improved methods is not simply a search for something to replace that which is traditionally accepted practice. Nursing scholarship and nursing practice are built upon an epistemologic stance that seeks knowing of the whole, not just the parts. Similar to the epistemology that gives rise to feminist scholarship,1 this well-recognized epistemologic commitment to wholism gives rise to nursing scholarship. Some of the methods that have served many disciplines well also serve nursing well, but many methods that are well accepted in other disciplines have been found to be wanting when nurse scholars apply them to nursing problems. Some of the methods can be used in combination with other methods to move closer to a comprehensive understanding of the whole. Some scholars seek new and innovative methods that serve the purposes of their work more fully. Grasping the whole is not a simple matter, and even grasping what this means challenges the best thinkers in nursing. The newer and more creative methods require long and dedicated testing to determine their worth in terms of scientific merit. Some will fall by the wayside, while others will become a solid part of nursing's accepted methodologic approaches. Many of the authors who have contributed to these 2 issues of ANS have taken considerable risk in developing and publishing their ideas and conceptualizations. Their work now stands before all of us to respectfully consider and debate. Their contributions are significant and contribute a forum from which the next generation of nursing scholarship can emerge. Send your ideas and responses to their work in the form of a letter to the editor. We will share your responses in future issues of the journal, and continue the discussions that are vital to the ongoing development of our discipline.",

Since this time, HIV prevention changed from behavior modification to testing to treatment as prevention to chemoprophylaxis using HIV medications among HIV-negative persons. While these modifications have been heralded as public health successes, critical evaluations are needed. In this article, we present one such review in which we argue that HIV prevention, while previously disciplinary in the Foucauldian sense, has become controlling in the Deleuzian sense. In this way, the parameters of context are targeted and behavior change is less relevant. This highlights the importance of questioning public health \"advancements\" and using novel theoretical lens to do so.",

The position statement endorses a zero-tolerance response, which is moralist, punitive, and questionably effective. It problematically presents patient and coworker violence as equivalent.

    "abstract": "I was intrigued to read the article titled, “‘No One Gets Through It OK’: The Health Challenges of Coming Home From War,”1 in the July-September issue of Advances in Nursing Science. This article caught my attention because I am an Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran attending college. I was pleased to see the qualitative approach to acquiring data on the health challenges faced by reintegrating veterans of war. The author captured many of the same obstacles I faced while reentering my civilian life. The term “flipping the switch”1 particularly resonated with me because this term was used frequently during my time of military service. I feel that there are benefits to listening and analyzing firsthand accounts of the experiences that are troubling returning veterans; a simple postdeployment survey does not allow for that intimate exchange. However, I feel that combining both qualitative and quantitative data, in a mixed-method approach, will give the researcher a much more accurate assessment of an individual's condition. I would like to recommend some additional articles for your reading on the matter of posttraumatic stress disorder. Both supporting articles are from Military Medicine and use samples of individuals who have registered for Veterans Affairs health care.2,3 The authors James et al3 used 3 trials of postdeployment evaluation tests on the participants, the first of which was conducted approximately 6 months after they returned from war, the next was conducted at 12 months, and the third was conducted at 24 months. All the tests preformed were self-administered in the form of questionnaires. However, none of these studies were conducted immediately after the individuals were discharged from military service. This is an issue because the stresses of a transition can weigh heavily on an individual's ability to cope with previously suppressed issues and could therefore trigger a delayed onset of posttraumatic stress disorder. As per the article,1 I would like to mention that the use of a team to analyze the qualitative data could have shown benefits, with multiple views on the subjective storytelling method. In addition, with multiple researchers reviewing the data, perhaps the precision of the analysis would increase. This is important in establishing validity, reliability, and overall credibility of the research. The Wands et al1 article was well arranged and the research was well conducted. I enjoyed reading this article because I gained insight into the lives of fellow veterans as they try to overcome the challenges of regaining their civilian identities. I feel that this study can contribute to multiple disciplines in the medical field and as such provide relevant information to better accommodate veterans of war in all settings. —Steven J.

    "abstract": "RESPONSE TO CRITIQUE OF \"CARING AS EMANCIPATORY NURSING PRAXIS: THE THEORY OF RELATIONAL CARING COMPLEXITY\" RESPONSE We wish to thank the doctoral students of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, for their thoughtful evaluative critique of and suggestions to enhance our article, \"Caring as Emancipatory Nursing Praxis: The Theory of Relational Caring Complexity.\"1 Drs Marilyn Ray and Marian Turkel have provided a response to this critique. This article examined the importance of nursing praxis by asserting that a social caring ethic, a practice of how we think about nursing's responsibility of human caring in complex health care organizations, needs be woven into the cultural context of day-to-day nursing practice. A social caring ethic illuminates through critical reflection and reasonable communication the core values of nursing as caring—love and compassion, and ethics—respect for human dignity, human rights, and justice (fairness) within the nurse-patient relationship. The reflective practice science articulated in this article on caring as emancipatory nursing praxis focuses on highlights of Ray and Turkel's extensive 30-year research trajectory on caring science, technology, politics, economics, and organizational complexity and applications in practice gleaned from the advancement of the Theory of Relational Caring Complexity, a theory that integrates human capital and social justice—the meaning of caring as the essence of nursing and ethical principles of fairness, respectively. Praxis of this kind is \"thoughtful action, ... knowing of, in, and through doing,\"2(p69) as Sandelowski stated. Human capital recognizes that both the nurse and the patient are autonomous beings worthy of respect and dignity. The nurse who is invested in the patient cares who the patient (and family or family of choice) is, what the patient's needs and limitations are, what is conducive to the patient's needs, what the social context may be, and also what the limitations may be for the one caring (from Mayeroff).3 Coevolving the integral nature of this knowing facilitates a deeper understanding of relationship as it is unfolding. The examples of emancipatory nursing praxis highlighted in this article may seem \"simple\" to some readers; however, they were initiated by nurses themselves in relation to patients' and significant others' needs and the context (the hospital, the school, the street, the home) wherein the practice of nursing took place. The decision to initiate these practices and to identify which practices to initiate was accomplished by the nurses practicing at the bedside; they were not selected by the hospital administrators or nursing leaders as a top-down process. That action in itself is reflective of emancipatory nursing praxis, and as acknowledged in this article, nurses self-identified that \"this is freeing.\" The nurses choose what they wanted to do and then did it. Although the reality of the practice environment is busy, chaotic, and complex, nurses are making the choice to integrate caring into practice. The ideas suggested by the doctoral students in this critique—that practice is too busy to allow for this to occur—are not reflective of the nursing cultures within the hospitals cited as exemplars for this article. Yes, practice is busy but nurses are making an ethical choice and making the time to integrate caring-healing modalities into practice. Their actions were different from those of a leader identifying practices for nurses or bringing in a consultant who tells nurses what to do. The nurses in these exemplars illuminated the art of praxis—human rights and social caring justice, \"...nurses' obligation to understand social contexts, promote moral mindfulness, seek ethical knowledge, exercise ethical evaluation and judgment, and promote caring as emancipatory praxis within the moral community.\"1(p144) Caring-healing modalities such as self-care, aromatherapy, and hand massages initiated with intentionality and authentic presence are not simple but reflective of Caritas Process #8: Creating Healing Environments at All Levels4 and are tangible and meaningful expressions of the integration of Watson's Theory of Human Caring into Practice. Buying a bus pass for a family member to be with a loved one is a genuine expression of Caritas Process #1: Practice of Loving Kindness to Others4 and knowing what is most important to the family member at that time. The exemplars cited in this article serve as \"forms of evidence\" reflective of aesthetic knowing in practice and especially for Dr Watson when she does site visits to designate hospitals as Watson Caring Science Institute (WCSI) affiliates.5 Many of the exemplars referenced in this article are reflective of the Caritas Coach projects of registered nurses prepared at the baccalaureate and graduate levels (www.WCSI.org). It was beyond the scope of this article to identify the research guided by appreciative inquiry and caring science that took place in the hospitals cited. Within the past 2 years, an increased number of Caritas Coaches have been PhD prepared and are using qualitative and quantitative methods grounded in concepts relative to emancipatory nursing and caring science. Coaches, WCSI faculty, academics, and PhD researchers from the practice setting study the practice/\"work\" environment of registered nurses in Magnet hospitals, many of which are WCSI5 affiliates and compare and contrast data in hospitals where a caring science theoretical foundation for nursing practice is not part of the practice environment. —Marilyn A.

    "abstract": "INNOVATION IN NURSING: ONLY RADICAL CHANGE WILL DO For several decades the most prestigious health and human service organizations, both public and private, have called for significant restructuring and revisioning of how health services are delivered. Likewise, environmental scientists have doggedly tried to make the case for a global response to impending environmental and ultimately increasing human, read—human health—disaster. Nursing as both an organized body of professionals and a disciplinary body of knowledge has as yet failed to address major change through major innovation. Radical change is called for, change that is not incremental or a rehashing of traditional perspectives and methods, but the change that is dramatic and abrupt, creative and feeling like a risk, one that is threatening to all stakeholders in the way great change feels at first. Woman's suffrage, civil rights, same-sex marriage, legalization of marijuana, LGBTQ in the US military, and immigration reform are examples of areas in which only swift and abrupt change either eliminated or set in motion a path to eliminate barriers to people's needs. Ultimately, incrementality, while somewhat helpful, did not create the vast changes required in these examples. In nursing, we are well past the point for which disparate, incremental innovation is keeping up with the health needs of people and their communities. Radical change is required. The quality of ideas and the breadth of innovation is a notion that is not given enough attention in nursing. I admire the authors whose innovations are included in this issue of ANS and nurses everywhere who struggle to make things better. Many nurses, perhaps most nurses, working today have a critique of their workplace, and they have ideas for improving or changing how things are done for patients—some things to improve patient outcomes and some things to improve the working conditions of nurses. Many are frustrated, seeing persistent problems that are not addressed, and feel unable to create change; many, most, were inadequately prepared for becoming change agents in school; most lack the key elements for change and that is the ability to critically analyze the social, political, and cultural milieu in which they work, the power dynamics of the setting, and their own power to make change. However, nurses would have to be educated during their time in school to have the skills and confidence to become real innovators. Or, practicing nurses need to form “study groups” where they can develop the knowledge, skills, and confidence to innovate. Emphasis on critical social theory, feminism, social justice, and the political, social, and economic basis of nursing and more generally, health care, would be needed. Nurses could effect greater change and greater good outcomes for a greater number of persons and communities by learning to be, and rewarded for being, imaginative, creative, and critical. Not all ideas are good enough or innovative enough or potentially efficacious enough to achieve desired outcomes. There is a lack of imagination and creativity in advancing new ideas for how nursing is accomplished and particularly, from my perspective as a nurse educator, how nursing education gets done. There are thousands of ways to meet any desired goal. There seems to be a lack in creating truly progressive nursing care delivery and education. Even indices such as healthy people goals are chronically underaddressed and not given their due as primary foci for the profession and for professional education. We continue to support the biomedical industrial complex and fail to reject its greed-inspired tenets and inadequate solutions to human health and illness. We continue to take a back seat and not forward the nursing philosophies and holistic, humanistic, and caring agenda that most nurses value. If so-called innovative programs such as Magnet Status Programs and the essentials by which we educate students according to accreditation standards are indicative of progress, change, and innovation, we may be in trouble. While achieving institutional recognition for indices-oriented quality improvement programs brings some changes that nurses recognize as desirable in terms of safety, quality, and improved outcomes, the primary beneficiary is the hospital. The intention is not to overhaul the infrastructure to provide innovative patient care and an environment for actual professional nursing to occur guided by nursing's extensive body of knowledge. Similarly, teaching to the test and basing nursing education standards on outmoded ideas of what the majority of persons and communities need (acute care in hospital) rather than ideas of what evidence has indicated most persons need (nonroutinized, holistic, socially critical care in community) is dangerous. We have an unhealthful and in-need populace that clearly demonstrates this position. Radical change is required. Indeed, the focus on another “innovation” such as electronic medical records and the seeming acceptance by many nurses as they turn their face away from patients and clients toward the computer screen is a serious example of nurses not speaking up and pulling the plug on a lousy idea (or at least lousy implementation of a good idea). There may also be a widespread blind acceptance that those designing and selling these systems provide safeguards for the ethical issues of confidentiality and privacy. However, presently, electronic medical records may be a technology that is running ahead in terms of sales and implementation without necessary addressing of the ethical dimension and unthought-of potential problems for confidentiality and privacy. The motivation for institutions and organizations to accept and initiate electronic medical records primarily for cost-cutting measures trumps potential risks to patients and families. As demonstrated by the inequitable and fragmented infrastructures and systems dominating health services, it is clear that protecting profit is more important than protecting patients and improving health outcomes, safety, and quality. If designed and implemented with the patient as the clear recipient of benefit, electronic medical records could indeed be an enormous help in the continuity and comprehensiveness of health care. A large part of the “fix” would have to be disconnecting the nurse and doctor from the computer during their interactions with people so they can provide the simplest of human-human endeavors: looking at and listening to the recipient of their care. Moreover, the money and time and effort to establish and expand simulation in education may be a misguided use of the processes of imagination and innovation. Many will not agree with this statement despite a lack of empirical evidence that demonstrates that better student outcomes are without a doubt associated with the use of simulation and not other factors of enhancing the teaching-learning process, There is no denying that practice in the simulation laboratory may be helpful to some, perhaps many students, and boosts their confidence for traditional hospital-based nursing care. However, this emphasis has trapped nursing into an acute care model, one that we need to end, and instead create a process of education and practice that is more in keeping with the ideals, values, and goals of the discipline and profession. I advocate for nurses to practice outside the hospital setting and create well person, chronic illness, and acute care community nursing venues established by, designed by, and run by nurses. It would be innovative for nursing as a profession and for nurses to act on its/their own goals and values—those that promote health and quality of life in humanistic and socially critical ways to the majority of persons who require care where they live—in the community. Nursing innovation is when nurses take a critical approach to their enormous knowledge and talent in healing and caring and reject the biomedical industrial complex and the biomedical model for the many philosophical and scientific frameworks that reflect the reasons most nurses went into the field in the first place. My students tell me that they did not go into nursing to sit at a computer and not face the other human who has come to them at a time of health with questions and concerns or times of illness, suffering, and perhaps experiencing loss. They did not come into nursing to achieve a hospital's increased prestige achieved on the backs of nurses who are still positioned to follow doctors' orders, an archaic remnant of misogyny, classism, and professionism (professional bias, entitlement, and dominance) if there ever was one. Others came into nursing only on the basis of the cultural stereotype of the hospital nurse in white doing exactly that—following doctors' orders. However, the focus for many students is more on the opportunity to “work with people” and “care for people” but most arrive at, as well as complete, their education without any critical social analysis or awareness of the importance of such practices as working with and caring for people while being socially critical. Many graduates proceed to work and have only a vague notion of cognitive dissonance (they are not really able to be with people as they had wished) and that something is not right once they begin work in settings dominated not by nursing goals and knowledge but rather, those of the corporation and of corporate medicine. Only radical change brought about by big innovative ideas and action can deliver a health care system and nursing care delivery that really works for both patients and nurses. And, only by becoming adept at social and power analysis can we hope to create real change. This critique requires a deep examination of the social relationships and power relationships that drive the political and economic patterns and infrastructures of health care. All nurses need to learn this in school; it should be an essential—or several essentials. The current standards lack in making nursing a critical study field, while preparing nurses to uphold their charge as care providers, healers, advocates, teachers, and reformers by the absence of social critique, and the use of social justice and nursing frameworks as the primary focus of education and thus of practice. In 20 to 30 years, the only relevant nurses will be those who know how to organize and provide safety and urgent/chronic community care, food and water, and disaster relief supported by a sound knowledge of environmental health and disaster response and sustainability measures. This one essential aspect, recognition that the greatest threat to human health this century is environmental, is blatantly nonexistent in current preparation and practice of nurses. The number of nurse scholars developing knowledge around environmental health and sustainability is scant. However, they are disciplinary leaders, and they are innovators. The failure of most nursing leaders to imagine the future based on current environmental evidence and respond creatively and urgently toward innovation that represents radical change is indicative of how deeply ensconced we are in the agendas of big business and the accompanying greed and self-promotion of most organizations and agencies charged with the health and well-being of our citizens, nursing organizations included. Innovation does not mean tweaking or repositioning the puzzle pieces of nurse education, practice, and research to form seemingly novel approaches. Innovation means taking a profoundly critical look at where we are and how things are done and taking the risk to abandon habits of thought and action toward true change and accomplishment that betters human health and quality of life. —Paula N.

    "abstract": "EMERGING THEORIES FOR PRACTICE CRITICAL, PARTICIPATORY, ECOLOGICAL, AND USER-LED: NURSING SCHOLARSHIP AND KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUTURE The United Kingdom leads the way in service user–led research,1 in large part because many funding agencies require it.2 Theory, research, and the so-called “evidence-based practice” in the United States lag far behind those by our colleagues in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the traditional funding structures of the National Institutes of Health and the like are generally not inclusive of patients or health service users as leaders and collaborators. Although there have been some requests for proposals for community-based participatory research projects, they are few and far between and they do not always require true leadership of patients or service users. Although funding for community-based participatory studies is limited, some US-based researchers3,4 approach knowledge development using these methods, which have been especially useful for phenomena of concerns of traditionally underrepresented or vulnerable populations. My own community-based participatory research on the mental health of vulnerable populations, more specifically, my recent research through a research group named “Voices and Visions,” has informed these ideas for the future of nursing knowledge. The purpose of this article is to propose a new approach to nursing knowledge development, using my experiences on a user-led “Voices and Visions” research team. Before working with this interdisciplinary and international research team, I conducted research in the community.5 I conducted community-based participatory research with persons who served as representatives of the community,6 and I conducted community-based participatory research studies that had community advisory boards.7 These studies formed the methodological scaffolding that has led me to the service user–led Voices and Visions research team. Service user–led research is more than simply conducting research in the community and is more than community-based participatory research. It involves more than having 1 person with relatively little power consult with a research team. It is more than having a community advisory board whom the researchers share their ideas, seeking approval or disapproval. A service user–led team, for example, the Voices and Visions research team, is true community-based participatory research—it is a team that is led by consumers with lived experiences of the phenomenon of concern; in this case, persons with psychosis who are consumers/users/survivors of mental health services. Persons with lived experience of psychosis have central roles—as leaders and coleaders—as researchers and theorists. The researchers, coresearchers/community members, and students all share an interest in unusual experiences, which include voice hearing and other psychotic-like experiences. The Voices and Visions research team is led by a mental health service user/consumer/survivor with lived experience of psychosis (voice hearing with schizophrenia) and a PhD student in community psychology, coled by me (an academic researcher, educator, and psychiatric mental health nurse), and includes 2 undergraduate students in community psychology (one with lived experience of psychosis and the other with lived experience of a learning disability). Our team also consists of several members of the hearing voices community—persons who are users/consumers/survivors of mental health services, who are also mental health activists, and who serve as research collaborators and participants in all aspects of the research process. The team is currently conducting several studies and projects: (1) a phenomenological study of psychosis; (2) a qualitative investigation of first-episode psychosis in young adults; (3) an exploration of service user's positions on psychiatric diagnosis, etiology, and treatment (N. Jones, T. Kelly, M. Shattell, unpublished data, 2013); and (4) an autoethnographic project on the dynamics of service user involvement within a research team (N. Jones, M. Shattell, C. Sonido, unpublished data). The work of the team is critical,8,9 participatory (N. Jones, T. Kelly, M. Shattell, unpublished data), ecological,10 and user-led (N. Jones, M. Shattell, C. Sonido, unpublished data). I think that this may be the future of scholarship and knowledge development in nursing—theory and research that are critical, participatory, ecological, and patient or health service user–led or coled. Emerging theories for practice should be critical of traditional hierarchical power structures; should include persons with the lived experience of the phenomenon of concern, as theorists and researchers; should exhibit understandings that persons are part of wider sociocultural, political, organizational, and historical contexts; and conceivably should be codeveloped and cocontrolled by patients or health service users. Although there are many challenges to this, I believe that this would exponentially enhance the value of nursing knowledge. Mona M.

    "abstract": "NURSING METHODOLOGIES The advances that have taken place in nursing methodologies over the life of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) are stunning. When ANS began in 1978, nurse scholars were in the early stages of exploring nursing theory—what it is, whether nursing could and should have its own theories, and what about borrowed theory? The first 2 issues of the journal focused on the topic of “Practice-Oriented Theory,” based on the ideas introduced in 1971 by Dickoff, James, and Wiedenbach.1 Their work remains among the most influential in the history of nursing scholarship. In the early ANS issues, various approaches to concept analysis appeared with some regularity and today concept analysis remains a cornerstone of many doctoral programs. Over the years, many different approaches to the process of concept analysis have evolved, with increasing sophistication, as articles in this issue of the journal illustrate. Another trend in nursing scholarship that appeared early in the history of ANS is the ongoing development of various qualitative methodologies. In fact, nursing as a discipline has been at the forefront in the human sciences in developing methods drawn from qualitative traditions. It is interesting that these 2 trends emerged at a time when nursing was just beginning to gain standing in the academic world as a well-regarded and credible scientific discipline, and some nurse scholars held the view that if nursing were to become well established as a discipline, we should follow the path of traditional empiric science. Over time, a general consensus emerged acknowledging the importance of traditional empirics while integrating the important insights that were emerging from less traditional approaches. There are a number of reasons that nursing has taken this path of methodological diversity. From my perspective, this path has been inevitable. It represents a fundamental commitment in nursing to 2 underlying values—the search for wholeness and meaning. At the same time, nursing has a strong tradition of pragmatism, both in practice and in theory, reflected in the early Dickoff, James, and Wiedenbach perspective on theory. Today, to our credit, nurse scholars remain engaged with the dialectic tension between philosophy (wholeness and meaning) and practice—between what we know and what we do. Nursing scholarship reflects a wonderfully complex array of approaches to addressing this tension, with amazing insights and approaches that are significant for the future of our discipline. Today, nursing stands at the brink of massive social, economic, technological, and political changes in health care worldwide. The abiding commitments to both philosophy and practice means that we can influence debates and decisions so that pragmatic solutions are well informed by underlying meanings that affect how people experience health and health care. This is a mammoth challenge for our discipline, and one for which nursing is well equipped. As you read the articles in this issue, I believe you will see the significance of nursing scholarship for many practical challenges in health care.

    "abstract": "With this issue, Advances in Nursing Science enters its 20th year of publication. As with other kinds of anniversaries, I was drawn to looking back over the years to reflect on what had brought us along this far. Here are a few excerpts that I found in the From the Editor column: ANS will focus on articles that address the full range of activities involved in the development of science, including empirical research, theory construction, concept analysis, practical application of research and theory, and investigation of the values and ethics that influence the practice and research activities of nursing science. •1978, 1(1), p. i From an editorial standpoint, we have conceived a broad concept of \"science,\" recognizing the philosophic, ethical, and political forces that influence the development of our science. •1980, 3(1), p. xii From its inception, we have intended for ANS to provide a means of public debate and discussion of professional, scholarly, conceptual, and theoretical issues in nursing. •1983, 5(4), p. xi There is a very real paradox in maintaining a balance between high standards of scholarship and encouraging creativity, but I have learned that these two objectives need not be at odds with one another. •1984, 7(1), p. viii Based on your responses to ANS during its first decade, the journal we have all formed has proven to be something of real worth, worth that extends beyond the material boundaries of the pages and the words printed on them. Part of what we have created together is a character, an essence, a uniqueness that is represented by this particular journal. •1987, 10(1), p. x I am aware that ANS has earned a reputation for taking risks with what we publish, and that we publish some work that is considered controversial by many. We also have earned a reputation for excellence, while pushing the limits of what might be possible and thus creating new possibilities for the future. While ANS has been an avenue, it is the support of the nursing community that has forged the path and made possible the journal's existence. •1990, 12(3), p. vi As we of the nursing community reflect more fully on the philosophic foundations of our science and our practice, we can recognize points where conscious decisions and reaffirmations are needed for clarifying our most fundamental values and beliefs. In so doing, we move between and beyond the paradoxes of clarity and questioning, of certainty and uncertainty, of conviction and possibility. •1991, 14(1), p. vi I anticipate that this and future issues of the journal will continue the tradition of providing the discipline with a provocative and stimulating springboard from which to debate, to consider alternatives, and to imagine new possibilities for the future. •1995, 17(3), p. viii The intentions that have gone into the formation of ANS seem quite clear. I hope that the message is equally clear that every reader, every subscriber, every author of manuscripts, and every manuscript reviewer is vital to making these intentions come into reality. I extend to each of you my heartfelt appreciation for your support, participation, and responsiveness to what this journal has become. I also extend to each one the invitation to continue to participate in bringing about the continual evolution not merely of the journal, but of nursing as a vital discipline. Peggy L.

    "abstract": "SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IN NURSING I was pleasantly surprised to discover the article titled, “Understanding Situation Awareness in Nursing Work: A Hybrid Concept Analysis”1 in the most recent issue of Advances in Nursing Science. First, I would like to commend the authors for introducing the concept of situational awareness (SA) to the nursing literature. The authors accurately describe that SA remains largely unexplored in nursing despite the potential impact on safety demonstrated in high reliability organizations. Despite the relevance of this article, there are 3 major theoretical concerns. First, the authors used a hybrid concept analysis causing some concern in regards to the retrospective assessment of SA. Second, the authors make a strong case for Benner's novice-to-expert model,2 avoiding concerns of automatic decision making and complacency. And, finally, team SA is not addressed. The authors suggest that hybrid concept analysis allows for inclusion of the nurse's perspective. Having recently completed a concept analysis (unpublished) on SA using Walker and Avant's method,3 in addition to studying decision theory, I question the theoretical aspect of retrospectively interviewing nurses using the questions presented in the article. As the authors acknowledge, the most common definition of SA is Endsley's “... the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future.”4(p36) The perception of elements within a volume of space and time presents challenges for assessing SA retrospectively. Humans tend to validate their decisions after they are made, thereby clouding the actual awareness of the situation within a volume of space and time. Knowledge of the outcome can influence judgment of the situation.5 Retrospectively assessing the level of SA within a volume of space and time may be impossible. Second, the authors heavily rely on Benner's novice-to-expert model2; however, a 1997 study on SA and air traffic controllers6 suggests that personal factors, including experience, have virtually no variance on awareness and error severity. The more recently the controller was (re)certified, however, the less severe the error.6 Similar to Benner's model, decision management theory suggests the progression of analytic to automatic decision making. Eventually, decisions become automatic, effortless, and uncontrollable.7 To illustrate this concept in nursing, the first time a nurse cares for a patient with slightly elevated vital signs, the process may be painfully analytic. Educational background, or a mentor, may suggest decision rules that are gradually memorized. Eventually those rules became automatized to the point where later the nurse may not perceive subtle changes in the patient's condition. Concerns about automatic decision making are mainly confined to decisions where things happen fast; automatic behaviors are not necessarily good. In addition, expertise and experience are not equivalent. A nurse of 4 years may be better apt to recall on an experience that occurred last week than a nurse of 40 years who has never been involved with such an experience. Knowledge and experience likely affects perception, comprehension, and projection (SA); however, it may not run parallel to Benner's novice-to-expert model. Finally, the authors make a recommendation to develop methods aimed at accelerating the novice-to-export trajectory. Although this may be an important phenomenon for many reasons, one should consider the concept of team SA. If, perhaps, some nurses are better capable of achieving level 1 SA (perception) and others are more likely to complete levels 2 and 3 SA (comprehension and projection), recommendations should be focused on team SA. It may be unrealistic, and perhaps undesirable when speaking about SA, for all nurses to be “experts.” When considering interventions, it is certainly beneficial to consider SA as an interwoven concept where team members collect, synthesize, and disseminate information to create an understanding of the current situation.8 I could not agree more that future research is needed to understand the application of SA in nursing practice and its impact on patient outcomes; however, the methods of research must be carefully considered. Failure to maintain SA presents threats to patient safety; therefore, SA needs to be examined within a theoretical context, studied systematically, and openly recognized as a universal factor in patient safety. —Amanda M.

    "abstract": "Once again, this ever-popular Advances in Nursing Science ANS issue topic is packed with stimulating, interesting, and timely articles that carry forward works published in ANS in the past. And just as this traditional featured issue topic carries forward into the future, the journal itself continues to grow and develop in synchrony with the latest developments of our time. Of course, I am referring to the ever-growing importance of the World Wide Web in every facet of life, including the life and publication of professional journals. The ANS publisher, Lippincott William & Wilkins has developed a remarkably dynamic and future-oriented Web resource for the journal (http://www.advancesinnursingscience.com/). Here you will find the common things you might want to know about the journal—information for authors, a list of future topics and due dates for manuscripts, and information about the current issue. In addition, the Web site provides access to every article published in the journal since the first issue in 1978. If you are an ANS subscriber, this access requires no additional cost. If you are not a subscriber, there is a fee to download article PDF files. In addition, there are a host of features that will give you instant access to important ANS resources. One of my personal favorites is the “Most Popular” feature. Here you can select to view the articles that have been the “Most Viewed” and the articles that have been the “Most Emailed”. This gives you a snapshot of ANS resources that your colleagues and peers are noticing and using. Another of my favorites is the “Collections” section. Here you will find a number of collections of articles published in ANS that have lasting importance. Examples of the Collections include “ANS Classics,” “Ethics,” “History,” “Feminism,” “Research Methods,” and a host of other topics that will inspire you to explore further. Another exciting feature is the “Published Ahead-of-print” section. In this section, you will have access, free of charge, to the PDF version of articles that will not appear in the journal for several weeks or months. And if that is not enough, you will be able to see the full table of contents for the next issue to appear in print. These Web enhancements to the journal provide readers with important and timely resources. But the real significance of these tools lies not in the bells and whistles of the Web but in the substantive ANS content that the Web leads to. The process of selecting the material to include in the “Collections” made me aware again of the long-standing significance of the scholarship that has been published in the journal over the years. There was hardly an issue, in all 32 years covered by the collections, in which there was not at least 1, and usually at least 2 or 3 articles, that met the standard of “lasting importance.” The authors who have contributed to the journal have given it this hallmark status. Their works have made a tremendous difference beyond the simple fact of publishing their ideas. They have left a legacy that will continue for years to come. Access to their work is now only a mouse-click away! I hope that all of our readers will take full advantage of all that the Web and this amazing journal have to offer—-past, present, and future!

    "abstract": "UPSTREAM AT THE WATERSHED MOMENT The research assistant wrapped a clean washcloth around the end of the faucet to avoid scratching it. Then she clamped a wrench over the faucet's spout, turned on the water, and drew each sample into its respective bottle. After securing the samples into a small cooler, the research assistant headed back to town. She understood the 30-hour protocol window; if the samples arrived at the state laboratory within 30 hours, they would be viable. However, missing the FedEx truck and/or the deadline would mean that the samples would need to be discarded. In that case, another visit would need to be scheduled. The goal of collecting the water samples was to document the extent of household environmental health risks in rural low-income families. The results were then folded into the delivery of a tailored research intervention based on each family's risk profile.1 The families in this study all lived in Gallatin County, Montana (ie, Bozeman), or Whatcom County, Washington (ie, Bellingham). From a national or international perspective, the families lived in some of the least populated and supposedly pristine areas on the planet. It was not unusual in this study for families to live in mobile homes that had million-dollar views of mountains and forest. Families often told us that the view was the reason they lived in the country; despite these tough times, they would rather pay the gas money than move into town. Even though my public health lens seems to autofocus at the population level, I know that in the end, environmental health is personal. It plays out in the family. The families we saw whose wells were contaminated needed to decide where to situate those risks into the demands of their daily lives. How did they decide where the paycheck went? Should they use their money to buy bottled water, a point-of-use filtration system, or do nothing and hope for the best. Parents in our study needed to consider the immediate demands of rent and daycare in the context of theoretical risks associated with arsenic- or nitrate-laced water. To ease these decisions, we provided families with a pop-up book describing each finding as well as a list of no-cost/low-cost options for different risk scenarios. As the study investigators, we characterized the risks, using the scientific language we know so well. However, what we often heard from families was “what is ‘nitrate’ and how did it get into our well water?” Environmental health lives in a complex duality and a rapidly changing context. As thought leaders in nursing, we need to recognize this multidimensionality; in this editorial I lay out several (5 actually) facets of environmental health and a charge for our profession to move forward on several fronts simultaneously. The first facet of environmental health is for us to consider the role that environmental risks play in individuals and thus in the creation of future patients. Each of us has friends whose lives have been cut short by Parkinson's disease, cancer, or other conditions. They are not outside of us; they are us. We should never lose sight of that perspective. A second facet addressing environmental health is to reflect on the totality of economic and societal costs due to environmentally associated disease. Trasande and Liu2 recently recalculated the costs of environmentally associated diseases in US children; the 2002 estimate of $54.9 billion was upgraded to $76.6 billion for 2008.2 Sobering data, even when we see the data in terms of dollars versus human capital. A third facet of environmental health to consider is the regulatory environment. Our nation's decisions to evolve (or devolve) environmental regulations has a direct impact on its citizenry. Families most affected by local messes often need to launch their own crusades for cleanup; they work hard to navigate a sea of ambiguous policies at the local and state levels. Local regulations addressing factory farms vary widely. At what point does the burden of keeping up with information addressing the discharge of tons of antibiotic- and hormone-ridden animal waste become the responsibility of the government versus the factory farm's unfortunate neighbors? A fourth facet of environmental health is to situate the current mix of risks at this point in time within its evolutionary context. Many of today's environmental risk-reduction solutions are rooted in 19th-century technology and thinking. To a remarkable degree, national water pollution control efforts still reflect “dilution as the solution to pollution.” These policies persist, despite recent findings quantifying pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical by-products in the drinking water of major American cities. At the present time, our planet's saturation point for “dilution” will come well in advance of our collective ability to prevent pollution. The latter will require a fundamental redesign of the way our civilization lives and defines progress. And, last but not least (fifth facet), nursing needs to consider the portfolio of risks and benefits associated with the health care system itself. Persistent chemicals, ionizing radiation, and biohazards are central to the business of health care. Health care services are incredibly resource-intensive and deeply enmeshed in a production-consumption economic model. So as a profession committed to health, we have our own work to do. Every site of care warrants redesign, from waste generation to product selection. Those we educate must understand and have the fundamental tools they need to engage in environmental risk reduction. We can no longer justify leaving environmental health content on the periphery of nursing, under the guise of overcrowded curricula. Without a working knowledge (beyond superficial content) of environmental health, the graduates of 2012 and beyond will be missing an essential tool of nursing practice. Nurses will either assume leadership of health care redesign efforts or by default they will be supplanted by those with a weaker understanding of health care and those it is intended to serve. Back at the ranch (literally), the public health nurse visits a family to share the results of their water testing with them. The analysis took about a month; the water was analyzed for bacteria, heavy metals, pesticides, and other solvents. This time the news is good; no contaminants were found to be above the threshold level. The mother is relieved to find that all family members, including the baby and toddler, can drink the water. In actuality, “good” means “good for now”; what it doesn't mean is that today's pristine water will be pure next year or the next. Taken as a whole, our findings and those from other health scientists are beginning to provide evidence that sooner or later, what gets poured or sprayed or buried in the ground ends up in our drinking water. Some risks, such as those from agricultural run-off and mine waste, are easily seen. Other risks from illegal dumps and methamphetamine-associated solvents are highly site-specific. Thus, sooner or later a derailment of chlorine-filled railcars into the river, a small and underregulated foundry, or a windblown pile of last century's mine tailings has the potential to end up in all of our drinking water. In the end, environmental health is personal as well as political; it is embedded in our daily work but warrants a global vision. The watershed moment is upon us. The truth is becoming more than inconvenient. We are finding contaminants in the most remote parts of our country, where we least expected it...where we have never considered looking before. Fortunately, as a profession, nursing has the ability to embrace the multidimensional complexity of environmental health; we are also blessed with the numbers and talent to solve problems on many fronts simultaneously. Let us broaden and deepen our efforts to ensure a future worth having. Our nation and planet can ill afford to perpetuate a reactive approach to environmental health; nor should we wait to see downstream effects manifest themselves as lives are lost. We should turn our efforts upstream, where the real problems lie. —Patricia Butterfield, RN, PhD, FAAN Guest Editor Dean Washington State University College of Nursing Spokane, Washington [email protected]",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of cited references in a curated data set of 100 articles from 100 different nursing journals. From these articles, a sample of references for analysis (n = 666) was created. From this total, only 8 references (1.3%) could not be retrieved at all. Small numbers of references (≤3%) had errors in the author name, journal title, article title, or year, but these did not prevent retrieval. These small numbers suggest that use of current technology including electronic databases and reference management software has improved overall accuracy in reference lists. An unexpected finding was the discovery of enhanced reference lists for online articles at publisher sites.

    "abstract": "Editor's Note: Last year we established an Editor Immersion Program designed to introduce nurse scholars to the Editorial role and the field of scholarly publishing in nursing. Our first participant in this program has been Jane K. Dickinson, RN, PhD, CDCES, Program Director/Senior Lecturer, Diabetes Education and Management, Teachers College Columbia University. Dr Dickinson teaches a graduate nursing theory course at Teachers College, and a number of her students have contributed blogs for Nursology.net. One of her areas of expertise and research is the language used in health care, ways in which our language sustains inequities, and ways our language can promote health and well-being. This Editorial is authored by Dr Dickinson as part of her immersion experience. Peggy Chinn, Editor Not long ago, I received an email from a non-nursing colleague that he ended with \"nursing theories need better branding\". We had been collaborating on some work in the \"diabetes space\" for the past couple years. Recently, on one of our calls, I mentioned nursing theory, and my colleague was intrigued. \"What is nursing theory?\" he asked. \"I didn't know nurses have theories.\" I teach the (one) theory course in a doctor of education (EdD) in Nursing Education program. In this solely online and asynchronous course, students and I discuss many aspects of the knowledge base of the nursing discipline. We discuss whether nursing is a basic or applied science; the risks and benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration; and the development, testing, and evaluation of nursing theories. We also discuss the relationship between nursing theory and nursing practice and the role of theory in nursing education and nursing research. These discussions tend to help students develop an understanding of the value of nursing theory and where we could end up as a discipline without it. The students frequently write that without nursing theory, nursing will be relegated to a task-oriented role and that nursing theory helps students understand what makes nursing nursing. Most students finish the semester with very strong ideas about teaching nursing theory at the ADN, BSN, master's, and doctoral levels of nursing education. They also tend to argue the importance of our disciplinary knowledge being used to guide nursing practice and research, and that we should be using and teaching all 5 patterns of knowing in nursing.1,2 A few students sometimes hold out that empiric knowing, specifically safety measures, is most important in nursing practice. Even then, the discussion typically turns to how without considering the whole person—as taught in multiple nursing theories—we can't truly address safety. The discussion about interdisciplinary collaboration is always interesting because students tend to feel strongly that nursing knowledge would benefit all health care disciplines. We often ask ourselves, do other disciplines even know that we have a knowledge base? Do they know that we have theories, frameworks, and models? Do non-nursing health care professionals ever implement nursing theories or use them to guide their practice or research? While no one seems to know for sure, the answer is typically no. When I got the message from my colleague suggesting nursing theories need better branding, I was reminded of these conversations in class, which made me think about how we often lament the lack of \"voice\" in nursing. If we had a stronger voice, would nursing knowledge be more widely known, referenced, and used? Before we can even contemplate that question, perhaps we need to dig into whether or not nurses, ourselves, are aware of and using our own knowledge base. Are we talking about what and how nurses know? Are we teaching nursing theories? Are we applying them in practice? Are we guiding our research with them? Are we evaluating and adapting nursing theories and developing new ones? How do we \"brand\" nursing theory within our own discipline, let alone with our peers in other disciplines? Maybe, it's time to start doing both. —Jane K. Dickinson, RN, PhD, CDCES Guest Editor",

    "abstract": "Like many other issues of ANS over the years, this issue of the journal resonates with implications for practice. But tragically, the messages seldom reach those who might best benefit directly from these insights. The theoretical insights presented by the authors in this and other issues of ANS are exciting and stimulating for those of us accustomed to reading and thinking about theory, but are often obscure for those who are more accustomed to dealing with the practical and urgent challenges of minute-by-minute nursing care. The current and unrelenting shortage of nurses inspires practical and “fast-fix” responses, leaving in the dust the more complex theoretical explorations that reveal fundamental and underlying insights. I addressed some of the reasons for the divide between theory and practice, and knowing and doing, in the April, 1988 issue of the journal devoted to the theme “Theory and Practice.” Now, over 15 years later, I believe that the issues that were then before us as a collective discipline remain even more urgent today. In that issue I stated: As nurses we are particularly vulnerable to an unrelenting sense of disparity between what we know and what we do. We know we would be stronger as a profession if we were unified with each other and with other health care providers, but we are not unified. We know we would be able to provide a high quality of care if we were free to practice nursing as we envision it to be, but we do not and cannot practice in these ways. We know we would better serve society if we focused our practice on health and developed greater knowledge about health, but we practice in an illness care system, not a health care system. 1(pvii) In that editorial, I called for nurses everywhere to begin to take steps toward bringing theory and practice together in small and simple every-day acts. Admittedly, these small and simple acts are challenging, and not easy. The actions call for courage and a recognition that something needs to change. Reflective practice, whether the practice of nursing care, teaching, or research, means finding ways to continually bring what we know and what we do into line with one another. We do this by talking about what we know with other nurses, and exploring how to do more of what we know. We do this by questioning the meanings of the theoretical words and ideas that we use, and challenging how well these thoughts and ideas fit with what is happening in practice. This kind of thinking and challenging is at the heart of what theory is really all about, for theory is created to represent what is “really” going on in the world in a way that challenges preconceived notions, opening the way for new possibilities. When theory does not serve this purpose, it falls by the wayside. In the 1988 editorial, I cited the still-relevant work of Bunch. 2 She named one of the paradoxes that sustains the divide between knowing and doing as the “too hard/too easy” paradox. Many nurses believe that unless theory is expressed in esoteric terms it will not be viewed as worthy or scholarly, and will not be taken seriously. Others simply assume that all theory is just “too hard.” On the other hand, some nurses would call for theory to be easy to understand by anyone, comprehensible without expert knowledge or the aid of a professional glossary, and that it should be directly applicable to practice. Both extremes serve to sustain the divide between what we know and what we do. Theory development and comprehension is not simple and easy, but it can be done in a way that is comprehensible and explainable. It is my hope that as you approach the articles in this issue, you will release “too hard/too easy” preconceived notions, and remain open to the possibilities and the challenges that these authors are proposing. The implications for practice are immense and vital if we are to meet the challenges that face us as we enter the year 2004.",

This article provides a brief overview of the development of the troubled-teen industry, addresses the thorny issue of parents' right to send their children to these facilities vis-a-vis the rights of their children, and argues that nurses and other health professionals have a collective obligation to speak out against them in the strongest possible terms. Suggestions for action by nurses are proposed that could protect vulnerable children against this continuous cycle of institutionalized child abuse masquerading as therapy.",

    "abstract": "A POSTMODERN VIEW OF EVIDENCE \"Evidence\" is one of the front-page buzzwords these days, reflected in a plethora of journal articles, conference themes, workshops, and curricular initiatives. The dominant ideology surrounding this trend is, not surprisingly, that of modernism/positivism. This is not all \"bad,\" but there are huge gaps, confusions, and uncertainties about the \"evidence-based practice\" movement that are particularly acute in the day-to-day realities of practice. As Lather explains, \"It is not that the dreams of modernity are unworthy; it is what they render absent and their conflictual and confusing outcomes that underscore the limits of reason and the obsolescence of modernist categories and institutions.\"1(p88) A postmodern perspective insists on exploring multiple meanings and possibilities to more fully comprehend the complex world with which we engage—whether as researchers, practitioners, or consumers. This perspective does not eschew empirics. Instead, postmodern approaches take a skeptical stance, challenging, questioning, and probing all perspectives and methods, including its own. Lather1 provides a critical postmodern framework for interpreting and understanding a \"text,\" or in this case the data or analysis that we accept as \"evidence.\" She proposes constructing 4 distinct readings of a text, which she calls \"tales.\"1(p128) In the case of \"evidence,\" the text or data can be research results, theories, ethical reasoning, experiential logs gathered in practice, outcomes of quality assurance projects, or anything that a particular group accepts as \"evidence.\" The 4 readings that Lather describes are realist, critical, deconstructivist, and reflexive. A realist tale is the typical empirical interpretation of what we count as evidence. It is the typical empirical description, interpretation, and conclusions that result from systematic scientific method and the theories that emerge from this interpretation. A critical tale is one that reveals underlying social structures and power dynamics that influence and shape the world that has been studied or examined. For example, consider the evidence that is typically called forth in a situation concerning how people respond to healthcare advice or directives or prescriptions. The social structures and power dynamics of this type of situation are rarely considered in designing or generating evidence related to this phenomenon (sometimes called \"adherence\"), but the dynamics are crucial factors influencing how people act and re-act—those who are the \"prescibers\" or \"advice givers\" as well as those who receive the prescriptions or advice. A critical reading of the text would explore these dynamics. A deconstructivist tale is one that reveals blind spots and illusions that undergird the evidence. This tale examines the assumptions that are implicit in the situation under study and how the evidence is shaped by blind spots and illusions. This approach examines possibilities in the situation that are not addressed, even taken to be \"unspeakable\". Finally, a reflexive tale is one that brings the \"teller of the tale\" back to the center, examining how the personal circumstances, social standing, power position, and underlying worldview of those who generated the evidence, and who have shaped the evidence. This tale examines the personal investments of the researcher in generating this evidence, as well as the motivations of those who accept this particular information as \"evidence.\" The articles in this issue of ANS, consistent with our tradition of going beyond the traditional margins of inquiry, help point the way to new thinking around the concepts of theory, evidence, and practice. I welcome your comments and responses as readers. Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "Marshal1 provides an exceptional review of the interdisciplinary work that has contributed to our current understanding of place as a concept. This interdisciplinary perspective provides valuable insight regarding the importance of the interactions between healing and place. The concept of place is directly related to environment, which, as Marshall notes, is\\break a core nursing concept. Therefore, it is especially relevant to consider contributions from disciplines that share this core concept, in particular, architecture and environmental psychology. A basic underlying principle of neuroscience is that \"… environment influences behavior.\"2(p1227) This is also a basic underlying principle in architecture and environmental psychology. Clare Cooper Marcus,3 noted landscape architect, in her book House as Mirror of Self illuminates the intersection between design and emotion. There is a further extension of the concept of place by Manzo.4 This research extends the exploration of place, and places of comfort or restoration, beyond the home and into community. These scholars, who study the concepts of environment and place, provide important insights for nurse scientists to consider in their work. The interrelationship of home and healing is especially relevant as people cope with the loss of home due to the current economic downturn. Thank you for publishing this timely and important article on the relationship between place and healing. Grace A. Kline, MN University of Washington, Seattle, Washington",

This qualitative study used interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to strive to meet the study objectives. There is a paucity of literature on the topic of nurse and law enforcement interaction in the hospital setting. Overwhelmingly, participants described a contentious dynamic between nurses and law enforcement officers in the hospital, wrought with argument, stress, and a feeling of coming from \"different worlds.\" The influence of gender was apparent to the female-identified participants, and gender constructs and therefore gender role conflict were critical points of contention. In exploring how nurses and law enforcement officers think about and describe their experiences, nurses and hospital systems may develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of barriers to care for incarcerated patients and of the challenging experiences nurses face in caring for these patients. The nurses' expressed feelings of intimidation, stress, and impaired self-efficacy in this dynamic underscore the need for institutional support and prioritization of caring practices, and identification of the ways in which carceral practices impair care, as well as nurses' safety.",

The analysis suggests that heart failure self-care tends to focus on individual behaviors to the detriment of social and structural determinants of health. It also shifts responsibility away from the health care system and onto the individual.

    "abstract": "We compared online distributed information provided to patients with cancer in Scandinavian countries through the lens of governmentality. A secondary comparative qualitative analysis was conducted. Discourses in online patient information showed differences in governmentality techniques across the countries: Norway used a paternalist approach, Denmark an educative approach, and Sweden an individualistic approach and expected the patients to make the “right” decisions. Online information for patients with cancer in Denmark and Norway showed high professional and health care system involvement, whereas in Sweden, there was high patient involvement. There was almost no use of the person-centered approach among the online discourses.",

    "abstract": "Hospital-based nurses face many occupational risks. In the early days of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, questions were raised regarding nurses' responsibilities to provide care in the context of risk of exposure to this infectious disease. In the United States, these questions were answered relatively swiftly using a deontological framework. If nurses did not have access to appropriate personal protective equipment, they were not duty bound to provide nursing care to patients with a known infection. Another occupational risk hospital-based nurses face is exposure to patient violence. Questions about nurses' responsibilities to provide care in the context of this occupational risk have not been addressed. The purpose of this article is to examine these 2 occupational risks and ethical decision-making frameworks that can be used to answer questions about the provision of nursing care in the face of personal risk. While useful in the context of COVID-19, a duty-based framework seems insufficient to capture the contextual nuances and moral complexity of providing nursing care to hospitalized patients who exhibit violent behavior. Professional duties are explored as are other ethical frameworks. Ethics of the everyday, virtue ethics, and care ethics are introduced as additional perspectives that can help inform nurses' decision-making and actions when they are exposed to occupational risks such as patient violence and COVID-19.",

A mother's narratives of her experiences when her adolescent son suffered a spinal cord injury seemed very rich and informative. The challenge arises in the dissemination of this knowledge. With a phenomenological approach the narratives of a mother's experiences were analyzed. This revealed an experience characterized by (1) being emotionally overwhelmed due to the shock of the accident, (2) resisting imagination and acceptance of a disrupted life path for the adolescent, (3) balancing your assistance to provide the needed support maintaining the adolescent's dignity when helpless, (4) comforting and supporting the adolescent when in need for comfort and support yourself, and (5) reconciling parental assistance with the need for professional assistance. The discussion explores what the findings from the single case can tell us about being in a situation like this, and to what extent this knowledge can be disseminated to assist health professionals.",

While the essence of the commentary is intentionally interdisciplinary and weaves together disparate threads of multidisciplinary knowledge, it has important implications for nursing-with its relational core, unique as well as shared bodies of moral and scientific knowledge, and interprofessional health care goals to maximize human growth and well-being across the life span in both health and illness.",

    "abstract": "The Value of Classic Literature in Shaping the Future There are many factors that shape the future, but one that is always present, often overlooked and undervalued, is the literature that has shaped the present and that exerts a lasting effect in shaping the future. The admonition that most students learn early in their academic careers is to read and cite the most recent literature in their field of interest—an admirable practice, but one that leaves a large, gaping hole in any scholarly effort when the evolution and history of a current idea are not also explored. In fact, there is evidence, reported in a recent computer science article (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0275), that there is a notable increase in citations of older literature. Technologic factors that have prompted this renewed interest in older literature include the shift to digital online publication, mass digitization of journal archives, full-text indexing, and improved search engines based on relevance ranking. But accessibility alone does not explain the possibility that older literature is gaining increased attention by current scholars. Once an older article on a particular topic is discovered, it is still subject to same critical assessment that a scholar makes of a current article, which includes placing the content of any article in the context of the time and place in which it was produced. If an article, regardless of date, has particular importance and relevance to the present and the future, it can and should be acknowledged. This journal, Advances in Nursing Science (ANS), has a strong reputation for articles that prove to be “classics” over time. In fact, the metrics that indicate the strength and value of a journal are the strongest for ANS in those measures that reflect the lasting influence of early articles. The entire archive of ANS was digitized in 2004, making the entire ANS library available online to all subscribers and electronically to all academic libraries as well. But mere availability does not create a “classic”; classic literature can only be revealed as demonstrated by its lasting influence over time. In this issue of ANS, we feature an interview with Barbara Carper, the author of one of the most notable classic articles in ANS, titled “Fundamental Patterns of Knowing in Nursing.”1 Carper's insights unleashed a critical moment in the history of the development of nursing by demonstrating that nursing practice is based on wholistic knowing that includes not only empirics but also privileges personal, ethical, and aesthetic knowing. Other authors have used Carper's work to substantiate their own scholarship. Others have provided constructive critiques and analyses that have extended the possibilities for future development of nursing knowledge, theory, research, and practice based on the foundation that Carper's work provided. For many, the revelation of the wholistic nature of knowing in nursing has affirmed and encouraged nursing's historic commitment to the wholistic nature of human experience. Therefore, it is a great honor to publish Elizabeth Eisenhauer's interview with Dr Carper and to honor Dr Carper as a significant contributor to the development of the discipline of nursing. The fact that Carper's words are conveyed here in the form of an interactive interview is also significant, because interaction and discussion are vital processes that shape what ultimately appears in the published literature. Discussion that is informed by the long view of history builds a common disciplinary understanding of the issues, appreciation of opposing ideas, and ultimately consensus on shared ideas and mutual understanding where ideas are not in agreement. As an ANS reader, you can join the ongoing discourse around the ideas that appear here and in other nursing literature.

But regardless of one's interest in these populations, these article contain important insights that contribute to the development of nursing's interests in overcoming discrimination and injustice in health care. The planned topic for this issue—“Post– Hospital Nursing”—is one that is becoming increasingly significant for nurses, as health care shifts more and more to the home and the community. Dr Katherine Maeve, who serves on the Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) advisory board, recently related to me her experience following hospitalization for knee surgery. Her story, and her insights related to the experiences faced by everyone who enters the setting of a modern hospital, inspired me to invite her to share her experience in her Guest Editorial. Dr Maeve's editorial, and each of the articles in this issue, will be featured on the ANS blog (http://ansjournalblog.com), where you can join in a discussion focusing on how nurses can envision new directions for the future!

    "abstract": "Response to “Compassion Competence in Nurses” by Lee and Seomun in the April-June 2016 issue of Advances in Nursing Science Dear Editor, I have worked as a correctional nurse for the past 21 years, the last 11 years as a cluster nurse manager. Correctional nursing is a unique position within the nursing profession because it combines the demanding environments of corrections and health care. As one of the main providers of health care, nurses' responsibilities include elements of outpatient care, occupational health, community health, emergency nursing, and mental health. Occasionally, correctional nurses voice apprehension about being empathetic or showing to much compassion with offender patients. As leaders, we reinforce professional nurse actions toward patient care. When patients sense they are being understood, they develop a rapport with nurses and are more likely to follow the treatment suggestions and information about healthy lifestyle changes.1 I had the opportunity to read the article, “Compassion Competence in Nurses” by Lee and Seomun2 in the April-June 2016 issue of Advances in Nursing Science. I felt their research in identifying the attributes of the concept of compassion competence for nurses would benefit me, as a leader, to promote continuing education and lifelong learning of compassion for correctional nursing. The statement, “Nurses with compassion competence can correctly assess the needs across varying conditions and cultural backgrounds and make accurate clinical decisions based on integrated professional knowledge,”2(pE57) can be utilized in correctional nursing for improving patient care, as well as the findings that through education, knowledge, and clinical experiences, nurses can develop the sensitivity to recognize the minor changes, responses, and emotional changes of their patients.2 On the basis of these findings and previous literature, the act of compassion can be taught. As a nurse leader, I want to promote correctional nurses as a positive and professional specialty. This will have to be done through more education in compassion competence. I think that further research into correctional nursing compassion competence would be beneficial due to the challenges of empathy and compassion in a secure environment. Compassion could be misinterpreted, and the nurse could be at risk of being manipulated by the inmate or security could interpret this as establishing a relationship. Best regards, —Laura David, BSN, RN Cluster Nurse Manager Chester, Texas [email protected]",

    "abstract": "ACKNOWLEDGING THEORETICAL, PHILOSOPHIC, AND EMPIRIC LINKAGES This issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS), focused on “Palliative Care,” was planned to provide an opportunity for ANS to respond to a call for nursing journals to participate in “The Conversation Project” (http://theconversationproject.org; see also https://nursingeditors.com/inane-initiatives/conversation-project). The Conversation Project is an initiative encouraging people in all walks of life to engage in conversations about palliative and end-of-life care with their loved ones and especially with their health care providers. Despite the widely recognized need to have these kinds of conversations, they are difficult conversations, even in the context of health care relationships. Nurses, in particular, are in key roles to encourage and facilitate these conversations, and nursing scholarship can contribute significantly to the resources that support not only conversations but also the practices that occur in palliative care and end-of-life situations. It is notable that the articles in this issue, taken together, demonstrate a fundamental fact of science—the necessity of theory, philosophy, and empirics in developing disciplinary knowledge. The imperative of each of these dimensions of knowledge development remains largely unacknowledged. The focus remains on empirical evidence without adequate scrutiny of the underlying meanings of mental constructs and world views that shape what is taken to be empirical evidence. Perhaps the real-life situations that call for palliative care draw attention to these underlying meanings. These situations demand something more than empirical knowledge alone. These situations are complex, fraught with uncertainty, mystery, and a sense of urgency for remedies and for human caring—caring that embraces the deeper challenges of finding meaning in life, in suffering and in death. The nature of nursing as a discipline places nursing at the center in providing palliative care, and at the center of the larger enterprise of exploring and finding effective ways of responding to the physical, emotional, and spiritual suffering of patients and their loved ones. This enterprise calls for empiric evidence that informs decisions that guide effective practice. But empiric evidence alone does not suffice as adequate knowledge when deeper issues such as personal and cultural meaning, the purpose of life, and spirituality are so central. Philosophic perspectives provide the foundation from which all scientific endeavors emerge. Theoretical knowledge provides a frame of reference, a road map, and conceptual relevance that guides the development of empiric evidence and that prompts emerging possibilities for developing ever-growing relevance in the search for understanding. The articles in this issue of ANS collectively address the vital dimensions of palliative care and the interrelated realities of social and cultural justice, family dynamics, sacred, and spiritual meanings. As these articles illustrate, the interfaces between theory, research, and practice are vital if we are to develop knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of the human health experience. —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "ANS Transitions This issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) marks 2 major transitions for the journal: the integration of a new section in the journal—\"Visions: Scholarship of Rogerian Nursing Science,\" and welcoming the new ANS Editor, Dr Eun Ok Im (https://www.nursing.emory.edu/faculty-staff/eun-ok-im). Dr Im is already familiar to long-time ANS readers. She has been a frequent contributor to the journal, publishing works based on her notable program of research that focuses on the development of situation-specific theory, feminist perspectives informing experiences of midlife women, cross-cultural explorations that inform our understanding of health and illness experience, and internet and computer technologies to eliminate gender and ethnic disparities. Dr Im is currently a Professor of Nursing at Emory University. She hails from South Korea and maintains strong ties to universities and health care systems in South Korea and the greater Asia-Pacific region. We have featured Dr Im's articles on the ANS Journal blog (https://ansjournalblog.com/tag/eun-ok-im), where she shared with ANS readers various backgrounds that inform of her work. Her blogs reflect the nature of her leadership in the development of nursing knowledge, with titles such as \"Theory Development Process of Situation-Specific Theories,\" \"Theory Development Strategies for Middle-Range Theory,\" and \"Focus on Transitions From a Nursing Perspective.\" It is my great pleasure to welcome Dr Im as the new Editor of ANS! The new \"Visions\" addition to ANS comes as a result of an agreement between ANS publisher Wolters-Kluwer and the Society of Rogerian Scholars (https://www.societyofrogerianscholars.org). The Society has published \"Visions: The Journal of Rogerian Scholar Science\" since 1993; all past issues of the journal are available to download on the Society website—https://www.societyofrogerianscholars.org/visions. We are delighted to now provide a new \"home\" for this scholarship in the new section \"Visions: Scholarship of Rogerian Nursing Science,\" which will feature one article in each issue based on Rogerian Nursing Science. The content of the journal will remain diverse in presenting a wide range of theoretical and philosophic perspectives, with this new section devoted to Rogerian science. The new \"Visions\" section will increase the size of each paper issue, and each ANS issue will be provided as a Society member benefit. The first article appears in this issue of the journal, titled \"Unitary Appreciative Nursing Praxis,\" by W. Richard Cowling III. We are delighted to also welcome Jane Flanagan, PhD, RN, AHN-BC, ANP-BC, FAAN, as the \"Visions\" ANS Editor. Dr Fanagan is a Rogerian scholar and is an associate professor at the Boston College Connell School of Nursing. I am delighted to also welcome Dr Flanagan and the new \"Visions\" section on ANS! I will provide support and assistance during this transition and will remain as the ANS Journal Blog editor! Worldwide, we are experiencing a significant time of renewal and transformation, as well as the chaos that comes from major change. ANS has from the beginning stood as a venue for cutting-edge scholarship that challenges the status quo while building on a firm foundation rooted in the cherished values of the discipline of nursing. As these changes unfold for the journal, I am confident that the journal will grow and evolve in significant ways that will continue to enrich the discipline and embolden new horizons for the future! —Peggy L.

There is a gap in the literature surrounding woman veterans’ perspectives about the care they receive. The purpose of this study was to apply the Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior framework to study the patient-provider interaction described by women veterans. A qualitative descriptive methodology, using directed content analysis, was employed. Six themes were identified. Consistent screening, provider knowledge about service roles and experiences of women veterans, and familiarity with military-related health conditions support holistic care. Further research in this area is warranted.",

    "abstract": "It is my greatest honor, pleasure, and excitement to succeed Dr Chinn in continuing the legacy of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS). Throughout nursing history, ANS has always been the premier journal that challenges granted assumptions, injustice, and power imbalances and brings provoking, highly innovative, and creative perspectives to nursing discipline. Under the strong leadership of Dr Peggy Chinn, ANS was founded in 1978 and has stayed as the leading journal in highly innovative, thought-provoking, and boundary-breaking scholarships in nursing. As all of us know, Dr Chinn has been an extremely productive and inspiring thought leader, theorist, and meta-theorist in nursing for the past several decades. While reading her blog posting, titled \"The History and Future of Advances in Nursing Science,\" I could feel the atmosphere when ANS was founded, and I could understand what kinds of challenges she needed to go through to initiate and raise this cutting-edge journal. Without knowing this background history, I first met ANS when I was a BSN student at Seoul National University in South Korea in 1980s while taking a nursing theory class for the first time. Then, ANS has inspired me during my master's and PhD classes in 1990s, and I have been a fan of all the thought-provoking theoretical works published in ANS throughout my nursing career. I just have taken it for granted that ANS has always been there for us. However, obviously, it was not possible without Dr Chinn's endless efforts with all our thought leaders throughout the history of ANS. The legacy of ANS lies in the fact that ANS has been always on the frontline of nursing science. Most of the landmark, thought-provoking articles related to nursing knowledge generation have been published in ANS as I remember. Most of prominent theoretical, philosophical, and scholarly works in nursing have been published in ANS, which is the reason that ANS is one of the most-read and most-assigned journals by faculties of graduate programs in nursing. The authors of articles in ANS included nationally and internationally renowned nursing scholars, theorists, philosophers, and researchers such as our famous grand theorists, middle-range theorists, situation-specific theorists, meta-theorists, feminists, social critical theorists, post-modernists, womanists, and so on. As an author, ANS has been the first journal that I targeted to publish my theoretical and philosophical works and boundary-breaking conceptual and methodological articles. In recent years, nursing discipline has gone through multiple expected and unexpected changes, which include the impending retirement of senior nursing scholars and researchers, changes in characteristics of nursing students and nursing workforce, advances in technologies, heightened health disparities and social injustice, drastic changes in dissemination practices of emerging nursing scholars, and all unanticipated alterations due to the COVID-19. At the same time, there have been drastic changes in the directions of nursing knowledge generation with the new leadership at the National Institutes of Health including the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), which may be consistent with the directions that ANS has aimed throughout the past several decades (eg, social justice, health equity). Also, nursing discipline has been drastically globalized with advances in communication technologies, and there is a clear need for collaborative knowledge generation in the global nursing community. This is the time to come out of Western-dominated knowledge generation in nursing. Subsequently, the vision and mission of the journal need to be evolved with the consequent changes in knowledge generation and knowledge translation in nursing. As the new editor-in-chief of ANS, I plan to make necessary changes while maintaining the legacy of ANS. In my first year, I want to aim 2 changes in ANS. First, I will aim to incorporate the edge-running ideas in nursing knowledge generation in the direction of ANS through widely reaching out to the scholars/researchers in the emerging fields. Also, I will aim to extend the audience of ANS to the global nursing community while involving more international nursing scholars in ANS. Please stay tuned for future changes, but note that ANS will continue to be the premier nursing journal on the frontline that challenges the status quo of nursing and advances nursing science. Again, I really appreciate Dr Chinn's unyielding, continuous, highly innovative efforts made for ANS during the past several decades. Also, I really appreciate her strong support during this transition. Dr Chinn has generously shared all her wisdom and advice during this transition, and I could see how much she was dedicated to ANS and how strongly she believed in nursing scholarship. More importantly, I want to say thanks to all the authors, editorial advisory board members, editorial review board members, all the readers of ANS, and, of course, our highly supportive publisher, Wolters Kluwer. All of you have made the legacy of ANS. I will look forward to working with you to continue the legacy of ANS. —Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "We present an evidence-based clinical teaching and learning method based on the middle-range theory of Guided Participation (GP). Typically, teaching and learning in a clinical setting refer to providing information based on the learner's diagnosed condition. With GP, the relationship between guide and patient or client is central to how GP sessions proceed. The guide uses GP processes to identify issues important to the learner and to heighten the learner's competencies for self-care or for caregiving within the family and the community. Through reflection, GP practice heightens competencies in the guide as well. Teaching and learning occur in tandem with learning goals cocreated to help learners resolve, change, and even transform their health-related issues. Learning is embedded in participatory experience that the guide structures, often with the learner. A dynamic process, GP is fashioned and refashioned as the learner develops competencies or acquires new health-related needs. Guided participation assumptions are illustrated with clinical cases drawn from GP practice, and we discuss skills and supports needed for the practice and future directions for extending the method.",

When I found in the last issue (ANS 25:1) that Jane Georges had not only read and appreciated Toward a praxis theory of suffering (ANS 24:1), but had considered and taken the time to further write about it, I was surprised and pleased. My article, as Georges noted, is based on 10 years of inquiry (which has resulted in 52 other refereed publications), was in ANS summarized, and by necessity and form, abstracted. I am somewhat puzzled, given the nature of her critique and her interest in my work, that she did not read the background referenced articles to acquire a broader knowledge of the theory. My theory of suffering is derived from the words and actions of more than 200 men and women from various cultures and is, within the traditions of qualitative methodology, theoretically grounded in that data. Georges' critique neither adds to nor alters my results. Georges' argument centers on the meaning of the word “praxis.” While the everyday usage of praxis is “the practice of a technical subject or art, arising out of the theory of it” (Oxford English Dictionary), Georges chose a narrow definition and a particular usage and theoretical perspective to (re)view my theory. While one may possibly critique a theory from a different theoretical perspective, one cannot nullify the results without data, without further investigation. I look forward to Georges embarking on her research program to verify her notions. I invite her to present her findings at the Qualitative Health Research in Banff in April 2004, and will be delighted to engage in substantive discussion in press.",

The theory may also be useful in framing future research studies exploring the relationship between access to care and utilization of clinical preventive services related to breast health care.",

    "abstract": "REGARDING RECENT PUBLICATION, POLITICS OF NURSING KNOWLEDGE AND EDUCATION Dear Dr Chinn: I am writing to voice my dismay at the publication of the article, Politics of Nursing Knowledge and Education, a piece in which our disaster nursing program at The University of Tennessee in Knoxville was attacked with the most volatile, incendiary language. Inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise erroneous statements were made about the program without any effort to verify the soundness of the authors' inferences. That the authors were allowed to put forward inadequately supported, unverified claims and conclusions is cause for concern. In this brief space, I would like to address our program and provide an honest picture of what we teach. First, we are first and foremost a program that teaches nursing, with a goal of producing nursing leaders with advanced skills and knowledge appropriate to our times. As part of their course of study our graduate students are challenged to examine where disaster nursing as a specialty fits within nursing theory and practice, but they are also charged with analyzing how the language and paradigms of nursing, applied in a disaster setting, mesh with the care paradigms and terminology used by a myriad of other disciplines who are part of collaborative disaster response teams; it was in conjunction with this analysis that the 2008 paper by Persell (cited in the article) was written. This kind of critical appraisal is important because evidence in literature demonstrates that when responders understand and share common disaster-related language, psychological stress among care providers is reduced, effective intervention is enhanced, and more lives are saved. Second, as part of our approach to fostering crossdiscipline understanding and collaboration, students learn not only from nursing faculty, but also from scholars and experts from allied disciplines and agencies with a stake in disaster response. We have found that this interdisciplinary approach not only enhances students' experience and increases their fund of knowledge and comfort with language, but also that it also instills in other professionals a new appreciation for the breadth of what nurses know and can contribute to disaster leadership. Third, our curriculum is rich and complex. We teach about all hazards in equal measure, but in addition to nursing theory and research our emphasis is on things other than hazards: ethics, psychological impacts of catastrophic events on survivors and caregivers, public-health law that impacts response and intervention, economics and budgeting, crisis communication, providing care in mass-shelter settings, disaster triage. Fourth, our program is based on the realization that we are training nurse leaders to function in a global society. With that in mind, we as faculty develop and nurture a global world view among our disaster nursing students, teaching about world affairs, caring for the vulnerable domestically and abroad, international border issues that impact nursing practice in calamity, evaluation, and treatment of diseases linked to poor sanitation and poverty, and how to cope when the values orientations of the nurse are in conflict with those of the society in which the nurse provides care. Our doctoral students have conducted ground-breaking research into the psychological experiences of Haiti earthquake survivors and responders, nurses who provided care during Hurricane Katrina, perceptions of nurses who have served on humanitarian aid teams, caring within the context of faith-based disaster response, the development of situational awareness among health professionals, educational efficacy of modes of Basic Disaster Life Support training, and the lived experiences of atomic bomb survivors who subsequently immigrated to the United States. Students' and graduates' interests are as broad as what we teach. Contrary to what the authors of the Politics article allege, our Tennessee disaster-nursing program has not been taken over by a military mindset. We are indeed unique, but what we are most of all is pioneering, preparing nursing scholars, and clinicians with advanced skills who can lead and practice during calamity—wherever it may be—as part of interdisciplinary teams, responding to the needs of our 21st century global society. It is my belief that every disaster response in recent memory could have been made more effective by the presence of a nurse with disaster expertise in a major leadership position. Yet, in order to be placed in major roles of authority, nurses must have the training and credentials required. Our doctoral program provides both, and prepares nurses to apply their core, expert, nursing knowledge in the context of a global world. That is something of which we are extraordinarily proud. It is unfortunate that the authors chose the approach that they did to examine what they called the “militarization of nursing.” Had they adopted a more scholarly stance, using language reflecting ethical consideration for presentation of well researched conclusions based on abundance of data, and absent personal attack, their argument might have generated the scholarly discourse that true scientists esteem. Instead, what they have written is an affront, not only just to our program but also to ethics, and all who value honest, dispassionate examination of ideas and thought.",

    "abstract": "NURSING AND HUMAN RIGHTS Many years ago, I heard Marge Piercy describe politics as the ability to exercise your values in the world. Piercy was discussing her writings with a group of faculty and students and describing the feminist concepts embedded in her work. Piercy has written a number of engaging novels that explore various dimensions of women's experience in the world. One of her earliest novels Woman on the Edge of Time was written after she witnessed first hand the flood of letters that her friend Phyllis Chesler received in response to her 1972 ground-breaking book Womenand Madness.1 In her novel, Woman on the Edge of Time, Piercy2 depicts a woman committed to in-patient psychiatric care after beating up her niece's pimp in an attempt to save her niece. To cope with the horrendous conditions of her life and her imprisonment on a psychiatric ward, she time travels to a nonsexist world of the future where she works her way through possibilities for survival. Reading one heartrending letter after another from women who read Chesler's Women and Madness was a life-altering experience for Piercy and the others sorting through the barrage of mail. The women who wrote the letters recognized in the book their own experience of victimization by prevailing social, political, and personal mental health practices and were compelled to share their own stories to affirm the truth of what Chesler recounted in her book. In the talk that I heard Piercy giving several years later, she recounted how both her fiction and her poetry were political acts—ways to exercise values that are grounded in women's experience and women's vision of a preferred future. Every time I hear (nurses in particular say) something like “I am not political,” I think of Marge Piercy's stunning definition of what it means to be political. By virtue of being a nurse, we have assumed a commitment that is inherently political—a commitment to abide by a code of ethics that respects the dignity of all people and the right of all people to receive health care in their time of need. We also acquire a body of knowledge that serves as a powerful tool that can be used for the good of humankind and a forum from which to advocate for the humane and caring treatment for all. By performing our daily obligations as nurses, we exercise our values in the world. We can, and indeed we must, use our privilege as nurses on behalf of human rights. The authors who have contributed to this issue of ANS bring to the fore many of the challenges that nurses and health care providers face in exercising our obligations. These articles expand our understandings of the complex issues that surround health and human rights and challenge us to reconsider and recommit our efforts on behalf of those we serve. I hope that you will contribute to the conversations that these authors introduce. —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

The research was undertaken to determine whether a perception of disintegrity--a perception that life has not gone as it should have--may be such a link. Ninety-one master's-prepared nurses between the ages of 55 and 70 completed a measure of the extent to which they had experienced stress in balancing a career with other life involvements. They also assessed the extent of integrity-disintegrity in their life pattern and recorded the illnesses that had occurred during their middle years. In a path analysis, once the indirect path through disintegrity was considered, the direct path between stress and illness was so minimal that it was considered eliminated. This result suggests that unless stress leads to feelings of disintegrity, it is not likely to lead to illness.",

    "abstract": "Nursing Activism and Scholarship to Address Health Disparities This issue represents a collaborative initiative between Nursing Research and Advances in Nursing Science. We both put forth a call for manuscripts that address the issue of health disparities. As a result, both journals are featuring articles related to this topic in the September 2005 issues. There is ample documentation worldwide that confirms tragic disparities in health status based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other factors. However, 2 great mysteries remain: what creates and sustains these disparities and what is to be done to reduce or eliminate them. Nursing has a long legacy of reaching out to serve those who are underserved, and of developing community programs to empower people who are disadvantaged and disenfranchised. Nursing professional organizations have a strong history of supporting social policies and programs to improve the health of all people, particularly those who are less fortunate. Other groups of people have devoted substantial resources and years of dedication attempting to right the wrongs of health disparities. However, the realities of disparities in health remain, weakening the very fabric of communities worldwide. Advocacy and activism are vital if the realities of disparities in health status are to change. However, advocacy and activism can be substantially strengthened with strong foundations in research and scholarship. Nurse advocacy and activism have made important marks in many communities, but the outcomes of nursing efforts to address health disparities have far too often gone unnoticed and undocumented. Anecdotal accounts of remarkable accomplishments by nurses and other activists are moving, but they do not form a basis for replicating or expanding that which has seemed effective in any given instance. Even more fundamentally, underlying hegemonic conceptual ideas that shape circumstances creating and sustaining health disparities have rarely been challenged. Vital philosophic and conceptual challenges to that which is taken for granted hold a key to breaking open new possibilities for action. These issues of Advances in Nursing Science and Nursing Research offer collections of research and theoretical/philosophic insights that can serve as models for future scholarship, and as inspiration for future advocacy and activism. These authors are activists in the finest sense—challenging that which has been taken for granted and searching for evidence that can shape action to bring about meaningful change toward improving the health of those who need it the most. If as professional nurses we move to the next logical steps according to the works of these authors, we will indeed make a major mark toward righting the wrongs of health disparities. Peggy L.

Although traditional Korean medical doctors, Hanuisa, largely practice at traditional Korean health clinics and hospitals, the nurses who work at these traditional Korean health clinics and hospitals are trained at the same nursing education programs as those who work in Western medical clinics and hospitals. The purpose of this study was to find a concept of “nursing” in the context of traditional Korean medicine, which traditional Korean nursing in modern era may inherit and expand upon, by reinterpreting the concept of nursing in terms of a philosophy that supports traditional Korean medicine. This article utilized a philosophical analysis of literature that is essential to the reinterpretation of this concept. In terms of core concepts, nursing and traditional Korean medicine share common features with each other. On the basis of these common features, cowork in practice should be more developed and articulated. This will add new characteristics to the history of Korean nursing.",

The phenomenological description was created using van Manen's approach for hermeneutic phenomenology and Drew's method for examining the researcher's preunderstanding of a phenomenon. The phenomenological description was historicized using Scott's concept of historicizing and Leininger's Sunrise Model as a framework.

    "abstract": "As this issue goes to press, the United States has just ended an amazing and historical election. As Barack Obama often stated during his campaign for President of the United States, he was not exactly the most likely candidate to be seeking this highest office of the land. Born in Hawaii of a Black Kenyan father and a White Kansas mother, with a relatively short history in politics and no family background of political or economic privilege, he waged a 21st-century campaign focused on changing the way politics works in the United States. I believe that reflecting on what has just occurred and some of the elements that went into this historical event holds lessons for each of us who desire fundamental change in healthcare worldwide. Obama has demonstrated in action and in words a keen sense of history and a well-considered analysis of the significance of the past in light of present circumstances. He hails from Illinois, the home state of Abraham Lincoln, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862 to end slavery in the United States. Now, as the first Black American elected to the presidency, Obama not only reveres the significance of Lincoln's historical stance but has also studied in depth the nature of Lincoln's presidency, including his legacy of making friends and allies with former political rivals. Obama has also examined in depth the record of many other leaders and historically significant events worldwide and integrates his understanding of history with his analysis of present-day challenges and his vision of the future.1 Some claim that Obama's vision is lofty, idealistic, or unrealistic. While these claims hold some merit, I believe what makes his vision viable is that his ideas for the future are firmly grounded in ideals—values that can be put into action in everyday, simple, and realistic ways. Obama often makes the very lofty claim that his administration will not be “politics as usual.” He demonstrates in action and words his intent toward this change. Here is an example: During a recent press conference, a reporter asked him about an issue that connects with his “friends in State government.” Obama answered the question about the issue, and then turned to the implications in the “friends” phrase. He explained that making decisions on the basis of friendship would not be the way his office would work but rather the needs and interests of the people affected by the decision would guide his decisions and actions. Finally, the success of this election was due in part to a large and energized grassroots effort—the commitment of millions of citizens who were determined to see this thing happen. Of course Obama is an inspirational, inspiring figure unmatched by few in world history. But without the broad, well-organized, and committed support of ordinary folks from every walk of life, this election could not have happened. The forces of corporate power and elite interests remained alive and well throughout this campaign, and all too often in this country and others, those of privilege prevail against the interests of ordinary, less powerful people in society. This was a modern-day uprising, demonstrating that like other powerful movements in history, this kind of thing can happen. This is exactly what we need in healthcare. The interests of the people have not been well served for many decades. I believe that nurses, who represent a large grassroots group of people of ordinary background and standing in society, can become the leaders, movers, and shakers of the future. The articles in this issue of Advances in Nursing Science speak to this possibility for the future, grounded in our collective historical record. I hope you will find inspiration as you read this issue. Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "HEALTHY PEOPLE BEYOND 2010 At the time this issue is underway, the United States is embroiled in a major process toward “reform” of the healthcare system. The process is acrimonious, with the fundamental conflict being between the interests of corporate profit-making groups and the interests of the people. The fact is that the United States lags far behind other countries in significant measures of overall health, even though it spends more on healthcare than does almost any other country. Part of the tragedy in all of this, to me, is that many other countries in the world look to providers and scholars in the United States for leadership in terms of advances in practice and healthcare knowledge (nursing, medical, dentistry, etc), and yet our system is in shambles. There are many aspects of healthcare in the United States that are indeed noteworthy, and there are many providers and scholars whose leadership makes valuable contributions to health worldwide. But there are many aspects of healthcare in the United States that are not in the best interests of those we serve, yet exert an undue influence worldwide. One such aspect is the dominance of the medical model of care, one steeped in Western ideologies. While this dominance has long and deep historical roots that extend the world over, the fact that the US system has developed a fully entrenched model of care that is structured around medical dominance is a major factor in sustaining this model worldwide. This model remains firmly entrenched even though it is widely recognized that it is not the best model upon which to build a comprehensive and effective system that promotes the health and well-being of all citizens. Over the week during which I was contemplating the content of this editorial, I heard thoughtful interviews of 2 well-known physicians who stated in no uncertain terms that the changes that are currently proposed for change in the US system are necessary but fall far short of achieving what is actually needed in healthcare. They each went on to describe what they envision to be actually needed—greater emphasis on real prevention (beyond disease detection), programs of education and support for people who have chronic illness conditions, emphasis and teaching on nutrition and exercise, support for lifestyle and behavioral changes to promote wellness, better access to mental health care, access to wholistic modalities of care, and a more comprehensive approach to care that focuses on the family and the conditions of people's lives. In short, they were describing nursing. But they did not acknowledge nursing. On the basis of my recent interactions with well-intended physicians who were clueless about nursing, I might even go so far as to speculate that these physicians being interviewed may not even be aware of the fact that these things are at the heart of nursing. So this leaves me with the question: what do we, as nurses concerned with the development of knowledge, contribute? The most basic challenge, I believe, is to continue to make the voice of nursing stronger, louder, better understood, and heard (even among our own colleagues). We do not need to do so from a motive of competition or self-interest. Our primary motive should be, and must be, a conviction that what we offer is exactly what the majority of people need the most from healthcare, regardless of where on the globe they reside. There are countries and systems that place far more emphasis on the kinds of care that nurses provide than can be found in the United States. It is time to make these systems more visible and to bring together the best ideas and act on them, so that healthcare worldwide becomes just that ... HEALTH care. As nurses, we can do that, and we must. —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "RESPONSE TO LETTER TO THE EDITOR: EXAMINING EPISTEMOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT NURSES' KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT IN TRANSGENDER PATIENT CARE We would like to thank Asa Smith for comments about our article, “Nurses' Knowledge About Transgender Patient Care.” It is time to create dialogue about the ways that nurses learn about and treat patients from stigmatized groups so that we can reduce health disparities and improve the quality of care that all patients receive. We would like to respond to a couple of the comments that Smith makes about our article. First, related to the comment about the “paucity of discussion surrounding internal stigma” in our article, we would like to point out that our focus was on nurses, who were presumably mostly heterosexual and cisgender (we did not ask their identities, but nearly 10% volunteered that they were LGB [lesbian, gay, and bisexual], and none reported identifying as transgender). Most nurses are in the dominant majority in regard to gender identity. The term “internalized stigma” is almost exclusively used in regard to people with the stigmatized identities, who internalize the negative stereotypes and belief systems of society in a way that affects their perceptions of themselves as flawed or deviant. This internalized stigma results in feelings such as shame, guilt, and self-hatred and often leads to some of the self-harm behaviors seen in these populations (substance abuse, suicide, and unhealthy coping strategies for stress). People in the dominant group, on the contrary, internalize stereotypes that generally do not affect their own perceptions of themselves. Nurses, as a collective, have power over patients and are agents who enact stigma. Our study revealed many ways that nurses created or maintained stigma through their bungling of names and pronouns, gossiping, and isolating of patients; however, the intent of our study was not to study stigma in individual nurses but to assess their knowledge of transgender patient care issues. Second, Smith notes that empathy is a “key determinant of knowing.” We did not find much evidence of lack of empathy in our study, as most of the respondents reported negative behaviors that they had witnessed, rather than conducted, and many indicated that transgender patients were poorly treated in general. They did, however, frequently mention their lack of knowledge regarding transgender patients as a factor. Smith also mentions syndemic theory as a good model for the study of health outcomes of transgender patients, and we agree heartily. However, it was not an appropriate model for our study because our focus was on nurses' knowledge rather than causal factors related to a health outcome variable. Transgender patients experience many simultaneous and serial social, interpersonal, and community-level traumas that combine to increase their risk for negative health outcomes. It would be very useful for nurses to be aware of how stigma works in the lives of many of their patients and the syndemic relationships among health determinants. Finally, Smith recommends the use of Carpers' epistemological model to better understand nurses' attitudes about transgender patients. This does seem like a potentially useful model, and we would argue that gender binary systems in place in health care settings and society at large impact the ways of knowing that Carper and other researchers have suggested (eg, gender stereotypes and binaries affect the way we construct ethical frameworks, aesthetic standards, personal attitudes, religious/spiritual beliefs, and so on). A paper on this topic would likely add much to our current knowledge and help in the understanding of how nurses approach the care of patients who do not fit into their worldviews. In summary, as Smith notes, “It would be interesting to hear some clarification on how stigma education and awareness raising could improve the interventions that are provided to both student and practicing nurses.” We would argue that stigma education is an intervention, but that has not been widely applied in nursing education or continuing education to date. We would love to hear of the experiences of others who have engaged in stigma education and suggest that in the case of transgender health care issues, the gender binary system must be addressed as a powerful source of stigma. —Michele J.

    "abstract": "EXAMINING EPISTEMOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT NURSES' KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT IN TRANSGENDER PATIENT CARE This letter is in response to the July-September 2016 article “Nurses' Knowledge About Transgender Patient Care: A Qualitative Study.” I found the article to be a valuable and engrossing piece of literature with a vital message for improving nursing practice. However, I have concerns regarding the epistemological framework that was used to determine the causes of a nurse's lack of knowledge when caring for transgender patients. In the article, there was extensive discussion about the effect of insufficient education, institutional-enforced gender binaries, and external social stigma on the health disparities seen in this population. While these are all important points, I noticed a paucity of discussion surrounding internal stigma as a causal factor of the documented discomfort, confusion, and absence of understanding seen in the nursing workforce. This is an important issue to discuss as it could adjust implications for future practice and education to improve care for this patient population.1 This issue at the core is both a philosophical and ethical one because it highlights an assumption that nurses do not exhibit stigma or bias when caring for patients. In the health care setting, it has been documented that both nursing students and registered nurses can exhibit negative attitudes toward transgender patients.2,3 From an epistemological standpoint, the results gained from this study did not consider all angles and focused primarily on insufficient education and external stigma as the primary causal factors. There was inadequate discussion in this article about the effect of internal bias and discrimination on the current health disparities seen in this particular population. Given that some nurses did display such attitudes in the study this article was based on, a nurse's assumptions about gender binaries may not necessarily be caused by a lack of knowledge or experience.4 It could also arise from preconceived stigma and resistance to adapt an egalitarian world view to gender identities.2,3 Ultimately, this creates a disconnect because not all causes of the reported lack of nursing knowledge have been explored.2 As a result, it raises concerns about the completeness of the claims and recommendations presented. One applicable example that highlights this issue is the landmark “Fundamental Ways of Knowing” article written by Barbara A. Carper in 1978. Carper5 claimed that knowledge and beliefs in health care practice stem from multiple factors, including empirical, personal, ethical, and aesthetic factors. According to Carper,5 self-understanding and empathy are key determinants of knowing from a personal perspective. Therefore, stigma creates a barrier to learning because it reduces empathy and negatively impacts how a nurse understands patient needs and perspectives. In addition to typology that illustrates the many influences on health care practice, there are theories that highlight the issue of caregiver stigma in minority groups. One pertinent example is syndemic theory, developed by Singer and Clair6 in 2003. Syndemic theory relates to the interaction of social conditions with disease. It is described by Singer and Clair as “...interacting deleterious conditions among populations produced by the structural violence of social inequality.”6(p434) Research with transgender patients in a syndemic framework has found multiple psychosocial factors that contribute to the documented health disparities within this population, including HIV infection and high-risk sexual behavior.7 In addition, there is a higher prevalence of mental health disorders combined with syndemic indexes of social marginalization within transgender patients, such as a history of incarceration and/or sex work.7 Given the combination of these multiple factors, it makes stigma within the nursing workforce a more probable phenomenon.6–8 This stigma has indeed manifested in the previously mentioned studies2,3 and should be considered and addressed among the nursing profession. Otherwise, education may only be minimally effective at reducing bias and improving health care quality for transgender patients.1,3 In summary, I would be interested in hearing about an appraisal of the impact of internal stigma on the lack of knowledge surrounding the needs of transgender patients. It would be interesting to hear some clarification on how stigma education and awareness raising could improve the interventions that are provided to both student and practicing nurses. It would be also be intriguing to apply Carper's5 Fundamental Ways of Knowing and to examine how empirical and personal influences play a role in understanding this phenomenon. Ultimately, recognizing and applying the optimum measures to reduce the discrimination and health disparities through education, sanctions, and policy development are needed to develop appropriate care for this vulnerable patient population.1,4 —Asa B.

    "abstract": "The Web is more a social creation than a technical one…. The ultimate goal of the Web is to support and improve our weblike existence in the world. We clump into families, associations, and companies. We develop trust across the miles and distrust around the corner. What we believe, endorse, agree with, and depend on is representable and, increasingly, represented on the Web. We all have to ensure that the society we build with the Web is of the sort we intend. 1(p123) The internet, and subsequently the World Wide Web, has dramatically changed our world. The Web, along with other technological influences such as film and television, has catapulted the social order from a print-based society to a world society that depends on electronic media. Like all such transformations in the world, it is not an easy one, and the issues that we are compelled to grapple with are not of our own choosing. There are 2 such issues that I believe are particularly important for nurses and the others concerned with promoting health. The first issue concerns the generation gap that has emerged as youngsters began to learn to use computers, the internet, and the World Wide Web from their earliest days. Those in the academic world perceive this gap in dramatic ways, decrying the inability of young students to read, to write, to spell—to engage in all the skills that we in the older generation see as the skills of those who are literate. At the same time, we encounter midlife students (and some colleagues) who still resist using the computer, who resist using e-mail, and who discount any information that might be obtained in the World Wide Web. What we of the older generation are only beginning to realize is that our preconceived, print-based notions of literacy are being transformed, and will be replaced by expectations, standards, and skills that we are only beginning to acquire and appreciate. Spender, who believes that we are probably the last of the purely print-proficient, has observed: What we have to see is that we are the only generation which will know both mediums, the print and the electronic. We are the ones who will be able to make comparison, who will be able to assess, evaluate and transfer our experience, expertise—and wisdom—form the old forms to the new. 2(pxvi) The challenge is to acquire sufficient appreciation and proficiency with the new media in order to have a major influence in this process of transfer. The second issue that I believe to be important concerns access—access based on economic advantage, social and economic class, gender, political and legal forces, and many other dynamics. Nurses themselves around the world represent all issues of access, as do the populations and individuals whose health concerns us. All too many are excluded from the new world of cyberspace by conditions beyond our control, but even more devastating are the self-imposed and self-controlled factors that limit access and involvement. Spender credits Florence Nightingale as one who declared that without the book, women would be in danger of dying of intellectual starvation. 2(pxxi) Likewise I believe that nursing today will be in danger of dying if we do not fully embrace, use, and become proficient in the new internet-based technologies. The fact that many women still eschew technology and the internet-based technologies does not work in our favor, for our own discipline, and for many of those whose health we claim to protect. Cyberspace is where new communities are being formed and it is where new human values are being forged. Nursing, in order to remain viable and vibrant in influencing health world wide, must be involved, visible, and influential in the world of cyberspace. As the authors of the articles in this issue of Advances in Nursing Science demonstrate, there are nurses who are fully engaged in the world of cyberspace, and have considerable proficiency in creating virtual realities. It is my hope that their work will inspire not only improved scholarship in this area, but will encourage everyone to move to your own next level of cyberspace proficiency!",

In-depth interviews conducted in May-June 2020 with 9 participants, and analyzed using content analysis, revealed 5 themes: adjusting to living with HIV/AIDS and diabetes impacts beliefs about COVID-19 risks; COVID-19 information seeking and accuracy; trade-offs in self-managing multiple chronic conditions; balance between safety, relationships, and the society at large; and discordant perceptions and actions. Some participants were resilient from previous experiences.

    "abstract": "CONFRONTING CONCEPTUAL CHALLENGES IN NURSING SCHOLARSHIP Advancing the science of nursing requires a variety of forms of inquiry and also a clear understanding of what constitutes nursing as a discipline. Neither of these is possible without meaningful conceptual work. Science is, after all, a conceptual enterprise. Everything we learn involves refinement and development of concepts that give us more clear, specific, and effective ways to think about the world around us. The need for quality conceptual work is particularly evident in nursing. Many of the things that nurses describe as crucial to the discipline and that capture the purportedly unique position of nursing are understood primarily on the conceptual level. Think about how often in nursing we reference abstract ideas such as presence, justice, dignity, personhood, caring, and holism. Although conceptual work is critical to nursing, and to science in general, rarely is it given the specific attention that is necessary to move our science forward. Even more disturbing, much of the work identified as conceptual lacks the rigor and meaningfulness we expect in our scientific endeavors overall.1 As a result, it may be tempting to abandon such work. But abandoning an approach is not the solution for flawed applications; what is needed in nursing (and in other disciplines) is renewed understanding of the importance of conceptual work and the development of alternatives so that work can proceed at a high level. Several initiatives are crucial at this stage. First, nurse scholars must move beyond the long-standing obsession with literature-based concept analysis and expand the array and quality of conceptual work. The focus should be on the development of concepts using methods appropriate to the conceptual problems and the phenomena being conceptualized. Existing research methods can be used for concept development and new methods of inquiry based on expressive and aesthetic forms can be created to expand the types of inquiry done to enhance our conceptual foundations. An important part of such change in our inquiry is the explicit recognition and emphasis on creating better concepts as a part of scientific progress. Second, such work must be tied to a clear and delineated conceptual problem. The need for the inquiry as well as how the work will contribute to science should be explicit. Third, such work must involve the methodological rigor that is appropriate to any quality inquiry, with rigor evident in every aspect from problem delineation to sampling and data analysis techniques. The overemphasis on literature-based analysis, and lack of attention to concept development overall, is a clear hindrance to scientific progress.1 Fourth, nurses must recognize that philosophy and methodology change over time and embrace changes in methodology rather than rely on decades-old viewpoints because they are the most prevalent. Finally, advancing nursing science on the conceptual level requires awareness of the contributions that all scientific work makes to concept development and building on that development across an area of science. As a simple example, consider the evolving concept of fat based on new insights about types of fat and the roles of different adipose tissues in the body. Empirical studies have advanced the understanding of physiology, but that understanding persists in a radically reshaped concept of fat.2,3 We grow science conceptually even if we do not recognize that connection. Imagine the possibilities if we make that connection explicit and directly confront conceptual problems with sound methods. A clear challenge in the path forward concerns inquiry known as \"concept analysis.\" More than one-half century of conduct and critique of this work have resulted in little change and the oversaturation of the literature with studies that often are of poor quality, duplicative of previous work, or that offer little link to scientific progress.1,4 Rigorous analysis does have a role, however, and is useful to answer questions such as: When, and why, did this concept emerge? What real-world phenomenon does this concept capture? How does the use of the concept reflect current thinking compared with its historical use? How do we distinguish phenomena using an array of similar concepts? What conceptual problems are addressed by variations? What is the current conceptualization of some phenomena and does that capture the situation well? How can we conceptualize a new situation effectively? If we cannot conceptualize something, we cannot study it; and if we do not address the conceptual aspects of a situation of interest, we lose the ability to think clearly and communicate about it. An example of the contribution of analysis to new ways of thinking can be found in Westra and Rodgers'5 work on the concept of integration that offered an alternative to dominant ideology concerning \"adaptation\" or \"adjustment,\" neither of which reflected what they were seeing in their older adult population upon discharge from the hospital. Such insights have important implications for those in practice as they can shape thinking and also interventions to support people during such experiences. Systematic and expedient growth in our science can come from an explicit focus on concept development. Nurses at all levels need to understand the critical role of concepts in our knowledge base well beyond any connection they may have with theory, and nurse scientists can work to ensure those concepts are useful. We have immense opportunities for improving our conceptual repertoire if those invested in the science of nursing confront conceptual problems with quality inquiry and with the creativity that is needed to continue the advance of nursing science. —Beth L.

    "abstract": "Register's Theory of Generative Quality of Life for the Elderly (GQOLE) is an innovative and intriguing model that comprehensively addresses QOL issues in older adult populations. Furthermore, creating this model from a theoretical framework using an ontological perspective and introducing the concept of connectedness as a missing factor among other QOL models and measurement tools builds a strong foundation for a new perspective in how QOL can best be evaluated. “A Middle Range Theory for Generative Quality of Life for the Elderly” not only describes Register's GQOLE model and its potential implications for nursing practice but also brings up salient points regarding the structure and evolution of QOL models and measurement tools over time. Furthermore, though not directly mentioned, there is speculation that the authors themselves may be creating a QOL measurement tool based on this model in order to accurately assess the state and well-being of older adult patients. It is unclear, however, how this might be put effectively into practice in the traditional sense of such a tool, as the authors noted the numerous QOL categories and areas that can have variable meanings based on individual values and beliefs. Although the underlying premise is connectedness within each of these areas, it seems that in order to both holistically measure each patient and allow for individual preferences of which areas are perceived as important QOL factors, there would have to be a complex system of identifying those important areas without quantifying less important areas that could lead to assessing an individual as having a poorer QOL than he or she perceives. In order to achieve the true meaning of QOL, a standard paper-type measurement tool may be inappropriate and a more elaborate electronically based system may be warranted. Based on Register's GQOLE model, it would seem paramount to first identify which areas each patient deemed important QOL factors for himself or herself, then measure his or her perceptions or “connectedness' within each one, and perhaps look at these factors over time. It will be interesting to see the tool that is created through this model. Aside from the description of the model and its implications for nursing practice, there was one point the article made that was slightly concerning regarding elders being displaced to new living arrangements in residential centers, assisted living facilities, or institutional centers. The authors emphasized that this can be a negative experience with decreased QOL perceptions for residents. This may be true for some who view such a move as a loss of autonomy, but it should also be noted that many older adults who move to these facilities feel an enhanced QOL. They make new friends and connections, get involved in any number of activities, feel a greater sense of security from the surrounding residents and healthcare staff, and are less burdened with chores such a cooking meals and cleaning. Again, QOL varies for each individual and changes through different stages and phases in life. Acknowledging and respecting this individuality is paramount in truly assessing QOL. Register's GQOLE is perhaps the most accurate model to date in capturing this intricate essence. Marilyn J. Hammer, DC, RN Predoctoral Student, University of Washington, School of Nursing",

    "abstract": "When an elderly patient who is dirty and bruised presents to the emergency department, red flags go up everywhere. Caregivers are questioned and assumptions are formed regarding the lack of care or the possibility of abuse. Most medical personnel would not consider that a frail 70-year-old patient is in such a condition because he or she was intoxicated all week—no one except those of us who have dealt with similar episodes on a more personal level. Nor would most people realize how difficult it is for caregivers to care for parents in their time of need after years of suffering neglect and abuse at their hands. Not unless you have been there. Last year I was not only 1 of the 28 million Americans who had an alcoholic parent1 but I also joined the ranks of another 39 million households caring for someone older than 50.2 When I first read the article “The Effects of Past Relationship and Obligation on Health and Health Promotion in Women Caregivers of Adult Family Members,” I felt excited and almost relieved to see research devoted to a subject that so closely reflected my own personal struggle. Personal yes, but isolated no; the article reminds us that 1 in 4 women has been abused by a conjugal partner, approximately 10 in every 1000 children experience abuse or neglect, and 17% of women have had one experience of incest before the age of 16. These same women are the 80% of family caregivers, both daughters and spouses, who in later years are expected to care for those who abused them.3 I hope this article will provoke those in the medical profession to think about each individual situation and consider not only what is best for the patient but what is right for the family. In our society it is unacceptable to just assume that the family knows best or that the family should or can take care of their elderly. I will personally never forget the physician who informed 5 grown children whom he had never met that one of us needed to take our father home and care for him. Nor will I forget the feelings of shame and inadequacy that he provoked when we refused. If the doctor had exerted the same amount of effort in obtaining our family history as he had on attempting to make us feel responsible for our father's physical condition, he may have understood our reasoning. Understanding that each family is different is instrumental in helping both the patient and the family in these difficult situations. Each member of my family participated at different degrees in caring for my father; each was greatly influenced by experiences and current coping skills. In later years I became my father's house-cleaner, cook, nurse, and personal chauffeur, just to name a few titles. It was not an easy role for me to assume, but I am grateful for the few times where I could see small glimpses of the man my father could be when not clouded by the effects of alcohol. Thank you for making others aware that not all family dynamics are the same and that care should be given not only to the patient but to the family unit as well.

    "abstract": "This ANS issue topic comes at a defining moment in world history. The United States is preparing for a presidential election that holds the possibility of shifting the ways in which this nation addresses conflict. It is clear that most of the US populace now recognizes that the aggression waged against Iraq was not only ill-advised but also wrong. The challenge now before this world power is finding a course of action that is best for all parties concerned. A large proportion of the world population wants simply to end the violence now. The solution could be as simple as that, but probably it is not. Violence begins at home, where in virtually all cultures in the world people learn at an early age how to deal with conflict and differences in violent and hurtful ways. Skills required to make peace, prevent violence, or respond to violence in nonviolent ways are all too rarely engrained in day-to-day experience. These are skills that not only are more difficult to learn but are also exceedingly difficult to practice. There is a growing recognition of the connection between violence in homes, schools, and workplaces, and violent conflict between gangs, tribes, nations, and all other forms of social organization. Many projects, many with an important presence on the World Wide Web, have been put into practice to intervene with domestic violence and to teach children and youth alternatives to violence and positive responses to violence. Many of these projects are developed as a result of the excellent research completed in recent years by scholars in many disciplines. Yet it remains to be seen whether these projects will eventually bring us to a place as a global society where nonviolent approaches will prevail. This issue of ANS stands as a testament to the excellent contributions being made by nurse scholars in the area of violence. The articles in this issue address violence on every social level—in the home, at work, school, and between nations. I believe that the articles published in this issue of ANS will have a wide influence within nursing and beyond. Like the early work of nurse scholars such as Ann Burgess and Jacqueline Campbell, nurses continue to make substantial contributions that can change the “story” where violence is concerned in our homes and beyond. There are lessons to be learned from each of the articles in this issue that every reader can literally take “home.” Among these are the vital steps that I believe to be some of our most important challenges in nursing today: learning to recognize the very real problem of horizontal violence within nursing, learning ways to intervene, responding, and preventing this disease that affects each and every nurse.

    "abstract": "Response to Letter to the Editor In response to the much welcome feedback from M. J. Hammer, we are in the process of developing a quality-of-life (QOL) instrument that focuses on connectedness, which is the unifying theme in Register's Generative Quality of Life for the Elderly model.1 We believe connectedness is QOL. Therefore, instruments researchers currently use, which seek to determine factors that diminish or influence QOL proxies, are not sufficient. Instead, our instrument will measure connectedness to the forces and processes (people and systems) that older adults encounter on a daily basis, which is QOL. We believe ontological and conceptual congruence is essential in QOL research. As Hammer and a number of experts rightly indicate, QOL measurement must be multidimensional (holistic) and allow for subjective appraisal that accounts for individual preferences2–7 among the various types of connections. Although experts generally recognize the multidimensionality and subjective imperative related to QOL, no QOL instrument can demonstrate ontological and conceptual congruence regarding the essence of QOL, which is connectedness. Hammer adeptly underscores the importance of subjectively quantifying the connections that are most salient to each patient, without diluting or distorting the overall QOL measure, regardless of patient setting or circumstance. Researchers have recognized, and we acknowledge, that people perceive events or situations in different ways.8 We also acknowledge that perceived connections are dynamic and subject to change over time.1 In research related to stress and coping, Lazarus9 contends a person's perception greatly determines the impact of stressful encounters. We believe the same holds true for connectedness. The variability in perceptions is especially applicable to older adults who are displaced to residential centers, assisted living facilities, or other institutional settings, either by choice or by necessity. We plan to purposefully examine individual perceptions and subjective appraisal of the various types of connections by using the strategies germane to Lazarus and Folkman's10 Daily Hassles scale. Lazarus and Folkman's instrument measures the frequency and perceived severity of stressful encounters. However, the instrument examines frequency and severity separately. Severity scores offer insight into the saliency of events. Frequency scores offer additional insight in terms of the most common daily hassles. Our instrument will examine the frequency and relevance of the various dimensions of connectedness. Relevance scores will inform us about the saliency of the connections and frequency scores will help us identify the types of connections typically employed by the individual. We believe this strategy can address Hammer's concerns about the appropriateness of traditional paper-and-pencil instruments and ensure ontological and conceptual congruence in QOL measurement. Furthermore, relevance and frequency information can help researchers design a new class of nursing interventions that target connections perceived as most important to the individual. Interventions grounded in the patient's unique perceptions and personal appraisal can leverage optimal patient outcomes and offer a more constructive alternative to the current problem-oriented deficit-based approach to QOL among older adults.

    "abstract": "This issue begins the 30th volume of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS). When I founded the journal I would not have even dared to predict its future. As I reflect back to the early days of the journal, I am reminded of my own childhood when I would eagerly entreat my parents to tell me about “the olden days!” It was a risky enterprise—not only because ANS was to be a journal whose audience would be limited but also because of the kind of journal that we intended it to become. At the time that ANS started, nursing research was in relatively early stages of development. There were only a handful of doctoral programs scattered throughout the United States. In fact, the master's degree was generally still considered “the terminal degree” in nursing. No schools of nursing had faculties of nursing consisting of all doctorally prepared nurses; few deans were doctorally prepared. There were no personal computers; mammoth mainframe computers in universities were fed letter-size cards punched with rectangular holes containing research study data for a limited range of analysis. Several days later, the results were fed out on large sheets of fan-folded paper that the researcher poured over for days to extract the meaning of the printouts. Journals that published research results were few and far between, and almost none were eager to review or publish other kinds of scholarly works. Their hesitancy at the time was understandable. Nurses were still attempting to establish themselves and their discipline as a solid and respectable academic discipline, and the academy demanded that nurse scholars demonstrate excellent research skills. Few other disciplines pursued research methods outside the mainstream of traditional quantitative approaches, and other approaches to inquiry were either not yet developed, generally viewed as perhaps interesting but less-than-rigorous, or were relegated to academic departments that were considered humanities or arts—not science. Theory, and the development of theory, had begun to arrive in a formal way in the nursing literature only a few short years prior to the time that ANS was conceived. So what was the future to hold for a journal that was founded with the intention of publishing a broad range of approaches to research, a wide spectrum of forms of scholarship, and most frightening of all, material that challenged the status quo and prompted readers to consider ideas that might not be in the mainstream? Personally, I thought at the time that if we managed to provide a few years-worth of literature that achieved these intentions, the enterprise would be well worth the effort because this was precisely what I believed was needed in nursing. I certainly did not take issue with the pathway that generally was accepted as that which was required to establish nursing as a worthy academic discipline. But I also held the view that nursing required much more than that offered by traditional research methods alone, and I also believed that in order to flourish, nurses would need to think outside the boxes that had restricted the discipline for far too many years. As fate would have it, just at the time that I was contacting nurse scholars as possible contributors to the first issue, I met Barbara Carper. Her work and her insights fit perfectly with the early intentions around which the journal was being founded. Her work provided for many others and me affirmation that indeed, nurses require approaches beyond that of traditional science and that our disciplinary focus requires a broad range of thought. Shortly after the founding of the journal, I met Jo Ann Ashley. Jo Ann helped to shape and inspire the early commitment for ANS to publish works that challenged the status quo; in the 2 short years that she lived after the founding of the journal, she regularly challenged me to take bold editorial stances and to remain faithful to my vision of cutting-edge scholarship of excellent quality. None of us involved in the early development of the journal envisioned reaching Volume 30! I know that those who are no longer living would be gratified to see their hopes and dreams for the journal survive to this point. The ongoing success of the journal can be attributed only to a host of people who have supported and affirmed what we have become—the scholars who have tirelessly volunteered their expertise, time, and energy to review works submitted for publication; the authors who have looked to ANS as a possible avenue for publishing their work; the publishers who have provided material support and expertise that makes the journal's existence possible; and our many readers all over the world, in far greater numbers than reflected by the numbers of individual subscribers. It is with deep appreciation to each and everyone who has made this possible that I offer you a continuing commitment to excellence in all forms of scholarship, creative approaches to the challenges of the discipline, and articles that I hope will stimulate your thinking and prompt lively discussions around the complex issues that nursing faces today.

    "abstract": "BIAS EMBEDDED IN TECHNOLOGY—AN EMANCIPATORY CHALLENGE FOR OUR TIME Over the years, Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) has published a large number of articles addressing the harm of bias, prejudice, and stereotyping and how these cultural dynamics harm the health and well-being of all people,1 but especially those who are disadvantaged by them. A number of these articles acknowledge the persistence of harmful practices and attitudes in health care in general, and in nursing in particular, calling for emancipatory responses—awareness and action—to change the status quo. This issue adds to this significant body of literature in ANS, and yet as we take in the important insights of these and other nursing literature that address these challenges, we cannot avoid acknowledging the intractability and persistence of the very problems we aspire to change. The incredible growth of information technology, particularly offered on the Internet and the world wide web, was assumed by some to be a path to creating a more equal universe—a world where knowledge would be democratized. Now, it is clear that the vision of a democratized Internet environment has faded, and in its place we see information technology weaponized as a tool for domination and power. The fact is that technological tools are not free from bias. They are created by human beings, who build in to the technologies they create their attitudes, biases, and stereotypes, often in such subtle ways that most people cannot detect what is actually happening. A recent interview posted on the Scholarly Kitchen with Safiya Umoja Nobel,2 the author of the new book Algorithms of Oppression3 explores some of the challenges facing scholarly publishing and the persistence of bias built in to technologies, both in content and in structure. Another notable blog post by Charleton McIlwain,4 an edited volume titled The Intersectional Internet: Race, Sex, Class and Culture ONline,5 and Sara Wachter-Boettcher's “Technically Wrong” book6 are additional excellent resources to begin to understand the problems we face. It is notable that these excellent sources are, for the most part, authored by women and people of color, and they are published on sites and by publishers that are not in the mainstream. Nevertheless, for those of us in dominant groups where dynamics of discrimination are structured and persist, it is time for us to take notice and to take every action we can in the direction of change. McIlwain's post4 provides important clues about our own ongoing complicity, knowingly or unknowingly, to perpetuate the problem, even in ways we access information using search engines. McIlwain's investigations show the tendency of search engine users to migrate toward sources that are produced by and that reflect the dominant cultural perspective, while avoiding those sources that are produced by, or reflect the views of culturally different and minority authors. Naming, acknowledging, and understanding the subtle ways in which technology perpetuates bias is a start. Next, it is up to each of us to shift our practices and habits, and to challenge the assumptions underlying our interactions with information technologies. It is time to take notice of the writings of nurses of color, and of other scholars who are dedicated to overcoming bias and discrimination. It is time to make sure students know this literature, that we nurture habits of deep reflection on ways we all participate in systems of injustice, and that we shift our own practices to fight injustice and racism, not sustain it. —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "Drastic advances in health information technologies using computers and mobile devices have made nursing scholars use these technologies in nursing knowledge generation in various areas. One prominent area of nursing knowledge generation using health information technologies is nursing research. Indeed, the number of nursing researchers using health information technology has drastically increased in recent years. The National Health Institute has specific objectives related to technology and innovation in their strategic plan for 2022-2025.1 The 2022-2026 National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR) strategic plan2 also declared, \"NINR supports research that is innovative, applies the most rigorous methods, and has the potential for the greatest impact on individual, community, and population health.\" Indeed, the use of highly innovative technologies in nursing knowledge generation could greatly improve the accuracy of the knowledge that is generated and facilitate the intervention delivery of nursing knowledge, especially among underserved groups of women by providing easy access, precise measurements, and/or effective media for delivery.3-6 These technologies allow nursing scholars to reach out to the populations that have been difficult to approach physically without time or geographical restrictions.7-10 Also, these technologies could provide non-face-to-face interactions through which populations with stigmatized conditions could safely and comfortably interact.7-10 These technologies allow nursing scholars to systematically deal with diversities and complexities in nursing phenomenon through computer programming and algorithms.7-10 Indeed, the use of health information technologies has been ubiquitous in all areas of nursing research.7-10 The use of cutting-edge technologies frequently brings million dollars of research grants to nursing scholars in their knowledge generation, which has been a driving force of the increasing usage of computer and mobile technologies in nursing knowledge generation. I have witnessed that the use of highly innovative technologies has made many nursing scholars shine in the field. As an early adopter of computer and mobile technologies in my own research projects, I am surely an advocator for the use of technologies in nursing knowledge generation. Although the use of the new technologies gave me lots of headaches, it also gave me a number of exciting opportunities to shine in my field. At the same time, I frequently found that the traditional ways of data collection would work better than digitalized data collection methods for some populations (eg, older adults, those without technological literacy). Also, I often found that some technologies could delay the research process rather than facilitate the process because the study population needs to have access to the computers or mobile devices and login to the systems. I also found that technologies would not be welcomed by some populations who want actual tangible human interactions. Certainly, there exist various sources of biases and unsolved issues in using the technologies in knowledge generation although future advances in the technologies would resolve them ultimately. With the increasing emphasis on technology and innovation in nursing knowledge generation, especially research enterprise, it may be the right time to reflect on the use of health information technologies in nursing knowledge generation and work on the measures to ensure rigor in technology-based research. Throughout the past 3 decades while I have been using computer and mobile technologies in my own research for nursing knowledge generation, I frequently found myself to look for some methodological guidelines for my research and tried to develop some measures to ensure the rigor of my research. I bet all researchers who are using the technologies might have experienced the same dilemma and they would have their own ways to evaluate a new technology before adopting it for their research. I want to conclude this editorial with 3 questions that I have used in my research to determine if I am going to use new technologies in my studies for nursing knowledge generation. More questions and further guidance could help our next generation of nursing scholars. Will the new technology be necessary for nursing knowledge generation? Will the new technology improve the process of nursing knowledge generation? Will the new technology facilitate nursing knowledge generation among the target population? —Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAANEditor",

    "abstract": "The famous novel entitled \"invisible man\" by Ralph Ellisoni1 caught my attention in recent months. The novel was brought up in a board meeting of a nursing professional organization when the members were discussing the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues. Although the novel was published in 1952, the context illustrated in the novel continues in 2020s in many oppressive situations with power games. This novel made me contemplate on many things, including the invisibility of nursing. When I was in PhD program in nursing in 1990s, people suspiciously looked at me and asked if nursing really had a PhD program. In early 2000s, when I shared with my neighbors that I had a PhD and post-doc experience, people looked at me with a strange glance and asked me why nursing would need a PhD degree. Even in 2020s, when I said to my ophthalmologist that I was a faculty member in a school of nursing, he asked me if a faculty position in nursing schools would require a master's degree. Although nursing science has advanced drastically in recent years, the status of nursing science in the community of health science may have not advanced as expected as well. Nurse scholars have published an increasing number of articles on their scientific findings and scholarly discourses. Yet, in reality, it is not clear how nursing scientific outputs are actually being recognized and cited by researchers from other health disciplines, and how nursing scientific outputs are used in health care, especially in nursing care. With an increasing emphasis on impact factors of peer reviewed journals, the number of submissions to nursing journals has drastically decreased.2 Despite the recent upward trend of impact factors, nursing journals tend to get much lower impact factors compared with other health disciplines because of multiple reasons.3 One of the reasons may be related to our own publishing practice and mentoring for our PhD students and junior faculty members. Indeed, when we are mentoring our PhD students and junior faculty members, we are emphasizing them to publish their works in high impact journals, which may imply non-nursing journals in a way. When we cite articles in our publications, we tend to cite more medical or other health science articles rather than nursing articles. When we submit a proposal to a funding agency, we tend to use a well-known theoretical framework from other disciplines rather than using a nursing theoretical framework. Then, how about researchers from other disciplines? Are they citing our scientific works? The case gets worse at an individual level when our scientific works are published mainly in nursing journals. In the academic, each faculty members' H-index is recently viewed as an indicator of the impact of their scholarly work, and it is often used in the promotion process.4 At some institutions, H-index is required to be listed in the faculty members' promotion packages. An interesting phenomenon that is being noted and discussed among nursing faculty members is: those who have mainly published their works in nursing journals tend to have a much lower H-index compared with those who have mainly published in non-nursing journals. Subsequently, junior faculty members want to submit their works to non-nursing journals rather than nursing journals. Is our nursing discipline on the right direction? When nursing began to have our own journals, nursing community widely celebrated it.5 When the National Institute of Nursing Research was firstly established in the National Institute of Health, nursing community was thrilled to celebrate our discipline's growth.5 All these milestones in nursing were not possible without extensive efforts of early generations of nursing scholars, researchers, and clinicians. This may be a significant point of nursing discipline to make nursing more visible in the scientific community while adapting to the new environments with all the metrics that did not exist in the past.

The major theories used to frame this problem include the triple risk model of bed-sharing and evolutionary theories. Nurses are masters of multidisciplinary collaboration and are well positioned to unify the triple risk and evolutionary views of infant bed-sharing to guide future innovations in health care practice and research.",

    "abstract": "Reflections on Nursing Care Outcomes This issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) reflects to me the vital role that this journal has taken in the realm of nursing's scholarly literature. The work that is reported here goes far beyond the limited, albeit important, task of demonstrating what can be expected to evolve when nurses are involved in patient care. The articles in this issue do address expected and demonstrated outcomes of nursing care, but they also present, examine, question, and critique the models or mental images associated with the aims we seek, and the worth or value of what we aim to accomplish as nurses. Most important, several of the articles in this issue contain rich images of outcomes that are fully grounded in the deepest values and ideals of nursing care. Over the years, ANS has consistently challenged the dominant models that drive the healthcare industry, presented work that demonstrates alternatives, and work that is clearly grounded in nursing values. The dominant medical model yields many important outcomes, and the methods of traditional science provide compelling evidence that can shape and improve nursing practice, and many nurses practice and conduct research that is grounded in these dominant models. But if as a discipline we were to be limited to what comes from practice and research grounded in dominant models, we would lose the vitality and richness that persist in nursing. The richness of which I speak—deep human connections, finding meaning in illness, nourishment of the mind/body/spirit—is not readily accessible to the traditional methods of science, nor are the outcomes associated with these healing experiences simple or easy to comprehend, much less articulate. We live in an age where the most meaningful and elusive experiences of human existence are often glossed over or ignored, but they remain ever present and even more ardently sought. It is possible to simply take the position that the realm of science and the goal of producing demonstrable outcomes is not the appropriate “place” to address meanings, to explore values and dynamics grounded in human care and caring, and that these concerns lie within the realms of religion or philosophy. I believe that we do not have the luxury of sweeping these concerns into other realms, and that it is possible to continue to reach for ways to bridge the traditional gaps between the empirical and the artistic, that which is seen and measured and that which is deeply comprehended by the human spirit. The future of nursing as a discipline is still in the making, and nursing as many of us have known it will evolve into other forms. But the values of caring that have shaped nursing care will persist in some form because this is at the heart of human desire. As research has shown, people do want medicines that cure, surgical interventions that fix what is going wrong, and competent nursing care that contributes to these important outcomes, but they also want, even yearn for, the kind of nursing care that comforts on many levels, that makes sure everyone involved is on the same page, nurses who understand their deepest concerns, who appreciate what they are going through, and who help interpret the complexity of their care and the system in which it is happening. As the contents of this issue of ANS demonstrate, we can reach for these important goals, and we can create the circumstances in which to achieve outcomes that come from the best and the fullest forms of nursing care.

    "abstract": "Physiology and the idea of holism As the due date drew near for this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS), I realized that the manuscript submission level was far too low, which extended the time frame for this issue. I sent a message to members of the Advisory Board and Review Panel, announcing the very unusual extension of the date for submitting manuscripts for this issue, and received a reassuring response. This prompted me to ponder a number of issues related to the journal, as well as issues more broadly situated in our discipline. From the perspective of ANS, I realized that perhaps this journal is not reaching colleagues whose research and scholarly interests fall within the realm of physiologic health dynamics. The journal has developed a general conceptual, theoretical, and philosophic focus, and although we regularly publish empiric research and articles that reflect or address physical phenomena, these are not typically associated with ANS. Therefore, scholars whose work revolve around empiric research and physical phenomena may not think of ANS as a journal that addresses their interests. However, ANS has regularly included issue topics and articles that encompass physical phenomena, for example, “Childhood Health and Illness.” More fundamentally, through our descriptions of topics for forthcoming issues, we have consistently reflected an underlying commitment to the fundamental nursing value of holism, calling for works that embrace holistic approaches to the development of nursing knowledge, including empiric research and the full range of human experience, including physical experience. The level of theoretic and philosophic abstraction that ANS tends to emphasize, however, may ironically lead us more toward phenomena that are perceived to be outside the realm of the physical, with the unintended consequence of straying from a truly holistic approach. As nurses and as nurse scholars, all of us have a long tradition of seeking to embrace the whole. At the same time, the sociopolitical structures of practice, education, and science remain fragmented into parts and particulars. As a result, the mental structures through which we experience the world, and from which we work, make it extremely difficult to truly embrace the whole. It is my hope that the articles in this issue of ANS will prompt readers to consider the dilemmas involved in embracing the irreducible whole. Send us letters expressing your thoughts and ideas about this dilemma, and perhaps we can initiate some stimulating discussion in the months ahead! Peggy L. Chinn PhD, RN, FAAN, Editor",

Normalcy is a powerful and complex idea, and the term can be used intentionally or unintentionally to various effects. We aimed to raise awareness of the complexity of this idea of normalcy and thus promote a more critically reflective understanding among nurses and other health professionals. By raising questions about how we use normalcy in our discourses and the potential impact that our professionally socialized interpretations of what constitutes normal might have on patient experience, we can encourage nurses and other health professionals to develop an intellectual curiosity about how the idea of normalcy works, and to be more critically reflective about how they integrate normalcy language into their practices and patient-centered communications. By unpacking the ideas that normal is always a good thing in the context of patient experience, and that normalizing can neutralize that which is bad in the health care world, we can qualify the language used and the metamessages conveyed for the ultimate benefit of patients.",

    "abstract": "This integrative review was conducted to determine the current state of science in understanding the process of awakening the spiritual self/identity among adolescents with cancer. Twenty-six studies were included in the data synthesis. Six major themes were identified: recounting rough spots of the cancer experience, the spiritual self/identity, nurturing the spiritual self/identity, affirming values and beliefs, abiding resilience and transcendence, and portraying the cancer experience. Findings offer increased understanding of the process of awakening the spiritual self/identity among adolescents with cancer that can guide spiritual nursing practice and inform future research including the development of spiritual care interventions.",

    "abstract": "To the editor: I was pleased to see the attention given to the theory of health as expanding consciousness in Yamashita and Tall's recent article (ANS 1998, 21:1). I would like to address a number of points in their critique that are not accurate reflections of the theory in the hope of precluding misunderstandings that may accrue. The problem lies mainly in the paradigm from which the authors speak. They examine initial parameters of the theory with knowledge from other fields, fields that are derived from philosophies of science different from that of health as expanding consciousness. My understanding of scientific criticism is that it proceeds from within the paradigm of the theory being evaluated, not from another set of rules. Yamashita and Tall begin by stating specifically that the Newman theory fits with the alternative medicine paradigm. It does not. The alternative medicine paradigm is an ill-defined conglomerate of therapies considered alternative to traditional medical therapies but with the same goal of promoting health in the sense of wellness (relief of disease). The Newman theory clearly is not limited by this goal. The Newman theory can (and often does) incorporate medical therapy but has an entirely different focus on the meaning of the whole experience. In their discussion of the assumptions of the theory, Yamashita and Tall state that the second and third assumptions are \"not surprising\" to those familiar with psychoneuroimmunology and other named fields and then go on to paraphrase the meaning of these assumptions as \"simply\" that \"psychic imbalance can create the conditions for disease to manifest.\" Not only does this language tend to trivialize the assumptions, but also the explanation of the theory in causal mind-body terms betrays the unitary nature of the phenomenon. Referring to Lamendola and Newman's study of persons with HIV/AIDS, Yamashita and Tall challenge the use of the term \"health\" in relation to the devastating experiences accompanying this disease. That criticism would apply to other chronic disease situations as well. What is apparent in the authors' comments is that they do not accept the basic premise of the concept of health as expanding consciousness. As long as one is viewing health from the standpoint of wellness (ease), it is impossible to grasp the meaning of health as expanding consciousness in the experience of disease. There are other misinterpretations of the theory and inaccuracies. Yamashita and Tall's attribution of a \"search for equilibrium\" to the theory is inaccurate. The quotation they use to support this assertion [the citation of which should have been my 1994 book, p. 21] depicts a constant movement between equilibrium and disequilibrium, and the thought continues with my citation of Buckminster Fuller that the system moves from disequilibrium to disequilibrium, never pausing at equilibrium. The authors' example from neurolinguistic programming psychotherapy aimed at refuting an insight-to-action relationship is based on action targeted at a specific behavior and does not apply to my theory. In health as expanding consciousness the insight emerges from recognition of the pattern of the whole. There is no way of knowing in advance what that will be or what action will be indicated. In describing the nurse-client interaction, Yamashita and Tall equate my use of mirroring with Carl Rogers' theory. The mirroring that I have referred to is based on the pattern that has emerged in the first interview and is not the Rogerian sense of non-directive interpersonal communication. Further, the authors parallel my use of interpenetration of the nurse's and client's fields with the concept of therapeutic touch. They admit that they do not understand what I am saying about the field or if it is similar to the work regarding physical energy fields in other disciplines, but then proceed with an explanation of other concepts of physical energy, claiming that this explanation aids in understanding my theory. The ideas of interpenetration of fields and wave interference come from a holographic view of this interaction and do not imply an exchange of energy, as the authors suggest. Toward the end of the article, Yamashita and Tall emphasize \"negotiation, reciprocity, and empowerment\" as dimensions of research as praxis. Admittedly I used those terms in my first glimpse of research as praxis but later dropped them from my concept of praxis because they are instrumental and inconsistent with the unitary-transformative paradigm. I thought I had made it clear to Yamashita on more than one occasion that these concepts are no longer consistent with my thinking, and I am puzzled as to why the authors persisted in including them as part of my concept of praxis, except perhaps as a basis for elaboration from the standpoint of other authors. The example they cited from Yamashita's research would be viewed from my standpoint as an evolving pattern of expanding consciousness. Finally, there are a couple of inaccuracies in regard to the research method: the assertion that, \"In all cases, the initial interview begins ...\" and the claim that \"None of the other studies ... have utilized such final [follow-up] interviews ....\" I admit to having contributed to the image of a specific step-by-step approach by having published a research protocol in my 1994 book, but the method is not static and there are many variations on the theme of asking participants what is most meaningful in their lives, as reflected in some of the more recent studies. And my recommendation to Yamashita to use a follow-up interview was based on Litchfield's initiation of a follow-up interview in her 1993 research. Research within the context of evolutionary emergence is creative and interactive and arises out of the theory, the understanding of the researcher, and the circumstances of the selected participants.

    "abstract": "This issue topic of Advances in Nursing Science (21:1) is the only issue topic that we have repeated with some regularity. It first appeared in Volume 7, No. 4, July, 1985. This issue, like the three subsequent issues focusing on \"Critique and Replication,\" included some of the most well-known and frequently cited articles to appear in ANS. The important works that appear in each of these issues affirm a long-standing premise of the development of science, namely that knowledge develops as strong and worthy when it is subjected to the challenges of critique and replication. The announcement for each of these issue topics requests manuscripts that focus on previously published works in ANS, based on the premise that a journal will be stronger when it turns inward and examines its own contents, and extends and develops that which was previously put forth. In some instances, authors have provided critique or recent development of work they authored in previous issues of ANS. In other instances, authors have critiqued or extended the work of other authors. There is a unique feature of this particular issue of ANS. Four of the articles that appear here are authored or co-authored by individuals outside of the United States. The countries represented are Canada, Australia, and Japan. Consistent with recent trends in authorship in ANS, we are beginning to develop a truly international scholarly community, where rich and diverse perspectives and ideas are exchanged. The process of critique is unending exactly because it is a process that continually seeks new and different perspectives. In extending this process and the discourse of ideas beyond the bounds of a single country, to a global level, we are entering a new and exciting phase of possibility in the development of nursing knowledge. Nursing has long been known as a worldwide occupation, with significant common threads that bring us together from around the world. The efforts of many nurse scholars who work internationally to develop our common understandings of theoretical and philosophical ideas have resulted in the development of a worldwide discipline, science, and art. At the same time, my own international experience has demonstrated that nurse scholars in other countries hold theoretical and philosophical perspectives that challenge and enrich my own parochial understandings. Sometimes I have found it difficult to comprehend meanings that derive from cultural experiences that are outside of my realm of experience. But when I have been able to step in to a different realm of understanding. I have found valuable and important insights. I would be delighted to see this discourse extended even further in the pages of this journal in the form of \"Letters to the Editor.\" This is a valuable means of providing exchange of ideas and perspectives. Letters can be published within a reasonable time frame, providing timely exchange of perspectives within the nursing scholarly community. As you read and reflect on the ideas in this and other issues of the journal, I hope that you will be inspired to write a brief letter to share your thoughts with others who read ANS. Send your letters to: Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN University of Connecticut School of Nursing; 231 Glenbrook Rd., U-26; Storrs, CT 06269-2026; I look forward to hearing from you! Peggy L.

This theoretical vision is illustrated with a case study about a nurse who was infected with HIV on the job. The purposes in presenting the case study are to give testament to this brave woman's story, illustrate the dynamics of a contextualized ethics, and challenge nurses to make changes in practice, policy, and structure to foster truly ethical work and relations with others.",

Examination of resource materials at a midwestern university revealed that nurses were neither victims nor heroines of a male-dominated system. Although the evidence supports the oppressor/victim model of women in the professions, it also shows that nurses were instrumental in challenging the university to respond to the need for upgraded nursing education. Particularly striking in the resource material was the effect student nurses had on the development of the occupation at this institution.",

    "abstract": "Imagine how it feels to always belong-belong in a diversified community, for it is the diversity in nature that gives the web of life its strength and cohesion. [1] (p248) There is a prevailing perception, in my experience, that the path to unity and community in nursing lies in agreement and uniformity. I recall the many times when someone urged membership in a particular organization, or a vote along a particular line, or a public litany of admonition that if only nurses could agree, our political and social problems would be solved. These sentiments are not in themselves wrong or in error, but they usually find voice without the important preliminary steps of listening carefully for the many diverse perspectives the underlie the concerns and differing opinions of many nurses. Learning to appreciate diverse perspectives and concerns is truly a lifelong project. Those with relative privilege in a culture carry with them what Frye [2] called the \"privilege of not hearing.\" She recounts instances when feminist women of color have challenged white feminist activists who proceed without regard for their needs, concerns, and interests: Many white feminists have to a fair extent responded to the demand; by which I mean, white feminists have to a fair extent chosen to hear what it was usually in their power not to hear. The hearing is, as anyone who has been on the scene knows, sometimes very defensive, sometimes dulled by fear, sometimes alarmingly partial or distorted. But it has interested me that I and other white feminists have heard the objections and demands, for I think it is an aspect of race privilege to have a choice-a choice between the options of hearing and not hearing. That is part of what being white gets you. [2] (p111) Those who are relatively disadvantaged in a culture carry the burden of always having to hear, to listen, to be on guard, to notice, to attend, to Figure outwhat other perspectives are and how they influence what is happening in the environment. Those without privilege have little or no choice in carrying this burden. For those with privilege, a first step in learning to value diversity is to notice when someone expresses a viewpoint that is not familiar or that is different. Once you notice, it is quite another experience to stop, set aside the inner reactions and responses to the other viewpoint, listen attentively, ask reflective questions to make sure you understand what you are hearing, and finally enter into a deep discussion that provides for exploration and clarification of that which is unfamiliar. An even deeper exploration requires self-reflection and critical examination of assumptions and social circumstances that make the hearing so difficult and the understanding even more difficult. And even deeper explorations require finding ways to share the journey with those who hold different perspectives in ways that deepen appreciation and understanding. The path seems very difficult, even impossible. But I believe that if we are to reach for the unity and community we say we desire in nursing, it is time to to aside the appeals for agreement or singular voting strategies and instead to enter into realms of hearing and exploration that call forth our diversities. By doing so we can learn to appreciate the many perspectives and concerns and needs that our colleagues bring to the table. And in the process we will find the resources from which solidarity and community are built. Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "CONTEXTUALIZING PATTERNS OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR: A UNITARY-EMANCIPATORY-TRANSFORMATIVE PERSPECTIVE The phrase “patterns of health behavior” is a broad term that has been used to define a wide array of phenomena that are associated with health. It is applied to behaviors related to health in individuals, families, communities, and populations. It has been conceptualized and used as a broader reference point for describing and understanding health. Advocates of studying patterns of health behavior implicitly or explicitly consider the focus on behaviors a more direct and useful indicator of the health of the person or population. In addition, exploration and analysis the patterns of behavior provide a more comprehensive approach to understanding health than a diagnostic approach. It is clear that research specifically and scholarship broadly, that focus on patterns of behavior associated with health, have yielded useful knowledge that can be applied in clinical practice. Nursing scholarship grounded in a variety of conceptualizations of patterns of health behavior has advanced our understandings of health beyond disease and diagnostic perspectives alone. Conceptualization and contextualization of phenomena is central to how they are applied to the human condition as in nursing. A unitary-emancipatory-transformative perspective sheds new light on patterns of health behavior. The primary elements of such a conceptualization follow and are derived from unitary nursing science and unitary appreciative praxis1–3: Unitary: Patterns of health behavior are expressions of life patterning that provide clues to the wholeness of individuals, families, communities, and populations. Emancipatory: The use of patterns of health behavior as a focus of research or practice as unitary expressions of wholeness offers possibilities for participants to develop approaches to their health and well-being that are liberating in nature and in line with their own wishes and desires. Transformative: Considering health patterns as expressions of wholeness and focusing research or practice on liberating potentials of the participants generates knowledge that can evoke transformation. The unitary perspective provides a context for exploring health patterns of behavior as expressions of wholeness. The long evolving conceptual theme of human wholeness suggests that relying on data or information in reductionist ways fails to capture the fullest understanding and appreciation of the human experience. The value of this contextualization of health behaviors is that it avoids the fragmentation of human experience. This requires a synoptic orientation to health behavior patterns in which data are considered contextually. In some ways, this might extend beyond patterns of health behavior embracing other aspects of the human experience in which information is explored relationally. Human wholeness is reflected in a variety of phenomena, including health behavior, that provide information about the whole but cannot singularly represent fully the nature of the whole. These phenomena include those labeled as physical/physiological, mental/emotional, social/cultural, and spiritual/mystical. A synoptic lens as an alternative to an analytic lens on these phenomena allows for the exploration of the interrelatedness of the health behavior within patterns extending beyond to additional phenomena and creating more expansive knowledge. For instance, patterns of health behaviors of women who were abused as children might be brought into the eye of the narrative of each woman's abuse. Doing this might create a richer and deeper understanding of what is happening in the lives of the women relating health behaviors to abuse narratives. The goal would be to create a more meaningful understanding of the life pattern of women abused in childhood inclusive of health behaviors. This understanding may suggest approaches to enhance health and well-being that are more enduring. The unitary contextualization of patterns of health behaviors described opens the doors to a greater array of possibilities for improving health conditions through mobilizing personal power in a variety of forms. Novel knowledge of patterns of health behavior are generated that may create the capacity for mobilizing inherent personal power to create desired changes. These are the power of knowledge and of awareness. The methodology associated with the praxis of unitary appreciation applied to patterns of health behavior would be participatory in nature. This provides for the power of cooperative understanding that evolves from mutual exploration of patterns and their relationship to larger forces and factors of the person, family, community, or population. Cooperative development of strategies to improve health and well-being would be a goal of this kind of praxis for research or practice purposes. The culmination of these 3 powers would lead to the power of liberation. This involves the development of competencies and skills that allow for enhancement of daily life aligned with dreams and desires. Returning to the example of women who were abused as children, this approach would enable the women to use these sources of power (knowledge, awareness, cooperation, and liberation) to improve the conditions of their lives. Focusing on patterns of health behavior would provide a trigger for broader exploration and focus on development of strategies and competencies to enhance health within the context of life as a whole. Seeing health patterns as expressions of wholeness and focusing research or practice on emancipating potentials of the participants generates knowledge that can arouse transformative possibilities. The type of holistic understanding that emerges from the process clarifies and explicates health behavior patterns. The meaning of patterns of health behaviors is expanded in making connections with other phenomena of life. As noted previously, one of the outcomes of using the unitary contextualization of patterns of health behaviors is the development of competencies to improve health and well-being through knowledge, awareness, cooperation, and liberation. The transformative potential resides in the capacity of the research or practice to support the participants in developing themselves as instruments of change. The aim is toward seeing and appreciating patterns of health behavior in this broader more inclusive light relevant to the wholeness of the participants. This in turn suggests expanded potentials and possibilities for action. Returning once again to the example of women who were abused as children, patterns of health behavior incorporated into the abuse narrative reveal ways of approaching health that go beyond treatments of symptoms or disease. Emphasis is placed on potentials and possibilities that might not have been considered with a health behavior perspective alone. The advancement of science focused on patterns of health behaviors is impressive and has significant relevance for nursing extending our understanding beyond a disease or symptom-focused model of care and treatment. The ongoing contributions to persons, families, communities, and populations based on previous inquiry and practice offer the possibility for improving health conditions in accord with the focus. The unitary-emancipatory-transformative contextualization of patterns of health behaviors suggests potentially broader and richer appreciation of human wholeness and healing. Acknowledging the need for extensive development of this perspective to become relevant, this perspective is shared to evoke thinking about novel ways to approach nursing's role in promoting health and well-being and the betterment of the human condition generally.

    "abstract": "POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM AND PSYCHOSIS: SO THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE What follows is only that which I can recall after having a total knee replacement some months back. My physician marks his initials on the knee to be replaced while another man in scrubs asks me if I've ever had any trouble with anesthesia. I tell him yes, fentanyl and Versed (midazolam), and remind him that it should be on my admission interview with the nurse. He asks me what happens, so I tell him it makes me crazy, crying, and paranoid, and it lasts several days. Only propofol has not caused me any problems. He says for me not to worry, “We'll take good care of you.” My next awareness is being wheeled into this strange hospital ward area that doesn't look familiar. I tell them that I'm not supposed to be here. “Yes you are dear, you're in the hospital.” I feel confused and scared. Why am I here? “You had surgery on your knee.” I did? They wheel me into a room that looks very old, maybe a little dirty, and I don't want to be there. My knee doesn't hurt, so why is everyone constantly pressuring me about pain and why is there a morphine pump in my arm? I have to go to the bathroom, and I'm a nurse, so without thought I bring the morphine pump with me. But almost immediately, all these people are running in asking me what do I think I'm doing. “I'm going to the f***ng bathroom, what does it look like?” I mean, really, they can see me sitting on the toilet and hear the sound of urine. They sternly tell me that's not allowed anymore, that they must accompany me. I see they want my urine as if it belongs to them, but it's mine. Every time I try to get up, it's as if there's an alarm under my sheets that goes off to tell them I'm trying to escape, even if it's only to escape to the bathroom. A nursing colleague and friend, Linda, comes and brings me a basket of “goodies.” As it's close to Halloween, there are black cats, pumpkins, witches, and the like, in the basket. Linda tells me, “They only want to make sure you don't fall when you get up, so just push the button and let them help you, it'll be all right.” But I don't want their help, I want their absence. After Linda leaves, the black cats, pumpkins, and witch cutouts in her gift basket start circling the room on the wall, all around me. They even wrap around the corners of the room on their circling journey. I'm hallucinating, but I'm not scared. I know I'm hallucinating, and it's fun! Somehow Linda has arranged this for my entertainment. Is that cool or what?? But I know not to tell anyone this great secret; otherwise, they would try and give me medicine to stop my fun. I tell the cat and the witch that I must sleep. My orthopedist and nurse practitioner (NP) unwrap my knee and look disturbed. I can see the knee cap is red and swollen. Maybe it hurts, I'm not sure. They want an MRI and x-ray; something must be wrong. I still believe they care for me, as a person, so I do as they ask. They return to tell me I have a blood clot under my knee cap and I have to go back to surgery to put in a drain asap. Another nurse friend, Marietta, is in my room for just a few moments. I think, when the “anesthesia types” come to the room and without asking my permission begin to drag me out of the room. Marietta tells them not to forget I can't take fentanyl, and I say “only propofol, please.” One of the “anesthesia types” waves her arm at us as if to blow us off. I was in a whirlwind of activity, completely confused. I don't remember that anyone noticed or cared. I just felt pushed around, literally. After this second surgery, I start urinating in the bed, a complete incontinence that I never feel until the urine seeps up between my legs and warms them. The nurses are very angry at me. The irony of their wanting my urine earlier and now having it forced on them makes me smile. Still, I'm deeply humiliated. That evening, the NP tells me that they want another MRI of my lungs and a CT scan of my head to make sure I didn't have any blood clot problems there. But this doesn't seem right, and I don't want to do it. I want him to arrange for my release. He refuses. I remind him I'm not a prisoner, which he seems to find amusing. Now I'm certain—I've been taken prisoner. Somewhat aggressively I remind him that I have rights and that I can leave AMA any time I want. When I repeat this to my significant other, Will, he says there is no way he'll help me do that, and that he won't be around if I'm going to pressure him into doing something he knows is wrong. Apparently, I have powers over him that he won't be able to resist if he sees me in person. I see they've gotten to him as well. Linda and Marietta convince me that it's the right thing to do and why. It makes some sense, but more importantly, I want to be free, so I agree to the tests. As I predicted, there was nothing wrong. But I know what they're up to, they're trying to keep me prisoner. If I can't trust Will, I can't trust anyone in my family; they'll all be trying to make sure I maintain my prisoner status. Now I'm being summoned to a discharge planning meeting that is going on about me! I walked there alone, without assistance, but quickly see a police woman is standing close to my shoulder. I watched them all talk about me, but they never asked me anything. Linda was there saying that I could go home with her. The 20 people or so in the room nodded their heads in agreement, as did my NP who was giving me a strange look, as if I shouldn't be there. Getting back to my room, my nurse brings me two Percocet (endocet) tablets. I take one, but the other sticks to my tongue so I put it back in the cup until I swallow the first one. But I hear 3 “taps” on the 2-way mirror between my bed and the bathroom. They must think I'm hoarding drugs and are keeping track. I stare at the mirror and take the second pill so she can see. It's the nursing student I saw in the hall; I'd noticed she'd snuck into my bathroom some time earlier. My NP came into my room to discuss what he thought was my “disorientation,” perhaps even a little psychosis. I angrily reminded him that I was completely sane and that my discharge was being planned at the meeting we both attended. He tried to tell me such a meeting never happened. And, everyone else confirms this, even Linda. But to this day I can see that meeting as clearly as I see the computer I'm typing this essay on. It was palpably real. I recall what everyone was wearing, where they were sitting in the room. Ultimately, I just have to tell him to leave my room and stay away from me. This seems justified to me as he only has a master's degree and I have a PhD. I deserve more respect. Finally, Linda comes to get me and take me to her home where I'll be safe from everyone including my family. I'm still sure that someone is hiding in my bathroom to keep an eye on me, so Linda checks out the bathroom and reassures me that no one is there and that there is no 2-way mirror. I ask her several times to be sure, and she patiently reassures me each time. I hold my head down and tightly grip Linda's hand while we walk down the hall toward the outside door, as I'm completely certain that if my primary adversarial nurse sees me, she'll try to take me prisoner again. Linda tells me no one will take me that she has me now, everything will be OK. So that everything stays OK, I refuse to return any calls from Will or any of my family members to let them know where I am. I'm safe only with Linda. Slowly, I came to understand that I really had been disoriented and psychotic. It was 4 more days until I felt I could talk to Will and safely go home. And, it was at least 6 more months before I really felt myself. Epilogue ... I have wondered and wondered how I survived this ordeal. How had my nurses become my enemy, and why did they not seem to care if I felt that way. Looking back, I think they just thought of me as that “crazy lady with the knee.” Why was a nurse, not on their staff, the only nurse who did advocate for me? Linda took my disorientation and psychosis right in stride; she did not endorse it, but she tried to answer my disorientation with facts in ways that allowed me to maintain my sense of independence and at the same time come to understand that I really was having a reaction that some people have after surgery. I could be totally crazy with Linda, but I always felt safe in following her direction. Much later when I was able to get copies of my medical record, I found that they gave me fentanyl in both the first and second surgical procedures. Then, it all made sense to me. I hope my story serves as a cautionary tale of how much real nursing presence in a patient's life means. Although I now know that Linda met with a discharge planner, there were no nurses present, nor my physician or NP. If I had not had such a wonderful friend as Linda, and her extraordinary extended family, what would have happened to me upon my release from the hospital? No one knows, not even me. Clearly, nursing must consider the period following hospitalization as critically as we view actual hospitalization itself. In this day of oversight by Medicare, insurance companies, and The Joint Commission, rehospitalization has important monetary and accreditation consequences for hospitals and therefore for nurses. Were it not for Linda and my other nurse friends, for me, rehospitalization would have been likely. I remember when I was an undergraduate student, a nursing instructor asked us to write a paper about what the future of nursing could look like, from any perspective we wanted, anything was fair game. I wrote my paper on the notion of the “neighborhood nurse.” I argued that if every neighborhood had a professional nurse, in the private practice of nursing (not necessarily an NP), operating at the top of the practice act in her state, she could conceptualize her neighborhood as her “patient.” She would live in the neighborhood and know the health problems of her neighborhood overall but, more importantly, know what was going on with individuals within the neighborhood. If I had a neighborhood nurse, she would have known I'd just had a difficult surgery and could check in with me—as a neighbor and as a nurse. Visiting nurses, community health nurses, and home health aides just would not be the same as “our” neighborhood nurse. I am sure my idea may now seem naive. But I'm reminded of the great nursing instructor who gave me an assignment that has stuck with me all these years. My hope is that this special issue of Advances in Nursing Science will include new ideas and innovations that will address post–hospital nursing. As my story suggests, a reconceptualization of post–hospital nursing is essential for patients and for the future of nursing itself. —M. Katherine Maeve, PhD, RN Guest Editor",

    "abstract": "EDITORIAL STANDARDS OF QUALITY: EXAMINING PATTERNS OF HEALTH IN SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING The emergence of online and “open access” publishing has created massive changes in the publishing industry, some of which are yet to be fully realized. Since the invention of the printing press and until the advent of online options, publishing remained a fairly stable industry and scholarly publishing developed patterns of institutional “behavior” that came to be relied upon to assure that what is published is valid, accurate, reliable, and worthy of the public trust. The emergence of the open-access business model that shifts the cost of publishing from subscribers who pay to read journal content, to authors who pay an Article Processing Charge to open their work to the public, began with the worthy intention of making scientific findings freely available to all scientists who have an interest in building on the work of other scholars, and to the public that might benefit from the work produced by scientists. Indeed, this intent remains one of the defining commitments that has sustained the growth of credible and legitimate open access publishing. However, the opportunity for profit that is created in a model where an author pays a fee to support the publication of their work has proven to be irresistible to individuals with shady intentions, resulting in the phenomenon we now know as “predatory publishing.” Predatory publishers prey on unsuspecting authors who are eager to have their work published, luring them with the opportunity to pay to publish—an opportunity that is often “sweetened” with promises of rapid review, discounts for future publications, and other enticements. Typically these publishers post information on their Web sites that do not stand the test of scrutiny or collaboration (such as fake Impact Factor scores) and unreliable information about the individuals who are represented as being involved as Editors or reviewers. So, it is important for all nurses who are involved in work that relies on what is published in nursing's scholarly journals—whether online, open access, or traditional paper subscription journals—to understand the patterns that constitute standards of integrity in publishing. In a nutshell, the key principles to look for include the following: Practices that protect against commercial and personal influence on editorial content, including peer review, and author statements related to any conflict of interest Evidence that all persons involved in selection and production of editorial content are fully qualified and adhere to Committee on Publication Ethics Codes of Conduct Transparent processes that assure that all editorial content has been adequately vetted by experts in the field. Assurance that all editorial content is permanent and that it is and will remain discoverable for the foreseeable future. At the outset in 1978, Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) established patterns and practices that assure editorial integrity for the journal, and these standards have remained in place throughout all the production and formatting changes that have occurred. Our editorial practices are fully described in our “Information for Authors” page at http://edmgr.ovid.com/ans/accounts/ifauth.htm. These guidelines now include detailed description of the ANS hybrid model that retains the journal as a subscription journal, but it also provides an option for authors, after their manuscripts are accepted for publication, to pay an Article Processing Charge to retain copyright of their article, and to make their article open to the public. The International Academy of Nursing Editors (INANE) has provided information to help guide nursing editors, scholars, readers, and students in understanding the new challenges involved in publishing. The INANE collaborative statement that provides a foundation for understanding the distinction between sound open access publishing and predatory practices is available in the September 2014 “Nurse Author and Editor” newsletter (http://www.nurseauthoreditor.com/article.asp?id=261). There is also more information about the meaning of “open access” on the ANS blog at http://ansjournalblog.com/2014/11/26/open-access-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not/.

    "abstract": "RESPONSE The authors of “Barriers to Innovation: Nurses' Risk Appraisal in Using a New Ethics Screening and Early Intervention Tool” are grateful to Celia Bridges, BA, BSN, RN, for her scholarly and eloquent analysis of our study on the feasibility of using an ethics screening tool to identify patient situations with an increased likelihood of ethical conflicts.1 We certainly agree with Ms Bridges' major assertion that both system thinking and system change are required to enhance the moral landscape of practice settings. Agreement on that core idea leads us to question how to transform systems of care so that nurses and other providers along with patients and families can interact in meaningful and constructive ways when considering not only the science but also any ethical concerns. On the basis of our ethnographic research, we found that these conversations are often avoided and even when they do occur, nursing perspectives are sometimes not voiced or, when voiced, are frequently disregarded.2,3 Even shared decision making, often viewed as the current standard in ethics, is a model designed to be between physicians and patients.4 Our underlying assumption is that nurses have valuable insights into treatment benefits as well as burdens and therefore should be seen as a resource for patients, families, and other providers during these conversations. However the question remains—how do we create systems that avoid “moral muteness”5(p188) in favor of promoting ethical mindfulness? Emanuel claimed that ethics is intricately woven into the “webs of interactions” that occur in the structure of care.6(p151) This seems to suggest that relationships are key to our moral commitments to patients and families. With that in mind, we need to consider how to build relational capacity and communication skills across disciplinary, cultural, sociopolitical, and moral difference. From our point of view, the foundational dynamic that underlies any relationship is the reflective and ethical mindfulness of individuals who are nested within interdependent ecosystems. The implication is that systems change when individuals inside those systems change just as much as individuals change when systems surrounding them change. We acknowledge the important insights that Ms Bridges provides when stating, “...it may be more productive to conceptualize the escalation of ethical dilemmas as reflective of a faulty or dysfunctional system, rather than of a lack of agency on the part of individuals within the system.” However, building on this idea, perhaps we need to replace “rather than” with the word “including” so that we acknowledge that systems transform not only from the bottom-up and the top-down but also from the many middles in all directions. This idea is described by Anderson7 in a forthcoming anthology on emancipatory nursing as the tension between “individual agency” and “structural constraint.” Anderson claims that seeing these as separate rather than related concepts often impedes nurses' work toward equitable relationships and social justice. Perhaps, when we as nurses begin to see ourselves as an important part of the systems that actually create the structural constraints, we might develop new insights on how to transform the systems in which we work and actually become “full partners with ... other healthcare professionals in redesigning health care in the United States.”8(p4) This notion will not “spare nurses from the requirement that they commit to actions perceived as personally or professionally risky.” Rather, we will be thrown into the thick of change with all its uncertainties and murkiness—and yes, risk. However, it may become what Ms Bridges calls for—the “inversion of the status quo [that] change[s] the expectations of the individuals within the system”—all individuals within the system. But only if bold nurses move beyond “moral muteness” to create a chorus that challenges system constraints that give rise to the risk of speaking up. Only then will health care organizations transform from structural hierarchies to holarchies where entities (holons) are simultaneously viewed individually and as part of a system larger than itself.9 We believe Ms Bridges' ideas blended with our own provide helpful insights about ethical responsibilities—the most basic of which is for all system components to create systems with moral space where open, inclusive dialogue and constructive conversation on ethical aspects of care is expected and welcome. Many hold the keys to this change: nursing and physician leadership, ethics consultants, administrators—and perhaps even The Joint Commission needs to expand stipulations beyond simply requiring health care organizations to “provide an ethics process.” Yet, ultimately, the individual, the one most directly involved, who witnesses the concern or the violation, is left with the responsibility to do something. This has been true all throughout history; it comes down to the one person giving voice. So, often it is the least powerful or most vulnerable who lifts his or her voice, often at great risk, and ultimately changes everything. Respectfully, —Carol L.

    "abstract": "There have been volumes written about human relationships over the years, and many more could be written! The close connection that exists between relationships and health is not always acknowledged explicitly, but that connection is always there in one form or another. People seek and hope for relationships that provide a host of benefits related to health in a wholistic sense—happiness, comfort, self-affirmation, love, nurturing, and safety. Communities and groups establish all sorts of formal, informal, professional, and lay organizations and structures that provide human interaction and relationship. Given the universal interest and investment in human relationships, and given the nature of nursing itself as a relational discipline, it is only fitting that nurse scholars make the matter of relationships and health a focus of their inquiry. Yet, as Gweneth Hartric-Doane points out in her Guest Editorial for this issue, nursing's theoretical and philosophic frameworks, most of which have arisen from western or westernized regions of the world, have sustained a primary concern with the health of individuals as a central concern, consistent with a larger Western neoliberal, individualistic perspective. The logical reasoning of much of our understandings of health leads down a path that focuses on individuals, with an underlying assumption that in the end, individuals alone are responsible for their health and well-being. However, nursing's philosophic foundation and commitment to wholism has prompted nurse scholars to acknowledge and even integrate relational concerns, and the focus of the discipline as caring in the human health experience1,2 has brought about an emphasis on the nature of the professional caring relationship in nursing. Given our disciplinary perspectives, it follows that nurse scholars would take seriously the matter of human relationships, and how these relationships can be shaped and formed in the human health experience to promote wellness not only for the individuals as individuals but also for the social units in which they relate. People in our world today need healthy families, however they are experienced or defined, healthy organizational structures in which to work, and healthy social contexts for rest, relaxation, and restoration. I believe that the articles in this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) provide interesting examples of what nurse scholars contribute to the knowledge that is required for creating and sustaining healthy relational contexts. In this issue, you will find several articles that provide a focus on family relationships and the challenges of family life, both traditional and nontraditional. All of the articles in this issue prompt examination of many assumptions about human relationships and challenge preconceived ideas about the experience of relationships—both personal and professional. I hope that you as a reader will not only find this issue interesting and thought-provoking but also join in discussion with these authors about their work.

    "abstract": "HEALTH EQUITIES It is always a good day for a journal editor when there is too much material for an issue of the journal! This is exactly what happened with this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS)! As a result, this issue contains “Health Equities: Part I.” “Health Equities: Part II” will appear in the next issue (37:4), along with articles that focus on the topic “Post–Hospital Nursing.” The volume of scholarly work that has emerged over the past several years addressing social justice issues is remarkable and affirms the conviction upon which many nurses historically have built their practice. In the contemporary context of growing and serious inequities worldwide, and the health consequences that follow, this movement on the part of nurses is especially significant. My colleagues, Paula Kagan and Marlaine Smith, and I have just completed the production of a text that is due to be published at about the same time as this issue, the title of which is Philosophies and Practices of Emancipatory Nursing: Social Justice as Praxis.1 In the Introduction, we presented elements of the concepts of “critical” and “emancipatory” that emerged from the works of the book's chapter authors. Taken together, these elements define the scope and nature of emancipatory nursing—a perspective that addresses the health outcomes of inequities. These elements are as follows: Challenging what is taken as “truth” or the “way things are.” Thinking and working “upstream,” addressing the root causes of health and social inequities. Examining and disrupting systems that advantage some and disadvantage others. Envisioning transformative actions that facilitate humanization, and putting these actions into motion. Bringing self-awareness and consciousness to one's work, focusing on one's own ability to engage in action for social change. Engaging communities to form actions and to develop knowledge that is grounded in the experiences and perspectives of those who suffer injustice. The authors in this issue, and those whose work will appear in “Health Equities Part II,” provide interesting, inspiring, and thought-provoking works directed toward emancipatory nursing. These articles, and other contemporary nurse scholars whose work addresses issues of social justice, provide depth and breadth to expand nursing's disciplinary perspective that engages social justice as central to our social mission. I invite you to follow our ANS blog (http://ansjournalblog.com), where each article in the current issue will be featured, along with a message from the authors who share background and insight about their work. Most important, you can comment, question, and engage with these ideas! We welcome your participation. —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "SHAPING THE FUTURE FROM A STRONG FOUNDATION This journal, Advances in Nursing Science (ANS), is approaching the 40th year of publication—a milestone that is significant for any scholarly publication. This milestone is particularly notable for a publication that began with a vision that challenged the dominant mainstream trend focusing on hard-core empirical science as the sole, or at least most important, path to establishing nursing as a bona fide professional discipline. From the beginning, ANS has published articles that not only questioned the dominance of empirical science but has also published material that offered philosophical and theoretical perspectives that reflect the value of all patterns of knowing. Traditional empirical methodologies have never been eschewed in the pages of the journal, but rather than taking empirical knowing and methods as the most important approach, many ANS authors have offered cutting-edge approaches to the development of nursing knowledge. These approaches draw on a wide range of scholarly methods that contribute to knowledge and understanding of the human health experience. This intrinsic quality of cutting-edge scholarship has remained a steadfast commitment for the journal, even as we recently began to move away from the long-standing tradition of topic-focused articles. About 2 years ago, we began to invite articles on any topic, which we have called “general topic” submissions. This felt, at the time, like a risky step, given the fact that the issue topics of the journal, in and of themselves, have reflected the intent to broaden the scope of nursing science to include all forms of knowing, and all factors that influence the evolution of a science. From the beginning, we have called forth scholarship on such topics as “The Politics of Care,” “Energy and Healing,” “Critique and Replication,” “Feminism and Nursing,” “Innovation in Health Care Delivery,” “Holistic Health,” and many more that prompted nurse scholars to bring their innovative ideas out of the shadows and into the light of day. Once we started inviting “general topic” articles, we very quickly found that the strength of the journal's foundation was well established. The great majority of articles submitted to the journal as “general topic” articles have reflected the journal's fundamental commitment to high standards of scholarship, cutting-edge thinking, and innovative approaches to knowledge development. For the past several issues of the journal, we have included several “general topic” articles—articles not focused on a specific issue topic, but that represent current and notable scholarship. This issue marks the first time that the journal shifts to content that is not focused on a predeter-mined single topic. It includes some topics that are difficult to address, such as violence against women, female genital cutting, workplace mistreatment, transgender health care, and globalization. This issue includes articles that describe and illustrate methodological approaches that are evolving beyond the margins of traditional science and approaches that embrace complexity and intersectionality. I have no doubt that even reading the Table of Contents alone will assure any reader that ANS retains a strong tradition of innovative thought. It is my hope that the titles of the articles in this issue will engage your interest to read a number of the articles. We welcome your responses to the content of this issue; each article will be featured on the ANS journal blog (https://ansjournalblog.com/) over the coming weeks, along with messages from the authors about their work. Most of all, we invite you to contribute your ideas by responding to our blog posts and, in so doing, participate in the ongoing journey that is the advancement of nursing science! —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "Translational scholarship, it seems to me, is a “natural” for nursing, given the long-standing history of literature that addresses connections between theory and practice. My own academic career began at the time that James Dickoff, Patricia James, and their colleagues published a series of articles that set in motion a line of thought that focused on the inevitable connections between scholarly work and the realities of practice.1–4 In the intervening years, even the prevailing message decrying the “gaps” between theory, research, and practice is an important symbol of nursing's abiding commitment that both knowledge and practice can only be meaningful and significant to the extent that each informs the other. As earnestly as nurse practitioners and scholars seek this ideal of knowledge and practice coming together as one, the fact remains that finding the key to a “unity” between knowledge and practice is elusive and fragile. The many attempts to build on the ideas that Dickoff and James wrote about many years ago have contributed to finding this key—including the growth in numbers of qualified nurse researcher/clinicians, the emphasis on evidence to inform practice, doctoral programs devoted to doctoral preparation of nurse clinicians, and the growing patterns that support interdisciplinary research and practice teams. This issue of Advances in Nursing Science includes 8 articles focused on a variety of approaches that fall into the conceptual field of translational scholarship. Gweneth Hartrick Doane, Sheryl Reimer-Kirkham, Elisabeth Antifeau, and Kelli Stajduhar, in their article, titled “(Re)theorizing Integrated Knowledge Translation: A Heuristic for Knowledge-As-Action,” express the general intent of their approach to translational scholarship, an intent that reflects common threads in nursing approaches: Having located our translational work in nursing within the larger field of knowledge translation (KT) in health care, we question the way in which existing models of KT are fundamentally conceived and also the background understandings that are governing KI activities. Being particularly concerned with representational KT models that privilege the development and dissemination of research knowledge, we describe how we have reconceptualized KT as a socially involved knowledge-as-action process. We also outline an inquiry heuristic developed through our KT research for the intent of supporting nurses to enlist the best available knowledge to address practice concerns and effectively navigate the complexities of health care milieus. (page 175) This issue also includes 2 “General Topic” articles, focusing on understanding the realm of nursing practice as embedded in specific health care milieus. Taken together, all of the articles in this issue continue the tradition of scholarship that contributes to, and has benefitted from, nursing practice in significant ways. —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "Recently, several of us had the opportunity to read and discuss the article, “Caring as Emancipatory Nursing Praxis: The Theory of Relational Caring Complexity,” by Ray and Turkel1 in the April-June 2014 issue of Advances in Nursing Science. We commend the authors for their moving discussion of the importance of social justice, human rights, and caring as an emancipatory nursing praxis (ENP) despite the sometimes dehumanizing impact of economics, technology, and bureaucratic systems. The authors suggest that when nurses practice from a principled, philosophical, ethical, and socially just perspective, they will realize the full potential of their “power” to positively affect patient care. We agree with the authors' hopeful and optimistic message and many of their recommendations that are solidly grounded in their theory of relational caring complexity. It is their position that through ENP, nurses can transform health care environments within complex organizations to create better outcomes for patients, employees, families, and themselves. We took issue, however, with examples of ENP suggested for hospital settings. Some of these included the creation of “caring-healing rooms” for patients with aromatherapy and music, implementing “code lavender” for nurses needing support from colleagues, and hosting “bake sales” to raise money for bus passes for family members. While well intentioned, these suggestions lack pragmatism and expediency in the face of heavy workloads and limited resources and fail to address the systems that undermine caring praxis. We question if nurses would find these overly simplistic strategies helpful or useful and if being tasked with additional caregiving responsibilities is in itself a socially just action. As doctoral students of nursing, we explored how best to broaden an understanding of the importance of ENP so that other nurses would participate in the movement. We offer the following suggestions: Coach currently practicing nurses in the process of appreciative inquiry where they examine fully what has worked in the past for the successful achievement of ENP by identifying moments they have experienced increased energy and reciprocal empowerment following interactions with patients.2 Nurses on the “front lines” will offer valuable insight into what is realistic and effective in a variety of health care environments. Inspire nurses to publish articles that describe instances of success in achieving ENP, as this will shed light on practices already in use. Offer hands-on support and venues to assist nurses with the writing process in the generation of these articles. This will lead to the development of new knowledge and hypotheses testing in future research. Encourage scholars and researchers to collaborate with nurses working in a variety of health care environments on research efforts focused on the study of ENP. Identify and challenge workplace and health care delivery policies that undermine the nursing professions' ability to achieve ENP and work to change these policies by developing and implementing efficacious strategies that facilitate and promote high-quality caring environments. We thank the authors for bringing an important theory and practice to our attention. This area certainly warrants ongoing research and further examination. We look forward to future opportunities to engage in dialogue necessary for the provision of ethically minded and socially just nursing care. —Tara Mariolis, MS, RN Raeann G.

    "abstract": "In the October/December 2013 issue of Advances in Nursing Science, the article “Barriers to Innovation: Nurses' Risk Appraisal in Using a New Ethics Screening and Early Intervention Tool”1 addresses the critically important yet thorny issue of ethics in health care. The authors are to be applauded for acknowledging the importance of this topic and for their broad-ranging discussion of the negative consequences of a work environment not fully supportive of nurses' voices in ethically ambiguous situations. These consequences can include compromised patient safety and quality of care, unnecessary suffering, unequal distribution of resources, and threats to the personal and professional well-being of nurses, to name but a few. A deep, effective understanding of such a complicated issue as ethics in health care requires an appropriate theoretical foundation—multilevel, multidimensional, and complex, with a strong focus on context. The authors underpin development of their ethical screening and early intervention tool with the model of the health care organization as ecosystem, and they highlight several elements of social ecology—normalization of values and power structures, interrelationships (not individuals) as central to system function, and the necessity of understanding how systems interrelate and interact to produce outcomes—as relevant to health care organizations. However, the choice of this theoretical foundation to guide development and testing of the ethical screening and early intervention tool seems incongruous on several counts, given that, in a framework of ecological analysis, system thinking is essential.2 First, even though the authors acknowledge that interrelationships, power structures, and borders between systems are key elements of the ecosystem, their approach suggests a focus on the individual rather than on the system in which these relationships, processes, intersections, and structures are embedded and have become normalized. From the ecosystem perspective, it seems reasonable that change in one element would create change—both anticipated and unanticipated—in another. However, it also seems likely that the system would constrain the ability of the individual to act, since the traditions and values—“how we do it here”—of an institution are often deeply embedded and normative. In fact, this is what the authors discovered: nurses knew what they should do but were “caught” in the system. The question that then arises is whether these constraints (eg, power imbalances, policy, the weight of the status quo) can truly be restructured in a sustainable way through the actions of individual nurses (or the sum of many of these actions) in the absence of system change. It seems unlikely, given that none of the 4 barriers to ethics-related action mentioned by the authors appears to be independent of an onerous ethical work environment. Next, viewing the nurse as the locus of ethical awareness and action may also obscure important dynamics of interrelationships and communities within institutions, which also have ethical lives and dispositions.3 If complex systems, such as those in health care, are separated into their component parts, our ability to understand them in a meaningful way becomes compromised.2 Furthermore, it is unclear why this nonpredictive ecosystem perspective would imply that a tool designed to foster ethical awareness and appropriate action would actually lead to action in the absence of an institutional culture of safety and support. In fact, the screening tool under discussion appeared to strengthen nurses' internal voices without affecting their external voices. Given this finding, might not such a tool further exacerbate nurses' moral distress by increasing the dissonance between internal and external voices? While I agree that the development of ethical awareness and action is beneficial both personally and professionally and should be encouraged and assisted, it may be more productive to conceptualize the escalation of ethical dilemmas as reflective of a faulty or dysfunctional system, rather than of a lack of agency on the part of individuals within the system. Perhaps then the landscape of the ecosystem could actually nurture nurses' sensitivity to emerging ethical issues, as well as empower them to act on what they already know. What if, for example, the system were structured so that, instead of action being required to initiate an early ethics (or palliative care) consult, effort would have to be expended to ensure that a consult not happen if anyone were to document certain findings? How might this inversion of the status quo change the expectations of the individuals within the system and spare nurses the requirement that they commit to actions perceived as personally and professionally risky? Obviously, there are no panaceas, but such system-focused changes might resolve part of the difficulty and remove some of the onus from an already-overburdened workforce. To conclude their article, the authors encourage the development of emancipatory knowledge as a way of improving ethical environments in health care. In this vein, using a system lens, we could ask: What is wrong with this picture of focusing on the skills and judgment of the individual? Who benefits from the continuing expectation that nurses shoulder this burden? What are the system barriers that, if lifted, would free nurses from this burden? And what system factors need to change in order for this to happen? As Pavlish et al pointed out, “Human behavior changes when structures surrounding them [humans] change.”4(p280) We owe it to ourselves to minimize individual burden and create change in the least distressing and most sustainable way possible.

We appreciate your thoughtful response in noting the relationship between our article and study findings, and the pioneering work of Hildegard Peplau and the advances she made in interpersonal relationships and knowing the patient. In response to the point about the information sheets, I believe there may have been a misinterpretation of our findings. We found that the paper-based information sheet was the most valuable, comprehensive, and tangible information source for nurses to know their patients. As a profession, we should be more attentive to these practices and identify ways in which we can continue to support nurses with tools that facilitate knowing the patient at a system or organizational level.

    "abstract": "As both a nurse and an information scientist, I was intrigued by the recent article “Information Needed to Support Knowing the Patient,” authored by Kelley et al1 in the October-December 2013 issue of Advances in Nursing Science on many levels. I applaud the authors and Advances in Nursing Science for writing and publishing, respectively, an article on the concept of “knowing-the-patient.” All too often, today we hear colloquiums (eg, treat ‘em and street ‘em) and see technology used (eg, texting used to end a relationship) in ways that do nothing but depersonalize human beings and human relations. From a theoretical standpoint, however, I was surprised by the noted omission of Hildegard Peplau and her work on Interpersonal Relations in Nursing.2–4 Her pioneering theory2–4 encompasses many of the elements of knowing the patient discussed by the authors,1 including understanding individual human response patterns and the development of the nurse-patient relationship.2–4 A second point related to Peplau is that she emphasized the importance of bedside nurses contributing to nursing theory,2–4 and this could be addressed through better management of the daily paper-based information sheets discussed by the authors.1 I am perplexed by the authors' general characterization of this information practice as negative.1 On the contrary, the authors found that the daily paper information sheets contributed to knowing the patient, thereby adding to safe, quality, patient-centered care.1 These sheets are individual-level decision aids that could help us explicate nursing actions and judgments, informing theory to define what it is nurses provide their patients. Yes, it is true, as the authors point out, that the information may vary from nurse to nurse1 but it is not uncommon for individuals to have their own information systems.5,6 Furthermore, the authors stated that the nurses in the study were already required to type the contents of this sheet into a Word document,1 thus they are already halfway through the process of storing the information for analysis. It is unfortunate that institutions do not implement policies that enhance this practice and capture it within their electronic medical record. This article has shown these sheets to be a valuable, useful, rich data source for nurses1 and therefore potentially for nursing science as a whole. Capturing this type of data, information, and knowledge in electronic systems is what will lead us to new wisdom in nursing—knowledge in action.7 Perhaps, these sheets could be scanned into the electronic medical record and the contents later analyzed by using optical character recognition technology and data mining. If the hospital asserts that these sheets are part of quality improvement projects, they would be deemed undiscoverable: a potential benefit and treasure trove of data with little to no threat for risk management. Peplau demonstrated the importance of the iterative cycle of theory and practice, promoting deep self-reflection on interactions with patients and then using these data to further inform theory.2–4 Peplau clearly stated that through our interactions with patients, nurses gain “invaluable data for advancement of the nursing profession.”4(p164) Fragments of these data may be captured in those daily notes and need further analysis. Ellis8 and Reed9 have more recently noted that too few nurses are contributing to nursing theory. As Ellis stated, “...if we really have a commitment to the future beyond the personal accumulation of wisdom from patient to patient, ....we must try to analyze our actions and formulate theories from them.”8(p1438) Conducting this type of information research with bedside nursing data could help us overcome this problem. There are several other recent articles that focus on the important topic of knowing-the-patient.10–12 In one such article, a nurse-scientist11 reviewed a business researcher's work that predicts skills in human-to-human contact will become increasingly valued.12 It is hoped that this collection of recent publications signals a trend in the right direction, elevating the crucial importance of the nurse-patient relationship. We must, however, acknowledge the source of this vital concept and its associated theory as Hildegard Peplau.2–4 Finally, I thank the authors for bringing to light the intersection of nursing and information science. “Nurses are resource persons who have the information ... patients ... need. Such information reduces the uncertainty and stress for the patient.”4(p165) This statement from Peplau's theory is complementary to theory-based principles in information science, regarding relationships between information, anxiety, and uncertainty.13,14 The 2 domains need much more explication and integration since nurses are indeed today's knowledge workers7—with the human touch.

I commend her for highlighting the important work of this skilled group of maternity nurses and their role in patient safety. It surprised me that Dr MacKinnon missed an opportunity to connect more broadly with the existing thread of safety literature examining the nurse's active role in creating and maintaining safe care. MacKinnon is correct that the safety literature too often misses nursing's contributions: two areas where this is particularly prominent are a focus on physicians as “front-line providers” and a focus on risk elimination that can obscure clinicians' central role in safe adaptation to evolving clinical circumstances. However, there are several publications taking a different approach: one that explicitly examines how nurses contribute to safety and what some of the barriers to optimal performance are in this context.

    "abstract": "INNOVATIONS IN HEALTH CARE There could be no more timely occasion for the appearance of this issue of Advances in Nursing Science. The United States is finally implementing a landmark health care law that moves in the direction of providing affordable and accessible health care for more citizens than ever before. Many other countries in the world already provide access to basic health care and community-based wellness services, and now the United States embarks on a historical initiative to shift in this direction as well. The US law calls for a more prominent emphasis on health-promotion and disease-prevention and community-based services, and nurses are called upon to be key providers in making these services available. The fact is that nurses have created innovative approaches to care for decades. In the early 1900s, Lillian Wald and her colleagues founded the “House on Henry Street” to provide a wide range of community-based services to immigrant families in need. In the middle of the last century, Lydia Hall established the Loeb Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, where she implemented her theory of nursing care with nursing at the center. In my own career, several schools of nursing where I taught established mobile and community nursing care clinics, staffed by faculty and students, to provide community-based wellness care and chronic illness management. Each of these attempts provided a demonstration of the possible and evidence that clearly supported the approach. But far too often, these initiatives fell by the wayside, lacking sustainable systems of support, politically and financially. Now, the time has come for nurses to come together as never before to revive some of the innovative models that existed in the past and to creatively forge ahead into uncharted territory. Many obstacles still exist, but there is a window of opportunity that exists in the context of massive changes happening in health care around the world. An excellent example is the Rutgers nursing schools in New Jersey, where faculty have created a model program that is designed to meet the needs of underserved urban communities in the Newark, New Jersey, area. (See video “Revolutionizaing Urban Health Care” at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jusxmtdqto.) Most of the projects of the past, and those of today, are projects focused on community care. This is timely in that there is wide recognition that community-based care is a key component of effective models of care. Years ago, Jo Ann Ashley often admonished nurses that we would need to leave hospitals in order to practice nursing. But hospitals remain, and nurses do remain in hospitals. Today, I believe that nurses can and must address the imperatives for change in every context where nurses practice. But unless nurses take drastic action to create innovative change in hospitals, Jo Ann's words remain all too relevant. We need strong models of care that are grounded in fundamental nursing values at the bedside, at the curbside, at the chairside—wherever people are who can benefit from the kind of care that nurses can and do provide. The time for innovation is here. The articles in this issue challenge all readers to consider possibilities and to take action to build on the work of these authors and the shoulders of the brilliant nurses of the past who have paved the way for innovation. —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "RE-FORM: INSIDE AND OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVES ON HEALTH CARE In late August 2011, just before this issue of Advances in Nursing Science went to production, Steve Jobs resigned from his post as chief executive officer of Apple. This event, even though anticipated for a while, created a flurry of tributes to Mr Jobs for the astounding accomplishments that he has overseen not only in the field of technology but also in the entire world of media and publishing. As one of those devoted “Apple” fans, I read many of these tributes and was impressed with some of the changes that Steve Jobs created that we now simply take for granted; many of which I had not realized carried a “Steve Jobs” imprint. What happened during the “Jobs” era, both in film (Pixar) and in digital technology (Apple) could be seen as a massive re-formation. Not only did he set in motion the development of the tools that made the changes possible, he charted a course for an entire shift in the way things are done. As a reader you may be wondering what this has to do with a professional journal like Advances in Nursing Science; you may even be one of the rare individuals who is actually reading this editorial in print form! In more likelihood, you are reading this on a computer or on a mobile device. It may not be an Apple product, but the fact that by far most people now access information like this editorial online can be attributed in part to the shift that started with iPod and iTunes (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA). When the product (iPod) and the process (iTunes) for getting stuff on it first appeared, many music fans were already using some form of mobile device to listen to music (MP3 players and even the old “Walkman” players). And a good number of those fans were downloading music, song by song, using illegal channels available on the web. Then along came a way to have lots of music of all genres, song by song, for a small 99-cent fee. As one of the articles on Jobs noted, many people wanted the convenience of mobile music, but did not want to “become mouse-enabled criminals taking the music we wanted.” So we jumped on the opportunity to pay a small fee to have exactly what we wanted to hear, when we wanted to hear it.1 The same kind of re-form in the world of print media is evolving, influenced in large part by the appearance of the iPad, and other tablet devices that have quickly followed. Those of us involved in the production and distribution of professional literature have realized, as these shifts have taken place in the world of popular media, that our world is beginning to shift in mammoth proportions. The biggest challenge, which the Steve Jobs story makes abundantly clear, is that of seeing the world through a different lens. Jobs was working and living in a world of computers, which, from inside the other world of music, magazine, and book production, seemed to have little to do with how people purchase and listen to music, or how people read books and magazines. Certainly, computers were essential to the process of production and distribution, but from that inside world, it was not so apparent how “computers” could play a role on the other end—the world of those who actually listen and read. Many ideas from both outside and inside the world of health care have been put forward as to how this endeavor of health care should and could be re-formed. Indeed, at the time of publication of this issue of Advances in Nursing Science, the United States and many other countries are experiencing a crisis in health care that is without precedent. I suspect that we have not yet encountered a “Steve Jobs” equivalent—a single force that comes along and quietly puts on the table a possibility that makes real re-formation possible. This does not need to come in the form of a single person with a vision. But it will need to embrace possibilities that somehow elude what most of us can imagine so far. I believe that nurses can contribute to the vision that is needed, and many have been working on promising possibilities for a long time. If you read further in this issue, you will find some of these possibilities. Let us all move beyond what is, and crack through the barriers that expand our vision! Once that happens, I believe true re-form is indeed possible! —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "PEACE AND HEALTH At the time this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) is going to press, the president of the United States has announced in a public speech his intention to begin to end the decades of war that have plagued the world community. There is no plan, but there is strong public support from people around the world who are weary and disgusted with never-ending conflicts, particularly those that could conceivably have been prevented or resolved in a much less destructive manner. But many still harbor a desire for dominance, and the complex issues surrounding many world conflicts seem utterly irresolvable. Furthermore, wars on a more local scale, even in local homes and neighborhoods, continue to rage on, creating damage, death, and destruction not only for those who engage in the fight but also for the many who innocently witness the conflict on the sidelines. Conflict of any kind carries with it serious health consequences, but most people feel helpless in the face of conflict that “hits home”—that we experience firsthand, much less regional or worldwide conflict. Although as nurses we are fully aware of the benefits of prevention, there are few, if any, curricula that teach nurses and other health care professionals how to prevent conflict. Nursing science has not yet taken up the matter of peace as a health benefit, nor have our educational programs begun to integrate knowledge of approaches to nurture the kind of wellness that might come from the prevention of conflict. In fact, nursing educational settings and nursing practice settings are all too often saturated with conflicts large and small that few people dare to address, much less challenge, and even less often attempt to resolve. It is in this context that we are publishing an issue focused on “Peace and Health.” For many, “peace” is still perceived as the absence of war, but as many nurses know firsthand, the mere absence of war is necessary but not nearly sufficient. If we are to achieve the goals of high-level wellness and health for all, understanding and creating peace are an absolute necessity. I believe that there is hope for each person to learn to create real peace* and, by doing so, begin to build a family-wide, community-wide, nationwide, and even worldwide possibility for peace. We need world leaders and local leaders who are courageous enough to work toward peace, but in the end, it is up to each person to also make this commitment. The articles in this issue of ANS stand as a signal that within the larger nursing community, this potential does exist. I hope that as a reader you will begin to join these authors, and many others in the nursing community, to build a science, and a practice, that focuses on peace! —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "PROMOTING SCHOLARLY DISCOURSE It has been a while since an article published in ANS has prompted substantive scholarly discourse in the form of letters to the editor. In this issue, you will find a substantial exchange between a reader and authors of an article published in ANS (33:3). The topic of that issue of ANS was “Emancipatory Scholarship,”and it was full to the brim with articles that exemplify the ideals of emancipatory perspectives. These ideals include challenging the status quo, examining dynamics that lie beneath the surface of what is readily obvious in day-to-day awareness, and calling for a shift in thought and practice that lead to social justice and equity. The letters that follow are substantive and deserve full consideration. I hope that you will consider the issues raised by this exchange and respond by continuing the discussion among your own circle of colleagues, and perhaps by engaging in your own scholarly work to further clarification, understanding, and knowledge related to the issues raised in this exchange.",

    "abstract": "BATTLEFIELDS WHERE WAR BEGINS “...lingering resentment, for example, grudges long held, resources clutched to rather than shared, help not offered. These are the acts of war that most threaten our homes and workplaces” 1 Chapter 17, location 2430 of 3571 As the contents of this issue of ANS affirm, nurses are all too familiar with war that begins at home. Our familiarity stems from many factors—the focus of nursing practice on the family, the hours devoted to spending time with people at the most important and intense moments in life, and the nature of interactions that tend to emerge in a nurse/person interaction. It is therefore appropriate that nurse scholars turn significant attention to the problems of violence and trauma in everyday experience, as the scholars of the articles in this issue of ANS have. The groundbreaking work of early nurse scholars in this area, such as Ann Wolbert Burgess (who formulated the concept of rape-trauma syndrome in the 1970s) and Jacqueline Campbell (who developed a widely-used danger assessment tool for women victims of domestic violence) paved the way for nurses to continue to bring new insights and knowledge related to the health hazards of violence. Their groundbreaking work, and the work of many other nurses who have followed, have formed a cornerstone for knowledge of trauma and violence for all disciplines. Interpersonal violence in the nursing workplace has, for as long as I can recall, formed a major topic in nurses' “water cooler” talk. The worn-out phrases “nurses are their own worst enemies,” and “nurses eat their young” still crop up all too often in my conversations with other nurses. The persistence of these messages can be attributed to the sad realities of nurses' experiences, but these messages can be challenged with a call to recognize the significant, and growing, efforts to refocus attention not only the realities of nurses' support for one another, but also growing initiatives to change the workplace culture in a direction of peace and harmony. Addressing issues of violence and trauma in the workplace requires what a friend of mine calls “courageous conversations.” These are conversations that openly acknowledge the subtle acts of workplace warfare; they are key to interrupting workplace violence. But beyond such acknowledgement, if nurses desire to turn this around, it is imperative to learn and practice acts of peace. It is widely recognized that domestic and workplace violence form the foundation upon which international conflict is built.2 If we find ways to shift these damaging local interactions, then we build a reservoir for establishing a longed-for world-wide peace. The articles in this issue of ANS address the approaches that nurses are using and investigating as ways to turn away from violence toward acts of peace, and to heal the harms wrought by violence. The works of these scholars make significant contributions to knowledge of healing in the face of violence. Their insights bear major implications for how nurses can address issues of workplace violence. I believe that it is incumbent upon all nurses to move these conversations beyond the realm of the water cooler and into the nurses' stations, conference rooms, and research centers where we can expand our knowledge and understanding of our own workplace violence, and move with more determination toward peace and harmony! —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "IDEOLOGY, NURSING ONTOLOGY, AND ETHICS AS POLITICS: A RESPONSE TO DR SPERAW To the Editor: We wish we could say that we are surprised by Dr Speraw's letter; however, it is not the case. Dr Speraw's letter does not address the actual content of our paper but focuses exclusively on our reference to the Homeland Security Nursing (HSN) programme, which she coordinates. She does not discuss the ontological and epistemological issues that we identify in her paper on a theory of homeland security. Although she does describe topics taught in the HSN programme and the research conducted within it, she does not refer to the partnerships established with military personnel and agencies in order to carry out some of these activities. Curiously, her letter focuses exclusively on disaster preparedness but silences entirely the overarching premise of the need for homeland security as the guiding philosophy of the programme. The tone of her letter and the accusations against the political and ethical dimensions of our article confirm that the title was chosen wisely. The objective of our paper1 was to discuss the various ways in which military speech and ideology can make its way into nursing idiom and education. We believe we have done this successfully by raising the ontological, epistemological, and ethical concerns that result from this process. Neither we are sure which portion of our paper constitutes a personal attack on Dr Speraw, nor can we identify volatile or incendiary language in our argument. The issue we raise may be contentious and we do not expect consensus around this issue. This, however, should not serve as an argument to avoid or dismiss the issue altogether. At the risk of offending Dr Speraw, other than citing the article Dr Speraw cowrote with her colleague, our paper is not about her or the HSN programme. The programme is used as one example of many techniques and strategies through and by which military agencies have made their way into civilian spheres, including the universities and their research traditions. As shown in our paper, this trend has been observed in most academic disciplines and we highlight the fact that nursing constitutes a fertile space for such an incursion. There is no need for personal attacks when one engages in a philosophical debate about current trends in nursing, whether these trends concern the evidence-based movement, the postmodern turn in nursing, practice development, or the influence of pharmaceutical industries. All the tools needed to engage in such debates are readily available to those who pursue a philosophical analysis. Philosophy allows us to take a step back and reflect on what it is that we do as nurses and to what purpose. Importantly, it also teaches us the various ways in which ideology operates and creates effects in everyday life. Certainly, nurses, wherever and by whomever, will continue to be trained as “nurses”. But one can legitimately wonder what kind of nurse is being educated and for what purpose. What is meant by “nurse”? The ontological answer we seek here goes beyond the usual rhetoric of “responding to today's needs”. This statement has become quite empty on the simple basis that different interests and agendas spawn different needs, and a consensus around what might constitute “today's needs” is difficult to come by. Nurses trained in a programme that is explicitly geared toward the preservation of national security will respond to a specific set of interests that powerfully dictate “today's needs.”Although the ideology of terrorism is a matter of focus in the HSN programme, we respectfully doubt that the very concept of “homeland security”,which in many respects has functioned as a powerful (totalitarist) ideology since September 112 – 4 is awarded the same critical examination. Other than the matter of finances, which certainly restrict one's disposition to question certain things (the University of Tennessee received significant funding from the Department of Homeland Security to develop its homeland security programmes and research centers5–7) one must account for the very way ideologies function. Arendt8(p469) defines ideologies as such: An ideology is quite literally what its name indicates: it is the logic of an idea. (…) Ideologies pretend to know the mysteries of the whole historical process—the secrets of the past, the intricacies of the present, the uncertainties of the future-because of the logic inherent in their respective ideas. Ideologies operate through a narrow mental framework that makes possible a shared (re)interpretation of particular events. They do not “have the truth as [their] purpose but [aim] at the fulfillment of the idea.”9(p124). They function because they carry their own powerful internal logic, often backed up by moral discourses. Their logic operates to create conformity (of thought and conduct) as well as lack of questioning. Ideologies work because they deploy through (usually well-intended) agents who do not realize that they are a part of them. In producing consensus and homogeneous thought, they also exclude other ways of thinking, doing and being. Ideologies breed intolerance for differing opinions, all the while appearing neutral, apolitical, and benevolent. Ideologies supplant reflection and opinion8; they position themselves above reason-and critique. Since September 11, 2001, in the name of “homeland security”or the “War on Terror,” there has been a massive surrendering of reasoning and decision making to the forces in power (largely military) which, by situating matters of national security above all else2,4 have achieved massive restructuring of civilian (including professional) structures, institutions, and responsibilities.3,4 This (self-)abdication is key to the success of ideology,8 whereby personal agencies are blurred and individual aspirations dissipate into one communal, self-confirmed, conviction, leading to a collective experience largely typified by fear and suspicion and the cultivation of “warfare personality.”9(p126) Dr Speraw adamantly insists that the HSN programme was not overtaken by the military and that it trains nurses in disaster preparedness. Unfortunately, this argument misses the mark because in today's post 9/11 context, disaster planning and management neither can be spoken about outside of the military idiom, nor can disaster-prepared nurses practice outside of militarized contexts of care, as though military matters do not concern them. Disaster (natural or man-made) enjoys a strong (constructed) interreliance with issues of national security, an ideological space where the military holds a dominant position. Homeland security and disaster management speech are powerful because they are laden with assumptions about civilian responsibility and duty, portrayed as patriotic, natural, and hence can be used unproblematically. As stated in our paper, we are not suggesting that nurses should not intervene when and where disaster strikes. Instead, we are highlighting the way powerful (ideological) discourses shape nursing work but also the way they further perpetuate themselves by and through nursing work. Nurses can become effective mediators of particular ideologies because of their privileged relationship with populations, but also because their work is typically viewed as benevolent and grounded in commonly held moral obligations. The multiplication of education and research endeavors (including, but not limited to, the HSN programme) further legitimizes militarized ideological discourses making them that much more difficult to challenge. Despite their stellar track record of “doing good,” nurses are not exempt from the risk of perpetrating acts that are not in accordance with nursing philosophy, even though their intentions are honest (see for instance nurses' involvement in capital punishment).10 In our paper, we provide several scenarios regarding the way this may occur. What we highlight is that nurses are ideally positioned to carry out actions that are not of their doing and that fulfil an agenda that is not theirs, whether they may (inadvertently or not) promote a particular policy, product or procedure, or follow questionable policies about restraints, confinement, or access to personal health information. We assert this political discussion, although difficult for many, is highly ethical and it falls within the scope of nursing academic work—toward an “ethics of discomfort,”11(p121) we might say.",

    "abstract": "CRITIQUE AND REPLICATION This issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) continues a long-standing tradition of publishing manuscripts that build on previously published articles in ANS. When I founded ANS in 1978, I made a commitment, along with the members of the journal's advisory board, to seek scholarly work that breaks new ground, offering new and challenging ideas and possibilities for the discipline of nursing. At the same time, we recognized that a single article representing a particular development in nursing scholarship could not stand alone, nor was any particular work static in the real world of practice. So we established the tradition of calling for articles that look back, that reassess, and that bring forward the evolution that occurs once ideas are subjected to the test of time. This duty to revisit completed work is well established in the realm of empirical science. It is widely accepted that the findings of a single research study must be replicated and tested again and again in different contexts to achieve widespread acceptance, to be considered reliable and valid. In other realms of knowledge development, the same principle applies, only the methods for establishing lasting value shift. Fundamental ethical norms are a good example, where empirical evidence has some bearing on the processes required to establish strong and lasting ethical knowledge, but philosophic methods of logic dominate the process. Reflection and refinement over time, along with experiential evidence, lead to refined insights and reasoning that strengthen, refine, or challenge what had been previously established as knowledge. The articles in this issue of ANS illustrate a wide range of scholarly methods used to further the development of prior work published in ANS. Regardless of the particular methods used, the articles in this issue exemplify the role of reasoning and critical reflection that is at the heart of any process aimed at refining and advancing ideas. These processes are not the easiest to employ, and there are no “how-to” manuals—they require creativity as well as discipline. They are based on well-established rules of logic, along with integration of new insights arising from contemporary norms and circumstances. Most important, this process of critique and replication, as well as of reflection, revision and refinement, does not stop with the publication of these articles. Knowledge in a discipline advances in the context of a community of scholars. You, as the reader, are vital to this community. You can contribute to the ongoing development of the ideas presented in any of these articles in more ways than ever! As always, you can contribute a “letter to the editor” with your ideas and responses. But now we have a more dynamic avenue using the ANS Blog (http://ansjournalblog.com). Each of the articles in this issue will be featured on the blog and will include messages from the authors giving some background about their work, and on the blog you can participate in a conversation with the authors and other readers in an asynchronous discussion, critique, and challenge of these ideas. We encourage you to comment on the blog—share your ideas, your critiques, and stories related to the work of these authors! This interaction is at the heart of the very best critique that advances our discipline—so join the conversation today! —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "It was with interest that I read the 2 recent articles on workplace bullying, in ANS: “Workplace Bullying Experienced by Massachusetts Registered Nurses and the Relationship to Intention to Leave the Organization” by Simons1 and “A New Model of Bullying in the Nursing Workplace: Organizational Characteristics as Critical Antecedents” by Hutchinson et al.2 Of particular note was the juxtaposition of viewpoints on the cause of workplace bullying presented in the articles. Simons1 mainly focused on the theory that nurses are an oppressed group and are therefore more prone to bully each other, whereas Hutchinson et al2 emphasized that organizational characteristics are the primary antecedents for workplace bullying. Although both views contain some element of truth, it seems that nurses need to move beyond viewing oppression as the main cause for workplace bullying, because this explanation does not lead to any easy solutions to the problem. As Hutchinson et al2 point out, raising awareness of the problem and creating zero-tolerance policies will not work if there are informal organizational alliances that work to undermine such interventions. Lending credence to the view that organizational factors are key to understanding workplace bullying are the facts that workplace bullying is a phenomenon that occurs in other occupations as well and that bullying behavior also occurs in top-level management positions.3 In order to determine the extent to which oppression contributes to bullying among nurses, it would be useful to compare bullying rates from studies in other occupations with bullying rates among nurses. Such comparisons are difficult given the current state of knowledge, because few studies in the United States have used the same measure of bullying. However, one study that looked at bullying among workers from diverse occupations across the United States, including education, finance, public administration, agriculture, and service, found that 28% of respondents had been bullied at work.4 This study used the same instrument as the Simons study, which reported a similar rate of 31%.1 More research is clearly needed to understand the complex reasons behind workplace bullying. Both of these authors are to be commended for their contributions to this discussion. This is a timely issue for nursing, and the discussion in this area needs to be based on science, not just opinion. Susan L.

    "abstract": "TRANSITIONS: A CORE NURSING CONCEPT Afaf I. Meleis, who has been an active member of the Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) Advisory Board for many years, is the originator of theoretical work that focuses on the concept of transitions.1 In one of our many discussions over the years, she made a very simple statement that has remained in my consciousness as a fundamental insight: everything is transitions! Indeed, I believe that the concept of transitions, along with the central concept of caring, forms a core around which the practice of nursing is constructed. These 2 concepts have not been formally linked in theory, but they are implicit in a number of theoretical models in nursing. For example, Benner and Wrubel,2 in their foundational work on caring, write about the fact that when someone is stressed, his or her temporal focus is reduced to the immediacy of the moment—the here and now. The nurse, as a caregiver, ushers the person from the immediate moment to the next moment—the nurse steps in to provide the image of what can be in the next moment (taking a few steps down the hall), assisting the person to move into that reality of the next moment. The thing about transitions, even in the absence of the stress of illness, is that many “transition processes” are very difficult to perceive because we are in the midst of the shift. Two examples illustrate this dilemma. When one is riding in an airplane at very high speeds, unless you have a visual point of reference outside of the plane (clouds or approaching runway) or hit an atmospheric condition that creates turbulence, it seems as if you are not moving at all and certainly not at the very high speed of several hundred miles an hour. This is a matter of physical sensation, or proprioception, that tricks our perceptive capacity so that we can settle in to enjoying the ride (more or less!). Another example involves a broader environment-time-space perception—the experience of parenting. As a very indulgent grandmother, I can perceive the transitions that my granddaughters are experiencing in ways I never could perceive when I was the mother of my son. Parenting tends to be a very “present” experience: the challenges that your child presents today is pretty much all-consuming—it is what is. Even when I “knew” that a certain phase of development would pass with time and a different challenge would emerge, the all-consuming process of dealing with the present challenges of my child today took front and center stage, almost obliterating any other perception. As a grandmother, not only do I have a greater appreciation for the reality of my grandchildren today but, at the same time, I also hold close the fond memories of their earlier months and years and anticipate with gladness the older children that they are about to become. Indeed, transitions are integral to human experience. But when life brings unexpected changes such as illness, or welcome changes with unexpected consequences such as parenting, nurses can and do play a major role in shaping the next moments in ways that lead to health and well-being The authors of the articles in this issue of ANS have provided examples of nursing scholarship that contribute to a broader and deeper understanding of this phenomenon. I hope you will be inspired to further the discussion around the issues raised! If so, go to our ANS blog at http://ansjournalblog.com/ and share your thoughts.

    "abstract": "SOCIAL JUSTICE AND HEALTHCARE If there is any doubt that social justice is a nursing concern, this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) provides ample evidence to support this position. Thanks to the ability to publish online—only articles in ANS, we were able to include 14 articles, all of which received peer reviews supporting their publication in ANS. This kind of response to our call for articles for this issue of ANS attests to the fact that social justice is not an isolated concern of just a small cohort of politically interested nurses. It is a fundamental concern for our discipline. Consistent with the overall purposes of ANS, these articles provide stimulating ideas—perspectives that challenge the status quo of social injustices that affect the health and well—being of people worldwide. ANS remains a leading publication in nursing, maintaining traditions of challenging and cutting—edge, high—quality scholarship. The journal's “brand”—the unique cover design—and our tradition of quality have remained constant for over 30 years. But many aspects of publishing have changed over these 30 years, and ANS has kept pace and led the way. In 2005, our submissions and peer review process shifted to the Web—based Editorial Manager system. In 2008, we began publishing selected articles ahead of print—the “Publish Ahead of Print (PAP)” feature on the journal's home page at http://www.advancesinnursingscience.com/. If you are an individual subscriber to ANS, you have access online to all articles— all—published since 1978! Now, whether you are a subscriber or not, you can customize the http://www.advancesinnursingscience.com site to make it your own “ANS home page.” Here are a few of things you can do: save searches of articles in ANS, create personal article collections, set up e-mail and RSS alerts, export references into your favorite citation manager, and export figures from full-text articles into PowerPoint. The site now shows featured articles, such as “most viewed” and “most e-mailed.” It will feature regular messages from the editor and information about new features coming from the publisher. Many other new features will be added to the site over the coming months to enhance the journal readability, accessibility, usability, and impact. I hope that you will visit http://www.advancesinnursingscience.com soon and return often. See for yourself the many ways that ANS provides a valuable service to you, the reader, to the nursing profession, and to all healthcare professionals interested in cutting-edge scholarship! L.

    "abstract": "In my editorial for ANS (26:4), late in 2003, I addressed the challenges that nurses face if we are to be major contributors to the health of populations worldwide in the age of the World Wide Web. In this issue of ANS, we turn to the broader concepts of informatics and technology, and I want to return to one of the issues that I addressed in that 2003 editorial-–the shift in literacy demands for the present and future. An electronic literacy generation gap is widely recognized between nurses recently entering the field and many of their educators and clinical mentors. Nurses in the academic world perceive this gap in dramatic ways, decrying the inability of young students to read, write, and spell in print-based media-–to engage in all the skills that many in the older generation see as the skills of those who are literate. At the same time, we still encounter some students, and some colleagues, who resist using the computer, even e-mail, and who discount any information that might be obtained on the Internet. Seasoned practicing nurses tend not to experience quite as stark a generational gap, primarily because they have not been able to retain their employment unless they learn and use a variety of Web-based tools and internal information systems. Regardless of our electronic literacy level, older generation nurses are only beginning to realize that our preconceived, print-based notions of literacy are being transformed and will be replaced by expectations, standards, and skills that we are gradually beginning to acquire and appreciate. Spender,1 who believes that the over-40 generations are probably the last of those to be solely print-proficient, observed in 1995: “What we have to see is that we are the only generation which will know both mediums, the print and the electronic. We are the ones who will be able to make comparison, who will be able to assess, evaluate and transfer our experience, expertise-–and wisdom—form the old forms to the new.”2(pxvi)[AQ1] Rather than view this divide as a “gap” and a tension, I would call on all of us to come to our tasks with an open mind that draws on the insights and skills of those who have advanced print literacy, as well as those whose skills now approach an advanced level of electronic literacy. Our mutual challenge is to transfer the wisdom granted by the old forms of literacy to the new and retain as much of the richness, depth, and insight as we possibly can. Spender credits Florence Nightingale as one who declared that without the book, women would be in danger of dying of intellectual starvation.1(pxxi) Likewise I believe that nursing today will be in danger of dying if we do not fully embrace, use, and become proficient in the new information technologies. The authors of the articles that appear in this issue of ANS have made remarkable contributions to keeping nursing, and nurses, at the forefront of this new frontier in nursing and healthcare. I hope their work will inspire and challenge all of us to reach for yet another level of understanding and proficiency. —Peggy L. Chinn Editor",

    "abstract": "NURSING AND MIGRATION As with many of the issue topics that I plan with members of the Advances in Nursing Science ANS Advisory Board, we recognized the importance, even the urgency, of addressing the topic of migration. At the same time, we felt a bit uneasy about what might be “out there” that would meet the journal's standards of scholarship for such a topic. But as we have done so often, we agreed to put the topic on the list of forthcoming issues in order to call forth scholarship in the discipline that could make a significant contribution to our collective understanding and insight about worldwide migration, and how it affects, and is affected by, nursing. Our hopes for this issue were indeed affirmed! We received a modest, but important, number of submissions for this topic. Many of the manuscripts that are not published in this issue were judged to have significant potential for development, and ANS reviewers provided those authors with constructive guidance that hopefully will assist them in seeking publication for their important work in the future. The articles that are published here have all undergone significant revisions based on insights and recommendations of reviewers, yielding an issue that represents some of the most important scholarship in nursing from both substantive and methodologic perspectives, and providing a springboard for future scholarship in this area. The challenge with this topic for all of us as individuals, nurses, and scholars is to constantly and vigilantly struggle to overcome the parochial and hegemonic worldviews that saturate everyday discourses, thoughts, and actions, even when there is a conscious and deliberate effort to overcome these tendencies. I recently had a memorable conversation with a gentleman from Indonesia who has established a model assisted living group home into which my sister has moved. I jokingly asked him whether he had known Barack Obama when he was a child living in Indonesia. He grinned and said, “Oh, he is much older than I am!” Then he proceeded to talk at length about how important it is to have a world leader who has more than a limited experience in only one country. He stated: “The way I see the world is entirely different from the way you see the world, because I know from experience what it is like to not have freedom, to not be able to work, to fear that you can lose your family. I hope Mr. Obama remembers all of that.” My hope is that this issue of Advances in Nursing Science will not only contribute to the knowledge of our discipline in this important area of worldwide migration but also give all readers a glimpse into several of those other worlds. The content of this issue has the potential to move all who read these articles to a place that is more sensitive to the limits of our own limited perspectives in the world and that provides a greater appreciation for the real challenges of those who inhabit other kinds of worlds. — Peggy L.

    "abstract": "As this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS 21:2) goes to press, I am particularly aware of the many ways in which the global scope of this green planet seems to be shrinking. Almost daily I enter the realm of cyberspace to browse the World Wide Web, tapping into resources from every corner of the earth. For a good portion of each year I welcome to my home friends from countries far away, and meet new international friends at conferences and meetings. More frequently than I would have ever anticipated, I board an airplane bound for lands that I once thought of as distant and exotic, only to find that within a few short hours I stand on land that feels familiar, see the same moon in the sky at night, and find nurses who share vast common grounds of understanding. Our planet is home to an array of people, cultures, and governments, each with his or her own unique health challenges and issues. Those who are called nurses in each culture reflect important and distinguishable traits that are unique to their homelands. However, we share the common mission of caring for those who are sick and protecting the health of our neighbors. When we have the opportunity to come together, we find much that we can learn from one another. We also realize the many ways in which our nursing cultures span the boundaries of time and space. Like those in many other disciplines approaching the turn of the century, nurses worldwide are reaching out to bring together the perspectives of east and west, north and south, to expand our awareness of what is possible beyond the boundaries of our local communities. In a recent conversation with Margaret Newman, she reflected on the experience of having a colleague from Japan recognize ideas within Newman's theory as similar to traditional ideas from Japan. This common phenomenon reflects a global consciousness that we are now able to explore more fully, given the ease and access of global communication and travel. Our similar thoughts, ideas, and inspirations affirm nursing's perspective of oneness and wholeness. At the same time, the more deeply we explore our various contexts, languages, and the fullness of our conceptual meanings, we find an amazing array of rich meanings embedded within that which is also similar. In my view, a global perspective is essential for the health of our planet, our nations, regions, communities, families, and our selves. The place where we each sit, stand, and walk on the planet is both literally and figuratively a microcosm of the entire world around each of us. Each time we take an individual step to heal and protect our selves, our neighbors, our relationships with others, or our environments, we also contribute to global health and healing. The articles in this issue of ANS address global issues of health and healing and also perspectives on nursing practice that have both local and global implications. As your own thoughts and ideas arise in response to these articles, please write to share your ideas. After all, ANS is a global journal. Nurses all over the world will benefit from what you have to say and the ideas that you have to share. In this way, you can participate in a global dialogue that can enrich and expand each of our perspectives, bringing our awareness to a broader and fuller scope. Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "To the editor: I am writing in response to Dr Dzurec's article entitled \"Certainly, leaps of faith and tradition: Rethinking clinical interventions.\" Dr Dzurec uses a research study reported by myself and Dr Marguerite Kinney, 1 to support her points regarding paradigmatic assumptions and how clinical traditions may not always be the most appropriate means for making clinical intervention decisions. I was pleased that Dr Dzurec correctly analyzed the grounding of our study and that she accurately reported the conclusion \"the practice of utilizing the abdomen as the only or preferred site for subcutaneous heparin injections was not supported.\" 2 The tenacity of tradition, so aptly described by Dr Dzurec, should be questioned if nurses are to view their interventions within a scientifically based practice. What disturbs me, as a researcher, is that 8 years after the initial study regarding alternate sites for subcutaneous heparin injections, there have been no reports (to my knowledge) of research that has attempted to replicate these findings. Through replication with extension to correct the limitations, the study of alternative sites for the administration of subcutaneous heparin could bring valuable insight into a common clinical practice in nursing. The statements Kirchoff 3 made over a decade ago, regarding the heavy reliance on tradition and the lack of replication, validation, and dissemination of research into clinical practice seems to be continuing today. This \"state of the science\" leads me to several questions. How long will we as a discipline continue to practice and teach \"traditions\" as the way to intervene versus developing a research-based practice? Which traditions in nursing practice would be supported under careful and systematic scrutiny? Is there room in our science for replication and validation? Where are the funds to support replication studies and research utilization? Who will disseminate information on replication studies? Are we moving toward a solid scientific basis for our practice without replication and validation? Can we encourage research utilization based on single studies? Will tradition be the primary guiding force of the discipline in the next century or can we move the discipline to utilization of a scientific-based practice, thus creating new supportable traditions? I believe there is value in tradition and that science and tradition can co-exist in a practice discipline. Indeed, if traditional interventions have merit, scientific analysis will support the tradition. To assure our clients have the best possible care, we need to develop traditions based on empirical evidence. I believe we need a science that encourages replication, validation and research utilization. - Pamela Stewart Fahs, DSN Assistant Professor; Decker School of Nursing; Binghamton University; Binghamton, New York",

    "abstract": "I read with interest the article by Beeber et al1 about identifying the barriers and strategies that are used to engage and retain mothers in mental health interventions. As a pediatric emergency nurse, I am obligated to recognize parental issues that may affect a child's well-being. Unfortunately, the in-home intervention used in this study proved to be an ineffective therapy method. The authors identified the most difficult barrier as “the crushing lack of resources that placed the mother's mental healthcare behind more pressing essential family needs.” “We could not get the mother to see the work as essential to her health and well-being.” The women receiving the in-home intervention experienced numerous distractions and anxiety-enhancing situations and encounters. Depression is the primary mental illness diagnosed in America, with an estimated 25% of all women experiencing at least 1 event. Even though research supports a biological basis for mental illness, including depression, there is still a significant public stigma.2 I agree with McCrae3 in that “Individuals diagnosed with mental illnesses are shunned, less likely to be hired, and less likely to be accepted as neighbors.” Home visits may allow the nurse to observe firsthand the “contextual factors” that enrich our understanding of patients' situations. Yet Beeber et al1 concluded that the lack of privacy and the constant presence of children, significant others, relatives, and neighbors cause interruptions in the nurse-client therapy, thus making it difficult to establish a working relationship. Furthermore, the exposed client may no longer escape the “radars” of her family and neighbors. The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion4 identifies 10 risk factors for depression, 1 of which is sexual/physical abuse. The presence of the abuser in the home prevents the client from freely discussing her concerns due to fear of physical or emotional retaliation by the source. Also, from experience, a threatening environment can prove anxiety provoking to the nurse, causing a reduction in therapeutic interventions. For depression to become less stigmatized in society, changes in the perceptions of the general public must occur. Raingruber5 states an excellent point: “To help reduce stigma, widespread use of public service/education ads should be “designed to emphasize the treatable nature of depression and normalize it. I agree that it is necessary to modify the healthcare providers' attitudes toward depression. The Program of Assertive Community Treatment PACT, in existence since the late 1960s, seems to be a very successful program. PACT is a service-delivery model that provides comprehensive, locally based treatment to people with serious and persistent mental illnesses. Unlike other community-based programs, PACT is not a linkage or brokerage case-management program that connects individuals to mental health, housing, or rehabilitation agencies or services. PACT recipients receive the multidisciplinary, round-the-clock staffing of a psychiatric unit—within the comfort of their own home and community. To have the competencies and skills to meet a client's multiple treatment, rehabilitation, and support needs, PACT team members are trained in the areas of psychiatry, social work, nursing, substance abuse, and vocational rehabilitation. The PACT team provides these necessary services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.6 Despite the documented success of PACT, sadly it is only available statewide in 7 states, the District of Columbia, and a few other individual areas. I believe the results of this study will be valuable in discovering new ways to help determine the optimal mental health program modalities to engage and retain low-income mothers with depression in treatment programs.

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in the development of knowledge related to women's health, aging, and development, a major disconnect still remains. It amazes me that nurses, most of whom are women, have not yet played a major role in various scientific and political enterprises that could turn this persistent trend around. At the same time, given the immense cultural and social barriers that persist, it amazes me that nurses have accomplished all that they have over the past several decades. Given the fact that in the United States and other democratic countries around the world women are still sadly underrepresented in all levels of government and in all major leadership roles in the private sector, we can hardly expect that women's interests are adequately represented in science, philosophy, or the humanities A number of times over the past several months I have been approached by young scholars in nursing and other healthcare disciplines seeking feedback and advice concerning the direction they might take as they start their own program of research. Because of my particular interests and areas of expertise, many approach me wanting to pursue some aspect of women's health. Over and over again they tell me early in our conversation: “I have been told not to develop this idea because it is not fundable.” Their ideas are important, their hopes for being able to make a significant contribution to knowledge about women's health and development are worthy and well placed. But they are stopped in their tracks with this one sentence discouraging them from pursuing an area of research that arouses their deep interest and passion. I am left to ponder exactly what avenue to suggest, and even more important, exactly who is culpable in creating and sustaining this situation. Perhaps the faculties advising students such as these have a level of culpability in allowing the shortage of funding opportunities drive students' decisions. Perhaps even the students have a level of responsibility to frame their ideas and questions in ways that present a more compelling case, and one that connects with the priorities of funding agencies. Perhaps the representatives of funding agencies are culpable to the extent they serve their own interests, and not the fundamental interests of all people in society, including women. Perhaps we all are culpable in that we do not take whatever opportunities we can find to shape the priorities of the funding agencies. We are all indeed culpable to the extent that we ourselves succumb to internalized devaluing and discounting of the interests of women, particularly women who face multiple disadvantages day in and day out. Certainly the contents of this issue of Advances in Nursing Science demonstrate significant efforts to address the needs of women, and illustrate ways in which nurse scholars approach the study of health challenges that women face. I hope that these articles will stimulate you, the reader, to think seriously about the many gaps that persist in knowledge about women and women's health, and ways that you might begin to bring about real shifts in the values that drive our knowledge development enterprise in nursing.

    "abstract": "We are proud to release this issue of ANS as a participating journal for the global theme “Poverty and Human Development” organized by the Council of Science Editors. At the time of release of this issue of ANS for publication, 230 journals from around the world, representing a wide range of disciplines, are participating in this initiative to simultaneously publish articles to raise awareness and stimulate interest and research related to poverty and human development. All participating journals are releasing their themed issue on or after October 22, 2007. For information about this initiative and to see the list of all participating journals, go to http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/globalthemeissue.cfm. All editors of participating journals were invited to nominate one article to be presented at an event to recognize and publicize the release of this global theme issue. The event, scheduled for October 22, 2007 on the NIH campus, is cosponsored by the Fogarty International Center and the National Library of Medicine of the US National Institutes of Health. I was honored to nominate for this recognition the lead article for this issue: “Applying a feminist approach to health and human rights research in Malawi: A study of violence in the lives of female domestic workers” by Lucy Mkandawire-Valhmu, PhD, RN, and Patricia E. Stevens, PhD, RN, FAAN. Consistent with the criteria to qualify for this nomination, Mkandawire-Valhmu and Stevens' article reports new and innovative, high-quality research, data collected within the last 5 years, and a clear and major influence on practice and policy. All of the articles in this issue of ANS address important issues of poverty, human rights, and human development worldwide and contribute to developing knowledge that is needed within the discipline of nursing to address these issues. Furthermore, the authors published in this issue of ANS are from many different geographic locations around the world and speak from the perspectives that come from within cultures that are seriously underrepresented in scholarly discourse. The publication of work that comes from these diverse perspectives is itself a major contribution toward addressing issues of health, human rights, and the serious problems that sustain inequities in health and healthcare worldwide. It is my hope that this issue of ANS becomes recognized for the contributions it makes to the global theme initiative of the Council of Science Editors. I also hope that this issue will be recognized as a milestone in bringing increased visibility for the diverse perspectives from around the world that are needed in our discipline. Indeed, these authors have brought forward insights and perspectives from around the world that raise awareness and provide new possibilities for bringing together knowledge and action to make a difference worldwide.

    "abstract": "Recently I had an occasion to interact with a number of physicians, some of whom are midcareer and others within the first 10 years of specialty medical practice. None of these individuals initially had any familiarity with my background or career in nursing. They were actively seeking the involvement of nurses, and in reading my curriculum vitae and interviewing me, they determined that I met the criteria for participating in the work group I was invited to join. This is a group of dedicated, progressive, and concerned healthcare professionals who sincerely intend to improve healthcare, and I joined the group with high hopes for our work together as a multidisciplinary group. Needless to say, this experience has had many ups and downs. As an example, it became increasingly clear that even though the physicians in the group work day in and day out with nurses, their perceptions and understanding of nursing remain amazingly constricted. At one point, the group decided to spend an entire afternoon discussing the various disciplines gathered around the table, with the primary purpose being to more fully understand nursing and what it is that concerns nurses that is different from the concerns of medicine. I left the afternoon feeling encouraged that everyone at the table was engaged in the discussion and seemed to be open, tuned in, and receptive to the ideas that the nurses of the group presented and explained. The overlaps in our various practices were clear and were not difficult to understand; as one of my nurse practitioner colleagues explained “we all practice a little bit of medicine and a little bit of nursing.” But when it came to issues of focus for each discipline and the possibility that there is a distinction to be made, it was clear that dominant medical ideologies remain firmly entrenched and privileged. The topic for this issue of ANS serves as one point of reference in our ongoing struggle as nurses to fully realize the potential we envision for our discipline and to convey that vision to our colleagues. Indeed, all of the healthcare disciplines have a concern for healing and restoration. Our overlapping concerns, functions, and scopes of practice that relate to these concerns are clear. However, even a cursory review of the article titles that are contained in this issue of ANS makes it clear that nursing has a particular conceptualization concerning “Healing and Restoration” that is not likely to be found in journals of disciplines that rely on a medical model. We are concerned with interactions between environment and human experience, challenges and interactions among individuals who nurture healing, and the everyday existential and spiritual struggles that people have in the journey toward recovery. None of these immensely important concerns require a drug, and none of them can be “fixed” with a technologic approach. In my view, what we as nurses bring to the arena of healthcare worldwide is vitally needed. We need to continue discussions like the one I describe with all of our colleagues in healthcare. But actions do speak louder than words. The amazing accomplishments that nurses achieve every day in hospitals, homes, and communities serve as evidence of who we are and what we do. The content and processes that unfold in our classrooms and laboratories set the stage for the future. What we investigate in our research and scholarship offers greater degrees of understanding, knowledge, and insight. What we produce in our practice and our scholarly journals is an act that conveys and documents our values publicly. Each of us contributes to our legacy as nurses and shapes what we bring to healthcare. It is up to us to deepen our resolve around the ideals and values that shape our practice and to enact those values and ideals day in and day out in our practice, research and scholarship, teaching, and learning.

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, In the last e-proof corrections, I seem to have overlooked the listed order of authors, in which Dr Widdershoven should have come last. I did change the order of listing in the described affiliations of all authors. What happened is that only at a late stage I found out what the academic mores are on this point. Dr Widdershoven, being the promotor in my PhD trajectory, is entitled to be mentioned as the last author acording to these mores, while measured in terms of the amount of contribution to the conception and writing of the article he would be rightly in the third place. As the first author, I (Jan Sitvast) have, of course, done most of the work. I actually wrote it. Tineke Abma (copromotor) is the second author and we discussed several versions of the article together. Tineke Abma suggested lots of changes that I often adopted. Guy Widdershoven played a role in the overall line of thinking that lies at the root of the article and commented on intermediary finished versions of the article. Bert Lendemeijer contributed least of all authors in terms of reading and commenting: his suggestions and comments resulted from reading the article in the very beginning and at the end of the writing process. So, to my belief and reckoning with the academic mores on this point, the listed order must be J. E. Sitvast, T. A. Abma, H. H. G. M. Lendemeijer, and G. A. M. Widdershoven. In retrospect, I would like to give due credit to all authors and, therefore, while apologizing for the inconvenience, I kindly request you to publish this letter with the rectification in the listed order of authors.

    "abstract": "COMPLICATING THE FRAME: A COMMENTARY ON THE ENGAGEMENT OF NURSING RESEARCH WITH THEORIES OF IDENTITY The Notion of identity is embedded in context. That is, the course of becoming encompasses structure, the social systems that frame our world, and agency, the ways in which an individual perceives and exerts his or her unique self in the world. Nursing, the science of health, is uniquely positioned as a multifaceted platform for engagement with identity theory. Our work began as an interprofessional partnership exploring, through a lens of cultural relativism and community partnership, discourses of identity constructed by refugee women living in refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border1 and postresettlement in the United States.2 In particular, we focused on the social, political, and cultural systems around and through which women navigated forced displacement. The narratives of women who participated in the research reflected the ways that Karen women from Burma positioned themselves as agentic and resilient actors within the structures of forced migration. As we framed these women's narratives through a lens of identity, we recognized that a historical account of the evolution of engagement of nursing research with theories of identity was not documented. Further deepening our interest was a necessity to draw from scholarship outside of the field of nursing in order to achieve the depth of theory required to interpret our findings. Discussions of our approach to theorizing evolved into the project described in this commentary. The aims were to review, frame, and organize studies through which nurse researchers approached identity theory in relation to explorations of the practice of nursing. Here we distill findings from the full review and describe challenges and discernments that emerged in the work of developing themes, assigning meaning to themes, and considering why our findings are important and relevant to nursing scholarship and practice. To begin, we crafted a search strategy centered in the CINAHL database. Within the database we searched the terms “identity' and “theor*.” To achieve both a manageable and relevant sample of articles, we limited our results to research articles published in the English language. The search yielded 467 articles. The initial review of abstracts eliminated 211 articles from the analysis. These articles lacked focus on identity as a major theoretical construct. Preliminary search outcomes resulted in the distribution of the 256 studies between 2 broad groupings in nursing research: applied identity (n = 182) and professional nursing identity (n = 74). Among themes generated from articles considering the professional identities of nurses, learning identities, socialized identities, and context-dependent identities emerged prominently. Learning identities characterized interactions with curriculum and pedagogies that functioned as mediating spaces in shaping identity. Socialized identities referenced the construction of professional identity in place. These studies often acknowledged the emergence of professional nursing identity in the context of interprofessional workspaces. Finally, context-dependent identities described the influence of place and time in the formation of professional identity. Related, and considered further as a subtheme of context-dependent identities, are identities formed through a critical incident and momentary or episodic experiences with a substantial impact on the formation of professional nursing identity. In the applied grouping—organized to explain ways nurse researchers frame the performance of identity among patient populations and communities under study—emergent themes included shifting identities, factors that protect or threaten identity, and symbols of identity. Shifting identities reflected research where identities, mediated by some action (eg, survivorship, recovery, becoming a mother), transformed or became new. Studies that described factors threatening or protecting identity tended to address symptom or sensory experiences, lost or shifting ability, or changing role. Symbols of identity were representations of identity, often in nursing research an experience that is embodied, such as medical devices or physiological dysfunction. Important examples of nursing research in both applied and professional groupings reflected theorizing and the application of theory constructed through historical and discursive understandings of identity. However, we feel there remains space to complicate the frame of identity theory in ways that extend beyond the unified and stable. Identities in our focal collection of articles presented as conflicted and shifting, but frequently those identities remained sequential, moving from one to the other. The question we pose in this commentary, and that will influence our future work, is whether hybrid, improvisational, and layered frames of identity could more aptly reflect the performance of the intersectional identities embodied by the individuals and communities we serve? — Sarah J.

    "abstract": "THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR! When I founded Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) in 1978, I had no idea that the journal would survive to the publication of the 40th volume, much less that I would still have the honor of serving as the journal's Editor! I founded the journal with the unequalled support of Wally Hood with Aspen Publishers, who was among the most pronursing Acquisitions Editors in the nursing publishing business. He worked closely with me and the Aspen production staff to accomplish all the tasks of founding the journal—including the process of forming the journal's identity as a premier scholarly journal in nursing. His influence on the journal persists to this day in many ways, not the least of which is the journal cover that he alone conceptualized and designed. The editorial intent of the journal that Wally and I shared has endured throughout the journal's history—to publish nursing scholarship of the highest quality, challenging the status quo, and providing thought-provoking ideas that open new possibilities for nursing knowledge and practice. In 2002, the journal was acquired by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (aka Wolters Kluwer), which continued the traditions established early in the journal's history.* Over the years, ANS has remained stable in terms of intent and quality, despite massive changes in the publishing industry and in modes of production and communication. When ANS started, I was doing all of the editorial work on an IBM Selectric typewriter, telephones were still tethered to a wire, and all correspondence traveled on paper by way of the postal system! The shifts to personal computers, the World Wide Web, and paperless production have had a tremendous (and positive) influence on the “how” of producing the journal, but our fundamental commitment to the best quality of scholarship and challenging ideas has deepened and grown over the years. In celebration of the 40th volume, the Collections section of the journal Web site has been updated to extend through the year 2010 (http://journals.lww.com/advancesinnursingscience/Pages/collections.aspx?Collection=Topical). The Collections provide links to articles that I have identified as standing the test of time to become particularly significant contributions to the discipline. Each Collection focuses on topics that have emerged from the nature of the articles that we have published over the years. For example, ANS has published some of the most notable articles on nursing ethics, articles that address diverse and sometimes divergent perspectives on nursing ethics and that have prompted the kind of debate that leads to growth and maturity of the discipline. Other collections focus on topics such as Concepts, Philosophy, Critical and Postmodern Scholarship, Feminism, History, Professional Issues, and more! Our fundamental intent to provide ideas that challenge debate and discussion is now enhanced by the journal blog at https://ansjournalblog.com/—an online resource that provides many “back stories” as authors share information about their articles as they are featured in the journal. An important dimension of the blog is that the journal is no longer only a one-way channel that delivers ideas from authors to readers—now readers can engage in discussion of the ideas that are presented in the pages of the journal! This first issue of volume 40 focuses on articles that build on works previously published in ANS, bringing current insights and knowledge to bear on paths that are envisioned for the future of the discipline. I hope that these articles, and those to come over the months ahead, will prompt you to join in the discussions initiated in our content as we bring together the past and present to shape the future of nursing! —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "RESPONSE TO THE ARTICLE “RETURNING TO THE PROFESSION'S ROOTS: SOCIAL JUSTICE IN NURSING EDUCATION FOR THE 21st CENTURY” This letter is in response to the April-June 2017 article, “Returning to the Profession's Roots: Social Justice in Nursing Education for the 21st Century.” I read with great interest the authors call for nursing to return to its roots and agree wholeheartedly with the authors that it is necessary to integrate social justice as a core concept throughout the nursing curriculum. Integration of social justice into the nursing school curriculum is not a unique concept; however, the authors did a phenomenal job of laying out the case for integration, and this new passionate call for action is greatly needed. It is my belief that the focus has already shifted toward integration of social justice within the curriculum of prelicensure nursing programs. Social justice was embraced within the American Nurses Association's 2015 Code of Ethics With Interpretive Statements1 and is one of its priorities. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) “The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice”2 2008 document, Essential Eight, postulates that “professionalism and the inherent values of altruism, autonomy, human dignity, integrity, and social justice are fundamental to the discipline of nursing.”(P4) That may have been the catalyst, since most undergraduate nursing program curriculum objectives now include social justice as part of their outcomes. However, although AACN Essentials document “serves to transform baccalaureate nursing education by providing the curricular elements and framework for building the baccalaureate nursing curriculum for the 21st century,” it does not provide a well-articulated strategy for developing a social justice curriculum. Nursing education is now challenged to effectively weave social justice into its curriculum with a pedagogical approach that provides students with a professional foundation that is inclusive of the skill set required to ignite activism. They are being charged to do this without specific guidance and must be cognizant of the substance of the prelicensure social justice student competencies and point of introduction into the curricular content. An area of great importance that was not covered in this article are the challenges to the integration of social justice content throughout the nursing curriculum. “Racism and all its manifestations are an integral part of workplace settings, especially in higher education institutions.”3 The elephant in the room is institutional racism in academia, which must be investigated and eliminated before there can be successful integration of social justice within the nursing curriculum. Also, as the authors clearly acknowledged, once nurses leave the prelicensure program, they work within the oppressive institutional structure that dictates their work environment, which makes social justice engagement difficult. Elimination of institutionalized racism within health care systems is perhaps the greatest challenge that we must overcome in order for nurses to become more actively engaged in social justice actions. I wonder what would be the impact if organizations such as The Joint Commission stipulates the demonstrations of social justice outcomes as one of its requirement. Undertaking social justice curriculum initiatives comes with the challenge of getting all faculty members on board and then training and equipping the faculty with the tools to effectively cultivate social justice skills. Decision on the most effective method to present social justice content while building a more inclusive campus environment also comes with its challenges. Continuous improvement and ongoing professional development are an expectation; all nurses including nurse educators and I agree with the authors suggested use of continuing education to improve educator's knowledge and expertise. I am grateful to the authors for their leadership in bringing this topic to the forefront once more. Social justice actions are critical to the obliteration of the various injustices that adversely impact the marginalized in our society, and reshaping the nursing prelicensure program curriculum to include social justice is crucial. I propose that the AACN do more than espouse social justice as part of its essentials; it should provide more leadership by synthesizing all the various evidence-based social justice educational strategies and put forward specific guidelines to assist and streamline the integration of social justice throughout the prelicensure nursing curriculum. I also challenge institutions offering nursing programs to devise strategies to overcome barriers to the integration of social justice content throughout the nursing curriculum. —Doris Brown, MSN College of Nursing Barry University Miami, Florida ([email protected])",

    "abstract": "This article presents findings from reimmersion in the data from a study on hope in Australian youth. Carried out in 2002 using a Gadamerian hermeneutic phenomenological approach, the study explored meanings that young people ascribed to their experiences of hope. It was clear from original analysis that the participants expressed hope as a driving force characterized by a necessity for human connectedness and the need to have options and choices in life which when experienced produced feelings of at-one-with. However, missing from this description is the acknowledgement of hope as an embodied experience that enabled resolution of grieving and loss. Reimmersion in the data added new dimensions to my understanding of hope and how it functions in people's lives. In this sense, engagement in secondary analysis fulfilled the goal of philosophic hermeneutics, which is to understand what is involved in the process of understanding itself.",

    "abstract": "BEYOND THE STRESS OF INFORMATION OVERLOAD I believe that I can speak with great confidence on this point—anyone reading this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) suffers from some degree of information overload. We live in this amazing age of almost instant access to any bit of information we need and to information that we do not particularly need but that intrusively vies for our attention. Almost daily I hear someone proclaim that he or she simply cannot keep up, even with the e-mail that arrives in one of several inboxes. The level of stress experienced, and the coping mechanisms employed to deal with the stress, varies from person to person and probably from generation to generation. It is now imperative to not only find ways to deal with the volume of information but also quickly discern which information is reliable and valid and which is propaganda, unreliable, manipulative, or false. The best admonishment I have encountered to address this challenge is “Think like a scientist!” Of course, this is not an instant litmus test to discern good information from misleading or “bad” information, but it typically leads fairly quickly to key factors that are readily available—the first being to determine the source and the evidence backing up the information. As all good scientists know, examining the basis for any claim of fact, or the logic underlying any statement of opinion, is vital to good science. A scholarly journal such as ANS maintains the process of peer review to ensure, as much as is humanly possible, that the information published in the journal has a firm foundation upon which the information is based. But good science goes beyond the fundamental reliability and validity of information, reaching for knowledge and understanding that arise from integration of information and facts, along with the whole of human wisdom. Nursing now has a tradition of seeking not only empirical information and facts but also a sense of the whole of knowing derived from ethical, personal, aesthetic, and emancipatory interests. I believe that to “think like a scientist” requires asking not only about the veracity of the sources from which information is derived but also about the meaning, significance, and importance of that information from our ethical, personal, aesthetic, and emancipatory understanding. Good sources welcome challenge and debate that explore the perspectives within which they place both facts and opinions. As in many other editorials and now with most of the ANS blog posts, I invite readers of ANS to participate in scholarly discourse related to the content of this issue of ANS. ANS has a long history of publishing content that challenges the status quo—challenges that are well founded and have merit scientifically and philosophically but that nonetheless require energetic debate. You can browse the ANS blog to see discussions that have emerged recently in response to ANS articles. You can follow the blog to receive a notice of posts that include messages from ANS authors about their work. We invite you to add your own comments and ideas. Doing so provides an avenue to not merely consume but also engage with ideas that are vital to the development of nursing! We hope to hear from you! —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "CRITIQUE AND CHALLENGE IN A CLIMATE OF DISRUPTION AND INCIVILITY From the very beginning, Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) has maintained a commitment to publishing ideas that are cutting-edge, challenging, and out of the mainstream. We also maintain the expectation of excellence in scholarship. This means that all ideas, no matter how different, have a solid empirical and philosophic foundation and are presented in ways that lead the reader to an understanding of the author's perspective, regardless of whether or not the reader agrees with the content. In 2015, the ANS advisory board affirmed our commitment to diversity and ideas that challenge the prevailing mainstream traditions. The following statement of purpose that appears in the journal “Information for Authors” reflects this commitment: The primary purposes of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) are to advance the development of nursing knowledge and to promote the integration of nursing philosophies, theories, and research with practice. While the journal provides scholarly articles that have relevance for all health-related disciplines, we are particularly committed to claiming nursing's rightful place in the development of health knowledge. We expect high scholarly merit and encourage innovative, cutting-edge ideas that challenge prior assumptions and that present new, intellectually challenging perspectives. We seek works that speak to global sustainability and that take an intersectional approach, recognizing class, color, sexual and gender identity, and other dimensions of human experience related to health. There have always been voices of dissent related to ideas that differ from the mainstream or views of representing cultures and beliefs that are not in the mainstream. But now, in the year 2017 in the United States and many other countries worldwide, dissent has grown to a point of stark polarization, leaving a very small, perhaps nonexistent, mainstream “middle ground.” This means that dissent is often cast as a battle between very different world views, with a perception of very little shared or common ground. The rise of incivility, bullying, and disregard for human dignity in the face of disagreement and difference is particularly alarming. If your experience is like mine, you see it everywhere: the principal of my grandchildren's school noted yesterday an alarming rise in bullying over the past year; my blogs have received unprecedented harmful, name-calling comments that disregard the content of posted material; nurses I work with in graduate-level classes report escalating problems with incivility in their work settings; a brief scan of the Table of Contents of most nursing journals reveals content acknowledging violence and incivility. What is missing, so far, is evidence that even those of us who recognize the problem remain at a loss to know how to respond, how to turn the situation around, how to heal the hurt, and how to prevent harmful words and actions, transforming disagreement into opportunities for growth. Those of us living in this time are not capable of fully comprehending the significance of this climate, but we do understand that we face serious challenges, among them finding ways to constructively address views that are polarized from our own. I believe that what we are experiencing is a surfacing of feelings and thoughts that have been simmering and hidden for far too long. It is a societal disease that has been dormant. The appearance of these symptoms provides an opportunity for change and healing, for nurses to step up and respond. I am calling on nurses to bring to this challenge the best we have to offer—to gather in small groups to explore constructive ways to bring healing to our families, neighborhoods, workplaces, classrooms, and communities. We can act to heal our communities. We can direct our scholarship into opportunities to contribute to healing and transformation. This issue of ANS continues our strong tradition of challenging the status quo in several arenas, offering insight into social justice, healing, and health. I hope that the content of this and other issues of ANS will call forth critical insights and prompt action toward health and healing. Please follow the journal blog at https://ansjournalblog.com/, where we publish messages from the authors of ANS articles, sharing background about their work and their ideas. We welcome all readers to join us in discussing the ideas—even bringing opposing and differing ideas to the discussion and, in so doing, demonstrating the capacity to challenge, discuss, and consider differing points of view in ways that lead to greater understanding and growth. —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "THE POLITICS OF SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING: STANDING UP FOR SCIENCE As this issue of the journal goes to press, there is a growing political climate that challenges facts, science, and expertise. Ironically, the very basis of the best of science is the skeptical attitude that questions the truth and validity of all claims and an insistence on the basis of those claims. However, the recent rise in the challenge to science and facts is not consistent with a legitimate skepticism—it stops with the challenge often without a basis for the challenge and without any effort to look beyond the challenge to investigate the basis for any scientific or factual claim. In fact, from what I have observed, there is more of a tendency to reject that which does not “fit” with one's own worldview and to accept without question that which does fit. A recent blog post by Alice Meadows on The Scholarly Kitchen offers a challenge to all who are involved in scholarly publishing to stand up for science.1 As Meadows observes: ...public trust in science and scientists is at risk. Many people don't understand how science works and, instead, rely on attention-grabbing (and often misleading or downright erroneous) headlines; their distrust is compounded by media coverage of what is wrong with science, rather than what is right.... This, in turn, makes it easy for those who seek to discredit genuine academic research to claim that their “alternative facts” are just as valid. Meadows offers steps for publishers and editors to stand up for science and against false claims. From the beginning, Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) has maintained practices and policies that ensure the integrity of the journal, including A strong peer review process that ensures, as much as is humanly possible, the scientific integrity of all content published in ANS. Membership in COPE—the Committee for Publication Ethics (http://publicationethics.org), which outlines practices to ensure that journal content is free of conflicts of interest and that editorial practices that ensure the integrity of the journal, protects freedom of expression, and maintains accountability and transparency for all editorial practices. Transparency and open explanation of all of our editorial practices and policies, now available on the journal Web site “Information for Authors” (http://journals.lww.com/advancesinnursingscience/Pages/Instructions-for-Authors.aspx) with additional details on the pages that show the Review Panel members, processes, and policies (http://journals.lww.com/advancesinnursingscience/Pages/reviewpanel.aspx). All involved in the production of scholarship have responsibilities that address the current tide that can erode the public trust in science and scholarship. Here are suggestions for all nursing students, practitioners, and scholars—things you can do to affirm your own confidence as a scholar and a consumer of reliable nursing knowledge and stand up for science: Be aware of the best editorial practices of nursing journals that ensure the integrity of their content. Learn and practice “journal due diligence” when you are seeking a journal for publication of your work. Be aware of the dangers of predatory publishers. (See articles published in Nurse Author and Editor at http://naepub.com/category/predatory-publishing.) Ensure that your practices as a scholar are well founded and maintain a record of your practices to ensure that your work is not compromised. Educate others (your patients, students, and colleagues) about your own practices to ensure the integrity of your own work and why these practices are important. Network with other scholars in your area of interest to ensure that you have a community of those who share your intent to maintain the integrity of the scholarship in your field and who can speak with confidence about the foundation on which your work is based. I invite all readers of ANS to participate in discussions about the practices and policies of this journal and the standards on which we base those practices. We welcome the opportunity to speak to any issues and concerns at any time! —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "It is ironic that this issue of ANS is being published at a time when the United States government is persisting in waging war in Iraq, despite growing insistence from the citizens to end the war, repair our damaged relationships with many other countries in the world, and change the priorities to better care for the earth and people in desperate need. Relationships at the level of governments and world powers are beyond the control of any one individual, but in fact, the fundamental challenges of relationships between nations mirror the same challenges of relationships between individuals. In any kind of relationship, certain dynamics shape the nature of the relationship—dynamics of trust, respect for differences, concern for one another's well-being, and positive ways of resolving conflict. I believe that every effort that each individual makes in the direction of building strong, healthy, and satisfying relationships with others is another step toward the possibility of world peace. As this issue of ANS goes to press, the 7th edition of my book Peace and Power: Building Communities for the Future is also in press. First published in 1984, this little book explains ways that groups can shift the dynamics of their relationships from power-over, hierarchical interactions, to cooperative interactions grounded in values of empowerment for all, nurturing of one another, and respect for one another's differences. The book is admittedly idealistic, but it has served as a beacon of hope for many individuals and groups seeking to move toward new ways of relating to one another. It has also provided practical guidance for groups in making changes both large and small. In the preface of Peace and Power, I have included “A Dozen and One Things You Can Do to Create Peace on Earth.” This a list that my late coauthor, Charlene Eldridge, and I created at the time of the first gulf war. The list addresses many of the most serious challenges that we face as a global community. I remain firm in my belief that we can indeed turn the tide of human history and global health by heeding the actions on this list. Plant and nurture something that grows. Practice the fine art of yielding—in your car, in conversation, etc. Become active in a group that works on principles of cooperation, on principles of Peace and Power. Fill your home, work, and commuting environments with visual and auditory images of peace and tranquility. Do at least one thing to simplify your life and reduce your consumption of disposable products. Do at least one thing to reduce your consumption of natural resources. Move toward a vegetarian diet. Learn and practice some form of meditation. Learn and practice ways to reduce hostile interactions with others. Exchange gentle forms of touch regularly. Express appreciation to at least 1 individual or group every day. Help 3 children learn 3 things on this list. Pass this list along to someone else. The scholars who have prepared the articles in this issue of ANS have made significant contributions toward building insight and knowledge about the dynamics of relationship. So now add one other item to the list—ANS readers learn and apply the insights conveyed in this issue of ANS to strengthen nursing contributions toward better, stronger relationships. Peggy L.

    "abstract": "MICROAGGRESSION IN NURSING KNOWLEDGE GENERATION AND DEVELOPMENT \"Microaggression,\" contemporary racism, is a term that was relatively recently introduced to nursing. Racial microaggression refers to \"brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults to the target person or group.\"1(p271) According to Sue et al,1 racism has been changed into vague forms in recent years, which are called modern racism, symbolic racism, and aversive racism. Sue et al1 also asserted that all these types of contemporary racism would be deceptive and covert while the \"old-fashioned\" form could have obvious display of racial hatred and bigotry. Thus, it could be sometimes difficult to detect and prevent contemporary racism compared with the old-fashioned racism. All different types of microaggression could affect nursing knowledge generation and development. For instance, because of microinsult, some great research ideas from racial/ethnic minority scholars might have been killed because they were afraid to pursue the ideas after experiencing microinsult during their presentations to their mentors or peers in the academia. Although we have witnessed all types of microaggression in the academia, we have rarely addressed the issues. Also, we have rarely considered the impact on nursing knowledge generation and development. Indeed, in my personal experience as an Asian American nursing scholar during the past 3 decades, nursing has not been devoid of this lingering societal issue at all. When I was a PhD student in early 1990s, our nursing community began to talk about diversity, cultural competence, and ethnocentric approaches in nursing knowledge development and generation. After 30 years, we are still talking about the same things without a clear resolution. In reality, we may be heading back to the old days within the current political situations. While working on several leadership projects with leaders from Asian countries, I frequently found that our nursing knowledge has mainly been generated and developed from Western perspectives, which may be a form of Western (or Eurocentric) microaggression in nursing knowledge generation and development (eg, microinvalidation). I frequently heard from racial/ethnic minority researchers that National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant reviews would be biased toward racial/ethnic minority nurse researchers (eg, microinsult, microinvalidation). Some of them joked that they would change their names to sound like White male researchers so that their proposals could be fairly reviewed. Indeed, the NIH's data on their funded researchers clearly showed racial/ethnic disparities among the NIH-funded researchers.2 For instance, only 2.6% of the NIH-funded researchers were Black. Also, I often heard from our international colleagues that journal reviewers were particularly harsh in their reviews of their manuscripts. Although they hired a professional editor, they often got harsh comments on grammatical and spelling errors rather than on the content of the manuscripts. I also heard from colleagues about their difficulties in getting funding for their research among transgender populations and in publishing their research findings. Recent public attention on racial/ethnic conflicts in the United States has made many nursing scholars to give their thoughts on microaggression as a nursing phenomenon.3,4 With an increasing influx of racial/ethnic minorities in nursing, microaggression became a buzzword among nursing scholars. Indeed, there is an imminent necessity for nursing scholars to carefully consider microaggression in nursing. In nursing, the concept of microaggression was first introduced to our literature by Hall and Fields.3 Since their first article, a slowly increasing number of nursing articles related to microaggression have been published in the literature but have rarely addressed the issues in its impact on nursing knowledge generation and development. Throughout its history, Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) has published the articles related to social justice, racism, and microaggression, which have been frequently used by many nursing scholars. Indeed, the first article on the concept of microaggression in nursing was published in ANS. I hope that nurse scholars will give careful attention to this seemingly never-changing phenomenon in nursing, especially its impact on nursing knowledge generation and development, and will move forward with some feasible and tangible strategies to tackle the issues. —Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "\"AI\" is a recent buzzword among people including nurses. People are highly excited about it and, simultaneously, concerned about it. AI could be the future of humankind as we have seen in science fiction (Sci Fi) movies and novels. AI could help improve human life in many unexpected ways. At the same time, it could cause a number of unexpected problems such as possible misinformation with lack of accountability, manipulation to influence users, amplifying biases, hacking/mishandling personal information, losses of human jobs, lack of empathy, and so on. In recent 2 articles by The New York Times, the authors even warned that AI might be as dangerous as nuclear weapons and pandemics.1,2 With all these claims, it would be important for nursing communities to contemplate possible influences of AI on nursing knowledge generation and development. In a positive way, AI could help generate manuscripts and research proposals more efficiently than before; for those who are not good at written communication skills, AI could be a great tool to assist to generate better written products than currently available other technology-based tools. Indeed, many people claimed that AI would be useful in summarizing and paraphrasing.3 In a negative way, AI could create fake plausible information that people might not easily differentiate from real trustable information. ChatGPT is the heart of the buzz of \"AI.\" ChatGPT is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. ChatGPT is built upon GPT-3.5 (freely available) and GPT-4. GPT represents Generative Pre-trained Transformer. In other words, GPT is an AI system that generates new text that has similar characteristics of the training data in response to prompts after trained with existing data. Thus, ChatGPT can generate the response that is unfaithful to the provided training data. This phenomenon is called Hallucination.4 A user of ChatGPT should check the truthfulness of its responses. The science community in general also has concerned on the manipulation of information through AI by the creators/developers. AI could be intentionally programmed to produce misinformation purposefully by the creators/developers. Then, users could use AI without knowing the hidden agenda by the creators/developers. Subsequently, AI could create a number of ethical issues/concerns related to nursing knowledge generation and development with the hidden agenda. Then, the nursing knowledge generated and developed by AI could drastically influence nursing practice and consequently affect human beings. For instance, AI could easily augment biases if they are trained with the data that do not consider diversities in the population. Indeed, ChatGPT-3.5 reportedly has some issues related to racial and gender biases.5 Also, there is no checking point on the biases if they are programmed not to consider diverse perspectives and/or phenomenon. Then, the generated nursing knowledge could result in biased nursing practice and care. AI is not linked to a legal or moral responsibility for its products as well. In other words, AI does not have accountability for any errors or harm that it could cause. In nursing discipline where human health and life are taken care of, this could cause serious issues. As an editor of a journal, the first ethnical/legal issue that I concern is possible plagiarism and intellectual property issues since AI could produce texts that would combine copyrighted content. Another ethnical/legal issue could be possible privacy invasions and data protection violations because AI could produce private and sensitive information/data that could easily identify individual people. In addition, there could be an authorship issue if a written product is generated by AI (eg, should AI be listed as a coauthor?). There is a question then. Because of all these possible issues, should AI be avoided in nursing? If yes, why? If not, what should nursing communities do about AI? Personally, I think, if AI is used \"ethically and properly,\" it could be a valuable tool for nursing scholars. As mentioned earlier, AI could easily improve tedious writing tasks and skills. Rather, we need to develop guidelines and policies for \"ethical and proper\" usages of AI as a scholarly community. Of course, it would be very important to understand potential issues and dangers involved in the use of AI and to be transparent about the use of AI in any scholarly works. Indeed, this is an obvious question that nursing communities need to continuously discuss more carefully and in depth as AI will continuously evolve and other unexpected issues could occur. As the recent Times articles warned, we should not hastily take AI.1,2 —Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "This year, I was asked to be a keynote speaker for an international conference in South Korea. The theme of the conference was related to translational science and nursing. While closely looking at the literature on translational science and nursing, I found a significant lack of nursing literature on translational science, although nursing had closely been linked to translational science throughout its history. Yet, at the same time, it was also clear that translational science had been in the heart of nursing discipline in its efforts to provide highly efficient and effective, high-quality, and safe nursing care.1 In the history of nursing discipline, continuous trials to connect nursing research and theory to nursing practice have been intensely and intentionally made.2,3 Evidence-based nursing practice has been a different name of translational science in nursing for a substantial period.4,5 Indeed, \"the evidence\" for nursing practice has been sought by nursing scholars through generating and further developing nursing knowledge.4,5 To get the evidence from rigorous research,1 nursing scholars have used all different types of research (eg, randomized clinical trials).6 Yet, there has been a question on the practical adoption of the evidence from nursing science to nursing practice7: Why the evidence from nursing science has not been widely disseminated and used in the general scientific community? Maybe due to multiple disadvantageous statuses of nursing as a discipline (eg, women dominant discipline), the evidence from nursing research might have been devalued even by nursing scholars. In the promotion and appointment process in the academia, nursing faculty members are frequently criticized about not having an enough number of articles in multidisciplinary journals with high-impact factors. Indeed, there have been several questions that nursing scholars have struggled to answer during the past decades. Would other disciplines require their scientists to publish their articles in the journals outside their disciplines? Also, why do nursing journals not have high-impact factors? Why is nursing evidence not cited broadly and frequently? To promote translational science in nursing, one of the most important huddles that nursing scholars need to overcome would be valuing our own scientific evidence and heritages. Frequently, we found that nursing theories that we have been developing are rarely used in the actual translation into nursing practice or nursing research. Are we valuing and respecting our own knowledge generated through our science? If our own nursing community does not value our own science and scholarly works, then no other scientific communities would do. It would be very important for us to reflect on our own attitudes toward our own scientific evidence that we have been gathering and generating through nursing science. To translate the evidence from nursing science to nursing practice and research and to promote translational science in nursing, we should learn to value our own science and compete with other disciplines through generating nursing knowledge using rigorous scientific methods. Translation sounds great, but what will be translated would be more important. Do we have adequate and rigorous evidence from nursing science to translate into nursing practice? How to disseminate our own evidence to the general scientific community? Are we valuing our own evidence? Are we willing to translate the evidence from our own science to our practice? There still exist a number of questions to reflect on. —Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN Editor",

Subsequent to self-government in 1956, the national government, in its efforts to become independent of its reliance on Great Britain, turned to the United States and Canada for technical and financial aid. Consequently, sources such as the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization, and the Canadian International Development Agency were majoravenues for the provision of ideas, concepts, and values in health planning and policy making with primary health care endorsed by the government. Nursing education was thus influenced by these industrialized concepts and values. The impact of socioeconomic and nursing events in the Caribbean region coupled with local initiatives taken by the indigenous leadership to improve nursing education resulted in a program that was an amalgamation of British, North American, and indigenous features.",

    "abstract": "The authors respond: We welcome the opportunity to engage in discourse about middle-range theory. In our article we advocated the development of middle-range theories in addition to, not in opposition to or as a substitute for, the development of more specific theories. Empirically based concept development regarding the individual symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue provided the basis for moving to the broader scope and higher level of abstraction represented by the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms. As Brown notes, such concept development yields valuable information about patients' symptom experiences. It is needed to guide symptom-specific measures and interventions. Continued empirical work and concept and theory development at the level of individual symptoms also provides the basis for continued amplification and refinement of the middle-range theory. We agree that it should continue. Brown feels that a middle-range theory that encompasses several similar phenomena-in this case, unpleasant symptoms-may be less clinically useful than separate theories. Our experience has been that symptom-specific theory is too restrictive to be the sole focus of knowledge development. In keeping with nursing's holistic focus, clinical practice with ill patients almost always involves attending to more than one symptom at a time. The middle-range theory is clinically applicable because it goes beyond symptom-specific concepts and theories to stimulate thinking about common factors that may influence more than one symptom, the ways in which multiple symptoms interact with one another and affect performance, and interventions that would mitigate multiple symptoms. To underscore the usefulness of theories that encompass multiple symptoms, we point out that while we were developing our Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms, another group of nurse scientists, the University of California, San Francisco, School of Nursing Symptom Management Faculty Group, [1] was developing a model to guide clinical practice in the management of a variety of symptoms. Nursing theories are evaluated by several criteria, of which clinical usefulness is only one. Also important is a theory's ability to explain relevant phenomena in a parsimonious manner and to generate interesting scientific questions for study. It is our experience that a middle-range theory that highlights commonalities among symptoms and provides for the simultaneous experience of multiple symptoms (this aspect of the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms is evolving) generates more interesting researchable questions than single-symptom approaches. The latter represent untapped scientific potential that can be most effectively maximized through the development of higher-level middle-range theories. Elizabeth R.

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that I am an avid explorer of words and word meanings, I have grown quite impatient with semantic battles over the meanings of \"primary care\" and \"primary health care.\" The battles rage in academic meetings and classrooms, with little or no connection to how nurses outside these rooms perceive the world of health care to be, much less any connection with how practitioners in other disciplines use or respond to the words. All of the authoritative and worldwide definitions aside, it seems to me that the rest of the world is moving along in either a guided or misguided manner trying to respond to various pressures for health care reform. There seems to be no question about the need to move toward models of care that include such features as illness prevention, continuity of care, and health promotion-all notions consistent with the most adamant advocate for primary health care but still promoted in the current climate as \"primary care.\" The real debates and dilemmas seem to be over how much of what can the public afford and how far-reaching the needed changes can be. This issue of Advances in Nursing Science (17:4), originally devoted to \"Innovations in Primary Care,\" was planned over two years ago when it was clear that the health care system was headed for major change. Despite the timeliness of the topic, it drew amazingly few manuscripts. When I commented on this fact among colleagues around the world, on at least three occasions someone noted that those who are \"doing\" primary care in nursing are not well positioned to write about what they are doing-yet. And our conversations then turned to wondering what those who might write are doing or thinking about primary care. Perhaps my choice of the term \"primary care\" rather than \"primary health care\" gave pause to academic nurses who would prefer to write under a topic focused on primary health care. I chose the term \"primary care\" primarily because of its common use in the arena of health care reform and the consistent references under this label to activities that I associate with primary health care. Now, in reflecting back on that choice, I think it is one that bears serious consideration. Words can be carefully chosen for any number of reasons, and in this instance I opt toward terminology that will bring us as nurses toward the center of the action and the discussion. To do so will require abandoning the semantic battle. The term \"primary care\" can acquire the meanings that nurses intend as nurses move forward to put into practice that which is embedded in the fullest meaning of the idea of \"primary health care.\" The more nurses move outside the walls of the academic rooms of debate and begin to participate in meaningful primary care action, the more nurses will have to say about the value and worth of nursing's fundamental visions for health care in the future. The articles in this issue of ANS, now presented as the topic \"Primary Care and Knowledge Development,\" include several articles that illustrate shifts that can occur in how primary care is done and how it is conceived or conceptualized. This issue also contains articles that were originally developed for the previous issue focused on knowledge development. It is clear that there is much to be accomplished in acquiring a body of knowledge about primary care and other dimensions of health care for the future. It is my hope that in the near future we will see a more complete merging of these two important aspects of nursing knowledge development and practice. Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "KNOWING AND DOING “Copper Woman warned Hai Nai Yu that the world would change and times might come when Knowing would not be the same as Doing. And she told her that Trying would always be very important.”1(p53) We are all familiar with persistent voices decrying the various and sundry gaps that exist between the realms of theory and practice (also called, for us, the education v practice gap). Indeed, those of us who have walked in both the worlds of academia and service have experienced very real and distressing senses of “other worldness” as we pass back and forth from one world to the other. Yet we continue to hear pleas for someone to bridge these gaps, and wish for some magic formula that might make it possible for one world to better inform the other. As nurses we are particularly vulnerable to an unrelenting sense of disparity between what we know and what we do. We know we would be stronger as a profession if we were unified with each other and with other health care providers, but we are not unified. We know we would be able to provide a high quality of care if we were free to practice nursing as we envision it to be, but we do not and cannot practice in these ways. We know we would better serve society if we focused our practice on health and developed greater knowledge about health, but we practice in an illness care system, not a health care system. When we attempt to sort out the underlying issues and dynamics of these disparities, we experience clouded vision. We are confronted with circumstances and factors we would rather not see, that do not fit with our experience of ourselves and the world. We find contradictions, extremely complex situations, and a multitude of internal and external voices screaming dilemmas we already know too well. In the face of what seems to be an impossible challenge, I believe that there are brave steps that we can all take toward healing the perceived gaps. There is no single path, and some of the paths that we attempt may turn in a direction we would not intend. But it is vitally important that we begin to take the steps, as the authors in this issue of ANS demonstrate. One step is to no longer accept the notion that we are doomed to experience fundamental gaps between what we know and what we do, and to begin to act and think in a way that reflects our desire to more fully express unity between our theory and our practice. We can begin to act in accord with our ideas about the way nursing should be, with firm conviction that what we think and what we do are vitally important. We can increase our conviction that what we think and what we experience are related, by thinking systematically about what we experience and consciously forming our experiences in light of our fundamental ideas about the world. We can give voice to our doubts and our questions about the ways that things are and listen attentively to the voices of others, especially those who are doubting, questioning, angry, or aggrieved. We can begin to discuss, with nurses from all walks of life, all areas of work, all levels of preparation, how we might move beyond our doubts and questions and anger, to create something that will make a difference. We can begin to believe, and act on the belief, that what we think and what we do can, indeed, make some difference in the structures that exert control over our lives. Another step is to recognize that as we express unity in our knowing and doing, we will begin to enter dimensions of experience that have been previously unfamiliar. We will recognize paradoxes in our own thinking and in the thinking of other nurses that we wish did not exist. With recognition will emerge vision of how to move beyond the paradoxes. Bunch2 has named one of these the “too hard/too easy” paradox. Some nurses assume that theory must be esoteric and far removed from daily life, if it is to be properly called theory. It must be too hard for most people to understand if it is to be taken seriously in the academic community. On the flip side, as Bunch notes, some of us want all theory to be easy—to have words that do not require a dictionary, to be able to be read rapidly and easily, if it is to be of any use. Both of these attitudes represent barriers to serious consideration of ways to move beyond the disparities between what we know and what we do. If we recognize that reading and writing theory is not easy but can be done, and theory can be comprehensible to all nurses, then we will begin to experience both theory and practice in ways that we cannot imagine in advance. Healing what we experience as the theory-practice split in nursing cannot be left to someone else to do. As each of us, regardless of our work orientation, begins to heal the splits within our own thinking and in our own actions, we will begin to see movements toward unity that we all yearn for.

    "abstract": "Fawcett's challenge to Chinn's editorial on physiology and holism provides a perfect example of “the problematic allure of binary thinking” identified by Thorne et al.1 Fawcett asserts that a view of holism that allows attention to any dimension of that whole does not fit with the simultaneity paradigm and thus must represent a reductionistic view of holism, i.e., one that is a sum of the parts. I would like to suggest that we move beyond such dichotomous thinking and consider both/and possibilities instead of confining ourselves to the either/or position advocated by Fawcett. First, I need to begin with the understanding that paradigmatic models, however useful, are human constructions to help us organize the assumptions underpinning prevailing worldviews. As such, they are not infallible, not Truth, not absolute knowledge. This leads to my second point of suggesting that it is time to revisit pattern appraisal as the exclusive method by which human beings can be known in a unitary holistic sense. I would like to suggest that quantum physics provides a model for a both/and approach to holism. Physicists now widely agree that quantum particles manifest both as wave patterns and as localizable particles with different characteristics from waves; in other words, particles of matter have a dual nature, each of which can be described but together adding to the coherence of the knowledge of the whole.2 The holographic paradigm provides a similar model; according to Bohm, any part of the hologram provides information about the whole, not only one aspect of the whole, albeit that information is lacking in some detail.3 Such developments in quantum physics would suggest to me that the idea that knowledge of the whole can only be known through/vadjust pattern appraisal is inconsistent with the very foundations in physics that gave rise to the concept of unitary human beings. It is also inconsistent with everyday experiences in which we fully accept that the whole is more than and different from a sum of its parts and yet we can recognize, appreciate, and describe those parts: a cake and its ingredients, a symphony and its individual notes and instruments, a rainbow with its seven colors. Perhaps it is time for nursing scholars to consider the idea that knowledge of a dimension of the whole can provide additional detail, giving us a more coherent picture of the whole without worrying about whether such knowledge is consistent with one's endorsement of any particular paradigm. Not doing so places nursing at risk for a perverse form of reductionism in which knowledge of whole human beings is compromised through privileging knowledge gained from pattern appraisal and ignoring or rejecting the additional detail available through examining specific dimensions of that whole human being. Or, perhaps we have outgrown existing paradigms and discussions such as this mark the emergence of something new. Adeline Falk-Rafael, PhD, RN York University",

    "abstract": "LOOKING BACK AND LOOKING FORWARD On the wall of a battered women's shelter I saw a prominent poster that said “Don't look back, you are not going that way!” The words brought a smile to the faces of the 2 of us visiting that day, and we continued to talk about the meaning of the message as we left the shelter and reflected on the focus group we had just completed. The purpose of our group discussion had been exploring what the women found most helpful in making their transitions to a new life, and, indeed, the challenges that they each experienced as they attempted to move forward were horrendous. They knew their past mistakes, and were overwhelmed by personal and social barriers that seemed insurmountable. It was all too tempting for them to dwell in their past with all the regrets, guilt, anger, and sadness that it held for them. At the same time, they knew that if they focused their gaze on the past, they would surely trip over new challenges and barriers that they missed seeing. They understood the value of understanding their past, and of finding ways to change old patterns that had contributed to their pain and suffering. They had come to appreciate strengths that they brought with them from their past, and that they needed to learn to build on. They had come to the point of realizing that they must move forward for their own health and well-being, and the well-being of their children. This personal experience of moving forward from a challenging past is in ways not unlike the evolution involved in developing nursing knowledge. It has been an ANS tradition to regularly feature this issue topic: Critique and Replication. We have asked authors to draw on works previously published in this journal, but to build on and develop new insights, methods, or advances in substance and form. Each of these issues has provided some of the most provocative and important works that we have published over the 29 years of the journal's history. It seemed timely to once again call for this type of manuscript as we move forward into our 30th year of publication. In this issue of the authors have turned to several topics that have represented nursing's most difficult challenges in the past: medicalization, cultural safety, social justice, nursing ethics, quality of life, and adolescent health. Each of the articles included in this issue demonstrates the importance of taking a careful look at what has been accomplished in the past, learning from the relative distance of the present, and bringing forward new insights and understandings in order to move forward. Beverly Hall's response to the article that focuses on her prior work is included in this issue. I invite any reader to also respond to the articles published here, and to extend our discussion in letters for publication in future issues of Advances in Nursing Science. I look forward to hearing from you! Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "Chinn's editorial, “Physiology and the Idea of Holism,”1 raises a perhaps unintended question of what is meant by holism. As Chinn makes a case for the importance of research about physical phenomena for nursing in general and for publication in Advances in Nursing Science in particular, she notes, “… we have consistently reflected an underlying commitment to the fundamental nursing value of holism, calling for works that embrace holistic approaches to the development of nursing knowledge.”1(p287) She goes on to point out that “as nurses and as nurse scholars, all of us have a long tradition of seeking to embrace the whole.”1(p287) The implication I drew from Chinn's editorial is that scholarly work addressing physical phenomena somehow constitutes holism, presumably in combination with “phenomena that are perceived to be outside the realm of the physical.”1(p287) If my interpretation of Chinn's editorial is correct, her notion of holism must be a sum of parts. That notion of holism is consistent with a philosophical position known as the reaction worldview,2 in which people are viewed as bio-psycho-social and, sometimes, spiritual beings. In that worldview, the “bio” part could be construed as physical phenomena. Or, does Chinn mean that each person is made up of physical and some other parts that have meaning only within the context of the whole, such that the whole person cannot be reduced to distinct parts? That notion of holism is in keeping with the reciprocal interaction worldview2 and the totality paradigm.3 What Chinn cannot mean is a holism consistent with the simultaneous action worldview2 and the simultaneity paradigm.3 That is because these two philosophical positions do not permit any consideration of parts. Rather, human beings are viewed as unitary, more than and different from any sum of parts, and recognized by means of patterns of behavior. I certainly agree with Chinn that nurses seek “to embrace the whole.”1(p287) However, I think it is very important that each one of us is clear about what we mean by the whole, what notion of holism we embrace. One notion is not any better than another but they are different, and they lead to very different approaches to theoretical and empirical scholarship and to practice.

The highly visible and dramatic moments leading to the medical diagnosis create vivid memories and recollections of the experience. Nurses are sometimes involved, but are not major players as the reality of the situation dawns. But as the more tedious, life-shaping experiences of coping, learning, shifting to the reality of the illness unfolds, nurses become more central, more involved. Nurses, in this process, have significant opportunities to provide significant influences that can dramatically shape the experiences of living and dying. Recently, in a doctoral class I taught in Denmark, the members of the class posed the question as to whether I believed there is a universal and fundamental nursing philosophy. There were 4 physicians, 1 occupational therapist, and 6 nurses in the class; therefore, this question held special significance in the group. As we discussed this question, it became quite clear that the fundamental ideas that the nurses brought to the discussion were certainly familiar for those in the class who were not nurses. However, the nurses were consistently able to point to ways in which these ideas shaped their practice in significant ways. The occupational therapist recognized quite clearly how many of these ideas also shaped her practice. The physicians, although familiar with the ideas, expressed a wish that these ideas could have a more central place in their day-to-day practice. Their practice, they recognized, so fully focused on the diagnostic process and medical treatment that they were not able to devote the kind of attention to the experience of the illness itself, which was clearly the focus of the other members of the class. In her book Surviving and Thriving After a Life-Threatening Diagnosis,1 eminent nurse scholar Beverly Hall draws on her own experience as well as her extensive nursing knowledge of health and healing in the face of life-threatening illness. In her introduction to the second section of the book, she summarizes what I believe to be at the heart of a fundamental nursing philosophy: Whether you know it or not, you have always had with you two important sources of healing and comfort. The first is derived from the knowledge and expertise that has always been part of your personal, internal being, and that you will always find when you go inside to gain access to it. The second is the wisdom, healing power, and life-lessons that are yours, without charge, taken from the many spiritual practices available to you.1(p53) Here, Dr Hall reiterates a fundamental premise set forth by Nightingale—a belief that the human body has innate healing capacity. She also draws on nursing's long traditions that promote, encourage, and facilitate the processes of finding strength and wisdom in a person's capabilities to act on his or her own behalf. The challenges of surviving and thriving in the face of a life-threatening diagnosis are far greater than the various medical interventions that are used in treatment of the disease. How individuals and families meet these challenges is at the heart of the experience. The experience is shaped by a multitude of factors, and how people respond is not entirely of one's own choosing. In the absence of a strong presence such as that provided by a talented and wise nurse, people can flounder in a hopeless abyss of despair and fear. But the experience can become, as one of the reviewers of Hall's book notes, a wake-up call to live life to the fullest. Nurses have the opportunity each day to bring this possibility to reality. As you read the articles included in this issue of ANS, you will recognize these fundamental threads that shape the powerful presence of nursing in the challenges surrounding life-threatening illness. It is my hope that you will find ways to bring these possibilities more fully into nursing practice in very real ways. Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN, Editor",

    "abstract": "COMMENT ON: GENOCIDE RAPE TRAUMA MANAGEMENT Dear Editor, This letter is in response to the January-March 2018 article “Genocide Rape Trauma Management: An Integrated Framework for Supporting Survivors.” I found this article to be inspiring and beneficial because it contains important ideas that can empower women and possibly save lives. This article promotes emotional healing for women who have been brutally raped through medical care and women's support groups. However, as helpful as support groups can be, sometimes women do not want to talk about their feelings as it brings back traumatizing memories. As health care professionals, we need to empower women so that they feel a sense of control. We need to provide women with a sense of physical self-empowerment and such can be accomplished through self-defense training. According to the article, over the past several years, Rwanda's Ministry of Health has partnered with major organizations and initiatives, such as Partners in Health and the Human Resources for Health Program, to improve access to and delivery of health care services, increase quality of their education, and empower Rwandan health services while decreasing dependence on foreign aid.1 As they are improving socioeconomically and politically, the women are still struggling with their mental health and well-being. Providing genocide rape victims with a self of physical empowerment may be the first step in improving their overall health and well-being. As a Muslim refugee, my family and I escaped from the Yugoslavian War where there was genocide in Srebrenica as per the Bosnian Serb forces; they were sent out to ethnically cleanse our area. Although I personally did not experience or witness genocidal rape, I experienced fear and trauma from such an experience. I personally have experienced my own self-healing through self-defense training. I have been participating in the sport of karate and am presently a member of the US women's karate team. Self-defense training teaches women to set healthy emotional and physical boundaries. Self-defense training is also linked to psychological benefits for survivors of sexual trauma.2 It is stated, “Genocide rape trauma was expressed in terms of unbearable moments, overwhelming feelings, a sense of hopelessness, somatic distress, negative self-image, and altered intimate relationships and social isolation. These psychological troubles are exacerbated by poor physical health.”2(p49) In the article, there was a concept of self-help strategies that include writing in a journal or a prayer, but imagine how being in physical shape can benefit. Being in physical shape can benefit these women who have been through a lot, and they can use exercise and self-defense training to deal with posttraumatic stress disorder or depression. Incorporating physical movement to help the brain! Physical movement can stimulate the brain and increase dopamine and serotonin levels. Dopamine increases enjoyment, whereas serotonin improves willpower, motivation, and mood. In addition, self-defense training helps increase self-esteem, increase perceptions of internal control, and decreases perceptions of external control.2 Imagine being in control of your body, not feeling vulnerable, and feeling empowered because you know how to defend yourself physically? Being a part of the US national karate team, I am a firm believer that self-defense training is extremely important, especially because I am a woman. I travel the world not only doing the sport I love but also showing all the women out there you can express yourself with action and not with words or tears. Women who have experienced genocidal rape need to realize that their gender does not define who they are. They need to realize that they are in control of what they think and do with their body. Self-defense training is a catalyst to “preserve, protect, and promote human dignity.”2(p44) As the nursing theory states, women should also be able to feel strong and confident in their own body. For those suffering from genocidal rape, a combination of both mental and physical empowerment would make for a more effective treatment approach. —Ena Latic, BS Health Studies Utica College Utica, New York [email protected]",

    "abstract": "THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER When I was an undergraduate student at the University of Hawaii (UH) in the early 1960s, one of the lessons that were imprinted on us was the importance of believing the patient, of understanding that the patient's perceptions were that person's truth. Our curriculum was modeled after that of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA)—a program led by the great Lulu Wolf Hassenplug. The UCLA faculty and students at the time included key figures who would become leaders in the development of nursing knowledge—Dorothy Johnson, Sister Callista Roy, and Betty Neuman.1 My senior medical-surgical instructor, Noreen Meinhart, had just completed her master's degree in nursing at the UCLA, along with her close friend and classmate Afaf Meleis. In the UH curriculum, consistent with the emerging ideas of the UCLA faculty, the principles of psychiatric/mental health nursing were integrated throughout each and every course—both didactic and clinical—and so the message of understanding, and believing, the patient's perspective was thoroughly engrained in our thinking. At the same time, we were taught, and expected to apply in practice, certain scientific facts and theories—those principles underlying the best of nursing practice as presented in our main text—the Principles and Practices of Nursing by Bertha Harmer and Virginia Henderson.2 We acquired the ability to balance a respect for the person's own perceptions and truth, while at the same time bringing to the situation our understanding and appreciation of scientific facts and theories. We learned, in essence, the distinction between “truth” and “fact,” and how to assess the validity of each. Understanding the complex realm of truth was especially meaningful to me, having grown up in the midst of multiethnic children where perceptions of the world—what is right, good, proper, or acceptable—often differed vastly from the norms of my white, southern parents. From an early age, I observed the contradictions between the norms of my parents and those of the local people we were living among. I learned to “fit in” to at least 3 or 4 different worlds, realizing that some things were OK and “right” in some contexts, but not in others. I was not exactly confused about the differences, but it was only as a nursing student that I began to understand the critical “truth” that more than one truth can exist at the same time, arising from different contexts and circumstances—differences that are vitally important to health and well-being for individuals, and for the communities in which we live. Much later, as I grappled with various philosophic perspectives on the nature of truth, these early “lessons” began to take on even more significance. I had learned early in life to appreciate and tolerate ambiguity and complexity, even welcome it. But I was always aware of even my own tendencies to seek certainty, for relatively simple models and constructions to help make sense of the world. These tensions are not yet fully understood, nor have we, as a society or a discipline, developed widely acknowledged and practiced approaches for constructive ways to integrate and appreciate the wide diversities of experience that are now acknowledged as never before. In our current social context in which there is an unrelenting assault on “truth” and “science” and “facts,” I have thought a lot about these ideas that have formed a thread in my nursing career, and tensions involved in making sense of an increasingly complex world in which competing, divergent, even opposing ideas can and do coexist. It is no wonder that there are those who “blame” universities for confounding the ultimate claims on “truth.” I can appreciate those who are utterly frustrated with the world as it is now—the overwhelming challenge of figuring out what to trust and what not to trust in the overwhelming onslaught of information, the imperative to deal with technology in ways never before imagined, the desire for an imagined past that was simpler, more certain, more comprehensible. For those of us who are engaged in the project of developing nursing knowledge, we must grapple with ways to heal the fractures that have created the challenges of our times if we are to make a lasting and significant contribution to health and healing. The articles in this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) make such contributions—addressing threats to health and well-being created by the complexities of the times in which we now live. We welcome your comments and insights. We feature each article on the ANS Journal blog (https://ansjournalblog.com/), and hope you will follow the blog and participate with your comments. —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "EVIDENCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES Over the past couple of decades, health care disciplines have made major strides to ensure that decisions and actions are based on sound scientific evidence. Nurse scholars, those who provide direct service, administrators, and educators have joined the effort to identify the most reliable and sound scientific evidence available to inform practice. In addition, there have been discussions and debates about various meanings of “evidence”—what counts as evidence, how to deal with situations for which there is no evidence of any kind, the role of experience and clinical “know-how,” and how best to determine outcomes. Then enter the current climate of public discourse—a climate that casts doubt on science as a legitimate means of investigation and that questions the very definition of what counts as “fact.” Of course, it is very difficult, often impossible, to unequivocally establish a “fact,” even in the case of eyewitness accounts. But when it comes to evidence that shapes the very act of nursing care, nurses must rely on not only the conclusions but also the soundness of the methods used to arrive at those conclusions. The scholars and the practitioners of the discipline can, and should, have lively debates about the soundness of method and the conclusions reached. But ultimately in the moments of caring practice, nurses are faced with making the best choices possible, informed by knowledge of the science and by knowledge of the particular situation of the moment. As Thorne and Sawatzky1 explained, nursing is situated in particular situations that are complex, demanding not only empiric knowledge that provide scientific evidence on which practice is based but also ethical, aesthetic, personal, and emancipatory insights. Expert practice decisions and actions rest on a complex web that brings together all forms of knowing and understanding—each element of which has similar but distinct foundations of reliability and validity. These similar foundations require dialogue and debate among members of the discipline, corroboration that unveils patterns of consistency (or lack thereof), and dogged due diligence that reveals not only consistency but also important variations in underlying patterns. This issue of Advances in Nursing Science carries on the journal traditions of critical examination of the status quo and offering alternative approaches that might move in the direction of better informed practice based on sound and reliable scholarship. We encourage all readers to enter in discussion about the articles offered here—discussion among your own local network and beyond. These discussions lead to the next steps in the ongoing pursuit of the best evidence and insights that are so vital to the best quality of care. —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "DIETARY CULTURE OR DIETARY BEHAVIOR? A CRITICAL ANALYSIS IN RESPONSE TO THE PUBLISHED ARTICLE: “DIETARY CULTURE: A CONCEPT ANALYSIS” To the Editor, It is with great interest that I read and present this critical analysis based on the article, titled “Dietary Culture: A Concept Analysis,” by Elise A. Mollohan, published 2018, in the journal of Advances in Nursing Science. The article analyzed the concept of dietary culture in the context of nursing discipline, with the aim of increasing understanding of the interrelationships between diet, culture, and cardiovascular health. The knowledge gap in this context was identified as lack of published analysis of the concept of dietary culture in the nursing literature despite its importance in promoting healthy diet and cardiovascular health. The analysis presented in the article is meaningful to the nursing research and practice in promoting dietary habits that improve cardiovascular health outcomes, and I suppose this knowledge can be extended to other health problems. Using Walker and Avant's1 method of concept analysis, the author defined dietary culture as “patterned group eating behaviors that are unconsciously influenced and socially organized.”2(pE10) The article also methodically established the antecedents, attributes, and the consequences for the concept of dietary culture. The attributes of the dietary culture were identified as follows: patterned group eating behaviors, unconscious influence, and social organization. The antecedents are necessity, practicality, availability, economic resources, and culinary tradition. The consequences identified are food choice, nourishment, government guidelines, health status, and belongingness. For this critical analysis, I begin with remarks on notable ideas from the author's viewpoints and then proceed to present some important dimensions to outline where the analysis of dietary culture, as presented by Mollohan, seems inadequate to explain the relevance and utilities of dietary factors in nursing science, practice, and intervention. KEY HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ARTICLES The author made a number of important points that deserve further exploration. First is that concept is not static, it evolves “with time, context, and paradigm.”2(pE2) This calls for the need to constantly reevaluate the meaning of a concept as knowledge grows in the discipline, depending on the state of science and the expansion of knowledge in the field. As proposed by Rodgers and Knafl,3 concept development must continuously be a contextual process, with no realistic end point, until its significance diminishes. For instance, the concept of culture can evolve as a result of multiple factors interacting in a complex fashion.4,5 The Figure is a hypothetical illustration of culture development as a continuous cycle of 3 core stages connected with multiple interacting factors. An incumbent culture may be disrupted by its own consequences and/or external factors to create the desire for a new social norm. At the onset of a new social norm, several forces external to the group/people can facilitate the antecedents of a new norm and contribute to its form and acceptability. With time, the new norm is adopted and becomes the prevailing culture while the previous culture goes into extinction. And the cycle can repeat over and over.Figure: Hypothetical illustration of culture life cycle.The second point is the observation that the term “dietary culture” “was not found in any nursing publication.”2(pE2) Lack of published work on dietary culture in nursing science is quite surprising. For many years, several health promotion interventions have emphasized food-based solutions,6 and yet there are no published works on the concept of dietary culture from nursing science until now. It is then logical to ask whether those food-based interventions are based on thorough nursing science understanding. For effective food-based caring, deep understanding of dietary culture should be a priority for nursing science and practice. And again, the attribute of dietary culture as a socially organized concept, “generated from social construction and interaction around what, how, and when members of a particular culture eat,”2(pE4) suggests a notion that dietary culture is a characteristic of a group, community, society, or population with common beliefs and social norms, which may be applicable to population health. Understanding the dietary culture of a population could provide insight into the dominant eating pattern among a population and how it relates to a prevailing health issue. DIETARY CULTURE OR DIETARY BEHAVIOR? One major caveat of the Mollohan2 analysis is concerning the narrow scope of the concept as defined in the article. Culture is a complex dynamic concept.4,5 Setting an encompassing boundary where culture and diet are defined in a way that is relevant and useful for effective health promotion requires further research. Here, I make a case for why the analysis in the article should be extended to a broader concept of dietary behavior. First, the use of culture in the analysis seems to contextualize dietary culture as a social norm attributable to a group or a community where an individual can derive certain behavioral traits. Dietary culture as defined by the author emphasized group and social influence that patterns individual subconscious behavior. In this regard, dietary culture could be termed as an external socioecological factor that influences an individual eating behavior. It is arguable that an individual's eating behavior is an expression of complex interplay between personal attributes and external factors (including dietary culture). As noted by the author, complex interplay of factors underlies the philosophical assumptions of dietary culture. Thus, there is need for expanded knowledge scope to better understand the association between diet and a health problem. From philosophical standpoint, a broader analysis of “dietary behavior” that elucidates complex intrapersonal and external socioecological factors would be more valuable to the nursing science and practice. As stated earlier, dietary behavior is a broader concept that relates to both intrapersonal and external factors that influence eating behavior. This level of analysis can provide a better understanding for health promotion. To support this argument, one can point to where the author alluded to two contradictory philosophical paradigms of Freewill and Determinism. Freewill is a core component of neoliberalism, which is an ideology that is deeply embedded in the philosophy of individualism and the free market.7–9 Freewill allows individuals to make a free choice in the market system and take responsibility for the consequences of their choices.7,8 One can then argue that dietary behavior in the United States is heavily influenced by neoliberal ideology. We see elements of this among poorly resourced communities where people have succumbed to poor dietary behavior imposed by low socioeconomic status, poor working conditions, and overwhelming targeted advertisement of less healthy foods.7 The consequence is that the native dietary culture of a community can be suppressed by an imposed eating behavior.7,8 This can also be seen in the influence of globalization on the dietary behavior of certain world population.10 For example, a demographic group in a South Asian or West African community with distinct dietary culture may develop appetite for foreign meals due to the perception that eating such meals is an indication of higher social ladder. While the group may still identify with its native dietary culture, the dominant eating behavior is dictated by the general impression of the foreign meal. Finally, the discussion on relevance and implications for nursing science and practice highlights how an understanding of the defining attributes, antecedents, and consequences could help nurses and health care profession to improve healthy eating and cardiovascular health promotion. However, the complexity of eating behavior demands a more robust analysis not limited to culture alone. Nurses and health care professionals will be well equipped to guide dietary counseling when they have a broader understanding of factors underpinning the dietary behavior of a group or individuals. —Oluwatosin O.

    "abstract": "DEMYSTIFYING SCHOLARSHIP Recently members of the Advisory Board engaged in a lively e-mail discussion focused on the tensions involved in demystifying scholarship. The shared interest was to find ways to encourage the ANS audience to debate the challenges involved in maintaining high standards of scholarship while presenting scholarly work in accessible, interesting, and engaging ways for students and for practicing nurses. The ANS Author's Guide contains the following brief description of the writing style that we encourage: ANS insists on readability addressed to a wide audience. The tone of the article should be scholarly but not “stiff.” The approach should be both informative and interpretive with some emphasis given to the implications of information presented and to the provision of fresh insights. First person pronouns are acceptable for manuscripts that require an active author's voice. (http://ans-info.net/ANSathgd.htm#WritingStyle) Still, ANS, like many other scholarly journals, tends to be viewed as far removed from the venues we most need to reach—the realms of practice, the classrooms in which students learn, and the many places where healthcare policies are discussed and debated. Contrary to a popular misconception, these venues and the realm of scholarship are not separate entities. But the perception persists, and we remain committed to doing what we can to overcome the barriers that prevent scholarship from being accessible, even vitally important. Members of the Advisory Board have started the discussion to focus our attention on this concern. Here are some excerpts: I have talked with many faculty and students here who are terrified to submit anything to ANS because they do not believe they have a firm enough grasp on theory as it is often presented in many feminist and critical texts. [Recently students confided] to me that they were so afraid of not being seen as scholarly enough by their faculty if they did not continuously speak in “high scholar” language. We talked about the pros/cons of what this meant to their desire to work with women outside of and across the academe … the role of “theoretical discourse” and “scholarly language” in promoting and hindering nursing's agenda of better health for all and bringing all involved groups to the table. ANS is often held up as the “gold standard” of theory and methodological debate and is seen as daunting for students and practicing nurses. Having a paper published in ANS is the highlight of a career! While I wouldn't like to lose that, there is a place for demystifying and simplifying theoretical language. What is nagging at me is that it seems sometimes we endorse the idea that theoretical/philosophical language has to be, has to remain, difficult. I agree it's hard, but I feel an obligation to bring students to the “region of experience” where we can talk meaningfully about these things in understandable language… We need to strive for clarity in our writing and the manuscripts selected for ANS. The highest priority for me is the leadership the journal provides in pushing forward the frontiers of the discipline. Maybe we need more dialogue to clarify our values and to find ways to include as many scholars as possible in the mission of the journal. Sometimes language and style that seems mystifying turns out to have incredible clarity once the standpoint from which writing is accomplished comes clearer. So [more] dialogue about issues related to whether something is scholarly or simply mystified, … and why, should be of interest to the professional community especially in the context of “evidence.” I like the distinction between scholarship and mystification. Sometimes scholarship aims to de-mystify while at others, mystification is misrepresented as scholarship. We invite ANS readers to join in this discussion. Please send your comments and letters to [email protected]. We will continue this important discussion in future issues of ANS.",

    "abstract": "INTERSECTIONS OF THOUGHT AND PRACTICE In my experience, when words like “philosophy” and “ethics” come up in casual conversation, eyes glaze over and the conversation either takes another turn or stops altogether! But when this issue topic was posted as a forthcoming issue topic for Advances in Nursing Science ANS,), it brought forth a substantial number of manuscripts—many of which have close connections to the “real” worlds of nursing practice and research. It is no surprise to me that nurses make this important and essential link between the world of thought and the world of practice. Nurses are extremely “practical.” I often have graduate students describe in some detail how difficult it is for them to grasp abstract and theoretical concepts and ideas, only to find that in actuality, they fully grasp theoretical meanings, and actually use theoretical ideas in practice. Until the theory course in which we have had these discussions, they had not recognized that what they did and how they thought were so integrally intertwined. Philosophy in its most fundamental meaning is the thinking that underpins human behavior and experience. This fundamental meaning is evident in this issue of ANS, and the articles in this issue bring to light the importance of the study of philosophy in understanding our practices as nurses and researchers. Several of these articles illustrate how a deliberately assumed pattern of thought can shape and mold practice. Others illustrate the influence of hidden or implicit patterns of thought on human experience. Still others illustrate the tensions that exist between different world views, and between that which we seek in our practice and that which is actually practiced. The response to this issue topic also represented to me the extent to which nurse scholars are engaging in work that has profound, simultaneous implications for nursing knowledge development and the evolution of nursing practice. We received an unusually large number of manuscripts for this issue topic, prompting a major shift for the journal to both print and online publication. The publisher joined me in wishing to provide a publication avenue for as many of the eligible manuscripts for this important issue as possible, and initiated online publication for ANS. You will find the full list of titles and brief abstracts in the table of contents for both the print and online articles, and all of these articles are fully indexed for accessibility. All of the manuscripts underwent the customary peer review process required for publication in ANS, and all of the manuscripts were carefully revised in response to the recommendations of reviewers. Our “mental model” of scholarly publication may not have yet fully incorporated online publication, but this model is stretching, and will be shaped by the continuing quality of work that has characterized ANS since its founding in 1978. This avenue for publication not only provides for publication of works that cannot be incorporated into print but also makes these important works more fully accessible to readers worldwide. To further support online publication, the publisher has introduced online access to individual print subscribers to ANS. Instructions for free access are available at the journal's Web site www.advancesinnursingscience.com. I hope you will visit, and use, both the ANS print and online issues, which are archived as far back as 1995. Contact me at [email protected] with your comments and responses; I look forward to hearing from you! Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN",

    "abstract": "WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT STONEWALL This issue of ANS represents a turning point to remedy the neglect of sexual and gender minority groups—cultures in their own right. The issue includes 2 articles addressing nursing and health care needs of these groups. In this Guest Editorial, Drs Dorsen and Caceres call for an end of the long-standing neglect of and discrimination against people who identify as LGBTQ+. The name “Stonewall” may not be familiar to you. Or, perhaps, you know that it is somehow related to the struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBTQ+) equality but are not sure how. If you are like most nurses, you probably don't know why this event, celebrating its 50th anniversary this month, is considered one of the most significant moments in LGBTQ+ history. It is time for that to change. It is time for that to change. The Stonewall Riots took place in New York City in June 1969 after a routine raid of the Stonewall Inn, a bar in Greenwich Village frequented by gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, drag queens, street youth, and transgender persons. Raids at that time were common practice—it was illegal to be LGBTQ+ or to serve liquor to LGBTQ+ persons. Homosexuality was considered a mental illness and was listed as such in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The FBI kept track of suspected LGBTQ+ persons, and exposure could lead to harassment, arrest, loss of employment, and loss of family. Known LGBTQ+ gathering spots were frequent targets of law enforcement—police arrested patrons and employees, and newspapers often printed the names of those arrested the following day. But in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, the LGBTQ+ community at the Stonewall Inn, emboldened by the civil rights struggles of Black Americans, women, and other oppressed groups, fought back against harassment and injustice. Six days of riots followed, and the LGBTQ+ equality movement was born.1 We don't routinely teach the history of civil rights struggles in nursing, but we should. As you will read in this special edition of Advances in Nursing Science, focusing on culture, race, and discrimination, current and historical experiences of stigma and marginalization deeply affect all aspects of health, from access to and utilization of care to risk and risk behaviors to disease patterns and outcomes. This is certainly true for LGBTQ+ populations. Research suggests that the LGBTQ+ community has inequities in mental health, substance use, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers and experience significant social disadvantage, with higher rates of poverty, un- and underemployment, and housing instability than the general population.2 These disparities appear to be consistent across countries and social contexts. Certain subgroups of the LGBTQ+ community, including LGBTQ+ people of color, LGBTQ+ people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ immigrants and refugees, experience even greater inequities. Perceived and enacted stigma are to blame, including that of nurses who may lack basic knowledge about LGBTQ+ culture and health needs and may harbor implicit or explicit bias.3 To fight injustice, we need to educate ourselves, have hard conversations about our own privilege and power, and consider how our actions and attitudes may contribute to both lessening and perpetuating health inequities. Although the Stonewall Riots occurred 50 years ago, there is still work to be done. It is illegal to be LGBTQ+ in approximately 70 countries; in over a dozen, being LGBTQ+ is a crime punishable by death.4 And even in relatively socially progressive countries, including much of Europe, Canada, and the United States, LGBTQ+ people continue to face significant discrimination in areas such as housing, employment, and health care. We are only beginning to understand how social inequity influence the health of LGBTQ+ populations and their encounters with health care professionals. As nurses who pride ourselves on expertly caring for diverse populations, we need to hold each other accountable to learn the history of struggle and resilience of marginalized groups and to thoughtfully consider how stigma and discrimination continue to impact the health and well-being of many of us. As the largest health care profession in the world, nurses are in the perfect position to advocate for LGBTQ+ persons and lessen health inequities in this vulnerable population. But first we need to talk. We need to talk about how LGBTQ+ marginalization impacts the communities we serve and members of our profession. We need to talk about Stonewall. —Caroline Dorsen, PhD, RN, FNP-BC Assistant Professor NYU Meyers College of Nursing New York Nursing Chair GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBT Equality —Billy Caceres, PhD, RN, AGPCNP-BC Postdoctoral Research Fellow Columbia University School of Nursing and the Program for the Study of LGBT Health, New York City, New York",

    "abstract": "PRAXIS In April 1988, Volume 10:3 of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) focused on the theme “Theory and Practice.” My editorial for that issue was titled “Knowing and Doing” and addressed the disparities inherent in a society that nurtures deep-seated ways of thinking and acting that are diametrically opposed to one another. I noted then, and am still convinced, that the perennial “theory-practice gap” in nursing is not our own problem alone, nor is it entirely of our own making. The articles that appeared in that classic issue of ANS laid important foundations for moving beyond the splits that persist between the worlds of theory and practice, and they remain as pertinent today as they were in 1988. They included: Scientific inquiry in nursing: A model for a new age, by Holly A. DeGroot Challenging the focus on technology: A Critique of the medical model in a changing health care system, by Janet D. Allan and Beverly A. Hall A case of conflicting paradigms: Nursing and repreductive technology, by Margarete Sandelowski An ethical framework for nursing service administration, by Paula J. Christensen Nursing theory and administrative practice: Agenda for the 1990s, by Bonnie Mowinski Jennings and Afaf Ibrahim Meles Irritable infant syndrome: Theoretical perspectives and practice implications, by Maureen R. Keefe Adolescent hopefulness in illness and health, by Pamela S. Hinds There is an interesting connection and evolution between the contents of this past issue, and the issue now in your hands. The articles in Volume 10:3 reflected an emerging critical consciousness of long-standing assumptions and world views, as well as consciousness of possibilities that for many may have been quite unfamiliar. The articles in this present issue reflect a current and sharp critical awareness of underlying dynamics that shape how we think and what we do, clear allegiances to fundamental nursing values and perspectives, and well well-articulated connections between socially and culturally mediated dynamics that limit the ways we view the world. The possiblities for change that the articles present in this issue of ANS may seem unfamiliar, but open pathways toward bringing together what we know and value at the deepest levels, and the ways we go about the development of nursing practice. These articles open the door to praxis—critical reflection and action to transform the world. It is time to set aside the old perpetual moaning about the gaps between practice and theory, or between practice and research. As the authors of the articles in this issue demonstrate, there are alternatives and possibilities, ways to go about healing the splits. It begins with awareness, and then small and large shifts in thinking and doing.",

    "abstract": "REPLY TO DRS TAM AND GOH: REPLICABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, AND CURRENCY IN NURSING REVIEWS Dear Dr Chinn, We wish to thank Drs Tam and Goh for their response to our article and for their work in the area of the science of reviews. The need for replicability, transparency, and currency is important for upholding rigor in nursing reviews. While both of our articles1,2 address the science of reviews, the focus of their article was to examine the time taken between the last search, submission, acceptance, and publication dates of systematic reviews published in nursing journals. In contrast, our article examined the characteristics of nurse-led reviews and was guided by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.3 Because of the differing foci, we discourage direct comparisons between each article. Instead, we think that both articles can help authors, reviewers, and editors start to ameliorate issues central to the rigor of reviews in nursing. Drs Tam and Goh's suggestion that the use of the PRISMA guidelines to report only systematic reviews and meta-analyses is too narrow of a view and may be detrimental to improving the science of reviews in nursing. The PRISMA guidelines may be used as applicable, with other types of reviews such as integrative reviews and scoping reviews4 to ensure completeness of reporting. At the very least, these guidelines can bring some standardization to reporting the search process among reviews. An increasing number of publishers have accepted PRISMA as a comprehensive reporting guideline since the guidelines were disseminated in 2009.5 Furthermore, some journals have started to encourage or even require authors to complete the PRISMA checklist for relevant reviews. Both of our articles highlight the need for accuracy of reporting in reviews. Explicit documentation of search strategies used in systematic and integrative reviews has a significant role in the quality assessment and reproducibility of reviews. We concluded that transparent search strategies are not consistently documented in nursing reviews. Our 2 articles differ in focus related to search date information provided in a review. As noted in Tam and Goh's response, our findings revealed that several reviews reported end dates of searches as “to present.” Our review was concerned with the impact of this phrase on reproducibility of the search, not of timeliness of search date and publication. We agree that results can certainly become obsolete by the time a paper goes to press. However, thorough reporting of search criteria and methods is crucial for a number of reasons so that other researchers may (1) evaluate the quality of a search (eg, ensure the review was truly systematic and not based on hand-picked articles), and (2) conduct subsequent reviews of the topic at a later date, starting where the prior review left off. Going forward, journal editors and reviewers should encourage authors to thoroughly report methods used. Thank you again for your work in this area and for your interest in our article. —Coleen E.

    "abstract": "RE: “ADVANCING NURSING SCIENCE THROUGH COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARDS” Dear Editor, The recent publication of “Advancing Nursing Science Through Community Advisory Boards: Working Effectively Across Diverse Communities” provided an insightful perspective on both the utilitarian and ethical values of community advisory boards (CABs) in research with vulnerable populations.1 The move across our discipline toward a greater valuing of the voices of those whom we seek to study is an important step in ensuring the maximization of positive impact and simultaneous minimization of negative impact.1 The article provides relevant guidance to researchers beginning work with CABs, while also updating the scientific literature to incorporate the experience and wisdom from many successful CAB partnerships throughout recent years. Despite the great value of this article to the current standards of research engagement with vulnerable populations, there is an unaddressed theoretical assumption regarding power dynamics in the researcher-researched relationship. Throughout descriptions of each of the 5 components of community-engaged research2 presented, there is little attention given to the rationale for each of these elements. Within the elaboration upon “Incorporating real power sharing,” specifically, one would expect an explicit recognition of the well-documented inherent power imbalance that favors the researcher3–5. There is, however, no clear acknowledgment of the inherent power differential between the researcher and the researched that the CAB seeks to overcome. Drawing from the work of Wallerstein,6 explicit address of this power differential can be a powerful tool in working toward shared power. As is made clear in that work,6 there must be a restructuring of inherent power dynamics to establish an equitable and mutually beneficial partnership.1 This restructuring necessarily begins, however, with the realization that researcher-initiated projects, by nature, favor the researcher.5,6 I do not claim here that the authors ignore this power differential in practice. The provided vignettes, specifically The Workplace Violence Community Advisory Board, are clear evidence that power relations are taken into account.1 However, to forgo explicit address of power imbalance in the proliferation of a framework for other researchers is to run the risk of false impression for those only novice in community-based work. Without emphasizing understanding of power dynamics that rationalize collaboration with a CAB, one may falsely believe a CAB to be a tool to enhance or clarify the researcher's work, rather than as an effort to correct historic power discrepancies.6,7 Recent research by Jamshidi et al4 illuminates the potential for negative effects in poorly conceived community-based participatory approaches to investigation. Participants made it clear that the use of a community-based framework does not immediately resolve issues of power.4 Furthermore, members of poorly executed community involvement efforts are described as perceiving their inclusion to be tokenism, rather than a true effort at sharing power.4 Explicit recognition of imbalanced power is discussed as an approach for resolving this concern.4 Resituating the components of effective work with CABs within explicit recognition of power imbalance in the researcher-CAB relationship would allow for a more thorough presentation of the importance and necessary operation of CABs. Through this lens, researchers who are just beginning to work with CABs will have an accurate understanding of the true purpose of CAB involvement.6,7 This view also provides proper warning of the potential for negative outcomes and the responsibility that all researchers have to correct for this imbalance in their work.4 Furthermore, explicit acknowledgment of this dynamic, in turn, acknowledges the often unrewarded labor endeavored by many researchers of vulnerable populations to restructure such dynamics. I hope to express a small amount of the great deal of thankfulness owed to these researchers. The researchers published here are to be thanked not only for this presently discussed article but also for their efforts to ensure that community engagement and involvement in the research process become standard practice. Even the critique presented here would not be possible without the authors' former efforts to promote the conversation about community representation in nursing research.

    "abstract": "THE TIME FOR NURSING ACTIVISM Given the global, social, political, and environmental climates of our time, and the many threats inherent in social determinants of health, the urgency for nurses to step up and let our voices be heard, and our leadership be exerted, to do all things possible on behalf of human health and well-being. I know from personal encounters that there are nurses who believe that nurses and nursing organizations should remain disconnected from politics, but this perspective is rapidly evaporating as the urgency becomes more and more clear with each passing day. In fact, it is becoming clear that when nurses do step up and speak up, we bring vitally important perspectives to the table, and our voices count in significant ways in the long term. Politics is the process of enacting certain values in a social context. There is no organized entity, and no person who can remain disconnected from that which is political. Not speaking up, and not taking a stand, is in itself a political act that renders a “vote” for the status quo. Clearly, not everyone can or will or should enter “politics” in a formal way as an elected or appointed public official. But everyone actually does perform political acts each and every day—we make choices about what we purchase from whom, what we read, who we listen to, and how we spend our time. Each of these acts reveals the values that we are enacting. The communities in which we live and work shape, and are shaped by, our words and actions. In a very real way, we are political. People who are nurses also have a certain privilege, ability, and knowledge that place us on a stage to enact values related to health and well-being and to influence the collective actions that shape health and well-being in our communities. Even when nurses believe they are not “political,” by virtue of being a nurse and interacting with others as a nurse, they are contributing to the political landscape of the communities in which they live and work. Activism is the act of taking that influence one step further—taking informed, deliberate actions to bring nursing values into the public sphere in ways that challenge the status quo that threatens human health and well-being. Activism is never motivated by the desire for fame or fortune. In fact, activist nurses typically think of what they are doing as simply doing what needs to be done in order to improve the health and well-being of people who need what nurses can offer. When nurses take their insights and knowledge into a public sphere by speaking and writing in venues that reach a broader public, they broadcast ideas grounded in nursing values. When nurses conduct research and publish their findings, their ideas have a significant influence wherever nurses practice, teach, or engage in forming professional and public policy. When nurses join together, either in formal organizations or as informal networks of support, the potential for change that promotes and protects health and well-being multiplies exponentially. In this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS), 2 articles focus specifically on the context of crime and justice, where simply engaging with these issues as nurses is a significant form of activism. All of the articles you will find here reflect a commitment to nursing perspectives that emphasize the values of health and well-being. We invite you to follow the ANS blog at https://ansjournalblog.com/, where we feature each of the articles and publish messages authors provide that describe their work and ways in which their ideas emerged. We welcome your responses, contributing to the discourses that inform nursing knowledge, and, ultimately, nursing actions that contribute to our communities. —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "PEER REVIEW AND WHY IT IS ESSENTIAL As this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) goes to press, the fifth annual peer review week is underway—a relatively new global event that celebrates and promotes best practices in peer review that happens in the second week of September. During this week, there are virtual and in-person events focused on 4 main purposes: To emphasize the central role peer review plays is scholarly communication To showcase the work of editors and reviewers To share research and advance best practices To highlight the latest innovation and applications Many of the resources, presentations, and videos produced for this event are retained and accessible for all, providing year-round resources to help people worldwide participate in efforts to improve peer review and learn peer review best practices. One of the resources I encourage ANS readers to explore is the YouTube Peer review week channel—https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmYfn4oBs5a084aOu-ph-g Although there have been challenges to the traditions of peer review, and it arguably does not always “work” the way it is intended, the very large global community of scholars that participate in the annual peer review week recognize that it has been well demonstrated to be essential to maintaining quality and validity of scientific scholarly publications. These scholars are committed to efforts to improve transparency, diversity, and quality of peer review processes, and to promote ways to recognize those who contribute their time and expertise in the peer review process. One critical feature of peer review that assures quality in the process is the fact that peer reviewers are volunteers—they contribute to this process without compensation, assuring that they do not bring a conflict of interest to their reviews based on influence or coercion from the publisher or the editor. The selection of peer reviewers also takes into consideration the possibility of other forms of conflict of interest—close working relationships between reviewers and authors, or known bias that might unduly influence the judgment of the peer reviewer. ANS has an impressive panel of peer reviewers, all of whom are recognized on the ANS website here—https://journals.lww.com/advancesinnursingscience/Pages/reviewpanel.aspx. This past year we also launched a peer review mentoring program, which provides early career scholars an opportunity to work with a seasoned ANS peer reviewer to learn about the peer review process in general, and to start participating as a peer reviewer with the guidance and encouragement of their mentor. If you are interested in participating in this program, download the program description here—https://advancesinnursingscienceblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/ans-mentoring-plan-updated-2019-01-25.pdf. This is also available from the sidebar of the ANS Journal Blog here—https://ansjournalblog.com/ Reflecting on this process, and the vital role that it plays in assuring the quality of the journal content, I extend my deep appreciation to each of the dedicated individuals who provide this invaluable service for ANS! You are superb, dedicated, and tireless reviewers. Without you, ANS could not be what it is today! —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "CORRESPONDENCE TO “CHARACTERISTICS OF REVIEWS PUBLISHED IN NURSING LITERATURE: A METHODOLOGICAL REVIEW” BY TORONTO AND COLLEAGUES Dear Editor, We would like to thank Dr Toronto and her colleagues1 who conducted a very important study in examining the methodological quality of integrative and systematic reviews identified from Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) database. They evaluated the reviews according to the selected items in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and found that the compliance rates of different items in PRISMA statement ranged from 14% to 77%, with a median of 36%. We are particularly interested in item 7 in the PRISMA statement on whether the last searched dates were specified. Although the trends of reporting the last searched dates had increased from 5% in 2013 to 28% in 2015, only 14% of the included reviews in Toronto and colleagues1 did so. Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to share some recently published work on the topic among systematic reviews that were published in nursing journals identified from the Nursing category in the Journal Citation Reports (Science Edition).2 Of the 202 systematic reviews published in 2014, 172 (85.1%) and 155 (74.8%) provided the last search dates up to the year and month, respectively. Direct comparisons between the Toronto and colleagues study and these results may not be appropriate, as the authors included only systematic reviews and were limited to nursing journals within the Journal Citation Reports whereas Toronto and colleagues included interdisciplinary journals. Furthermore, PRISMA is often specified as the guideline for systematic reviews but not in integrative or other type of reviews. For example, the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) network recommends only systematic reviews to follow PRISMA guideline, but none of the 376 guidelines were related to integrative reviews (http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/). Toronto and colleagues1 also mentioned in their discussion that several studies used the word “to present” in specifying the time frame. They explained that such wording may be misleading, as it could be years before the actual publication. In fact, it was reported that the median time difference between the last searched and full publication date was 669 days (∼1.8 years).2 In addition, Palese et al3 reported that the time taken to publish a research article in nursing journals took an average of 981 days from the end of data collection to either online or hardcopy publication. By providing this information, we hope readers will get a broader perspective on the currentness of the published systematic reviews and improve the quality of such articles published in nursing journals in the longer run. —Wilson Tam, PhD Assistant Professor —Shawn Y.

    "abstract": "RESPONSE TO DIETARY CULTURE OR DIETARY BEHAVIOR? A CRITICAL ANALYSIS To the Editor, Thank you for the opportunity to respond to Oluwatosin Dada's thoughtful discussion of my concept analysis of dietary culture.1 Considering the significant impact of cardiovascular disease on global health, it is of critical importance that nurses and other health care providers engage in scholarly discourse and discovery aimed at promoting heart-healthy dietary change. I appreciate Dada's support for the methodology used in my analysis and for elaborating on selected key points from my work. In critique, Dada asserts that an analysis of dietary behavior would be more useful than dietary culture, favoring dietary behavior as a “broader concept.” I value this opportunity to discuss further the importance of examining the multiple, complex factors that influence diet on a deeper level, rather than from a broad perspective. Dada's primary criticism hinges on the premise of dietary behavior as a more valuable concept to nursing science and practice, citing the “narrow scope” of dietary culture. However, the author does not present a definition of dietary behavior or scientific evidence in support of this claim. Identifying the potential usefulness of defining one concept does not negate the value of defining and understanding other interrelated concepts, particularly within a phenomenon as complex as diet. Defining dietary culture provides a means to delineate it from other concepts while providing a deeper understanding of its internal structure.2 A recent publication by Marijn Stok et al3 provides support for the conceptual differences between dietary behavior and dietary culture. The authors analyzed dietary behavior because of the “fuzzy” nature of the concept and the lack of a consistent definition across disciplines.3 Dietary behavior is defined in terms of 3 categories, including food choice, eating behavior, and dietary intake/nutrition.3 Within the 3 main categories are 34 terms that provide a taxonomy for the concept. While minor connections to social context and culture are evident within some definitions of the taxonomy terms, culture is not explicitly represented.3 Dietary pattern was identified within the taxonomy and is defined in terms of cultural connections, such as Mediterranean, Western, and Prudent.3 This association supports patterned group eating behaviors as a defining attribute of dietary culture, as identified in the concept analysis.1 Also, the association demonstrates the interrelated nature of dietary behavior and dietary culture, underscoring the importance of differentiating the concepts. The concept analysis of dietary behavior and my analysis of dietary culture are complementary, working together to build a more well-formulated understanding of diet in relation to health. Another critical point raised by Dada is that a dietary behavior analysis would more clearly delineate the complexities of interpersonal and external factors that impact diet. However, dietary behavior conceptually emphasizes the individual aspects of diet.3 Dada asserts that dietary behavior in the United States is heavily influenced by neoliberalism. Individual responsibility and inequality as a consequence of choice are central tenets of neoliberalism.4 Within the lens of neoliberalism, poverty, lack of education, poor diet, and other factors associated with poor health status can be blamed on the individual.4,5 Thus, I would argue that neoliberal philosophy presents a distraction from the reality of external influences on diet, promoting the perception of individual choice based on free will. The concept analysis of dietary culture acknowledges the external influences on individual dietary behaviors in the United States, as discussed within the context of compatibilism.1 Dada further suggests that dietary behavior may better explain the complexities of cultural shifts in dietary pattern, alluding to the westernization of South Asian or West African dietary habits. On the contrary, the evolution of dietary culture is a primary example of why there is a need to understand the concept more clearly. Factors associated with cultural shift are discussed in the background of the original article and can be linked to the antecedents identified on pages E6-E7.1 Availability, economic, resources, and practicality are particularly relevant in this regard. The antecedents of dietary culture are evident in a discussion of trends and determinants of the westernization of Asian diets.6 Pingali6 identified economic growth and associated urbanization as factors that lead to increased access to and affordability of convenience and processed foods. In addition, lifestyle changes have increased the demand for convenience foods and processed foods, which connects with practicality as an antecedent of dietary culture.1,6 Exploring dietary culture in depth provides a framework for understanding the complexity of the cultural impact on diet. Dada and I agree on the importance of this topic to nursing science and practice. We are also in agreement that dietary culture alone cannot fully explain the complexity of diet. There is a need to explore a variety of concepts that relate to diet in further depth to gain a full understanding of the phenomenon. Thus, the specific nature of analyzing dietary culture does not negate its significance to building nursing knowledge. Rather, it provides an in-depth understanding of culture as one key factor that impacts individual dietary behaviors. Researchers commonly explore diet within a broad scope, emphasizing the individual. I contend that continuing to explore diet primarily from a broad lens fails to acknowledge its complexity. Nurse scientists need to build in-depth knowledge and understanding of the multiple factors that contribute to diet to identify strategies and interventions that will accomplish meaningful change to promote improved cardiovascular health. —Elise Mollohan, MSN, RN, CNE PhD in Nursing Candidate The University of Akron Akron, Ohio Professional Instructor Ashland University Ashland, Ohio",

    "abstract": "NURSING KNOWLEDGE IN THE TIME OF A PANDEMIC As this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) goes to press, the world is experiencing the overwhelming experience of a pandemic—a global event that has affected all peoples, all nations, and all communities in dramatic and irreversible ways. While it is still too early to see relevant scholarly articles appearing in journals such as ANS, this event is leaving a significant “mark” on nursing as a practice and as a discipline, and we can anticipate major outcomes in terms of both practice and theory in the months and years ahead. Nonetheless, even the current experience of reading scholarly literature, including the articles in this issue of ANS, will be influenced by the “lens” of this experience. I urge you, as a reader, contemplate the meaning of our shared pandemic experience informed by the legacy of our nursing heritage—the theories, models, and philosophies that form the foundation of our discipline. Since March 24, 2020, the Nursology.net Web site (https://nursology.net/) has provided weekly posts that focus on nursing theories that inform nursing practice during the pandemic. The first of these posts, aptly titled “Your Well-Being as a Nurse and the COVID-19 Pandemic,” by Chloe Litzen foretold the unprecedented challenge that nurses are facing in protecting their own well-being and health as they seek to care for so many seriously ill patients. During the month of May, 2 posts pointed to the significance of Florence Nightingale's insights that are just as pertinent today as when they were first written—a tribute to this in the 200th year since Nightingale's birth. A notable fact about this pandemic for nurses and nursing in the United States is the blatant inequalities in health and health care that are laid bare and that cannot be denied. The disproportionate effect of the virus in disadvantaged communities can no longer be denied, along with irrefutable evidence of the importance of public health policies and practices that are required to address all aspects of a major health crisis. Nursing as a discipline has a long history of commitment to the ideals of public health and illness prevention. It is now time for nurses everywhere—practitioners, scholars, administrators, policy makers, and students, to step up and work with the hosts of others worldwide to change the course of this pandemic. As we move through this experience, we will gain insights and develop new ways of addressing a challenge such as this. Nursing will never be the same, but we have a firm foundation on which to build! —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "Addressing Systemic Racism in Scholarly Publishing At this moment in history, when the hundreds-year long pandemic of racism seems to be coming to a point of reckoning, significant numbers of individuals and groups are turning away from denial and examining ways in which systemic racism is sustained, even promoted. The industry of scholarly publishing, in which Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) is included, is no exception. While ANS has a long tradition of being at the forefront in publishing articles addressing racism and all other forms of “isms” embedded in the fabric of society, we have yet to make a public declaration of editorial policy related to overcoming systemic racism. Bringing this matter to the forefront is long overdue but made possible in this moment by activism and resources that have emerged in the larger community of scholarly publishing.1,2 At the annual meeting of the advisory board this year, we will examine our policy and develop formal antiracism policy and action. The following will serve as a basis for this discussion, including: Develop guidelines for authors related to justification for inclusion of race as a concept/variable in their work. Require that when race is included, that racism is named and integrated with other intersecting forms of oppression such as gender, sexuality, income, and religion. Ensure that any inclusion of race does not explicitly or implicitly suggest a genetic interpretation, particularly when there is a focus on health disparities or inequities. Strengthen the presence of people who identify as BILNOC (Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and other nurses of color) as members of the Advisory Board, the Review Panel, and contributing authors. Consider actions to ensure that works published by those who identify as BILNOC are appropriately recognized and cited in ANS content. Include specific criteria for review that ensures that the reviewer has addressed the possibility of embedded systemic racism in content submitted to the journal and to give constructive guidance to authors for antiracist revision of their work. Encourage works that take an explicit antiracist stance, providing scholarly resources to support antiracism actions in practice, education, administration, and policy making. Racism is a public health issue and has been a public health crisis for decades. It is time to act on every level possible. We welcome all ANS readers to contribute to our ongoing work and to share our dedication to addressing racism in our profession. —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "TRUSTWORTHINESS The current social and political context in which the trustworthiness of everything is under fire leaves “information consumers” wondering how to sort out that which is reliable and sound from that which is questionable at best and utterly false at the worst. As members of the nursing profession, we bear a particular responsibility to know what health-related information is trustworthy and that which is not and, going even further, to be able to speak with authority and credibility, based on specific information and explanations that confirm our assessment of the messages being circulated to the public at large. Our professional education should provide us with the intellectual tools by which to make sound judgments, and our experience in practice gives further insight on which to base our opinions and conclusions. But at this time of increased scrutiny, it is prudent to reflect on the particular ways in which we can ground our confidence regarding sound and reliable information and renew our commitment to develop articulate and compelling messages for our various audiences—including people we care for, students and peers in our own profession, and the broader communities in which we live and work. I have created an acronym—REAL—as a way to review the crucial elements that are vital in sorting out that which is real and valid information from that which is flawed and false. REAL—Resources, Evidence, Alternatives, Logical conclusions: Resources (plural): Know, cite, and affirm the resources that are providing the information that is valid and well-founded. In the realm of scholarly journals and books that are published by reputable publishers, the processes that are used for judging that published content is sound and credible are publicly available so that you can be reasonably sure that the published content is trustworthy. But since any publication can end up with content that can be challenged, corroborate any “facts” with additional sources, be ready to summarize your own conclusions based on information from a number of reliable sources, and justify your conclusions with a sound logic. Evidence: Empirical evidence is essential for “factual” information, but evidence can extend far beyond that which can be known empirically. Even empirical evidence requires good judgment and the wisdom to know how to interpret that evidence. Take into account the perspectives and the circumstances in which good judgment is exercised and the values that underpin the sound interpretation of that which is factually “known.” Alternatives: Be well versed in alternative “facts” that might be circulating about a particular issue or challenge and be prepared to address and put to rest any opinions or beliefs that are patently false or even subject to question. If you are dealing with something that is in a gray zone of uncertainty, be particularly mindful that a position you might put forward may be open to question and provide guidance for your audiences related to the circumstances that might shift your position as more information is available. Logical conclusions: Your own judgment and the basis on which you are basing your conclusions and your recommendations need to be perfectly clear. If you cannot be certain about your own recommendations or interpretations but are compelled to provide your thoughts on a particular matter while you are still uncertain (actually a common situation), be clear and concise about the dilemma at hand and explain what further information or evidence is needed to be able to make a definitive choice. In this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS), you will find a number of articles that deal with the kinds of challenges that professional nurses and other providers face in our daily practices. The authors in this issue explore the kinds of knowledge we need to understand particular health challenges, the lenses that are used in interpreting experiences involved in health and illness, and ways to shape our practices to serve the interests of health and well-being in the face of serious health-related challenges. We invite you, the readers, to participate in discussion of these articles with your colleagues and whenever possible on our ANS blog at https://ansjournalblog.com/! —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "A NURSING THEORY REVIVAL! The year 2019 was a banner year for nursing theory and nursing knowledge development! After several decades of being focused on the development of empirical nursing research, and advances in the development of methods for research, many nurse scholars came to recognize that in this process, the importance of theory and fundamental ideals and values of our discipline had slipped into the background. This drift away from nursing theory was evident in the trend toward eliminating courses and curriculum content focused on nursing theories, and along with this trend a tendency to allow other perspectives to dominate, particularly perspectives derived from a medical model. The fact is that there is nothing inherently “wrong” with medical model perspectives per se, and certainly nurses require a great deal of knowledge and understanding related to medical diagnosis and treatment. But when nursing is dominated by medical concerns, we tend to lose sight of the underlying values that give rise to our most valuable contributions to health care. The growing concern that nursing values were slipping into the background grew from recognition that health care systems were becoming increasingly bereft of a significant concern for people in need—someone who understands their particular situation and can help navigate through their experience. In a word—someone who cares! As this concern grew, groups of nurse leaders established the Nursology.net Web site (https://nursology.net/) and organized 2 landmark conferences that, in turn, gave rise to the establishment of an annual nursing theory conference—to be held in the spring every year! The March 2019 Case Western Reserve nursing theory conference focused on celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first known nursing theory conferences in 1968-1970. The 2019 conference featured presentations by a number of seasoned scholars and doctoral students, discussing the evolution of their theory-related work with an eye toward the future evolution of nursing theory (see https://nursology.net/history/past-nursology-events/a-50-year-perspective-cleveland-oh-march-21-22-2019/). As an outcome of this conference, a group of doctoral students from schools all over the United States organized a Nursology Theory Collective; this group is dedicated to the future of nursing firmly grounded in nursing's most fundamental ideals and values (see https://nursology.net/category/nursology-theory-collective/). Then in November, the King International Nursing Group (K.I.N.G) hosted a collaborative conference sponsored by 11 other nursing theory–related societies and associations (see https://nursology.net/history/past-nursology-events/king-conference-washington-dc-area-november-14-16-2019/). The mission of the Annual Nursing Theory Conference team is as follows: ... to provide a global forum where all nurses can gather to nurture and critique nursing theory, thereby expanding nursing's unique disciplinary knowledge for practice, research, education, and policy. Recognizing that the ultimate purpose of nursing is the improvement of the health and well-being of all people, situated in the wholeness of their system context, we commit to supporting a place for active and equitable theoretical discourse. We value, support, and encourage the diversity of theoretical perspectives in nursing to enhance our unique knowledge base. Grounding us firmly in these tenets, we acknowledge the powerful link between philosophy, theory, research, and social change. (https://nursingtheoryconference.com/about/) The Second Annual Nursing Theory conference is happening just as this issue of Advances in Nursing Science is published—March 20-21, 2020! I invite you to follow the ongoing development of this annual event and participate as you are able! —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "CHANGE AND CONTINUITY IN THE EVOLUTION OF A JOURNAL If you are a regular reader of Advances in Nursing Science you may have noticed that the journal has a new publisher—Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. There are some changes in the interior layout design, and we are undertaking a reorganization of the board of review. The numbering of pages, volumes, and issues has changed so that the issues of each volume extend through a calendar year, and the page numbers extend through the entire volume (as is traditional for scholarly journals). If you have not noticed these changes, it is probably because we have retained the distinctive layout and colors of the cover, symbolic of the long and continuous tradition of excellence that will be maintained for the journal. We will also maintain the ANS tradition of issue topics. We also will maintain an editorial position welcoming ideas and perspectives that are not necessarily in the mainstream. While not all issue topics reflect this commitment, the periodic appearance of topics that call for “out of the ordinary” ideas serve as reminders that this journal welcomes that which stretches beyond what is taken for granted. Issue topics like “Politics of Care,” (Vol 2:3), “Violence, the Family and Society” (Vol 8:4), “Feminism and Nursing,” (Vol 13:3), “Energy and Healing,” (Vol 15:4), and “Aesthetics and the Art of Nursing,” (Vol. 17:1) may or will become widely accepted areas of scholarly inquiry. However, at the time many of the ANS topics are first announced, they create somewhat of a stir, and perhaps some anticipation concerning what might possibly appear in the issue to come. Always there have been nurses who welcome the opportunity that the issue topics offer, and others who are inspired by the ideas and perspectives that an issue topic presents. By periodically featuring the topic “Critique and Replication” we have reinforced the editorial commitment to ideals of critical challenge, insights, reflection, and growth. This issue topic calls for manuscripts that address advances in nursing science based on articles previously published in ANS. This kind of article is not limited to these particular issues, but appears with some regularity. For example, in 1983 an article by Yarling and McElmurry1 titled “The Moral Foundation of Nursing” appeared. By 1988, when we were preparing Vol 11:3 on the topic of “Ethical Issues,” a number of articles had surfaced that in some way responded to, challenged, or extended Yarling and McElmurry's work, several of which were published in ANS. Beverly McElmurry and Roland Yarling prepared a guest editorial for the April 1989 issue in which they reflected on the responses to their work, and indeed the “discussion” continued over the subsequent decade and beyond. As Editor, this is the kind of exchange and challenge that I value, and I know that those who review manuscripts for ANS share this value. We seek the highest level of scholarship, but the definition of scholarship remains open and robust enough to include challenges to the very criteria by which we judge that which is worthy. This issue of ANS focuses on a topic that seems quite mainstream, but as you will see as you read the works that are published here, ideas and perspectives embedded in this issue maintain the tradition of thoughtful and thought-provoking perspectives. I invite all readers to join the ongoing dialogues and to continue this fine tradition in discussions, as well as in print.",

    "abstract": "Author response: Since the publication of my article in September, I have received numerous e-mails from nurse scholars around the world, including Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada. All of these scholars have commented on the need for more critiques of nursing scholarship using a critical-feminist approach, and the special resonance each one felt with my analysis. I am especially humbled and gratified that Dr Morse would take the time to prepare this commentary. As I emphasized in my article, I approached this critique with an enormous respect for Dr Morse's invaluable contributions to nursing science. The critique/replication issue of ANS is an opportunity for nurse scholars to take the stance, as Dr Chinn 1 suggests, “of wondering, of questioning, and of exploring possibilities.” It was in this spirit that I undertook my critique. Those of us who are more recent graduates of doctoral programs in nursing have had the enriching experience of being encouraged to utilize a multiperspective approach that incorporates critical and postmodernist perspectives in “exploring the possibilities” of nursing science. We honor the enormous body of work done by nurse scholars informed by the empirical and interpretive traditions, while continuing to wonder about, question, and explore the ways in which the critical-postmodernist tradition might also advance our scholarship. In an upcoming issue of ANS focused on Critical and Postmodernist Perspectives (26:1, March 2003), I will explore further the ways in which there is room for all of us—both accomplished researchers and newer critical-feminist scholars—to create a culture of epistemic diversity in nursing scholarship. Like the “beloved community” envisioned by the late Dr M.L. King, this new community of nurse scholars would have as its core values connectedness and trust. In place of the standard academic model of adversarial discourse, we would wonder about, question, and explore each others' work in a spirit of mutual support and profound respect, regardless of our status or philosophical perspective. In fact, this community is already a reality, unconstrained by either time or place, and there is no longer any need to wait for a specific conference in a geographic location to participate in it. It is located in our hearts, and we can connect with others in the community at anytime, whether at nursemanifest.com, [email protected], or the growing number of spaces where nurse scholars cherish each other and our epistemic diversity.",

    "abstract": "On October 28, 2002, nursing and higher education suffered an internationally broadcast tragedy. Three nursing faculty members at the University of Arizona were killed by a student who subsequently committed suicide. The event sent shock waves throughout the nursing world. It is an event that raises important issues, and that calls for many levels of ongoing searching, reflection, and investigation in our quest for meaning and understanding. I have invited Richard Cowling, who worked with one of the murdered women, to write a guest editorial commemorating the lives of the three faculty members. His words follow, and I invite others to share letters in response to this tragic, and important, event that has touched all of our lives. IN DESPAIR I FOUND A WINDOW My friend was murdered today along with two of her friends and colleagues at the University of Arizona School of Nursing. The next day I cry because I remember Cheryl McGaffic and all that she meant to me and to the people who call themselves “Rogerians.” She had just written to me an e-mail about wanting to leave academic nursing at the end of the school year and find a new path. Last spring she had written a beautiful essay, My Heart is Naked, * about her relationship with students and patients. I learn that she was a volunteer hospital chaplain and frequently sat with dying patients in the oncology unit. She wanted death and dying to be understood and appreciated in a way that was sensitive to the individual person going through this transition. She was dead. She was shot to death. She was murdered by a student. Tears run down my face. Last week Cheryl told me she wanted to use healing work with my sister who was just diagnosed with cancer. I e-mailed my sister about Cheryl. My sister says she feels Cheryl near. I read My Heart is Naked to my students. I wish Cheryl was here reading this essay. Tears stream down my face. I tell my friends and colleagues and family about Cheryl and they all want to know more. In despair I found a window. I hear the news about the killings on CNN. They talk about the killer and his life and his trials and tribulations. The woman at the desk in Atlanta asks the woman reporter in the field in Tucson about the victims and she says simply that they were nursing faculty. I am angry that the media is so fascinated with knowing what motivated the killer and less about the lives of these lost women. In despair I found a window. I learn about Robin E. Rogers who loved her job. I learn that she cherished singing at contemporary praise services at her church on Saturday evenings. I learn that she was pediatric nurse practitioner and had served in the Air Force for 16 years. I read testimonies of colleagues and students about how much she cared for students and all people. I read friend's accounts of her active participation in the community visiting the sick. Students, friends, and colleagues wear purple, Robin's favorite color. I read the accounts of the service where her love of her husband and two children is acknowledged. I think about her being killed first, alone her office. In despair I found a window. I learn about Barbara S. Monroe and her dedication to her students and her specialty of critical care. I learn that she taught and practiced as a role model for other clinical faculty. I read about the memorial service and Barbara being remembered for her use of props to teach and her love of music. I learn that she loved telling stories about her native Minnesota, her cat, Fluffy, and her husband. Barbara grew up reading Cherry Ames student nurse books and was fascinated with the history of nursing. I think about her being in the classroom with Cheryl that day. I think about her being the last to die. I think about the students and the fear and the tragedy of all this. In despair I found a window. I have devoted a good portion of the last several years of my professional life to appreciating despair. Women came forward to participate in this work. I remember that these women have taught me so much about despair. I think of this tragedy. I think about my own despair. I remember despair as windows. I want to pay homage to the women who were murdered. I want to acknowledge the sacredness of their lives and relationships. I want them to live on in many ways. I wonder why men have not come to talk about despair. I remember that the killer has a name, Robert S. Flores Jr. I think about his despair. I wonder why he could not find a window. I must acknowledge that I feel a deep sense of grace in the presence of those women who have shared their life stories. I feel this grace in the presence of my daughter and granddaughters. I remember my mother dying and the sense of deep connection as she was slipping away. I think of Cheryl and her colleagues and their appreciation of the moments of living and dying. In despair they lead me to a window.",

    "abstract": "When the topic for this issue was first conceived, the downturn in the US economy had just begun. No prognosticators were anticipating that in the spring of 2003 the economy would still be relatively unstable. The rampant unethical and illegal actions of corporations had not yet been publicly exposed, and evidence of growing disparities between the rich and the poor had not yet reached a point of generating a general public outcry. Even as this issue goes to press, grassroots awareness and action are just beginning to emerge, and organized private and public sector changes are just beginning to be put into place to curb fraudulent transactions. The economic events of the past few years have affected everyone, but none more seriously than those who were already disadvantaged. The economic boom of the 1990s, which turned out to be at least in part an illusion created by fraudulent accounting practices, benefited those who already held impressive economic and class privilege. Those who were disadvantaged before the boom only suffered greater disadvantage, sometimes disaster. By the time manuscripts for this issue of the journal were due, the realities of the economic recession were crystal clear, and appalling health care disparities were imposed on growing numbers of citizens. Yet, when the deadline for this issue of Advances in Nursing Science arrived, there were fewer manuscripts on my desk than at any time since the first year of the journal's existence. Nurses have a long tradition of responding to the needs of those who suffer from economic and social discrimination. Nurses care for people in places and in circumstances where no other provider is found. Nurses maintain a perspective that embraces social and economic conditions as health variables. Even in the current broken health care nonsystem, in which nursing is seldom practiced as the nurses who are there would prefer to practice, nurses still do whatever is possible to help people address economic and social issues in their lives. So I have to ask: where are the nurse scholars, the thinkers, the movers and shakers, when a journal calls for work that focuses on economics and class as a health care variable? I know that fortunately, these nurses do exist. Many are immersed in political, administrative, bedside, chairside, and curbside work * to diligently address these very issues. Several have contributed to this issue of Advances in Nursing Science. There are articles in this issue that challenge the status quo, bringing to our awareness the fundamental fact that the status quo is not acceptable when one considers the plight of millions of people worldwide who suffer the negative health effects of economic and class disadvantage. Some of the perspectives of the authors in this issue are not widely shared, and some may generate strong responses from readers. But the ideas and the perspectives in this issue will certainly challenge all of us to consider alternatives, to move from complacency to action, and to contribute further scholarship that can influence social and political action to address economic and class issues.",

    "abstract": "PEER REVIEW: STATE OF THE ART AND SCIENCE The long-standing process of peer review in scholarly literature remains as a necessary hallmark of quality and credibility despite ongoing debates about what it is, how to do it, why it is important, and what alternatives exist. Yes, peer review is challenging and frustrating, with many persistent features that range from serious flaws to simply being annoying. Nonetheless, acceptable alternatives that achieve the underlying goals of quality and credibility have not yet emerged, and the importance of peer review has become more urgent with the growth of dishonest (predatory) publishing. The debates and challenges that peer review prompts led to the establishment of the now annual global event known as Peer Review Week (PRW) (@PeerRevWeek; https://peerreviewweek.wordpress.com/). Held for a week in September each year, this global event is a model for the future of scholarly debate and discourse! It is a \"ground up\" event—anyone can participate in any way you wish. You can \"register\" your event if you want to draw an international audience. Or, you can simply organize something in your local community—by and for people in your circle of friends and colleagues. Here are the general suggestions/guidelines for participation published on the PRW website: Host a webinar or virtual panel discussion (or attend one!). Submit a video to the Peer Review Week YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmYfn4oBs5a084aOu-ph-g). Write a blog post related to the PRW theme. Organize or participate in a peer review–themed social media campaign. Attend one of the PRW Reddit AMAs—or organize your own. Join the discussion on Twitter by following @PeerRevWeek and using this year's hashtags: #PeerReviewWeek22 and #IdentityInPeerReview Each year I tune in to the YouTube channel, follow the Twitter hashtag, and check the website to scan for virtual events or presentations to find topics and issues that provide me, as an Editor, a global perspective and introduction to new ideas for refining the processes we use. I find the discussions interesting and compelling and well worth considering. So far the message I come away with is that given the purposes and aims of ANS, the double-anonymous peer review process that we use is serving the journal well. But the fact remains that given the challenge of building and sustaining credibility, and despite the frustrations and drawbacks, ongoing discussion and searching for \"a better way\" are not only interesting but also, in fact, necessary to achieve the fundamental purposes involved in building a strong scholarly community! —Peggy L.

Adapting community-based participatory research principles, 4 focus groups were conducted with 13 youth and 12 parents. Using codebook thematic analysis, 5 facilitator themes (develop skills, ensure health, build understanding, promote safety, and help others, youth-initiated interest) and 4 barrier themes (anxiety and fear, skepticism, confusion, and unfamiliar/unknown experience) were identified. Youth and parent responses informed proposed guidelines for recruiting and engaging families in research using high-tech methods, particularly those from historically and systematically marginalized communities.",

    "abstract": "To the Editor, Twenty years after the death of Dr Philip H. Phenix (1915-2002), an educational philosopher at Teachers College, Columbia University, nursing scholars continue to ignore the fact that the fundamental patterns of knowing in nursing were derived from his work, Realms of Meaning.1 Instead, recent articles2–4 continue to attribute the original typology to exclusively Dr Barbara A. Carper.5 Notably, Carper cited Phenix's work more than 20 times in her doctoral dissertation6 but not once in her widely cited article, published in Advances in Nursing Science in 1978.5 The connection to Phenix's work has perhaps been best explicated in a book edited by Locsin and Purnell7 but has also been cited in articles by other scholars8–10; yet, this continues to be overlooked. Indeed, Carper herself has since acknowledged Phenix as a significant source of inspiration for her work.11 It is beyond time that nursing scholars did their due diligence on this matter. Furthermore, some scholars continue to state that Carper presented the fundamental patterns of knowing in nursing \"in a siloed manner.2(p17) This is a gross mischaracterization of her work and perpetuates a long-lasting, disciplinary misunderstanding. On the contrary, in 2015, Carper explicitly stated \"...we are not limited to one kind of knowledge or way of knowing ... it's not 'either or,' but all of them.\"11(p81) As Purnell noted, Phenix1 often linked specific disciplines to each realm of meaning, but to her credit, Carper5,6 pointed out that the discipline of \"...nursing uniquely engages in all realms simultaneously.\"12(p9) We owe Carper a debt gratitude for importing and applying Phenix's work to nursing. Yet, Phenix's work1 and its contribution to nursing science deserve to be more transparently recognized and fully explored. Sincerely, —Elizabeth R. Eisenhauer, PhD, RN School of Nursing, Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan",

    "abstract": "NURSING AS A COMMUNITY WITHIN COMMUNITIES Even though nursing's theoretical tradition has focused on individual care, nurses historically have been at the heart of various kinds of communities. Early in the 20th century, nurses in the United States formed groups focused on specific community projects and were instrumental in developing public health services for inner-city populations. They were influential in political activism related to rights of women to vote, government health care services for children, and involvement in the European wars. This tradition has continued throughout the decades, and yet the perception persists among most nurses that our tradition is one of individual isolation, of political apathy and a predominant focus on services to individual patients in hospitals. The articles in this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS 23:2) dispel various myths that have prevailed concerning the nature of nursing's own community and our activism within the larger populations and communities we serve. This issue provides important foundations for building a new understanding of nursing's potential for creating health in communities and systems. The reviewers' comments give a glimpse of what is in store in this issue: Stevens: \"… presents a compelling critique of the current welfare reform systems and challenging arguments to mobilize the nursing citizenry to action on behalf of the poor.\" Rubotzky: \"Although I have used Nursing's Agenda for Health Care Reform, I was unaware of the efforts behind the scenes which led up to its publication, and this history makes an important contribution to nursing knowledge.\" Rafael: \"The application of nursing theory and nursing science to the understanding of communities is difficult at best, and I believe this article provides a new perspective.\" Westbrook and Schultz: \"… provides the reader with an explanation of the development and organization of interdisciplinary neighborhood teams and their use of the core functions of public health to guide efforts to address community-identified problems. This is the cutting edge of the future practice of public health nursing and it is a true service to make this story available in ANS.\" Marck: \"The integration of theory and nurses' stories throughout the text provides a sense of being in the moment as one ponders the need for nurses to restore our 'right' ecological relationships to health, clients, other health professionals, and the larger world.\" Scott: \"Well articulated and important implications for research and practice.\" It is my hope that these articles will provide a beacon of light toward forming new kinds of communities among nurses, focused on making a real difference in the communities we serve. -Peggy L.

Patient experience is the current federally mandated hospital quality indicator that is measured via the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Minority representation in the HCAHPS survey development however was not robust. This study used a constructivist grounded theory method to explore how English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic patients seeking kidney and liver transplant care at a safety-net hospital perceive and interpret the care experience. A grounded theory process model emerged finding comfort, communication, connection, and care to be interdependent factors crucial for a positive hospital admission. Furthermore, “cultural context” was found to influence perception of each of these concepts. This research provides key insights into how Hispanics may perceive their needs when seeking care.

    "abstract": "THE BURDEN OF THE MORAL COURAGE NEEDED TO ACT IS LESS THAN THE TRAUMA OF REPEATEDLY WITNESSING INJUSTICE Editor's Note: The following guest editorial is by Robin Narruhn, PhD, MN, RN, Assistant Professor at Seattle University. This editorial is presented as part of her participation in the 2021-22 ANS Editor Immersion Program. Peggy Chinn, Editor As a nation, we are grieving the tragic mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, and now Tulsa, Oklahoma, happening days apart and taking the lives of the innocent. Our grief and confusion are palpable. We seem to be paralyzed by inaction, frozen, and seemingly lacking agency, by the overwhelming structural policies that allow gun violence to flourish in our nation. We are bewildered by the lack of police response and legislative barriers. A critical conscientization will assist us in recognizing the deep images of racism wherein Black people were slaughtered by a White supremacist in a grocery store. Just days later, a mass shooting where Brown children were not deemed worthy of protection by the police were killed. Workers and patients at a medical center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, were wounded a bit more than a week after the Uvalde tragedy. Gun violence and mass shootings are a stark, racist, common, and unjust occurrence in our nation. Gun violence is only one of the areas of injustice and health inequity in our nation. We are experiencing inequities in police brutality, mass incarceration rates, educational opportunity, wealth generation, and COVID-19 rates. Crimes against people who are LGBTQ, Islamaphobia, and anti-Semitism are prevalent in our nation. Racism, poverty, decreased life opportunities, homelessness, ableism, and more are all part of our national landscape. Social justice is a foundational value in the Nursing Code of Ethics (American Nurses Association, 2015), specifically in provision 9, and implied throughout all the provisions. Nurses must work on health policy (provision 7) and protect human rights (provision 8) as per the Nursing Code of Ethics (American Nurses Association, 2015). Nurses are called upon to advocate for justice. We need to work on just health care policy. There are calls to embed social justice throughout the nursing curriculum; however, we are cautioned to remain apolitical, yet somehow advocate for the individuals, communities, and populations in our care. Too often, we are told nurses should not be political despite the clear need for nurses to contribute to health policy and advocacy. There are many ways nurses can mitigate social injustice and health inequities, namely, by serving on relevant committees, working in the community, voting, and policy making are all steps nurses can take to contribute to social justice. There is a body of literature addressing social justice as it pertains to our work as nurses. Reading articles in Advances in Nursing Science, or perusing blogs such as Nursology or Overdue Reckoning on Racism, can increase our theoretical knowledge. Nursing pedagogy must include an explicit framework addressing the structural conditions and power dynamics and use a systemic critical analysis (Garneau et al., 2018) that abolishes gun violence and other health inequities. We are rarely taught to address social justice. Instead, the empirical, technical, and biomedical aspects of nursing take precedence despite the reality that other skills are needed to mitigate social injustice as it applies to health. Too often, we attribute health inequities to individual behaviors or \"lifestyle choices,\" cultural practices, or genetics and neglect the crucial step of effective analysis. Critical consciousness, contextualization, historical perspective, structural competency, reflection, and moral courage are all components of a pedagogy addressing social justice. As evidenced by the national events in Buffalo, Uvalde, and Tulsa, a lack of social justice and advocacy can be just as fatal as any other disease. Social justice can no longer be considered an optional soft skill and should be recognized and taught by nursing faculty who have the expertise to help all faculty integrate it into the nursing curriculum. Next, a willingness to do the heavy lifting of applying theories of social justice to practice is necessary. In other words, we must attend to the need to develop a praxis of social justice in nursing. Nursing is the nation's largest health care profession, with more than 3.8 million registered nurses nationwide. We are missing an opportunity. The burden of the moral courage needed to act is less than the trauma of repeatedly witnessing these injustices. As nurses, we must act. —Robin A. Narruhn, PhD, MN, RN Assistant Editor",

    "abstract": "The Ri Majel (Marshallese) migrants of Washington State have endured health inequities and unique laws dictating their access to health care once they arrive to the United States. These health inequities can be seen to be a result of historical trauma and militarization of their islands. The research question was an inquiry regarding access to health care for the Ri Majel in Washington State. We first provide detailed historical data in the background to contextualize our research inquiry. We interviewed 12 people and using manifest content analysis found 2 main themes regarding the health of the Ri Majel: (1) health care access and inequity and (2) historical trauma and embodiment. Health care access was impeded by (1) ongoing effects of radiation, (2) repeated denial of services, (3) lack of health care and insurance, (4) lack of language interpretation during health care visits, and (5) poverty. Historical trauma and embodiment were evidenced by these findings: (1) illness and early mortality; (2) provider lack of knowledge and understanding of the Ri Majel; (3) structural discrimination; (4) feelings of sadness and despair; (5) shyness and humility; and (6) a sense of \"cannot/will not\" and fatalism. Our findings demonstrate the need to examine structural factors when assessing health inequities and a need to understand and mitigate the effects of historical trauma enacted by structural racism, violence, and colonialism. Strategies to mitigate the embodiment of historical trauma require further investigation.",

Results indicate that spirituality is a pervasive nursing ethic manifesting respect, connectedness, love, acceptance, caring, hope, endurance, and compassion toward clients. Participants' experiences of spirituality promote self-awareness, open-mindedness, and acceptance of others and encourage participants' reflexivity, which grounds their nursing practice. Nurses' spiritual awareness fosters an appreciation for Indigenous community healing, leading to more reciprocal interactions with community members. Significantly, these participants provide care spiritually; they do not provide spiritual care.",

    "abstract": "When you read this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (ANS 22:1), the last season of the year 1999 will be emerging-autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and spring in the Southern Hemisphere. Because the end of the 1900s is drawing near, our attention is drawn to review what has transpired over the past century and to anticipate what might be in store for the coming century. This time breeds all manner of speculation, interpretation, reflection, and even hysteria concerning what has happened in the past and what it means for the future. One can locate almost any future prediction to suit your personal taste! This issue of ANS is rich with material that I anticipate will stimulate rich discussion among nurse colleagues as the new century approaches. The issues that these authors present are broadly representative of nursing professional and disciplinary concerns, and an array of examples of approaches to historical scholarship. This issue also continues the journal's growing international scope. As I reviewed these articles, I identified three themes that reflect the value of history. First, history provides evidence for a more complete understanding and appreciation of the complex dynamics that shape our world. These articles illustrate the interplay of a vast range of factors, including such diverse issues as ideology, politics, technologies, time, space, architecture, relationships, and world events. The nearsighted view of the present obscures our ability to see this rich complexity. But taken historically, we begin to see the unfolding layers of interaction and thereby appreciate the complexities of what is happening in our present time. Second, history provides evidence to debunk myths that persist as damaging influences on current and emerging realities, and brings into view that which has been hidden. The ways in which certain actualities are distorted to create damaging myths, and still other actualities are hidden from view, continue to be a mystery beyond my imagination. Work that reveals what actually happened, and how it happened, is important work to re-direct our thinking about our future, and how it can be shaped. As an example, several of the articles debunk myths about what women and nurses did in the past, revealing the hidden accomplishments of nurses in past periods of time and their courage, creativity, and strength. Finally, history is a valuable means of examining ideologies and their influence on emerging circumstances and situations. As we live from day to day, it is very difficult to realize the particular assumptions and ideologies that shape our thinking and our perceptions, and in turn shape our choices and actions. Work that examines, in retrospect, the ideological factors that shaped the past deepens our understanding of the power of ideologies and provides a lens through which to detect more clearly the ideologies of our own time, and to sense their persistent influence. I hope that these articles will prompt many occasions for discussion and exchange of ideas. Each of us can participate in shaping a future we choose. Historical insights such as those presented in this issue of ANS can inform the directions that we seek. -Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "To the editor: We welcome the letters of Dr Margaret Newman and Dr Emiko Endo 1,2 regarding our article titled \"A Commentary on Newman: Theory of Health as Expanding Consciousness.\" 3 Newman has pointed out some important clarifications, which we refer to below. However, indeed we do have some disagreements with her and with Endo, so we should like to defend our point of view. 1. Issue of paradigm. Newman states that \"The problem lies mainly in the paradigm from which the authors speak. They examine initial parameters of the theory with knowledge from other fields … My understanding of scientific criticism is that it proceeds from within the paradigm of the theory being evaluated.\" Endo writes, \"The authors violated the essence of this nursing theory, the wholeness, by dividing it into pieces and evaluating it from the perspective of other disciplines.\" We beg to differ. We believe that Newman's theory is illuminated by comparing and contrasting it with other theories. This cannot be done from within the theory. This is certainly legitimate criticism. For example, even a follower of Marxist economics may criticize Marx's treatment of female labor in the light of feminist ideas. As for dividing into pieces, this is unavoidable in any systematic exposition. Even the Buddha expounded the Four Noble Truths of His unitary transformative theory one by one. 2. Analogy to alternative medicine. We have drawn numerous analogies between Newman's theory and other disciplines. We did not mean to suggest a precise fit of Newman's theory with these other paradigms. Newman pointed out that these analogies are not perfect, and we never meant to suggest that they were. Her distinctions are helpful clarifications, but we still claim our analogies are useful in understanding her theory by putting it in a broader context. 3. Interpretations of assumptions on causal terms. We stated \"psychic imbalances can create the conditions for disease to manifest.\" We agree with Newman that from a unitary transformative paradigm this is not appropriate language. It would have been better to say that \"psychic imbalances are associated with conditions for disease to manifest.\" 4. The definition of health. Newman's theory offers a revolutionary conception of health. According to Newman, health is the process of transformation to higher levels of consciousness. She considers health and illness as a unitary process, which she identifies with \"expanding consciousness.\" Thus, Newman's concept of health differs significantly from the one that defines health as the absence of disease or another which places health and illness on a continuum. It should not be inferred from our critique that we do not accept the basic premises of the concept of health as expanding consciousness. However, we do indeed intend to emphasize that the use of the word \"health\" with all its usual connotations in a setting wherein those connotations are strongly contradicted can cause difficulties. We would suggest that calling the theory \"health/illness\" as expanding consciousness would avoid the problem. 5. Equilibrium. Moving on to lesser issues, we did not mean to imply that a search for equilibrium entails more than the instantaneous pause at the equilibrium state required by her postulate of a movement between equilibrium and disequilibrium. 6. Human energy field. Since Newman does not say anything about the nature of the human energy field in her writings and yet ascribes physical reality to it (personal communication, March 26, 1996), our lack of understanding of the field as she conceptualizes it may, we trust, be forgiven. We hope that she will explicate it further. Meanwhile, we have tried to understand it by looking at how other disciplines deal with such fields. And we did not mean to suggest energy exchange rather than a field effect. 7. Neurolinguistic program. Our neurolinguistic programing psychotherapy example was meant to show that insight does not necessarily lead to action. Whether insight in the specific context of Newman's theory does lead to action should be an empirically drawn or testable assertion. However, if \"action\" is defined sufficiently broadly, with \"no way of knowing in advance what that will be or what action will be indicated,\" there is a danger of failing Popper's 4 falsifiability criterion for scientific theories. 8. Difficulty and obscurity. Endo objects to our claim that \"Newman's theory has a reputation for difficulty and obscurity.\" This claim is of course impossible to precisely verify, but it is based on the first author's North American experience. Endo argues against this by the non-sequitur of giving some anecdotes of nurses who have been enlightened about nursing when they became acquainted with Newman's theory. Indeed, the first author counts herself among such nurses. 9. Origins. Endo finds the origins of Newman's theory in Newman's experiences with her mother rather than in the work of Martha Rogers and modern physics. There is a semantic difference here: Endo is referring to what psychologically primed Newman to formulate the theory, while we refer to the theoretical precursors which influenced her. 10. Research as praxis. In our article, in an effort to elucidate the construct research as praxis research, which involves the researched in a process of inquiry characterized by negotiation, reciprocity, and empowerment, 5 we merely expounded on that construct in terms of those three concepts; which Newman 5 noted were derived from Lather's 6 work. Newman's theory has come a long way from its early publications. 7,8 Dr. Newman is, of course, the final arbiter as to its current formulation, but as we observe with interest the evolution of her thought, we shall continue to view it from a wider perspective. -Mineko Yamashita, RN, PhD Professor, School of Nursing; Saitama College of Health Sciences; Saitama, Japan -Franklin D.

    "abstract": "To the editor: In the article, \"A Commentary on Newman's Theory of Health as Expanding Consciousness\" (ANS 21:1, September 1998), Yamashita and Tall presented their explication of Newman's theory and some aspects they considered problematic. [1] Their intention was to lead to more understanding and application of the theory; their exposition, however, may mislead readers. The authors violated the essence of this nursing theory, the wholeness, by dividing it into pieces and evaluating it from the perspective of other disciplines. Each piece offered is mostly understandable, but focusing on the piece does not help the reader grasp the meaning of this theory from a unitary-transformative perspective. [2-4] One such misdirected criticism is the example of efforts to help a client quit smoking as offered from the experience of neurolinguistic programming psychotherapy. The example is intended to illustrate how pattern recognition does not necessarily lead to change in behavior. The Newman approach would not target a specific behavioral alteration but rather would concentrate on the meaning of the client's total pattern of relating, not knowing in advance what direction the transformation will take. Clearly, the authors have a different concept of health than does Newman. The authors claim that Newman's theory has a reputation for difficulty and obscurity. This may be true for some, but it is also true that there are many nurses who have been enlightened about nursing when they became acquainted with Newman's theory. For example, after studying the theory, a young nursing teacher resolved her long-lasting feelings of despair for one client with cancer. She said, \"If I had known this theory 5 years ago, I would have understood baffling behaviors and worked with him without being afraid of him.\" Another nurse, who previously could find nothing to relieve the existential suffering of her clients with cancer, worked with these clients through the process of pattern recognition as nursing intervention. (See Endo, 1998, for further elaboration of this process. [5]) She said, \"I realized new relationships evolved between us, and my routine nursing activities had different meanings to me.\" And one other, a graduate student who was committed to clients who had been suffering distress from loss of speech communication by laryngectomy, felt their distress as if it were her own. She engaged in pattern recognition as nursing intervention with them and experienced, in the process, her own expanding consciousness with her clients. My sense is that these experiences of enlightenment, in the context of applying Newman's theory, occur in nurses who are compassionate, a characteristic of higher consciousness. To gain a deep understanding of Newman's theory, the important thing is to immerse oneself as a whole in the theory. The origin of the theory may help in grasping its impact and meaning. Yamashita and Tall say that Newman came to her insights from the work of Martha Rogers and modern physics. That may be true, but I see its origin in Newman's experience with her mother when Newman was in her twenties. [6] I feel my understanding of the theory growing whenever I read Newman's description of that experience: What I do want to share is my realization that life had to be lived in the present, and that if one were to be happy, it had to come one day at a time. I learned that my mother, though physically incapacitated, was a whole person, just like anybody else. I came to know her and to love her in a way I probably never would have taken the time to experience had she not been physically dependent. The 5 years I spent with her before she died were difficult, tiring, restrictive in some ways, but intense, loving, and expanding in other ways. [1] (pxxii) Here I see and feel the essence of nursing. Though I would like to show my respect for Yamashita and Tall's work, overall I experience a feeling of dissonance with their commentary.

Since both publishing in and being quoted in ANS is an especially high honor for me, I was motivated to address the use of my work in a recent article \"Dilemmas of caring in a corporate context: a critique of nursing case management\" by S M Padgett, RN, MS (ANS, 1998; 20(4):1-12). My quote as well as the other from Taylor were both particularly important as background by Padgett in his critique of the current state of discourse on ethics and case management. My discussion of ethics and case management (Ethical issues in case management. In: D L Flarey & SS Blancett, eds. Handbook of Nursing Case Management, Aspen Publishers, Inc. was faulted (p. 6 ANS) for defining political action as only \"informing public officials … about patient needs,\" (p 449, Pinch) when in fact, that particular item was one of several in the same list of other suggestions for case managers to take relative to the delivery of health in particular and the functioning of the health care system in general. Additionally, the need for political action to be specifically tied to issues of class, gender, and race (also found limiting by Padgett) was addressed by a later discussion in my article through examples of dilemmas encountered by case managers. I certainly appreciate the contribution of Padgett to the ongoing discussion of ethics and case management but take issue with his limited read of my discussion as positing \"mere communication failures\" (p 10) as a solution for ethical conflict. Neither did my use of \"balanced\" approach imply a simple application of principles of fairness and efficacy. This was not the clinical situation I live in nor one I presented in my discussion. - Winifred J.

    "abstract": "DECOLONIZING NURSING In September 2021, Nursology.net (https://nursology.net) and the Center for Nursing Philosophy (https://nursing.uci.edu/center-for-nursing-philosophy) sponsored an online panel discussion focused on \"Decolonizing Nursing.\" The 7 panelists were all nurse scholars of color who discussed the ways their research and activism were bringing the perspectives of Black, Indigenous, and other people of color to the center in order to develop knowledge originating from world views beyond Euro-centric thought. A brief recap of the event, and a recording of the panel, is available on the Center for Nursing Philosophy website (https://nursing.uci.edu/2021/09/decolonizing-nursing-recap) (Figure).Figure.: QR code for Decolonizing Nursing Panel recap and recording.The realm of nursing knowledge development has emerged over the past 50 decades in places and spaces that excluded people of color and spaces that might have admitted them but were not friendly or welcoming. The remnants of that history in nursing and health care have lingered to the present. In the past several months since the killing of George Floyd, there has been a more widespread recognition of the injustices of this history, and some notable efforts to begin to engage in truth, reconciliation, and reparation leading to equity and justice. The \"Decolonizing Nursing\" panel was one such event, but it is only a small beginning. Efforts to decolonize nursing bring to the forefront recognition of the limitations of knowledge systems arising solely from Euro-centric lenses. This does not mean that our existing theories and philosophies are to be discarded or devalued. Rather, this means that as a discipline we seek to create spaces where the perspectives of everyone \"belong\"—where thought systems other than those of White folks are not merely welcomed but also honored, taught, explained, and explored with the dignity and respect that they deserve. It also means that we turn a critical lens on the theories and philosophies originating from Euro-centric thought traditions, particularly dismantling the many ways in which those thought traditions exclude those perceived as \"different\" and unacceptable. Finally, it means that we explicitly change ways of writing, talking, and interacting that dismantle structures of injustice and prejudice and create contexts that honor the full humanity of all. Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) has a rich tradition of publishing works that bring injustices to the surface, that challenge the status quo, and that point the way to a more just and equitable future. To this end, we have published guidelines for addressing racism in ANS content. The ANS leadership—editor, advisory board members, peer reviewers, and publisher—recognizes that published scholarly works are vehicles that can challenge systemic racism and intersecting forms of power inequities. ANS expects an explicit anti-racist stance as a means to provide scholarly resources to support anti-racism in research, practice, education, administration, and policy making. To this end, we offer the following guidelines: Remain mindful of the many ways in which White privilege is embedded in scholarly writing, and engage in careful rereading of your work to shift away from these explicit and implied messages. As an example, general \"norms\" are typically taken to reflect White experience only; this is revealed when the experience of people of color is taken to be \"other\" or \"unusual\" or worse yet \"unhealthy.\" When race is included as a research variable or a theoretical concept, racism must be named and integrated with other intersecting forms of oppression such as gender, sexuality, income, and religion. If your work does include race, Provide a rationale that clearly supports an anti-racist stance; Be careful not to explicitly or implicitly suggest a genetic interpretation; and Explicitly state the benefit that your work contributes on behalf of people of color. Refrain from any content that explicitly or implicitly blames the victim or that stereotypes groups of people; situate health inequities clearly in the context of systemic processes that disadvantage people of color. Focus on unveiling dynamics that sustain harmful and discriminatory systems and beliefs and on actions that can interrupt these structural dynamics. —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

Relatively few people with obesity achieve long-term weight control, suggesting that obesity and resistance to weight change represent functional adaption of energy homeostasis to the environment. The purpose of this article is to synthesize the literature regarding the relationship between environmental temperature and body weight and fat mass to provide a new explanation of obesity as a problem of maintaining core body temperature. Chronic exposure to cool environmental temperatures likely contributed to the obesity epidemic, and passive whole-body warming may be a promising intervention for weight control.",

    "abstract": "Virtual Nursing Theory Week 2021: Presenting and Publishing During the week of March 17-24, 2021, with the global COVID-19 pandemic expected to be winding down but not over, the Virtual Nursing Theory Week kept the idea of an annual nursing theory conference alive and well! (see https://nursingtheoryconference.com/). The conference featured 3 keynote sessions, 76 \"breakout\" presentations based on submitted abstracts, and \"daily discussion\" sessions during which all who registered were able to log in to a Zoom meeting for networking and discussion. The value of presenting at any conference is significant, but the now-annual nursing theory conference is particularly important as the international \"hub\" around which future nursing knowledge development evolves. Unlike published works, the audience sees and experiences the presenter as a real-life person. This person-to-person experience (even in a virtual context) gives members of a group an appreciation for the person who has created the ideas and crafted them into a communicable form, as well as an opportunity to ask questions and share comments. Presentations are essential to the development of ideas, but presentations tend to lack the level of \"esteem\" granted published works. There are several factors that contribute to this value system—one is the wider \"reach\" of published works to audiences who are not present for in-person presentations. Another is the formal environment around scholarly publishing that serves the purpose of ensuring the credibility and scholarly merit of the work. Conference organizers conduct some degree of review and vetting of the content planned for the conference, but there remains the expectation that presentations may not be fully developed. Conference planners often welcome \"thought pieces\" and controversial ideas that will stimulate discussion among conference attendees. Journal publishers and editors, on the other hand, expect that any work submitted for publication has been developed beyond the stages of early speculation. When a work is published in a credible journal—one that maintains high standards of ethics in all aspects of publication, the reader/consumer is assured that the work is original (not previously published in any form), that it was contributed by a qualified author or authors, that there are no conflicts of interest, sources of funding are declared, and that peer review has confirmed that the work is sufficiently developed and the findings and conclusions are sound. We fully expect many of the presentations at the 2021 Virtual Nursing Theory Week to evolve into publications in credible journals. But the significance of this conference and the conference presentations cannot be overstated! This event marks the evolution of our discipline and provides a springboard for our future development. May the conference thrive far into the future! —Peggy L. Chinn, PhD, RN, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "A World Without Boundaries Given the success of the 2021 Virtual Nursing Theory Week, the nursing theory conference planning team, led by Leslie H. Nicoll, PhD, MBA, RN, FAAN, has determined that the annual conference will continue with a hybrid format. Each year we will identify a local site—college or university—with a rich history related to the development of nursing knowledge. The scholars at that site will be responsible for a plenary virtual session that highlights the site's nursing theory history, as well as local social and networking activities, for faculty and students in the geographic area and others who might travel to the site. This plan makes the conference accessible to nurse scholars and students worldwide and, importantly, keeps the expense of the conference to a minimum! The 2022 virtual conference will be held over 5 days—March 17-21. The local site will be the University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Nursing, the undergraduate home of nurse theorist Margaret Newman and now the home of the Margaret Newman Center. The conference theme draws on Dr Newman's 2003 Advances in Nursing Science (ANS) article, titled \"A World of No Boundaries\" (ANS. 2003;26(4):240-245. https://doi.org/10.1097/00012272-200310000-00002). There will be 3 general sessions—the first featuring the life and work of Margaret Newman. Mid-conference general session is designed and presented by early career nursing scholars. The final general session features information related to the 2023 geographic center for the conference—the greater Los Angeles area and the many colleges and universities in that area with rich histories related to nursing knowledge development. The remaining scholarly sessions will feature 50 of the abstracts submitted for the conference—all in dedicated Zoom sessions. The end of each day will provide opportunities for networking and discussion—a 1-hour \"daily discussion.\" The importance of this and other nursing theory-related events cannot be overestimated. The Annual Nursing Theory conference organizers have established a clear commitment to support and nurture the work of students and early career scholars who hold in their hands the future of the discipline. The conference will be a living dialectic—on one hand honoring the foundations of the discipline and ideas with a long tradition, and on the other taking in new ideas and perspectives that challenge the status quo. We anticipate lively discussion of ideas—many of which may be controversial and hotly debated. Watch the Nursing Theory Conference website—https://nursingtheoryconference.com/—for detailed information about the program and registration! Hope to see many ANS readers there! —Peggy L.

    "abstract": "EDITOR'S RESPONSE I would like to thank Dr Banks-Wallace for articulating these issues for the ANS audience. While the particular situation that she addresses is the ANS review process, I believe that the concerns she raises apply to many other types of review and evaluation processes, including grant reviews and faculty assessments of student work. The points that Dr Banks-Wallace addresses that I feel are particularly worthy of our consideration are: (1) the cultural tendency to ascribe common characteristics to groups other than our own; (2) our willingness to assign a spokesperson from a minority group to speak on behalf of all others of their group, and (3) the use of the dominant culture's values and priorities as the norm for all other groups. These are difficult issues to address, but I believe that we can find ways to remedy these expressions of everyday, often unconscious or unintended prejudices. The first step is to bring these matters to conscious awareness. Dr Banks-Wallace has provided a statement that can enhance our understanding of these dynamics and the serious consequences of our actions. It is everyone's responsibility to take her words to heart, to examine our own attitudes and practices, and to resolve to work toward change in our own practices. The next step is to learn ways to change what we do and how we do it. I would like to offer some suggestions along this line. With regard to our tendencies to ascribe common characteristics to groups other than our own, one practice that can be cultivated in our diverse communities is to invite opinions and points of view from each individual, with individuals speaking their own perspective. In communities where our practice is to act based on a majority voice, we sustain the tendency to assume homogeneity when in fact even among the majority, and particularly among the minority, great diversity of perspective probably prevails. When we learn to pay attention to the rich diversity of perspective, we will acquire the means to integrate that understanding into our attitudes and actions toward other people. Many feminist writers have addressed the dilemmas involved in asking one member of a minority group to represent their group. In \"The Bridge Poem,\" Donna Kate Rushin speaks eloquently of how it feels to be asked to explain and translate her cultural experiences to others, urging us to find other connections to cultures we do not experience first hand. [1] (pxxi) We can seek places and experiences that are not our common everyday experience. We can read the excellent writings that scholars of minority groups have written. We can listen with attentiveness and respect to the stories and perspectives that are offered in our everyday interactions with people who live in different cultural groups. In academic circles, we have built in to almost every process the values of the dominant culture. The recent controversies and discussions in the United States about the role of Ebonics (Black American English dialects) in schooling for children brings this issue to stark reality. I do not think that we can resolve the conflicts inherent in contradictory value systems by passing laws and writing policies. Instead, I believe that we can pay attention to the many ways that we impose dominant values on others, and examine how to shift our preconceived ideas of what is right, good, or worthy to embrace the values of groups other than our own. This starts with discussions where we live and work to find our common ground, and to better understand our differences. This issue of Advances in Nursing Science (20:3) focuses on \"Development and Aging.\" I am presenting Dr Banks-Wallace's letter, and my response, as a challenge to the nursing profession to develop our communities with a conscious intent toward embracing the rich diversity of our members. This is a development process. It happens over time, with great effort, and in small steps. It is my hope that in this development process, we will age with grace and dignity, and gain the wisdom that we prefer to associate with advanced years and maturity. Peggy L.

    "abstract": "Dear Dr. Chinn; I am writing in response to the editorial review of my manuscript. I would like to thank the reviewers for giving such careful attention to it. The majority of their comments were provocative and will assist me to further realize the significant influence of social position and life experiences on the interpretation of data and dissemination of findings. I would like to bring to your attention two matters that caused me grave concern. First, one reviewer noted under section II \"Concise, logical ordering of ideas; readability\": \". . . often times I would have to read a quote two or three times to discern how it was tied to the author's overall statement. . . with the approval of the journal editor, I solicited a second read from a colleague who is African American and a nurse researcher. She likewise struggled with the presentation of the quotes.\" The reviewer appears to have made an assumption that because her or his colleague is a woman of African descent she has some intrinsic understanding of all other women of African descent. The reviewer's actions (in conjunction with the colleague of African descent and the supervising editor), are indicative of an essentialist perspective of human experience and behavior. This perspective assumes that members within a particular social subgroup possess certain common characteristics, partake in the same life experiences, and have similar adaptive responses. Feminist theorists have been instrumental in expanding the dialogue about the influence of gender and class on every aspect of life. Thus, I am very distraught to be reminded, yet again, that the homogenization of experiences persists even within circles of feminist scholars. Furthermore, I think careful consideration should be given to the unintended consequences of having a woman of African descent serve the role of \"hatchet person.\" The reviewer channeled her or his negative comments through the personage of a nurse scholar of African descent. This made it possible for the reviewer to appear objective and concerned, but not responsible for the outcomes of the review process. I assume that the reviewer had some noble goal in mind when this option was chosen. However, the scholar of African descent was placed in a very precarious position. There is a long history within the United States of selecting a few \"good\" people of color to serve as gatekeepers and preservers of the dominant power structure. They usually have no power to change the system and are generally held in low esteem by the dominant society and distrusted within their social cultural groups. An outgrowth of this history is that regardless of outcomes, blind reviews by persons selected simply because of their assumed affinity to a particular group may breed mistrust and impede open communication. In addition, the imbalance of power within academe and secrecy inherent in blind reviews frequently leave scholars suspicious of potential allies and colleagues. Taken together, these factors may result in scholars who are people of color being further isolated or ostracized. None of these situations is conducive to the further development of a community of nurse scientists and scholars. A second area of concern was the assumption made by two of the reviewers regarding priorities for themes to be included in the manuscript. One reviewer noted that it would be helpful to have information regarding \"the participant's specific views on Caucasian women's roles in research\" and \"paradigms of Caucasian men.\" Another reviewer suggested that \"perhaps having a woman nurse scholar of African descent and a woman nurse scholar who is not a woman of color . . . review the match between the point or theme\" would be helpful. Together, these comments suggest that priority should be given to areas that traditionally have been the concerns of people of European descent. They also indicate that validation by the dominant culture is a prerequisite for the legitimization of studies by, for, and about people of color. Again, I am not sure of the intent of these comments. However, I believe the unintended negative consequences of maintaining these positions must be further examined by all scholars. In summary, I believe the comments of the reviewers indicate the need for a frank and open discussion regarding the influence of social and cultural norms, philosophical perspectives, and power differentials on development and dissemination of manuscripts. In particular, examination of the review process, the selection of reviews for manuscripts, and the influence of the process on the development of nurse scholars appears warranted. Thank you for your careful consideration of the concerns addressed. JoAnne Banks-Wallace, RN, PhD",

    "abstract": "Over the weeks that I was reviewing manuscripts and preparing for this issue of Advances in Nursing Science (20:4), I was also preparing the new ANS World Wide Web site. [1] From the beginning, I wanted to provide full disclosure of all procedures and policies related to the journal. The editorial policies and procedures are designed to ensure quality in both process and outcome, and disclosure practices ensure our accountability to those we serve. Now all of this information could be accessible worldwide at the click of a mouse button. I was thrilled! We live in a time when calls for quality and accountability dominate various discourses, and responding to these calls consumes a great deal of time and energy. A fundamental concern expressed in demands for both quality and accountability is the need to know. People on the receiving side of institutionalized interactions (receiving health care, for example) have grown weary of the institutional structures and practices that conceal important information and insights that could affect how they respond in the relationship. Those of us who represent the institution in the interaction have acquired ways of acting, and of being, that sustain concealing practices. Many of these institutional practices have evolved in such a way that there is no identifiable accountable or responsible party, making the challenge of changing the practice extremely difficult. Concealing practices include blatant practices that evolve as a structural component of the institution, such as billing and invoicing conventions that do not adequately itemize what is being charged. A concealing practice that directly affects nurses every day is the treatment of the medical record. The medical record historically has been treated as a document belonging to the institution, and not accessible to the person for whom it serves as a record, thereby serving to conceal the contents of the record from the person most invested in what it contains. The most powerful concealing practices are those that are embedded in the language, expressed in such subtle ways that even those who would prefer not to conceal remain unaware of their complicity in concealing. The use of the grammatical passive voice and other phrasing conventions that convey passivity in both verbal and written communication are pervasive in academic circles, and in professional circles. The passive voice conceals agency, which is often central to quality and accountability. Consider an oversimplified nursing education example: \"The class average on the exam was 82.\" This statement seems to convey information about the results of the examination, but in the absence of other statistical information the average actually conceals important information. The range of scores and standard deviation would disclose information about what the average means and the performance of all of the students who took the examination. Additional statistical information can disclose how adequately the examination itself served as a measure of knowledge; the examination itself is open to scrutiny and evaluation. Examinations sometimes adequately test the student's abilities; they more often reflect the quality of the educational process, indicating how well the teacher taught and how adequately the measure of success is conceived. Rarely, however, are examinations examined to disclose this type of information. In many cultures, including the cultures of the professions, disclosure is difficult because concealing is a habitual, comfortable practice. Disclosure requires effort that is felt at a deep level, because disclosure exposes essential human experience, and opens the possibility of judgment, of criticism. It also calls upon the person disclosing to remain true to that which is stated. If you have not yet seen the documents that disclose the practices we use in producing each issue of ANS, visit our web site. We welcome your response. Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "Most nursing models are developed based on Western philosophy. The conceptual model of “human as an embodied spirit” based on Iranian mysticism and wisdom is presented in this article. This conceptual model was developed in 2 phases: first, using a derivation process, the concepts of the model were developed. Next, in a synthesis process, the conceptual model was constructed. Definitions and descriptions of each of the concepts of the model—the constitution of the physical body, the composition of graded soul, knowledge-based interventions, love-based interventions, balance, and harmony—and the relations between these concepts are presented in the article. This model gives equal value to the art and the science of nursing and integrates all dimensions of human being and related health problems in such a way that they can be explained and approached as a continuum. The next step is the testing of this model followed by the development of guidelines for education and practice.",

    "abstract": "Recently I moved into an old house that has been cared for and loved by its owners for over 150 years. Still, when I moved in, it needed some special touches of rehabilitation. Getting organized to prepare this issue of ANS (19:4) seemed appropriate to my surroundings-repair people coming in and out, folks splashing paint on walls while music filled the air and sent new vibrations through the old walls, and a list of new appointments to make for yet more repair people to show up another day. Every day and night I learn more about the old house's idiosyncrasies-a creak here, a squeak in the floor there, a door that shuts a bit oddly, windows that work part way, a draft that needs to be tracked down. But despite its quirks and oddities that have come with years of withstanding use and abuse, the old house has grown lovely and rich in character. As the demographics of illness continue to change to reflect greater incidences of chronic illness, as well as greater possibilities for recovery from devastating injury, nurses have an increasingly important role to play in health and wellness care that focuses on rehabilitation and recovery. Just as my old house challenged my ingenuity, the creativity and ingenuity that nurse scholars can bring to this important aspect of nursing have yet to be stretched to their limit. Nursing's fundamental philosophy is consistent with a view that would bring people to a new future in the aftermath of challenging, sometimes devastating life events. As the articles in this issue of ANS demonstrate, nurses work diligently to bring new life, new possibilities, new ways to approach challenges. Nurses facilitate the regaining of function, listening and reflecting on the meaning of experiences, exploring of the shifts in ability and what these mean, repairing what can be repaired and learning how to adjust what cannot be repaired. I have witnessed nurses rejoicing in the newly found abilities that come with great struggle and commitment as a new life story emerges out of adversity. The knowledgebase that is emerging in the area of rehabilitation and recovery reinforces these idealistic philosophical commitments. The tragedies of life that call for rehabilitation and recovery call for this kind of idealism, for the real circumstances seem overwhelming. Hope and vision for a new future may be one of the greatest gifts that a nurse can bring to a person who faces a tragedy. The articles in this issues of ANS illustrate many possibilities for bringing idealistic vision to situations of despair and hopelessness. These authors bring to light a shift away from a mechanistic, \"fix-it\" approach to care, toward viewpoints and approaches to care that are rich with meaning and hope for a new life. It is my hope that these articles will inspire all of us to see new possibilities for practice and to begin to bring the best of the philosophies of rehabilitation into many aspects of nursing care.

    "abstract": "The methods that nurse scholars are developing to address the problems of our discipline are wide ranging in scope and impressive in their creativity. However, as Sandra Harding [1] has noted concerning feminist inquiry, methods in and of themselves do not account for the fruitfulness and power of the scholarly work of the discipline. Harding identified three features of feminist research that can be seen in an historic overview of feminist research. These are (1) the focus on the study of \"gender\" and its consequences, (2) the location of questions that originate in women's experiences, and (3) the practice of insisting that the researcher be placed in the same critical plane as the over subject matter. Harding notes that each of these features have important implications for the selection of method, but do not constitute or demand a unique \"feminist\" method of inquiry. As I reflected on the articles that appear in this issue of ANS, it is clear that feminist approaches to inquiry have had a significant influence on the methods and methodologies that nurses use. However, I agree with Harding that the methods themselves do not necessarily reflect approaches unique to nursing, nor do the methods account for the fruitfulness of our efforts. I believe that Harding's insights have important implications for the discipline of nursing. First, while there are instances where nursing inquiry focuses on gender as does feminist inquiry, the importance of nursing research I believe to be located in two other areas of central focus-wellness and caring. Consistently, the titles in the Table ofcontents of our major research and scholarly journals reflect that indeed, nurses are concerned with problems and questions that direct our inquiry toward promoting wellness-regardless of the processes of illness or health. At the same time, when nurses are also addressing questions and problems of how nurses can best promote wellness, their work contributes to the foundations for caring even in the most challenging of circumstances. It is the growing body of evidence concerning how to care for people in challenging circumstances that indeed distinguishes, in my view, the nature of nurse caring from what people experience as caring in their everyday lives. Analogous to Harding's identification of feminist traditions that locate questions originating in women's experiences, nurse scholars locate questions originating in the actual experience of health and illness. A single project may focus on one specific dimension of experience, but our literature taken together shows an impressive commitment to all aspects of human experience, located in the \"place\" of the person who experiences the health or illness challenge. The feminist practice of insisting that the researcher be placed in the same critical plane as the overt subject matter appears increasingly in nursing's scholarship, but I believe that this is an idea that could provide important links to bridging gaps that remain between research and practice. Increasingly, nurse researchers are involved in clinical practice, and locate their work within a practice context that is meaningful to the researcher. Making this meaningful link explicit in our work can contribute to making our efforts explicitly grounded in the nursing care contexts that we share. I appreciate Harding's insights that challenge the idea of method as being that which accounts for the uniqueness or importance of research efforts, and her caution to avoid \"methodolatry.\" At the same time, I applaud the search for the creation of sound methods that can better serve our disciplinary purposes, grounded in our search for knowledge of the whole, of health, and of caring. There are illustrations of several scholarly approaches to method, and to methodology, in this issue of ANS. I hope that you the reader will find these articles stimulating and challenging in your own search for approaches to inquiry and to practice. Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "Four grief themes that were developed in clinical practice have been explored. These themes were also prevalent in Ibsen's play Little Eyolf. The conspiracy of silence, detachment, guilt, and resolutions are themes that are prevalent in Rita and Alfred's life and, therefore, in the grieving of little Eyolf's death. These themes are family motifs present in the family's history. They must be brought into the open, in the hope of achieving a resolution at times of death. If not, future physical and mental health might be affected. In counseling the dying and their families, the nurse must explore these developing themes. Previous themes must be understood before the present ones can be confronted and resolved. These themes can then be used to gain a broader perspective into the needs, problems, and emotions of the dying and his or her family.",

There were significant differences of knowledge scores on (1) the pre‐ and posttest scores of the sophomore nursing students, and (2) the post‐test scores of the second‐year nursing students and the national undergraduate, nonmedical females.

    "abstract": "Copper Woman warned Hai Nai Yu that the world would change and times might come when Knowing would not be the same as Doing. And she told her that Trying would always be very important. [1] This issue of ANS (19:1) begins with a tribute to the life and work of Virginia Henderson. Anne Bishop and John Scudder, Jr, highlight Henderson's strong conviction that thinking and doing should be one. Henderson's conviction was uniquely and beautifully expressed in her long life of service and scholarship, contributing to a long tradition of deep knowing that thinking and doing can be unified despite the modern forces tearing them apart. Henderson knew that thinking and doing could be the same, and she tirelessly called on nurses to remember how important it is keep trying to bring them together as one. It is not a coincidence that the theme of uniting knowing and doing appears in the ancient insights of native North American women as well as throughout nursing philosophy, expressed so clearly in Henderson's work. The splits that we experience in modern technological, industrialized society are ethical and moral travesties that deeply affect the well-being of the earth and all that inhabits the earth. The mind-body split that we persistently seek to overcome in nursing is actually rooted in the split between knowing and doing. This same split is also reflected in what we decry as the theory-practice split. I submit that if we work toward uniting knowing and doing, we will at the same time address in deep and powerful ways the many other types of splits that we are at least able to recognize. Learning to know what you do and to do what you know is not an easy journey. It takes time to reflect on your actions. It requires a well-cultivated generosity of spirit toward your self and the ability to view every effort as valuable, as an opportunity to learn. I believe that the journey requires a community of people who together are willing to talk, reflect, and support one another in the trying. This is an ethical challenge because it requires courage to reach the honesty and integrity that bring knowing and doing together. Like most ethical challenges, the answers, even the possibilities, are seldom clear. But when knowing and doing come together as one, there emerges a deep intuitive knowing that leads to a place of peace with the knowing-doing. This journey is an ethical \"good,\" because healing the split brings about a wholeness, an inner integrity, an inner peace that nurtures the body-mind-spirit. The articles in this issue of ANS clearly reflect nursing's persistent moves toward ethics that unite mind and body, thinking and doing, theory and practice. I hope that as you read these articles you will find ways to take your own moves to heal the splits and to bring greater wholeness to human life and to the earth. Peggy L.

    "abstract": "Every morning I walk my dog 2 miles. Every evening before bed I spend some time in an outdoor hot tub. I describe these daily routines as therapeutic, which is probably no surprise to anyone reading this message. A large part of me resists this label; it sounds so clinical, and these things are my fun, my relaxation. At the same time I am conscious of certain and predictable experiences when I either do or do not do these things. Both of these activities are relaxing. At the same time, they are energizing. I experience an uplifting of my mind and spirit; my body is more attuned and limber than before. My general ability to cope with day-to-day challenges is clearly improved each time I walk or soak. I let go of fears and uncertainties. The best gift of all is that when I am at a loss as to what to do, or feel that my resources are depleted, during both activities some possibilities emerge and I am once again ready to move forward. But despite these clear and marvelous benefits, I cannot explain, exactly, what has created the habits or routines. The hot tub is easy-at the end of each day I have little difficulty thinking about and turning to the relaxing and warm waters of the hot tub. The walk is a different story. If it were not for my dog's chocolate brown gazing eyes, and her restless 120-lb body beckoning me to garb up and get going, I would not do it. The demands of the day often seem so pressing that I could easily (and sometimes do) skip the walk. But 10 minutes into it, I sense a shift of mood and mind to a gladness that I am outside walking and not inside stirring. These activities are for me clearly beneficial, and I need no scientific evidence to convince me that they are. I do not require specific medical or physical evidence to know that continuing their indulgence is something from which I will benefit. I cannot tell you why I walk 2 miles, or why I keep the water in the tub at 104 degrees F. I cannot explain what might happen if I ran or sat in a steam bath instead. I honestly am not interested in all the \"whys\" and \"hows.\" As a nurse, I can share my experience with others and make suggestions and recommendations about activities that might also benefit another individual. But the evidence, or the basis on which I might make these recommendations, is as yet only scant. The questions and issues for which I have no answers, or in which I have no interest where my personal \"therapeutics\" are concerned, are indeed critical for the development of nursing therapeutics. Nurses and nurse scholars have many important issues to debate around the concept of nursing therapeutics. At the same time, in today's environment and as public servants or stewards, it is time to turn collectively to developing strong scientific evidence that supports accountability for what we do and how we do it. As a discipline we need strong conviction and rationale concerning what counts as \"scientific evidence,\" pushing the boundaries of this concept outward and into more inclusive realms. But nurses need to step outside of these important debates and diligently pursue all means at our disposal-both mainstream and marginal-to gather evidence concerning our healing actions and approaches. As we do so, we will, I am convinced, have a strong voice in the public discourse concerning the future of health care. This issue of ANS contains important substantive articles contributing to the discourse about nursing therapeutics and the claims we can make concerning nursing therapeutics. It also serves to stimulate new ideas, visions of methodologic approaches, and directions for further scholarship in this area. I invite you, the reader, to write with your ideas and responses and let us all benefit from your contribution to the discourse. Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

The members of the St Luke's Alumnae Association, even in their initial statement of purpose, consistently affirmed their ties to other nurses, thus implicitly supporting the cause of trained nursing. But the cause of trained nursing was not the same as that of professional nursing. These findings support the usefulness of the “work group” paradigm vs the paradigm of professionalization in attempting to describe accurately the occupational evolution of nursing as portrayed in the minutes.",

As a psychiatric clinician at a large VA hospital in the Midwest, I found the topic timely and relevant. Often the hospitalization of the homeless veteran is little more than a reprieve from the stressful life on the street. The authors demonstrated through their research that homeless veterans can overcome hopelessness by taking an active part in treatment. The homelessness-hopelessness theory and its implications have given me a clearer picture of the dynamics involved in the predicament of homeless veterans. The prospect of breaking the cycle of despair in this underserved population is both encouraging and exciting. I plan to implement the nursing intervention used in the study to expand and enrich my nursing practice as well as improve the quality of patient care. The \"success mapping\" piece is an excellent tool for the patient to experience positive and concrete results while actively participating and directing his therapeutic goals. The researchers clearly explained Miller's powerlessness-hopelessness theory and successfully applied the theory to homeless veterans. Particularly significant is the low attrition rate from the group work. This clearly contradicts the popular belief that homeless people are apathetic and uninterested in bettering themselves. Through further research and intervention, we can work to instill hope in these people to develop the necessary skills for a productive and fulfilling life in society. Bonnie K.

For several years, I have followed the work on childbearing fatigue and dyspnea because I believed them to be middle-range theories in the making. In reading about work to combine the two models into a theory of unpleasant symptoms, I have concerns that the accessibility to clinicians of these evolving theories may be lost. I realize that the proliferation of very specific theories is problematic, but the separate theories both have broad ranges of generalization. Both lines of work have produced multiple, related concepts that begin to explain the dynamics of these two clinical phenomena. Also, the separate theories are reflective of patients' experiences and specific enough to guide interventions; both characteristics would be difficult to preserve in a more general theory. I would be interested in learning of the authors' reason for combining them as opposed to continuing to empirically develop them as separate middle-range theories.

Unless otherwise stated, we assume that letters addressed to the editor are intended for publication with your name and affiliation. As many letters as possible are published. When space is limited and we cannot publish all letters received, we select letters reflecting the range of opinions and ideas received. If a letter merits a response from an ANS author or Open Forum participant, we will obtain a reply and publish both letters.",

    "abstract": "Each time \"Critique and Replication\" has been scheduled as an issue topic for Advances in Nursing Science, I receive many questions concerning the idea of critique. The idea of replication does not draw the same attention; it seems to be an idea that is sufficiently explained in courses or texts. However, the idea of critique often elicits questions like, \"Exactly what does this mean?\" Like critical thinking, the process of scholarly critique can be variously defined. Unlike the idea of critical thinking, the conceptualization of scholarly critique has not yet become a popular debate in the discipline. There are important links between critical thinking and scholarly critique, and if debated, many arguments and distinctions now familiar in the critical thinking debate would also appear around scholarly critique. I offer a few of my musings along these lines with the hope of prompting more debate around this important process. The idea of critique is linked to the humanities, particularly literature. Dictionaries define critique in terms of evaluating literary or other works. Critique also carries the negative (in US culture) overtones of criticism or critical comment. However, scholarly activities in the humanities depend on a type of critique or criticism that moves out of the realm of negativity and arrogant judgment into a realm of deep analysis and detailed explanation that reveals knowledge beyond that of the work that is being critiqued. It is a thorough process that moves outside the bounds of the work itself to reveal broad and specific cultural, technical, social, and political meanings. It is a process that never ends, because insight and understanding grow, move, and change as scholars gain fresh perspectives with changing circumstances and contexts in their own experience. Excellent critics maintain a stance of doubt toward their own interpretations and analyses. A critic may have a fairly substantial, and at the moment seemingly accurate, technical explanation or criticism, but at the same time acknowledge possible views that could shift a technical interpretation. When critics move into interpreting cultural meanings, political significance, or other types of deep contextual relationships, their stance is typically one of wondering, of questioning, and of exploring possibilities. To the extent that the scholar conveys to others plausible possibilities, the critique itself inspires those who might pursue new work in the discipline. The critique may point toward pitfalls to be avoided. It may provide direction, even though speculative, concerning the manner of construction of a work to achieve an end-in-sight. It also may provide a novice with a model to emulate in acquiring the skills of the discipline-a model that is constructed from insights about an exemplar work that would not be obvious to most students or practitioners of the discipline. The author of the work that is the focus of the critique benefits in a number of ways from the work of the critic and in fact depends on serious critique as a measure of scholarly worth. Often, the author does not perceive many of the interpretations that are revealed through the work of the critic. The author learns of ways in which the work contributes to the discipline as seen through the lens of another scholar in the discipline. The author also benefits from the critic's perceptions of what is important in the work and what bears further development. Perhaps one explanation of why this concept remains a puzzle in nursing is that nursing scholarship has been predominantly constructed around the methods of science, where critique is not a common or well-developed process. In many sciences, the closest analogous process is the review of the literature, which is often just that-a review. Students may even be admonished to stay away from making any interpretive or analytic statements in the review of literature and simply to report the facts of what is found in the existing journals and texts. Certainly, speculation in the review that might reveal meanings such as social or political relationships, or the motives of the authors being reviewed, are not seen as pertinent or desirable and are not viewed as contributing further to the discipline. Debates about meaning often are not admissible, particularly when the science is based on mathematical models. To make a meaningful activity of critique for the discipline of nursing, I believe that a shift embracing the humanities is required. I submit that science itself benefits from, and in fact draws on, the activities of critique even though these activities may not be visible in the scientific literature. At this time of exploring methods and approaches to scholarship that are well suited to developing theory and knowledge in nursing, critique itself could offer important new possibilities, especially if the method of critique is openly explored, debated, and published. I hope that several of the articles in this issue of ANS will inspire such development. Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

    "abstract": "The concept of crisis is important to nursing; yet, discrepancies exist in the way the term is viewed conceptually and applied clinically. This lack of clarity makes systematic research more difficult. In this article, crisis intervention theory is used to describe the concept of emotional crisis. Traditional and more recent constitutive definitions are discussed using related theories of stress and threat. The utility of crisis for nursing is outlined with a focus on crisis as a continuous entity as opposed to the dichotomous variable it is often considered to be. Implications for research and clinical practice are explored.",

This article reviews competency measurement models from the disciplines of law, medicine, and philosophy and compares the usefulness of these tests and criteria. Conclusions are stated about the use of these models in nursing to evaluate the patient's autonomous state.",

The technique of concept analysis was used to develop four criteria for the diagnosis of a client as having attributes congruent with the concept of crisis and to differentiate crisis from related concepts, eg, stress and emergency. Variations of a model case were developed to illustrate what crisis is and what it is not. Antecedents, consequents, and empirical referents for crisis are also identified.",
