In this paper, I review the material presented in a series of three introductory lectures. I review the derivation of ideal and second-order viscous hydrodynamics from kinetic theory. I then show how to extend the methods used to a system that can be highly anisotropic in local-rest-frame momenta. I close by discussing recent work on this topic and then present an outlook to the future.",

Additional mixing within one ensemble between matrices and their inverses is also covered. Exact determinantal and Pfaffian expressions are given in terms of the respective kernels of orthogonal polynomials or functions. Here we list all known cases and some straightforward generalisations. The asymptotic results for large matrix size include new microscopic universality classes at the origin and a generalisation of weak non-unitarity close to the unit circle. So far in all other parts of the spectrum the known standard universality classes have been identified. In the limit of infinite products the Lyapunov and stability exponents share the same normal distribution. To leading order they both follow a permanental point processes.

    "abstract": "The motor protein kinesin literally walks on two legs along the biopolymer microtubule as it hydrolyzes ATP for its fuel supply.The fraction of accidental backsteps that kinesin takes appears to be about seven orders of magnitude larger than what one would expect given the amount of free energy that ATP hydrolysis makes available.This is puzzling, as more than a billion years of natural selection should have optimized the motor protein for its speed and efficiency.With an imagined device, Szilard has shown that the dissipation of information can drive motion.A higher backstepping probability creates more randomness in the walk and, consequently, leads to production of more entropy.If the product state of a transition has a higher entropy, then the free energy of that product state is lower.With the free energy that is made available by the production of \"backstepping entropy\", the catalytic cycle of the kinesin can be speeded up.We show quantitatively how the actually measured backstepping rate represents an optimum at which maximal net forward speed is achieved.We, furthermore, show how this thermodynamic mechanism can realistically operate on a biomolecular level.The results suggest that kinesin uses backstepping as a source of energy and that natural selection has manipulated the backstepping rate to optimize kinesin's speed.",

This may have much deeper drawback than anticipated so far. The impact on the running of the SM gauge, Yukawa and Higgs couplings up to the Planck scale has been discussed in several articles recently. Here we consider the impact on the running masses and we discuss the role of quadratic divergences within the Standard Model. The change of sign of the coefficient of the quadratically divergent terms showing up at about mu_0 ~ 1.4 x 10^16 GeV may be understood as a first order phase transition restoring the symmetric phase, while its large negative values at lower scales triggers the Higgs mechanism, running parameters evolve in such a way that the symmetry is restored two orders of magnitude before the Planck scale. Thus, the electroweak phase transition takes place at the scale mu_0 and not at the electroweak scale v ~ 250 GeV. The SM Higgs system and its phase transition could play a key role for the inflation of the early universe. Also baryogenesis has to be reconsidered under the aspect that perturbative arguments surprisingly work up to the Planck scale.",

Recent high precision measurements (0.54ppm) at Brookhaven reveal a ``discrepancy'' by 3 standard deviations from the electroweak Standard Model which could be a hint for an unknown contribution from physics beyond the Standard Model. This triggered numerous speculations about the possible origin of the ``missing piece''. The remarkable 14-fold improvement of the previous CERN experiment, actually animated a multitude of new theoretical efforts which lead to a substantial improvement of the prediction of a_mu. The dominating uncertainty of the prediction, caused by strong interaction effects, could be reduced substantially, due to new hadronic cross section measurements in electron-positron annihilation at low energies. After an introduction and a brief description of the principle of the experiment, I present a major update and review the status of the theoretical prediction and discuss the role of the hadronic vacuum polarization effects and the hadronic light--by--light scattering contribution. Prospects for the future will be briefly discussed. As, in electroweak precision physics, the muon g-2 shows the largest established deviation between theory and experiment at present, it will remain one of the hot topics for further investigations.",

The spinorial affine connection is given in terms of the spin connection $\\omega_{abi}$ and spin operator $\\bar{s}_{ab}$ by the formula ${\\mit\\Gamma}_i=-\\omega_{abi}\\bar{s}^{\\,ab}$/4, which follows from the assumption that the curved-space gamma matrices $\\gamma_i$ are covariantly constant, and which we prove to be equivalent to the `tetrad postulate' of van Nieuwenhuizen, that the tetrad $t_i^{\\;\\;a}$ is covariantly constant. The intermediate result that $\\gamma_k{\\mit\\Gamma}_i^{\\dagger}\\gamma^{\\,k}=0$ is also proven. Extension to dimensionality $D$ is straightforward, and results in the formula $\\widehat{\\mit\\Gamma}_{I}=-\\hat{\\omega}_{abI}\\widehat{\\bar{s}}^{\\,ab}$/4 for the spinorial connection.

    "abstract": "During last decade a number of detailed analyses of flavour observables and of their correlations within more than a dozen specific BSM models have been performed at the TUM. One of the goals of these analyses was to investigate which model is capable of obtaining large mixing induced CP asymmetry in the B_s system, S_{psi phi}, and to find out what this would imply for other flavour observables. In this context also the rare decays B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- have been considered. In some models their branching ratios can be enhanced by orders of magnitude above the SM expectations. The recent data on S_{psi phi} and B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- from the LHCb put an end to these very optimistic hopes modifying significantly the allowed patterns of deviations from SM predictions for flavour observables in concrete BSM models. We make a first semi-quantitative assessment of the most important modifications in the predictions of the BSM models in question including also recently analyzed models and taking into account the most recent lattice input. For some BSM models the LHCb data turned out to be a relief. On the other hand the SM, models with CMFV and MFV models without flavour blind phases appear to have significant difficulties in describing all Delta F=2 observables in B_{s,d} and K^0 meson systems simultaneously. We propose to regard the stringent CMFV relations between various observables as standard candels of flavour physics. The pattern of deviations from these relations may help in identifying the correct NP scenario.",

    "abstract": "The Jagiellonian Positron Emission Tomograph (J-PET) was constructed as a prototype of the cost-effective scanner for the simultaneous metabolic imaging of the whole human body. Being optimized for the detection of photons from the electron-positron annihilation with high time- and high angular-resolution, it constitutes a multi-purpose detector providing new opportunities for studying the decays of positronium atoms. Positronium is the lightest purely leptonic object decaying into photons. As an atom bound by a central potential it is a parity eigenstate, and as an atom built out of an electron and an anti-electron it is an eigenstate of the charge conjugation operator. Therefore, the positronium is a unique laboratory to study discrete symmetries whose precision is limited in principle by the effects due to the weak interactions expected at the level of (~10$^{-14}$) and photon-photon interactions expected at the level of (~10$^{-9}$). The J-PET detector enables to perform tests of discrete symmetries in the leptonic sector via the determination of the expectation values of the discrete-symmetries-odd operators, which may be constructed from the spin of ortho-positronium atom and the momenta and polarization vectors of photons originating from its annihilation. In this article we present the potential of the J-PET detector to test the C, CP, T and CPT symmetries in the decays of positronium atoms.",

In particular, it is expected that the search should answer the question whether the critical point of strongly interacting matter exists and, if it does, where it is located. First, the search strategies are presented and a short introduction is given to expected fluctuation signals and to the quantities used by experiments to detect th The most important background effects are also discussed. Second, relevant experimental results are summarized and discussed. It is intriguing that both the fluctuations of quantities integrated over the full experimental acceptance (event multiplicity and transverse momentum) as well as the bin size dependence of the second factorial moment of pion and proton multiplicities in medium-sized Si+Si collisions at 158A GeV/c suggest critical behaviour of the created matter. These results provide strong motivation for the ongoing systematic scan of the phase diagram by the NA61/SHINE experiment at the SPS and the continuing search at the Brookhaven Relativistic Hadron Collider.",

The investigated time series are recorded both at a daily time horizon and at a 5-minute time horizon. The correlation coefficient matrix is very different at different time horizons confirming that more structured correlation coefficient matrices are observed for long time horizons. All the considered methods are able to detect economic information and the presence of clusters characterized by the economic sector of stocks. However different methods present a different degree of sensitivity with respect to different sectors.

We consider the archetype cases of a damped harmonic oscillator and a free quantum Brownian particle. A main finding is that quantum dissipation helps to ensure the validity of the Third Law. For the quantum oscillator, finite damping replaces the zero-coupling result of an exponential suppression of the specific heat at low temperatures by a power-law behavior. Rather intriguing is the behavior of the free quantum Brownian particle. In this case, quantum dissipation is able to restore the Third Law: Instead of being constant down to zero temperature, the specific heat now vanishes proportional to temperature with an amplitude that is inversely proportional to the ohmic dissipation strength. A distinct subtlety of finite quantum dissipation is the result that the various thermodynamic functions of the sub-system do not only depend on the dissipation strength but depend as well on the prescription employed in their definition.",

The relation of such description to that of the physical (relativistic) observer is established via the fluid/gravity correspondence map, the related issues, such as the induced gravity and scalar field, relativistic postulates, Mach's principle and cosmology, are discussed. For estimate the values of the generated masses of the otherwise massless particles such as the photon, we propose few simple models which take into account small vacuum fluctuations. It turns out that the photon's mass can be naturally expressed in terms of the elementary electrical charge and the extensive length parameter of the nonlinearity.

    "abstract": "The motor protein kinesin literally walks on two legs along the biopolymer microtubule as it hydrolyzes ATP for its fuel supply.The fraction of accidental backsteps that kinesin takes appears to be about seven orders of magnitude larger than what one would expect given the amount of free energy that ATP hydrolysis makes available.This is puzzling, as more than a billion years of natural selection should have optimized the motor protein for its speed and efficiency.With an imagined device, Szilard has shown that the dissipation of information can drive motion.A higher backstepping probability creates more randomness in the walk and, consequently, leads to production of more entropy.If the product state of a transition has a higher entropy, then the free energy of that product state is lower.With the free energy that is made available by the production of \"backstepping entropy\", the catalytic cycle of the kinesin can be speeded up.We show quantitatively how the actually measured backstepping rate represents an optimum at which maximal net forward speed is achieved.We, furthermore, show how this thermodynamic mechanism can realistically operate on a biomolecular level.The results suggest that kinesin uses backstepping as a source of energy and that natural selection has manipulated the backstepping rate to optimize kinesin's speed.",

It is also shown that Tsallis distributions can be obtained directly from Shannon information entropy, provided some special constraints are imposed. They are connected with the type of dynamical processes under consideration (additive or multiplicative). Finally, it is shown how a Tsallis distribution can accommodate the log-oscillating behavior apparently seen in some multiparticle data.",

    "abstract": "The effects of different forms of the sound-velocity function c_s(T) on the hydrodynamic evolution of matter created in the central region of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions are studied. At high temperatures (above the critical temperature T_c) we use the sound velocity function obtained from the recent lattice simulations of QCD, whereas at low temperatures we use the ideal hadron gas model. At moderate temperatures different interpolations between those two results are employed. They are characterized by different values of the local maximum (at T = 0.4 T_c) and local minimum (at T=T_c). The extreme values are chosen in such a way that at high temperature all considered sound-velocity functions yield the entropy density consistent with the lattice simulations of QCD. We find that the presence of a distinct minimum of the sound velocity leads to a very long (~ 20 fm/c) evolution time of the system. Since such long evolution times are not compatible with the recent estimates based on the HBT interferometry, we conclude that the hydrodynamic description becomes adequate if the QCD cross-over phase transition renders the smooth temperature variations of the sound velocity, with a possible shallow minimum at T_c where the values of c_s^2(T) remain well above 0.1.",

The quest is then to reliably evaluate the time series of individual trajectories.

We here discuss for two different models of anomalous diffusion the detailed behaviour of time averaged mean squared displacement and related quantities, and present possible criteria to analyse single particle trajectories. An important finding is that although the time average may suggest normal diffusion the actual process may in fact be subdiffusive.",

    "abstract": "Continuum spectra can be a way out to alleviate the tension generated by the elusiveness of narrow resonances of new physics in direct experimental searches. Motivated by the latter, we consider the linear dilaton model with a continuum spectrum of KK modes. It is provided by a critical exponential bulk potential for the scalar field stabilizing the distance, between the UV boundary at $y=0$ and a naked (good) singularity at $y=y_s$, in proper coordinates, which corresponds in conformal coordinates to $z_s\\to\\infty$. The cutoff $M_s$ in this theory is an intermediate scale $M_s\\simeq 10^{-5}M_{\\rm Pl}$ and the warped factor solves the hierarchy between $M_s$ and the TeV, while the hierarchy between $M_{\\rm Pl}$ and $M_s$ has to be solved by a (Little) String Theory with coupling $g_s\\simeq 10^{-5}$. The Standard Model is localized on a 4D IR brane. The graviton and radion Green's and spectral functions have a continuum of states with a TeV mass gap, and isolated poles consisting on the 4D graviton and the light radion/dilaton. We construct the effective field theory below the mass gap where the continua of KK modes are integrated out, generating a set of dimension eight operators which contribute to low energy electroweak precision observables, and high energy violation of unitarity in vector boson scattering processes. The radion mass depends on the stabilizing UV brane potential and its wave function is localized toward the IR which enhances its coupling with the SM fields.",

For practical applications, one often wishes to estimate Σp in order to understand the dependence structure of the predictors, do various tests etc. Here the sample covariance matrix XX/n plays a key role. (Of course, in practice, it is often computed as (X− X)∗(X− X)/(n−1), where X stands for the column-wise mean of the matrix X, but for the sake of this note we will assume that the entries are centered.) One most important statistical application in which eigenvalues of the covariance matrix play a key role is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It is a linear dimensionality reduction procedure, which can also be thought of as a model selection technique. The idea is as follows. We are interested in recovering as much of the total variance in the data as possible while reducing the dimensionality of the problem from p to k. In other words, we",

The Inner Tracker, a very light detector (material budget $<2\\%X_{0}$), is one of the new subdetectors and it is composed of 4 cylindrical triple-GEM with a stereo X-V strips/pads readout. The commissioning phase of the Inner Tracker consists in the characterization of the detector response and in its performance evaluation. The method used to evaluate its detection efficiency is reported, together with some preliminary results.",

The topics include hydrodynamization time scale, holographic collisions, as well as hydrodynamization from the point of view of the asymptotic character of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion.

Our strategy is to first look at what we know, from independent considerations, about the analytical density dependence of the energy of nuclear matter and then, for practical applications, to obtain an appropriate density-dependent effective interaction by reverse engineering. In a previous work on homogeneous matter, we identified the most essential terms to include in our \"KIDS\" functional, named after the early-stage participating institutes.

The solutions are compared with the predictions of the anisotropic hydrodynamics describing a mixture of anisotropic fluids. We find that the solutions of the kinetic equations can be well reproduced by anisotropic hydrodynamics if the initial distribution are oblate for both quarks and gluons. On the other hand, the solutions of the kinetic equations have a different qualitative behavior from those obtained in anisotropic hydrodynamics if the initial configurations are oblate-prolate or prolate-prolate. This suggests that an extension of the anisotropic hydrodynamics scheme for the mixture of anisotropic fluids is needed, where higher moments of the kinetic equations are used and present simplifications are avoided.",

Increasingly sophisticated simulations reveal a shock that stalls for hundreds of milliseconds before reviving. Though brought back to life by neutrino heating, the development of the supernova explosion is inextricably linked to multi-dimensional fluid flows. In this paper, the outcomes of three-dimensional simulations that include sophisticated nuclear physics and spectral neutrino transport are juxtaposed to learn about the nature of the three dimensional fluid flow that shapes the explosion. Comparison is also made between the results of simulations in spherical symmetry from several groups, to give ourselves confidence in the understanding derived from this juxtaposition.",

The possibility of oscillation of particles produced together with kaons or neutrinos is considered in full wave packet quantum mechanics language. Precise definition of the oscillation of particles which recoil against mixed states is given. The general amplitude which describes the oscillation of two particles in the final states is found.

    "abstract": "We study the decay law for a moving unstable particle. The usual time-dilatation formula states that the decay width for an unstable state moving with a momentum $p$ and mass $M$ is $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{p}=\\Gamma M/\\sqrt{p^{2}+M^{2}}$ with $\\Gamma$ being the decay width in the rest frame. In agreement with previous studies, we show that in the context of QM as well as QFT this equation is \\textit{not} correct provided that the quantum measurement is performed in a reference frame in which the unstable particle has momentum $p$ (note, a momentum eigenstate is \\textit{not} a velocity eigenstate in QM). We then give, to our knowledge for the first time, an analytic expression of an improved formula and we show that the deviation from $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{p}$ has a maximum for $p/M=\\sqrt{2/3},$ but is typically \\textit{very} small. Then, the result can be easily generalized to a momentum wave packet and also to an arbitrary initial state. Here, we give a very general expression of the non-decay probability. As a next step, we show that care is needed when one makes a boost of an unstable state with zero momentum/velocity: namely, the resulting state has zero overlap with the elements of the basis of unstable states (it is already decayed!). However, when considering a spread in velocity, one finds again that $\\tilde{\\Gamma }_{p}$ is typically a very good approximation. The study of a velocity wave-packet represents an interesting subject which constitutes one of the main outcomes of the present manuscript.\\textbf{ }In the end, it should be stressed that there is no whatsoever breaking of special relativity, but as usual in QM, one should specify which kind of measurement on which kind of state is performed.",

We develop the theoretical description of this source, and in particular study QCD based processes of strangeness production in the deconfined, thermal quark-gluon plasma phase, allowing for approach to chemical equilibrium and dynamical evolution. We also address thermal charm production. Using a rapid hadronization model we obtain final state particle yields, providing detailed theoretical predictions about strange particle spectra and yields as function of heavy ion energy. Our presentation is comprehensive and self-contained: we introduce in considerable detail the procedures used in data interpretation, discuss the particular importance of selected experimental results and show how they impact the theoretical developments.",

    "abstract": "As is well-known, Newton’s gravitational theory can be formulated as a four-dimensional space-time theory and follows as singular limit from Einstein’s theory, if the velocity of light tends to the infinity. Here ’singular’ stands for the fact, that the limiting geometrical structure differs from a regular Riemannian space-time. Geometrically, the transition Einstein → Newton can be viewed as an ’opening’ of the light cones. This picture suggests that there might be other singular limits of Einstein’s theory: Let all light cones shrink and ultimately become part of a congruence of singular world lines. The limiting structure may be considered as a nullhypersurface embedded in a five-dimensional spacetime. While the velocity of light tends to zero here, all other velocities tend to the velocity of light. Thus one may speak of an ultrarelativistic limit of General Relativity. The resulting theory is as simple as Newton’s gravitational theory, with the basic difference, that Newton’s elliptic differential equation is replaced by essentially ordinary differential equations, with derivatives tangent to the generators of the singular congruence. The Galilei group is replaced by the Carroll group introduced by Levy-Leblond. We suggest to study near ultrarelativistic situations with a perturbational approach starting from the singular structure, similar to post-Newtonian expansions in the c → ∞ case.",

On the other hand, our analysis of the ratios Rc and Rn of the CP-averaged branching ratios of the charged and neutral B ! �K modes, respectively, suggested new physics (NP) in the electroweak penguin sector, which may have a powerful interplay with rare decays. In this paper, we confront our strategy with recent experimental developments, addressing also the direct CP violation in Bd ! � ∓ K ± , which is now an established effect, the relation to its counterpart in B ± ! � 0 K ± , and the first results for the direct CP asymmetry of Bd ! � 0 � 0 that turn out to be in agreement with our prediction. We obtain hadronic B ! ��,�K parameters which are almost unchanged and arrive at an allowed region for the unitarity triangle in perfect accordance with the SM. The “B ! �K puzzle” persists, and can still be explained through NP, as in our previous analysis. In fact, the recently observed shifts in the experimental values of Rc and Rn have been predicted in our framework on the basis of constraints from rare decays. Conversely, we obtain a moderate deviation of the ratio R of the CP-averaged Bd ! � ∓ K ± and B ± ! � ± K rates from the current experimental value. However, using the emerging signals for B ± ! K ± K modes, this effect can be attributed to certain hadronic effects, which have a minor impact on Rc and do not at all affect Rn. Our results for rare decays remain unchanged.",

    "abstract": "We consider models for control of epidemics on local, global, small-world and scale-free networks, with only partial information accessible about the status of individuals and their connections. The effectiveness of local (e.g. ring vaccination or culling) vs global (e.g. random vaccination) control measures is evaluated, with the aim of minimising the total cost of an epidemic. The costs include direct costs of treating infected individuals as well as costs of treatment. We first consider a random (global) vaccination strategy designed to stop any potential outbreak. We show that if the costs of the preventive vaccination are ignored, the optimal strategy is to vaccinate the whole population, although most of the resources are wasted on preventing a small number of cases. If the vaccination costs are included, or if a local strategy (within a certain neighbourhood of a symptomatic individual) is chosen, there is an optimum number of treated individuals. Inclusion of non-local contacts ('small-worlds' or scale-free networks) increases the levels of preventive (random) vaccination and radius of local treatment necessary for stopping the outbreak at a minimal cost. The number of initial foci also influences our choice of optimal strategy. The size of epidemics and the number of treated individuals increase for outbreaks that are initiated from a larger number of initial foci, but the optimal radius of local control actually decreases. The results are important for designing control strategies based on cost effectiveness.",

We explore the regime of validity of this result and discuss its relation to spectral features of the environment. We also consider its relevance to the experiments on the so-called Loschmidt (which measures, in effect, the fidelity between the initial and time-reversed or echo signal). In particular, we show that for partial reversals (e.g., when of only a part of the total Hamiltonian changes sign) fidelity will exhibit a Gaussian dependence on the time of reversal. In such cases may become independent of the details of the reversal procedure or the specifics of the coupling to the environment. This puzzling behavior was observed in several NMR experiments. Natural candidates for such two environments (one of which is easily reversed, while the other is ``irreversible'') are suggested for the experiment involving ferrocene.",

The relationship between path statistics and Quantum Mechanics (QM) leads to two canonical ways of defining random walk on a graph, which have different statistics and hence different entropies. Generic random walk (GRW) is in correspondence with the field-theoretical formalism, whereas maximal entropy random walk (MERW), introduced by us in a recent work, is motivated by the Feynman path-integral formulation of QM. GRW maximizes entropy locally (neighbors are chosen with equal probabilities), in contrast to MERW which does so globally (all paths of given length and endpoints are equally probable). The stationary distribution for MERW is given by the ground state of a quantum-mechanical problem where nodes whose degree is smaller than average act as repulsive impurities. We investigate static and dynamical properties GRW and MERW in a variety of examples in one and two dimensions. The most spectacular difference arises in the case of weakly diluted lattices, where a particle performing MERW gets eventually trapped in the largest nearly spherical region which is free of impurities. We put forward a quantitative explanation of this localization effect in terms of a classical Lifshitz phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "After a succinct review of the MOND paradigm -with its phenomenology, and its various underlying theories -I concentrate on so-called modified inertia (MI) formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention.These share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed relation.My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ substantially from their \"modified-gravity\" (MG) kin in predicting other phenomena.Because MI theories are nonlocal in time, MOND effects depend on the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG theories.This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not only on the instantaneous value.And, it is even possible to construct MI theories with practically no EFE.Other predictions that may differ are also discussed.Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia formulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these points.",

As such it played a prominent role in particle physics already for 45 years. Due to the smallness of $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ its measurement required heroic efforts in the 1980s and the 1990s on both sides of the Atlantic with final results presented by NA48 and KTeV collaborations 20 years ago. Unfortunately, even 45 years after the first calculation of $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ we do not know to which degree the Standard Model agrees with this data and how large is the room left for new physics contributions to this ratio. This is due to significant non-perturbative (hadronic) uncertainties accompanied by partial cancellation between the QCD penguin contributions and electroweak penguin contributions. While the significant control over the short distance perturbative effects has been achieved already in the early 1990s, with several improvements since then, different views on the non-perturbative contributions to $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ have been expressed by different authors over last thirty years. In fact even today the uncertainty in the room left for NP contributions to $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ is very significant. My own work on $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ started in 1983 and involved both perturbative and non-perturbative calculations. This writing is a non-technical recollection of the steps which led to the present status of $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ including several historical remarks not known to everybody. The present status of the $\\Delta I=1/2$ rule is also summarized. This story is dedicated to Jean-Marc Gerard on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of our collaboration and his 64th birthday.",

We improve the estimates of various long-range matrix elements and discuss the obtained numerical effects for the unpolarised elastic cross section.

    "abstract": "One method for deriving a factorization for QCD processes is to use successive integration over fields in the functional integral. In this approach, we separate the fields into two categories: dynamical fields with momenta above a relevant cutoff, and background fields with momenta below the cutoff. The dynamical fields are then integrated out in the background of the low-momentum background fields. This strategy works well at tree level, allowing us to quickly derive QCD factorization formulas at leading order. However, to extend the approach to higher loops, it is necessary to rigorously define the functional integral over dynamical fields in an arbitrary background field. This framework was carefully developed for the calculation of the effective action in a background field at the two-loop level in the classic paper by Abbott «The Background Field Method Beyond One Loop», &lt;span class=\"it\"&gt;Nucl. Phys. B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"bf\"&gt;185&lt;/span&gt;, 189 (1981). Building on this work, I specify the renormalized background-field Lagrangian and define the notion of the quantum average of an operator in a background field, consistent with the “separation of scales” scheme mentioned earlier. As examples, I discuss the evolution of the twist-2 gluon light-ray operator and the one-loop gluon propagator in a background field near the light cone.

    "abstract": "The detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences is impacting our knowledge of stellar-origin compact objects. In particular, gravitational waves from neutron stars encode key information about the nature of matter at nuclear densities and above. Its gravitational-wave spectrum is linked to neutron star properties and can be used to impose constraints on the equation of state, complementing those obtained by electromagnetic observations or heavy-ion experiments. In turn, those constraints can be used to infer key properties as the masses and radii of neutron stars, their tidal deformability, or their moment of inertia. Numerical simulations of neutron stars, either in compact binary systems or those formed in supernova explosions, are fundamental to assist in the detection of the gravitational waves they emit. Simulations are also essential for understanding their formation in highly dynamical events and assessing the role they play across various fields: relativistic astrophysics (as the central engine of gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae), gravitational physics (as prime sources of gravitational waves), cosmology (as standard sirens), and nuclear physics (to constrain the equation of state). In this article, we review the prospects to detect gravitational waves from two “types” of neutron stars — the hypermassive neutron star resulting from the merger of two neutron stars in a binary system, and the proto-neutron star born after the gravitational collapse of the core of a sufficiently massive progenitor star. Moreover, we also discuss ongoing efforts to infer parameters of the source from the analysis of the gravitational-wave signals and the wealth of physical information that can potentially be extracted.

Subsequently, the ability of the vibron model to reproduce the experimental data is extended to a wider region of heavy nuclei belonging to the rare-earth and actinide regions.

This approach allows one to simultaneously describe the alternating-parity spectrum of different bands of these nuclei. In this case, the values of the parameters of quadrupole and octupole triaxiality go beyond the traditional characteristic values of separate consideration of these deformations: \\(\\gamma _{\\rm eff}\\) (\\(0\\leq \\gamma _{\\rm eff}\\leq \\frac {\\pi }{6}\\)) and \\(\\eta _{\\rm eff}\\) (\\(0\\leq \\eta _{\\rm eff}\\leq \\frac {\\pi }{2}\\)). To identify the reasons for these differences, we studied the behavior of low-lying energy levels of a rigid asymmetric rotator with alternating parity depending on the angular variable of the polar coordinates \\(\\varepsilon _0\\) for fixed values of the triaxiality parameters \\(\\gamma _{\\rm eff}\\) and \\(\\eta _{\\rm eff}\\). We determined the region of experimentally observed energy levels with alternating parity corresponding to the given values of the triaxial parameters \\(\\gamma _{\\rm eff}\\) and \\(\\eta _{\\rm eff}\\) for different values of the angular parameter \\(\\varepsilon _0\\).

    "abstract": "The search for Higgs bosons in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) started intensively at the Large Electron–Positron (LEP) collider, which operated from 1989 to 2000, and later at the Tevatron from 2001 to 2011. In 2012, with the discovery of a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a new era began. This allowed for precision measurements of the Higgs boson properties which, so far, are all consistent with the SM expectations. Many searches for predicted BSM Higgs bosons advanced the field of experimental Higgs boson physics. The LHC already operated in three running periods: Run 1 from 2010 to 2012, Run 2 from 2015 to 2018, and currently Run 3 from 2022 to 2026. The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) operation is foreseen from 2030. The prospects of experimental Higgs boson research for the next decade are reviewed.

The obtained Hamiltonian differs from the previously known expression for quadrupole vibrations only in the coefficients before the differentiation operators \\(\\partial /\\partial \\gamma \\) and \\(\\partial /\\partial \\eta \\). This is due to the difference in the components of the moment of inertia tensor of the nucleus for quadrupole and octupole modes.

The analytical formulas for the control functions are derived from two established theorems in order to perform these types of synchronization. These new types of synchronization are considered a generalization of various types disccussed in the literature. Numerous applications in engineering and physics may benefit from these new types of synchronization, &lt;span class=\"it\"&gt;e.g.&lt;/span&gt; , image encryption and electronic circuits. Using the active control technique for the choice \\(N=5\\), we study two examples of 5CS and 5CCS in 12 and 17 different chaotic models. The analytical forms of the control functions are used and good agreement is found. The Runge–Kutta method of order four is used in our numerical simulations. Other examples can be similarly studied. We designed an electronic circuit for the proposed \\(N\\)-tuple compound synchronization in 12 different chaotic models. Using &lt;span class=\"sf\"&gt;MATLAB/Simulink&lt;/span&gt;, both numerical and simulation results show good agreement. For other drive models, similar circuit implementations can be created.

    "abstract": "A factorization theorem for the hard coherent processes involving high-energy scattering of photons is derived. We elaborate the treatment for the case of the longitudinally polarized photons and extend the treatment to the case of the processes initiated by transversely polarized photons, as well as to the coherent photo-production of heavy quarkonia. A wave function of a hadron being the solution of the Schrödinger equation is presented in the space-time evolution of initially zero-size and zero-color charge wave packet of bare quarks and gluons. The increase of the running coupling constant in QCD with the distance leads to the coexistence of two phases within the hadron wave function. One phase is the pQCD phase, the second phase is dominated by the phenomenon of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. The critical line at \\(r=r_{\\mathrm {c}}\\) follows from the gauge symmetry, asymptotic freedom, causality, quantum diffusion, and from the cancellation of soft color fields outside the wave packet. The distinctive properties of QCD are the significant probability of a high-momentum tail of the minimal Fock component (MFC) of the hadron wave function and the strong suppression of the soft part of MFC of hadron WF in the strong coupling regime of QCD. The factorization theorems predict hard coherent processes, color transparency, color fluctuations phenomena, &lt;span class=\"it\"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;. We argue that the value of the radius of the region occupied by the pQCD phase, \\(r_{\\mathrm {c}}\\), is restricted by the radius of the onset of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry \\(r_{\\mathrm {c}}\\gg r_{\\mathrm {CS}}\\). The success of the constituent quark model for a baryon suggests that the radius of the confinement of color is significantly larger than \\(r_{\\mathrm {c}}\\). The presence of a color core in hadrons matches well with preQCD field theories at distances larger than the critical line for the onset of the regime of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. It substitutes Landau nullification of the interaction within preQCD field theories, the preQCD Feynman model at the distances smaller than \\(r_{\\mathrm {c}}\\).

Our analysis takes into account the perturbative QCD effects, dominating at high momenta (or low transverse coordinate \\(b\\)), the effects of Chiral Perturbation Theory, dominating at low momenta (high \\(b\\)), and meson dominance in the intermediate region. We incorporate constraints form analyticity, leading to sum rules for the spectral densities of the corresponding form factors, which &lt;span class=\"it\"&gt;ia.&lt;/span&gt; are relevant for the high-momentum (or the low-\\(b\\)) asymptotics. With the obtained high- and low-\\(b\\) behavior, we deduce that the scalar (trace-anomaly) gravitational transverse density \\({\\mit \\Theta }^{\\mu }_\\mu (b)\\) must change the sign, unlike the case of the positive definite \\(J^+(b)\\) or \\({\\mit \\Theta }^{++}(b)\\). We also discuss the transverse pressure in the pion, which is positive and singular at low \\(b\\), and negative at high \\(b\\), in harmony with the stability criterion.

The LEPS2 detector system features significant improvements in acceptance for multi-particle final states compared to previous experiments. Our search employs two complementary strategies: direct production in the \\(\\gamma n \\to K^-{\\mit \\Theta }^+\\) reaction using a liquid deuterium target with a photon beam up to 2.4 GeV, and \\(\\bar {K}^{*0}\\)-associated \\({\\mit \\Theta }^+\\) production using a liquid hydrogen target with a photon beam up to 2.9 GeV. The extended acceptance covers both forward and large-angle regions, effectively spanning the kinematic regions explored by previous LEPS and CLAS experiments. The large acceptance and improved resolution of LEPS2, combined with these complementary approaches, provide unprecedented sensitivity for establishing the existence of the \\({\\mit \\Theta }^+\\) or placing definitive upper limits on its production.

We focus on his seminal 1997 work with Diakonov and Petrov that predicted the \\({\\mit \\Theta }^+\\) pentaquark, a breakthrough that initiated an intense period of research in hadron physics. The field faced a significant setback when the CLAS Collaboration at Jefferson Lab reported null results in 2006, leading to a dramatic decline in light-pentaquark research. Nevertheless, Maxim maintained his scientific conviction, supported by continued positive signals from the DIANA and LEPS collaborations. Through recent experimental findings on the \\({\\mit \\Theta }^+\\) and the nucleon-like resonance \\(N^*(1685)\\), we examine how Polyakov’s theoretical insights, particularly the prediction of a narrow width (\\({\\mit \\Gamma } \\approx 0.5\\)–\\(1.0\\) MeV), remain relevant to our understanding of the \\({\\mit \\Theta }^+\\) light pentaquark.

    "abstract": "By analogy with the Ginzburg–Landau theory of multi-band superconductors with inner (interband) Josephson couplings, we formulate the three-band Glashow–Weinberg–Salam model with weak Josephson couplings between strongly asymmetrical condensates of scalar (Higgs) fields. Unlike the usual single-band model, we found three Higgs bosons corresponding to the three generations of particles. Moreover, the heaviest of these bosons corresponds to the already discovered \\(H\\)-boson and decays into fermions of only the third generation through the Yukawa interaction. The other two decay into fermions of the first and second generations, but they are difficult to observe due to very poor production conditions. We found two sterile ultra-light Leggett bosons, the Bose condensates of which form the dark halos of galaxies and their clusters (&lt;span class=\"it\"&gt;i.e.&lt;/span&gt; so-called Dark Matter). The masses of the Leggett bosons are determined by the coefficient of the interband coupling and can be arbitrarily small (\\(\\sim 10^{-20}\\) eV) due to non-perturbativeness of the interband coupling. Since propagation of the Leggett bosons is not accompanied by a current, these bosons are not absorbed by gauge fields, unlike the common-mode Goldstone bosons. Three coupled condensates of the scalar fields are related to the existence of three generations of leptons, where each generation interacts with the corresponding condensate getting mass. The interflavor mixing between the generations of active neutrinos and sterile right-handed neutrinos in the three-band system causes the existence of mass states of neutrino without interaction with the Higgs condensates.

For the \\(\\gamma \\gamma \\) processes, extensions of the Standard Model amplitudes are implemented in the &lt;span class=\"sf\"&gt;TauSpinner&lt;/span&gt; program. This is mainly with the electric and magnetic dipole moments in mind, however the algorithm can easily be extended to other New Physics interactions, provided they can be encapsulated into the similar form-factors in the Standard Model structure of matrix elements. Basic formulas and algorithm principles are presented, and numerical examples are provided for illustration. Information on how to use the program is given in Appendix of the paper.

    "abstract": "This paper discusses multi-particle production in QCD and in gravity at ultrarelativistic energies, their double-copy relations, and strong parallels in emergent shockwave dynamics. Dispersive techniques are applied to derive the BFKL equation for multi-gluon production in Regge asymptotics. Identical methods apply in gravity and are captured by a gravitational Lipatov equation. The building blocks in both cases are Lipatov vertices and reggeized propagators satisfying double-copy relations; in gravity, Weinberg’s soft theorem is recovered as a limit of the Lipatov framework. BFKL evolution in QCD generates wee parton states of maximal occupancy characterized by an emergent semi-hard saturation scale. Renormalization group equations in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) EFT describe wee parton correlations and their rapidity evolution. A shockwave picture of deeply inelastic scattering and hadron–hadron collisions follows, with multi-particle production described by Cutkosky’s rules in strong time-dependent fields. Gluon radiation in the CGC EFT has a double copy in gravitational shockwave collisions, with a similar correspondence applicable between gluon and graviton shockwave propagators. Possible extensions of this semi-classical double copy are outlined for computing multi-particle production in gravitational shockwave collisions, self-force and tidal contributions, and classical and quantum noise in the focusing of geodesics.

The outstanding experimental results lead to quite a clear overall picture of the neutrino sector.

In the first part of this talk I review the present status of neutrino oscillations by reporting the results of a global analysis of latest world neutrino oscillation data from solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator experiments. This analysis is performed in the three-flavor framework and represents an update of the work published in Refs. [1, 2]. The recent developments in neutrino oscillations triggered a lot of activity in the community, and many new neutrino oscillation experiments are under construction, or under active investigation, to address important open questions, such as the value of the small mixing angle θ13, leptonic CP violation and the type of the neutrino mass hierarchy. In the second part of the talk I try to give an outlook, where we could stand in about ten years from",

These relations, friendly or hostile, can be measured in the Bogardus scale of the social distance. In previous works on the Heider balance, these relations have been described with integers 0 and ±1. Recently we have proposed real numbers instead. Also, differential equations have been used to simulate the time evolution of the relations, which were allowed to vary within a given range. In this work, we investigate an influence of this allowed range on the system dynamics. As a result, we have found that a narrowing of the range of relations leads to a large delay in achieving the Heider balance. Another point is that a slight shift of the initial distribution of the social distance towards friendship can lead to a total elimination of hostility.",

It is shown analytically and illustrated by numerical calculations that the particle momentum spectra can be presented in the Cooper–Frye form despite freeze-out is not sharp and has the finite temporal width. The latter is equal to the inverse of the particle collision rate at points (tσ(r, p), r) of the maximal emission at a fixed momentum p. The set of these points forms the hypersurfaces tσ(r, p) which strongly depend on the values of p and typically do not enclose completely the initially dense matter. This is an important difference from the standard Cooper–Frye prescription (CFp), with a common freezeout hypersurface for all p, that affects significantly the predicted spectra. Also, the well known problem of CFp as for negative contributions to the spectra from non-space-like parts of the freeze-out hypersurface is naturally eliminated in this improved prescription.",

    "abstract": "During the last several years remarkable progress has been made in numerical calculations of dimensionally regulated multi-loop Feynman diagrams using Mellin-Barnes (MB) representations.The bottlenecks were non-planar diagrams and Minkowskian kinematics.The method has been proved to work in highly non-trivial physical application (two-loop electroweak bosonic corrections to the Z → b b decay), and cross-checked with the sector decomposition (SD) approach.In fact, both approaches have their pros and cons.In calculation of multidimensional integrals, depending on masses and scales involved, they are complementary.A powerful top-bottom approach to the numerical integration of multidimensional MB integrals is automatized in the MB suite AMBRE/MB/ MBtools/MBnumerics/CUBA. Key elements are a dedicated use of the Cheng-Wu theorem for non-planar topologies and of shifts and deformations of the integration contours.An alternative bottom-up approach starting with complex 1-dimensional MB-integrals, based on the exploration of steepest descent integration contours in Minkowskian kinematics, is also discussed.Short and long term prospects of the MB-method for multi-loop applications to LHC-and LC-physics are discussed.",

To restore the spontaneously broken isospin symmetry, we implemented the isospin-projection scheme on top of the Skyrme-DFT approach. This development allows for consistent treatment of isospin mixing in both ground and exited nuclear states. In this study, we apply this method to evaluate the isospin impurities in ground states of even-even and odd-odd N~Z nuclei. By including simultaneous isospin and angular-momentum projection, we compute the isospin-breaking corrections to the 0+ --> 0+ superallowed beta-decay.",

In this paper we show that, in view of the lower altitude of LARES (h = 1450 km) with respect to LAGEOS and LAGEOS II (h ' 6000 km), the cross-coupling between the effect of the atmospheric drag, both neutral and charged, on the inclination of LARES and its classical node precession due to the Earth’s oblateness may induce a 3–9% year−1 systematic bias on the total relativistic precession. Since its extraction from the data will take about 5–10 years, such a perturbing effect may degrade the total accuracy of the test, especially in view of the large uncertainties in modeling the drag force.",

    "abstract": "We investigate local and global properties of timelike geodesics in three static spherically symmetric spacetimes. These properties are of its own mathematical relevance and provide a solution of the physical `twin paradox' problem. The latter means that we focus our studies on the search of the longest timelike geodesics between two given points. Due to problems with solving the geodesic deviation equation we restrict our investigations to radial and circular (if exist) geodesics. On these curves we find general Jacobi vector fields, determine by means of them sequences of conjugate points and with the aid of the comoving coordinate system and the spherical symmetry we determine the cut points. These notions identify segments of radial and circular gepdesics which are locally or globally of maximal length. In de Sitter spacetime all geodesics are globally maximal. In CAdS and Bertotti--Robinson spacetimes the radial geodesics which infinitely many times oscillate between antipodal points in the space contain infinite number of equally separated conjugate points and there are no other cut points. Yet in these two spacetimes each outgoing or ingoing radial geodesic which does not cross the centre is globally of maximal length. Circular geodesics exist only in CAdS spacetime and contain an infinite sequence of equally separated conjugate points. The geodesic curves which intersect the circular ones at these points may either belong to the two-surface $\\theta=\\pi/2$ or lie outside it.",

    "abstract": "In July 2012 the discovery of a new boson with a mass of about 125 GeV and properties in agreement with those expected for the Higgs boson in the Standard Model was announced.In this note, we review the results of the search for the Higgs boson and the study of its properties performed with the proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5 fb -1 and 20 fb -1 per experiment at √ s = 7 TeV and √ s = 8 TeV, respectively.The presented study confirms the Higgs-like nature of the new boson, with a signal rate consistent with the expectation of the Standard Model, and with the scalar nature of the new boson clearly favoured.In addition, we present studies of the diboson production as an example of a precise electroweak measurement at the LHC.The result, being in agreement with standard model predictions, is interpreted in terms of constraints on anomalous triple-gauge boson couplings.",

For small subsystem sizes we find substantial increase of fluctuations compared to those known from standard thermodynamic considerations.

Our results are subsequently used in the context of relativistic heavy-ion collisions to introduce limitations of the concepts such as classical energy density or fluid element. In the straightforward way, our formula can be applied in other fields of physics, wherever one deals with hot and relativistic matter.",

    "abstract": "I am considering Veltman's \"The Infrared - Ultraviolet Connection\" addressing the issue of quadratic divergences and the related huge radiative correction predicted by the electroweak Standard Model (SM) in the relationship between the bare and the renormalized theory, commonly called \"the hierarchy problem\" which usually is claimed that this has to be cured. After the discovery of the Higgs particle at CERN, which essentially completed the SM, an amazing interrelation of the leading interaction strengths of the gauge bosons, the top-quark and the Higgs boson showed up amounting that the SM allows for a perturbative extrapolation of the running couplings up to the Planck scale. The central question concerns the stability of the electroweak vacuum, which requires that the running Higgs self-coupling stays positive. Although several evaluations seem to favor the meta-stability within the experimental and theoretical parameter-uncertainties, one should not exclude the possibility that other experiments and improved matching conditions will be able to establish the absolute stability of the SM vacuum in the future. I will discuss the stable vacuum scenario and its impact on early cosmology, revealing the Higgs boson as the inflaton. It turns out that the Standard Model's presumed \"hierarchy problem\" and similarly the \"cosmological constant problem\" resolve themselves when we understand the SM as a low energy effective tail that is emergent from a cutoff-medium at the Planck scale. \"The Infrared - Ultraviolet Connection\" conveyed by the Higgs boson mass renormalization appears in a new light when the energy dependence of the SM couplings is taken into account. The bare Higgs boson mass square then changes sign below the Planck scale where it is activating the Higgs mechanism.",

Considering the still undecided status of these states and the limitations in the understanding of the eta-nucleon as well as the eta-nucleus interaction, the present article tries to look back at some unresolved problems in the production mechanism and final state interaction of the eta mesons and nuclei. An unconventional perspective which provides a physical insight into the nature of the eta-nucleus interaction is also presented using quantum time concepts.",

It is explicitly shown that forexample inﬂation, i.e. an exponentially expanding universe, can easily beexplained within the framework of Einstein-Cartan theory.PACS numbers: 04.50.+h, 98.80.Jk 1 Introduction There are many ideas how physics beyond the Minimal Standard Model maybe explained, however none of them so far was able to give a consistent outputthat could explain all experimental results of particle physics and cosmologyconsistently. In contrast to these modern approaches the authors of [2] adopt aconservativeparticle physicist’s point of view and include the minimal number ofnew degrees of freedom to formulate the NMSM that can explain Dark Energy,non-baryonic Dark Matter etc.From a geometrical point of view it may be preferable to allow more generalgeometric structures rather than increasing the number of required particles.Therefore the guiding principle of this note may be called the principle of min-imal geometry content.",

Renewed interest in the field of directed transport stems from the theme of ratchet physics where unbiased, noise-induced transport emerges away from thermal equilibrium as a result of the action of Brownian motors [1–3]. Similarly, deterministic directed transport can result in time-dependent driven systems that exhibit a symmetry breaking of either spatial (for instance, the periodic ratchet potential) or of dynamic origin. Research activities in this area is partly motivated by the challenge to model and control some biological processes at both micro and macro scales as found in transport of ion channels and muscle operations respectively [4]. Another source of motivation is the potential for technological applications aimed at devising mechanisms for sorting, separating, pumping and controlling tiny particles at nanoscales and micro scales (see Refs. [2,5] and references therein). Outstanding experimental realization of some of these devices have been carried out. Specifically, the control of motion of vortices in superconductors [6], particles in asymmetric silicon pores [7], charged particles through artificial pores [8], among others, have been reported recently.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of the expanding universe is analyzed in terms of the quantum geometrodynamical model.It is shown that the equations of quantum theory in the form of the eigenvalues equation similar to the stationary Schrödinger equation complemented by the equations of motion for the momentum operator and its time derivative in Heisenberg's form reduce to the Einstein equations with an additional source of the gravitational field of quantum nature.The spatially closed universe with cosmological constant, originally filled with a uniform scalar field and radiation, is considered as quantum cosmological system.The perfect fluid in the form of radiation defines the material reference frame.The properties of the averaged scalar field which acts like ordinary matter are investigated.After averaging over its quantum states, the free scalar field turns into the Weyssenhoff fluid characterized by the energy density, pressure, and spin of constituent particles.The cases when the contribution of the quantum effects into the gravitational interaction becomes significant on macroscopic scale are analyzed.It is demonstrated that, unless the whole, at least a part of such matter-energy constituents as dark matter and dark energy may have a quantum origin.",

    "abstract": "Maxwell's demon is a special case of a feedback controlled system, where the information gathered by measurement is utilized by driving a system along a thermodynamic process that depends on the measurement outcome.The demon illustrates that with feedback one can design an engine that performs work by extracting energy from a single thermal bath.Besides the fundamental questions posed by the demon -the probabilistic nature of the Second Law, the relationship between entropy and information, etc.-there are other practical problems related to feedback engines.One of those is the design of optimal engines, protocols that extract the maximum amount of energy given some amount of information.A refinement of the second law to feedback systems establishes a bound to the extracted energy, a bound that is met by optimal feedback engines.It is also known that optimal engines are characterized by time reversibility.As a consequence, the optimal protocol given a measurement is the one that, run in reverse, prepares the system in the post-measurement state (preparation prescription).In this paper, we review these results and analyze some specific features of the preparation prescription when applied to non-ergodic systems.",

    "abstract": "The paper confronts two perspectives on the asymmetry of time: a philosophical and a physical one.From the philosophical perspective, time has fundamental asymmetries which together form an asymmetry of time: there seems to exist something like a distinguished Now moving toward the future; we have many traces of the past -both in our memory and in the external world -but no traces of the future; events from the past influence those from the future, but we have no evidence of backward causation; the future seems to be open and we definitely cannot change the past.Because we believe in physics as a fundamental theory describing the world, we expect that physics should explain all of these asymmetries.However, the rub lies in the fact that physics, as it is known at present, is unable to explain these asymmetries.This means that physical processes such as the entropy increase, the expansion of the Universe or those in which weak interactions are involved only form asymmetries in time, that is, they just represent some asymmetrical physical processes in time.The way out of this difficulty can be sought in two directions: either we can look for a fundamental temporally irreversible law of nature which would be able to explain the temporal asymmetries of the world or we should look for the solution of the issue at hand outside of physics, that is, in metaphysics.The paper shows the difficulties of both directions of research.",

    "abstract": "Algorithms for search of communities in networks usually consist discrete variations of links. Here we discuss a flow method, driven by a set of differential equations. Two examples are demonstrated in detail. First is a partition of a signed graph into two parts, where the proposed equations are interpreted in terms of removal of a cognitive dissonance by agents placed in the network nodes. There, the signs and values of links refer to positive or negative interpersonal relationships of different strength. Second is an application of a method akin to the previous one, dedicated to communities identification, to the Sierpinski triangle of finite size. During the time evolution, the related graphs are weighted; yet at the end the discrete character of links is restored. In the case of the Sierpinski triangle, the method is supplemented by adding a small noise to the initial connectivity matrix. By breaking the symmetry of the network, this allows to a successful handling of overlapping nodes.",

    "abstract": "Multifractal time series analysis is a approach that shows the possible complexity of the system. Nowadays, one of the most popular and the best methods for determining multifractal characteristics is Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA). However, it has some drawback. One of its core elements is detrending of the series. In the classical MFDFA a trend is estimated by fitting a polynomial of degree $m$ where $m=const$. We propose that the degree $m$ of a polynomial was not constant ($m\\neq const$) and its selection was ruled by an established criterion. Taking into account the above amendment, we examine the multifractal spectra both for artificial and real-world mono- and the multifractal time series. Unlike classical MFDFA method, obtained singularity spectra almost perfectly reflects the theoretical results and for real time series we observe a significant right side shift of the spectrum.",

The studies were performed within the framework of experiments at two hadron colliders, the future ATLAS detector scheduled for operation in 2007 at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva and the currently running DO experiment at the Tevatron in Chicago.The tau lepton’s distinctive signature is a useful tool in many new physics searches where it is present in the final state. As a first study in ATLAS a Monte Carlo analysis of two-tau final states, which are sensitive to the underlying structure of supersymmetric models, was performed. Several extensions of the SM predict the existence of a charged Higgs boson.The major part of this thesis has consisted in using tau leptons to search for the charged Higgs in the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM). Results from this thesis show that searches for the H± → τντ decay channel extend the charged Higgs discovery reach for the ATLAS experiment compared to previous studies of other channels: the charged Higgs can be observed for masses up to ~ 600 GeV for tanβ > 10. Its mass can be determined with an uncertainty of 1 to 2%, dominated by statistical errors. The tanβ parameter can be derived from the absolute rate of this decay to a precision around 6% for 20 < tan β < 50.By measuring precisely the unitarity triangle parameter sin2β the SM description of CP violation can be put to a test. As a separate study a Monte Carlo analysis was performed in ATLAS, which shows that the systematic uncertainty is half the attainable statistical uncertainty. As part of the effort to search for the charged Higgs in the DO experiment a trigger algorithm for tau leptons was written, extensively tested and implemented in the experiment. Trigger strategies for events containing taus were designed. These trigger studies will be useful also for many other new physics searches at DO.",

    "abstract": "There are a number of very puzzling meteoritic events including (a) The Tunguska event. It is the only known example of a low altitude atmospheric explosion. It is also the largest recorded event. Remarkably no fragments or signicant chemical traces have ever been recovered. (b) Anomalous low altitude reballs which (in some cases) have been observed to hit the ground. The absence of fragments is particularly striking in these cases, but this is not the only reason they are anomalous. The other main puzzling feature is the lack of a consistent trajectory: low altitude reballs, if caused by an ordinary cosmic body penetrating the Earth’s atmosphere, should have been extremely luminous at high altitudes. But in these anomalous cases this is (remarkably) not observed to occur! On the other hand, there is strong evidence that most of our galaxy is made from exotic dark material { ‘dark matter’. Mirror matter is one well motivated dark matter candidate, since it is dark and stable and it is required to exist if particle interactions are mirror symmetric. If mirror matter is the dark matter, then some amount must exist in our solar system. Although there is not much room for a large amount of mirror matter in the inner solar system, numerous small asteroid sized mirror matter objects are a fascinating possibility because they can potentially collide with the Earth. We demonstrate that the mirror matter theory allows for a simple explanation for the puzzling meteoritic events [both (a) and (b)] if they are due to mirror matter space-bodies. A direct consequence of this explanation is that mirror matter fragments should exist in (or on) the ground at various impact sites. The properties of this potentially recoverable material depend importantly on the sign of the photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing parameter, . We argue that the broad characteristics of the anomalous events suggests that is probably negative. Strategies for detecting mirror matter in the ground are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of these lecture notes is twofold. First we aim at introducing the reader to the basic concepts pertaining to Casimir forces, starting from the seminal work of Casimir. In a broader sense, we also review some aspects of dispersion forces, in particular the status of van der Waals forces in vacuum as well as in a finite density and non zero temperature medium. The Lifshitz theory of forces between dielectric bodies is briefly described. In the second place, the course deals with a more recent analysis of the Casimir force for metals based on an exact microscopic statistical mechanical treatment of matter and field fluctuations. It reveals that charges fluctuations inside the conductors cannot be ignored (as is done in the conventional Casimir calculation). It also helps clarifying present day controversies about the contribution of thermal fluctuations to the force and the proper way to recover the metallic case in the framework of the Lifshitz theory. Finally the occurrence of Casimir forces in critical phenomena is illustrated in the case of the Bose–Einstein condensation in a free Bose gas. The Casimir effect in other contexts (general quantum field theory, particle physics, cosmology, …) is not considered here.",

    "abstract": "The τ-decay library TAUOLA has gained popularity over the last decade. However, with the continuously increasing precision of the data, some of its functionality has become insufficient. One of the requirements is the implementation of decays into five mesons plus a neutrino with a realistic decay amplitude. This note describes a step into this direction. For the 2π π + 2π 0 mode the three decay chains τ → a 1 ν → ρ (→ π π 0 )ω(→ π π + π 0 )ν, τ → a 1 ν → a 1 (→ 2π π + )f0(→ 2π 0 )ν, and τ → a 1 ν → a 1 (→ π 2π 0 )f0(→ π + π−)ν are introduced with simple assumptions about the couplings and propagators of the various resonances. Similar amplitudes (without the ρω contributions) are adopted for the π 4π 0 and 3π 2π + modes. The five-pion amplitude is thus based on a simple model, which, however, can be considered as a first realistic example. Phase-space generation includes the possibility of presampling the ω and a1 resonances, in one channel only, however. This is probably sufficient for the time being, both for physics applications and for tests. The technical test of the new part of the generator is performed by comparing Monte Carlo and analytical results. To this end a non-realistic, but easy to calculate, purely scalar amplitude for the decay into five massless pions was used.",

    "abstract": "Several physical problems such as the `twin paradox' in curved spacetimes have purely geometrical nature and may be reduced to studying properties of bundles of timelike geodesics. The paper is a general introduction to systematic investigations of the geodesic structure of physically relevant spacetimes. The investigations are focussed on the search of locally and globally maximal timelike geodesics. The method of dealing with the local problem is in a sense algorithmic and is based on the geodesic deviation equation. Yet the search for globally maximal geodesics is non-algorithmic and cannot be treated analytically by solving a differential equation. Here one must apply a mixture of methods: spacetime symmetries (we have effectively employed the spherical symmetry), the use of the comoving coordinates adapted to the given congruence of timelike geodesics and the conjugate points on these geodesics. All these methods have been effectively applied in both the local and global problems in a number of simple and important spacetimes and their outcomes have already been published in three papers. Our approach shows that even in Schwarzschild spacetime (as well as in other static spherically symetric ones) one can find a new unexpected geometrical feature: instead of one there are three different infinite sets of conjugate points on each stable circular timelike geodesic curve. Due to problems with solving differential equations we are dealing solely with radial and circular geodesics.",

Properties of the \"Dirac comb\" distribution and of its tensor products in higher dimensions lead to Poisson resummation, allowing for a useful approximation formula of a Fourier transform in terms of a limited number of terms. A connection with the Bochner theorem on positive definiteness of Fourier-positive functions is discussed. As a practical application, we find simple and rapid analytic algorithms for checking Fourier-positivity in 1- and (radial) 2-dimensions among a large variety of real positive functions. This may provide a step towards a classification of positive positive-definite functions.",

In the case of Finite Unified Theories the sum rule ensures the all-loop finiteness also in their SSB sector and in this way are promoted to completely finite ones. Using the sum rule we investigate the minimal supersymmetric Gauge-Yukawa and two Finite-Gauge-Yukawa SU(5) models. The characteristic features of these models are: a) the old agreement of the top quark mass prediction remains unchanged, b) the lightest Higgs boson is predicted to be around 120 GeV, c) the s-spectrum starts above several hundreds of GeV.",

Currently, there is a large amount of evidence that mirror matter actually exists coming from astrophysics and particle physics. One of the most fascinating (but speculative) possibilities is that there is a significant abundance of mirror matter within our solar system. If the mirror matter condensed to form a large body of planatary or stellar mass then there could be interesting observable effects. Indeed studies of long period comets suggest the existence of a solar companion which has escaped direct detection and is therefore a candidate for a mirror body. Nemesis, hypothetical death star companion of the Sun, proposed to explain biological mass extinctions, may potentially be a mirror star. We examine the prospects for detecting these objects if they do indeed exist and are made of mirror matter.",

The probability that endemic state occurs is also calculated. Surprisingly it occurs, that less contagious diseases has greater chance to survive. The influence of preventive vaccinations on the spreading process is investigated and critical range of vaccinations that is sufficient for the suppression of an epidemic is calculated.

Thepolymer was chosen to be a three-dimensional chain of N identical beads(monomers) without internal structure. Each monomer interacted with itstwo neighbors by a harmonic potential, which modeled a chemical bond.Additionally all monomers within a chain were assumed to interact throughthe Lennard–Jones (LJ) potential. Interaction with solvent and with otherpolymers was introduced using Langevin forces. Analyzing internal energyper polymer and radius of gyration as function of temperature we observeda rapid globule to coil phase transition. Also we studied elastic propertiesof single polymer chain for temperatures below the transition and identiﬁedthree regions with diﬀerent elastic behavior. Typical chain lengths in oursimulations ranged from 100 to 1000 monomers.

Without longitudinal fluctuations the classical time evolution maintains the boost invariance, while an instability develops once fluctuations that break boost invariance are included. We show that this \"Glasma instability\" enhances rapidity-dependent variations as long as self-interactions among unstable modes stay weak and the system resides in the linear regime. Eventually the amplitude of unstable modes becomes so large that the growth of instability gets saturated. In this non-linear regime the numerical simulations of the Glasma lead to turbulent energy flow from low-frequency modes to higher-frequency modes, which results in a characteristic power-law spectrum.

    "abstract": "We address Lévy-stable stochastic processes in bounded domains, with a focus on a discrimination between inequivalent proposals for what a boundary data-respecting fractional Laplacian (and thence the induced random process) should actually be.Versions considered are: restricted Dirichlet, spectral Dirichlet and regional (censored) fractional Laplacians.The affiliated random processes comprise: killed, reflected and conditioned Lévy flights, in particular those with an infinite life-time.The related concept of quasi-stationary distributions is briefly mentioned. I. MOTIVATIONJump-type Lévy processes in a bounded domain are a subject of an active study both in physics and mathematics communities.The physics-oriented research is conducted with some disregard to an ample coverage of the topic in the past and modern mathematical literature.The reason is rooted not only in a methodological gap between the practitioners' pragmatism and the mathematically rigorous reasoning.An important factor is a scarce (or even lack of) communication between various research groups and research streamlines.This refers not only to rather residual physics-mathematics interplay, but also to the mathematics community per se: relevant publications are scattered in a large number of highly specialized journals and easily escape the attention of potentially interested parties.Recently an attempt has been made to establish a common conceptual basis for varied frameworks in which fractional Laplacians appear.Formally looking different, but actually equivalent, definitions of fractional Laplacians, appropriate for the description of Lévy stable processes in R n , n ≥ 1, have been collected and their mutual relationships analyzed in minute detail in Ref. [1].There is a general consensus that the standard Fourier multiplier definition appears to be defective, if one passes to Lévy flights in a bounded domain.This is a consequence of an inherent nonlocality of Lévy-stable generators.Different proposals for boundary-data-respecting fractional Laplacians were given in the literature.Often, with a view towards more efficient computer-assisted calculations (that mostly in connection with nonlinear fractional differential equations, [11,12]).However, in contrast to the situation in R n , these proposals are known to be inequivalent, c.f. Refs.[2]- [16], see also [18,19].Likewise, the induced jump-type processes are inequivalent and have different statistical characteristics.That in particular refers to a standard physical inventory, adapted directly from the Brownian motion studies [20]: the statistics of exits from the domain, e.g.first and mean first exit times, probability of survival, its long time behavior an ultimate asymptotic decay [21]- [27].Interestingly, the existence problem for jump-type processes with an infinite life-time in a bounded domain, seems to have been left aside in the physics literature (compare e.g.Ref. [28] in connection with diffusion processes and Ref. [30] for a preliminary discussion of the Cauchy process in the interval).To the contrary, permanently trapped Lévy-type processes (diffusion processes like-wise) have their place in the mathematical literature.One category of such processes stems from the analysis of the long-time behavior of the survival probability in case of absorbing enclosures which actually allows to single out appropriate conditioned processes that never leave the domain once started within.A related topic is that of quasi-stationary distributions (c.f.[31] in the random walk and Brownian contexts) and the concept of so-called Yaglom limits, [33,34].Another category refers to reflecting boundary data and to reflected Lévy-stable processes (the reflected Brownian motion might be invoked at this point and set against the killed/absorbed one, c.f. [21,35,36]).Actually, censored fractional Laplacians are interpreted as generators of reflected Lévy stable processes, [18,19].Let us concisely state the main problem addressed.While giving meaning to the Laplacian in a bounded domain D ⊂ R n , denoted tentatively ∆ D , we must account for various admissible boundary data, that are local i.e. set on the boundary ∂D of an open set D. One may try to define a fractional power of the Laplacian by importing its locally defined boundary data on ∂D, through so-called spectral definition (-∆ D ) α/2 .This operator is known to be different from the outcome of the procedure in which one first executes the fractional power of the Laplacian, and next imposes the boundary data, as embodied in the notation (-∆) α/2 D .In case of absorbing boundaries, in contrast to (-∆ D ) α/2 , the Dirichlet boundary data for (-∆) α/2 D",

The former - in which quarks and leptons are viewed as composite objects built from confined fermionic subparticles (`rishons') - is known to be beset with many difficulties. The latter may be roughly defined as this part of the HSM that really works. We recall that the phase-space Clifford-algebra approach leads to the HSO without any of the HSM problems and discuss in some detail how this is achieved. The light which the phase-space-based view sheds on the HSO sets then a new direction along which the connection between space and particle properties could be studied and offers a glimpse into weird physics that probably lurks much deeper than the field-theoretical approach of the Standard Model.",

We start our presentation from production of two pairs of charm quark-antiquark and argue that it is the golden reaction to study the double parton scattering effects. In addition to the DPS we consider briefly also mechanism of single parton scattering and show that it gives much smaller contribution to the $c \\bar c c \\bar c$ final state. Next we discuss a perturbative parton-splitting mechanism which should be included in addition to the conventional DPS mechanism. We show that the presence of this mechanism unavoidably leads to collision energy and other kinematical variables dependence of so-called $\\sigma_{eff}$ parameter being extracted from different experiments. Next we briefly discuss production of four jets. We concentrate on estimation of the contribution of DPS for jets remote in rapidity. Understanding of this contribution is very important in the context of searches for BFKL effects known under the the name Mueller-Navelet jets. We discuss the situation in a more general context. Finally we briefly mention about DPS effects in production of $W^+ W^-$. Outlook closes the presentation.",

We discuss theoretical uncertainties of the formalism related to the basis truncation, parametrization of the underlying energy density functional, and ambiguities related to determination of Slater determinants in odd-odd nuclei. A generalization of the double-projected DFT model towards a no core shell-model-like configuration-mixing approach is formulated and implemented. We also discuss new opportunities in charge-symmetry- and charge-independence-breaking studies offered by the newly developed DFT formalism involving proton-neutron mixing in the particle-hole channel.",

    "abstract": "We discuss a Brane World scenario where we live on a 3-brane with massive gravity in the infinite-volume bulk.The bulk graviton can be much heavier than the inverse Hubble size, as heavy as the bulk Planck scale, whose lower bound is roughly the inverse of 0.1 mm.The 4D Einstein-Hilbert term on the brane shields the brane matter from both strong bulk gravity and large bulk graviton mass.Gravity on the brane does not become higher-dimensional at large distances.Instead, at distance scales above the bulk Planck length, gravity on the brane behaves as 4D gravity with small graviton mass roughly of the order of or below the inverse Hubble size.Unlike the massless case, with massive gravity in the bulk one can have: (i) 4D tensor structure on a codimension-1 brane; and (ii) no infrared tachyon for smoothed-out higher codimension branes.The effects of the brane dynamics on the bulk are exponentially suppressed away from the brane.One consequence is that there are no \"self-accelerated\" solutions.In codimension-2 cases, there exist nonsingular solutions with a flat 3-brane † This address is used by the author for no purpose other than to indicate his professional affiliation as is customary in scientific publications.In particular, the contents of this paper are limited to theoretical physics, have no commercial or other such value, are not intended as an investment, legal, tax or any other such advice, and in no way represent views of Quantigic Solutions LLC, the website www.quantigic.com or any of their other affiliates.",

Remaining parts are devoted to the presentation of the original derivation and present applications of the Smoluchowski equations. Commonly used in various physical, chemical, etc., problems is the kinetic Smoluchowski equation, being the high-friction limit of the full Fokker-Planck equation. Of less use so far has been the functional Smoluchowski (called also Chapman-Enskog or Bachelier) equation. Within the scope of modern theory of stochastic processes this equation is an identity equivalent to the definition of a Markovian process. It is argued that, in the view of the growing interest in non-Markovian stochastic processes, the functional Smoluchowski equation may become the most natural and effective tool for checking the Markovian vs. non-Markovian character of a considered process, especially when applied to experimental data. Some examples are given.",

    "abstract": "In these lecture notes we discuss an analytic calculational scheme for SU($N$) gauge theories in a finite volume. We will mainly concentrate on pure SU(2) gauge theory. The method relies on using an effective Hamiltonian for the zero momentum modes. The notorious problem of Gribov horizons is evaded by encoding the topological nontrivial nature of configuration space into boundary conditions for the zero momentum modes. This system then allows us to compute the low-lying energy spectrum in volumes up to about five times the size of the scalar glueball. These continuum results agree in general well with the lattice Monte Carlo results. We discuss in some detail the resolution of a discrepancy with Monte Carlo results for the $T^+_2$ glueball.",

Homogeneous second order phase transitions are the focus of our attention, but the same paradigm is applied to the cross-over and inhomogeneous transitions. The discrepancy between the experimental results in 3He and 4He is discussed in the light of recent numerical studies. The possible role of the Ginzburg regime in determining the vortex line density for the case of a quench in 4He is raised and tentatively dismissed. The difference in the anticipated origin of the dominant signal in the two (3He and 4He) cases is pointed out and the resulting consequences for the subsequent decay of vorticity are noted. The possibility of a significant discrepancy between the effective field theory and (quantum) kinetic theory descriptions of the order parameter is briefly touched upon, using atomic Bose-Einstein condensates as an example.",

    "abstract": "Measurements performed at the Tevatron of both the like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry in B d,s -meson samples and the mixing-induced CP asymmetry in B s → J/ψφ depart from their Standard Model (SM) predictions.This could be an indication for new CP phases in ∆B = 2 transitions, preferentially in B s -Bs mixing.The experimental situation, however, remained inconclusive, as it favored values of the element Γ s 12 of the decay matrix in the B s -meson system that are notably different from the SM expectation, suggesting the presence of new physics in the ∆B = 1 sector as well.The very recent LHCb measurements of B s → J/ψφ and B s → J/ψf 0 , which do not find any evidence for a new-physics phase in the element M s 12 of the mass matrix, point into this direction as well.In this article, we explore the potential size of non-standard effects in Γ s 12 stemming from dimension-six operators with flavor content (sb)(τ τ ).We show that since the existing constraints imposed by tree-and loop-level mediated B d,s -meson decays are quite loose, the presence of absorptive new physics of this type would lead to an improved global fit to the current data.The allowed effects are, however, far too small to provide a full explanation of the observed anomalies.Our model-independent conclusions are finally contrasted with explicit analyses of the new-physics effects in B s -Bs mixing that can arise from leptoquarks or Z bosons.",

    "abstract": "After a succinct review of the MOND paradigm -with its phenomenology, and its various underlying theories -I concentrate on so-called modified inertia (MI) formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention.These share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed relation.My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ substantially from their \"modified-gravity\" (MG) kin in predicting other phenomena.Because MI theories are nonlocal in time, MOND effects depend on the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG theories.This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not only on the instantaneous value.And, it is even possible to construct MI theories with practically no EFE.Other predictions that may differ are also discussed.Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia formulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these points.",

    "abstract": "The density fluctuation of the final state charged mesons are investigated in terms of two-dimensional scaled factorial moments in 28 Si‐Ag/Br interaction at an incident energy of 14:5GeV per nucleon. The experimental results are compared with a microscopic transport model based on the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD). To accommodate the Bose‐Einstein type correlation, that dominates the origin of intermittency, an algorithm based on reassigning charges of produced particles has been employed to the UrQMD data. However, our investigation shows that a strong self-ane intermittent behavior in the experiment still cannot be replicated by the simulation. The Hurst exponent is used to account for the experimentally observed anisotropy in the pseudorapidity — azimuthal angle plane. The usual power law type of scaling behavior of the factorial moments, typical of intermittency in one dimension, is retrieved only when independent phase-space directions are partitioned unequally. Several issues related to the underlying (multi)fractal structure of the density function are also examined.",

    "abstract": "Gamow–Teller (GT) transitions are the most common weak-interaction processes in the Universe. They play important roles in various processes of nucleosynthesis, for example, in the rapid proton-capture process (rp-process). In the pf-shell region, the rp-process runs through neutron-deficient nuclei with Tz = −2, −1, and 0 mainly by means of GT and Fermi transitions, where Tz is the z component of isospin T defined by Tz = (N − Z)∕2. Under the assumption of isospin symmetry, mirror nuclei with reversed Z and N numbers, and thus with opposite signs of Tz, have the same structure. Therefore, symmetry is also expected for the GT transitions starting from and ending up in mirror nuclei. We have been studying the Tz = −2 →−1 and −1 → 0 GT transitions in β decays, while those from stable Tz = +2 and +1 nuclei by means of hadronic (3He,t) charge-exchange (CE) reactions. The results from these studies are compared in order to examine the mirror-symmetry structure in nuclei. In addition, these results are combined for the better understanding of GT transitions in the pf-shell region.",

    "abstract": "This research addresses extensive and non-extensive thermodynamics. A comparison between the entropy for both different statistics are pre- sented. The non-extensive parameter, entropic index q , is discussed. We attempt to explore the limit of the non-extensive parameter by comparing the theoretical results with lattice and the available experimental results. The two thermal parameters T , B are calculated with the freeze-out con- dition S=T 3 = 7 for different q . The motivation of this research comes from recent non-extensive statistics studies which showed that this stan- dard thermodynamics failed to reproduce the freeze-out parameters. As an application, the black-hole entropy is calculated in the quantum General- ized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) modification form. Black-hole entropy may reveal information about the thermodynamics it belongs. This dis- crimination is essential to quantify the entropy in the hadron production evolution stage and in the black-hole thermodynamics. It is concluded that lattice QCD reproduces the extensive thermodynamics very well. Also, the black hole appears as an extensive system",

    "abstract": "We reemphasize the strong dependence of the branching ratios B(K + → π + ν ν) and B(K L → π 0 ν ν) on |V cb | that is stronger than in rare B decays, in particular for K L → π 0 ν ν.Thereby the persistent tension between inclusive and exclusive determinations of |V cb | weakens the power of these theoretically clean decays in the search for new physics (NP).We demonstrate how this uncertainty can be practically removed by considering within the SM suitable ratios of the two branching ratios between each other and with other observables like the branching ratios forWe use as basic CKM parameters V us , |V cb |, and the angles β and γ in the unitarity triangle (UT) with the latter two determined through the measurements of tree-level B decays.This avoids the use of the problematic |V ub |.A ratio involving B(K + → π + ν ν) and B(B s → µ + µ -) while being |V cb |-independent exhibits sizable dependence on the angle γ.It should be of interest for several experimental groups in the coming years.We point out that the |V cb |-independent ratio of B(B + → K + ν ν) and B(B s → µ + µ -) from Belle II and LHCb signals a 1.8σ tension with its SM value.As a complementary test of the Standard Model, we propose to extract |V cb | from different observables as a function of β and γ.We illustrate this with ε K , ∆M d , and ∆M s finding tensions between these three determinations of |V cb | within the SM.We point out that from ∆M s and S ψKS alone, one finds |V cb | = 41.8(6)× 10 -3 and |V ub | = 3.65(12) × 10 -3 .We stress the importance of a precise measurement of γ.Assuming no NP in |ε K | and S ψKS , we determine independently of |V cb | and γ: B(K + → π + ν ν) SM = (8.60 ± 0.42) × 10 -11 and B(K L → π 0 ν ν) SM = (2.94 ± 0.15) × 10 -11 with only CKM uncertainty coming from β, that is already precisely known.These are the most precise determinations to date.Assuming no NP in ∆M s,d allows to obtain analogous results for all B decay branching ratios considered in our paper without any CKM uncertainties.",

In both theories the large number of dileptons at invariant masses $\\sim$~$m_\\rho/2$ are shown to be chiefly produced by a density-dependent $\\rho$-meson mass. In R/W the medium dependence is dynamically calculated using hadronic variables defined in the matter-free vacuum. In B/R scaling it follows from movement towards chiral symmetry restoration due to medium-induced vacuum change, and is described in terms of constituent (or quasiparticle) quarks. We argue that the R/W description should be reliable up to densities somewhat beyond nuclear density, where hadrons are the effective variables. At higher density there should be a crossover to constituent quarks as effective variables scaling according to B/R. In the crossover region, the two descriptions must be ``dual''.",

    "abstract": "One of great mysteries of the Tunguska event is its genetic impact. Some genetic anomalies were reported in the plants, insects and people of the Tunguska region. Remarkably, the increased rate of biological mutations was found not only within the epicenter area, but also along the trajectory of the Tunguska Space Body (TSB). At that no traces of radioactivity were found, which could be reliably associated with the Tunguska event. The main hypotheses about the nature of the TSB, a stony asteroid, a comet nucleus or a carbonaceous chondrite, readily explain the absence of radioactivity but give no clues how to deal with the genetic anomaly. A choice between these hypotheses, as far as the genetic anomaly is concerned, is like to the choice between ``blue devil, green devil and speckled devil'', to quote late Academician N.V. Vasilyev. However, if another mysterious phenomenon, electrophonic meteors, is evoked, the origin of the Tunguska genetic anomaly becomes less obscure.",

    "abstract": "Chaotic time series obtained from simple dynamical systems (the tent map and the logistic map) are analyzed by means of Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) — a widely used method for quantifying long-range correlations in time series obtained from complex systems. The first conclusion is that time series obtained from stochastic (noise-driven) and deterministic systems may be indistinguishable using the DFA method. We introduce the adaptive DFA exponent and find that it is related to the structure of the periodic orbit. We show that persistence detected in deterministic series by DFA has a different interpretation than that used in the context of stochastic series analysis. For chaotic time series, we find that only a large level of dynamic additive noise can alter the short-range DFA exponent. Finally, a relation between the DFA exponents and the control parameter of the map is studied. The short-range DFA exponent is sensitive to different kinds of nonlinear transitions — we show that the exponent decreases with the merging of chaotic bands and increases as the natural measure becomes more symmetric. If periodic windows occur in the bifurcation diagram, they can be also detected by DFA as an abrupt decrease of the short-range exponent to a value close to 0. An interior crisis occurs at the end of each periodic window — as a result, the DFA exponent increases as a function of the control parameter until the next band-merging point. As the periodic windows are dense in the bifurcation diagram, the relation of the DFA exponent on the control parameter is more complex for this case.",

The energy per nucleonis minimized to obtain the ground state of symmetric nuclear matter. Thesaturation energy per nucleon used for nuclear matter calculations is deter-mined from the co-eﬃcient of the volume term of Bethe-Weizs¨acker massformula which is evaluated by ﬁtting the recent experimental and estimatedatomic mass excesses from Audi-Wapstra-Thibault atomic mass table byminimizing the mean square deviation. The constants of density depen-dence of the eﬀective interaction are obtained by reproducing the satu-ration energy per nucleon and the saturation density of spin and isospinsymmetric cold inﬁnite nuclear matter. The EOS of symmetric nuclearmatter, thus obtained, provide reasonably good estimate of nuclear incom-pressibility. Once the consants of density dependence are determined, EOSfor asymmetric nuclear matter is calculated by adding to the isoscalar part,the isovector component of the M3Y interaction that do not contribute tothe EOS of symmetric nuclear matter. These EOS are then used to calcu-late the pressure, the energy density and the velocity of sound in symmetricas well as isospin asymmetric nuclear matter.Keywords : Asymmetric nuclear matter, Mass formula, Binding Energy,Atomic mass excess, Nuclear incompressibility, Nuclear symmetry energy.PACS numbers: 21.65.+f, 23.60.+e, 23.70.+j, 25.70.Bc, 21.30.Fe, 24.10.Ht",

Exclusive hadron production processes in photon-photon and electron-photon collisions provide important tests of QCD at the amplitude level, particularly as measures of hadron distribution amplitudes. There are also important high energy {gamma}{gamma} and e{gamma} tests of quantum chromodynamics, including the production of jets in photon-photon collisions, deeply virtual Compton scattering on a photon target, and leading-twist single-spin asymmetries for a photon polarized normal to a production plane. Since photons couple directly to all fundamental fields carrying the electromagnetic current including leptons, quarks, W's and supersymmetric particles, high energy {gamma}{gamma} collisions will provide a comprehensive laboratory for Higgs production and exploring virtually every aspect of the Standard Model and its extensions. High energy back-scattered laser beams will thus greatly extend the range of physics of the International Linear Collider.",

We argue that, in general, the behavior of the system is different from the naive expectation and it depends strongly on the assumptions made about the energy and momentum deposited by the jet into the medium.

The reason for the later conclusion is that the initial transverse flow in thermal matter as well as its anisotropy, leading to asymmetry of the transverse momentum spectra, could be developed at pre-thermal, either partonic or classical field - Glasma, stage with even more efficiency than in the case of very early perfect hydrodynamics. Such radial and elliptic flows develop no matter whether a pressure already established. The general reason for them is an essential finiteness of the system in transverse direction.",

The Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC, described in this paper, was launched to expand the experimental study where theory cannot yet reach. Both large RHIC experiments, STAR and PHENIX, are in the process of preparing for the first run.

The distributions in the transverse momentum, rapidity and cosine of the mu- angle with respect to the beam in the laboratory frame and with respect to the reversed momentum of the b-quark in the rest frame of W-boson are changed rather moderately by the anomalous Wtb coupling. The distributions computed with the full set of leading order Feynman diagrams practically do not differ from those computed with the t anti-t production diagrams, with typical acceptance cuts. This demonstrates very little effect of the off resonance background contributions.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology in which a Chaplygin gas is coupled to a non-linear scalar field in the framework of the Hořava-Lifshitz theory.In writing the action of the matter part, we use the Schutz's formalism so that the only degree of freedom of the Chaplygin gas plays the role of an evolutionary parameter.In a minisuperspace perspective, we construct the Lagrangian for this model and show that in comparison with the usual Einstein-Hilbert gravity, there are some correction terms coming from the Hořava theory.In such a set-up and by using of some approximations the classical dynamics of the model is investigated and some discussions about their possible singularities are presented.We then deal with the quantization of the model in the context of the Wheeler-DeWitt approach of quantum cosmology to find the cosmological wave function.We use the resulting wave functions to investigate the possibility of the avoidance of classical singularities due to quantum effects.",

In this article we present three methods for determination of the beam profile of collimated annihilation gamma quanta. Precise monitoring of this profile is essential for time and energy calibration of the J-PET detector and for the determination of the library of model signals used in the hit-time and hit-position reconstruction. We have we have shown that usage of two lead bricks with dimensions of 5x10x20 cm^3 enables to form a beam of annihilation quanta with Gaussian profile characterized by 1 mm FWHM. Determination of this characteristic is essential for designing and construction the collimator system for the 24-module J-PET prototype. Simulations of the beam profile for different collimator dimensions were performed. This allowed us to choose optimal collimation system in terms of the beam profile parameters, dimensions and weight of the collimator taking into account the design of the 24 module J-PET detector.",

    "abstract": "At the Kernfysisch Versneller Instituut (KVI) in Groningen, NL, a new facility (TRImuP) is under development. It aims for producing, slowing down and trapping of radioactive isotopes in order to perform accurate measurements on fundamental symmetries and interactions. A spectrum of radioactive nuclids will be produced in direct, inverse kinematics of fragmentation reactions using heavy ion beams from the superconducting AGOR cyclotron. The research programme pursued by the KVI group includes precision studies of nuclear beta-decays through beta-neutrino (recoil nucleus) momentum correlations in weak decays and searches for permanent electric dipole moments in heavy atomic systems. This offers a large potential for discovering new physics or to limit parameters in models beyond standard theory significantly. The scientific approach chosen in TRImuP can be regarded as complementary to such high energy physics. The facility in Groningen will be open for use by the worldwide community of scientists.",

For practical calculations this formula may be used both in the Minkowski and in the Euclidean space. For the pion momentum Pμ ← 0 it reduces to the well known expression derived earlier by other authors. Using a generalized dipole Ansatz for the momentum dependence of the constituent quark mass in the Minkowski space, we express Fπ2 in terms of a single integral over the quark momentum fraction μ. We interpret the integrand as a pion distribution amplitude φ(u). We discuss its properties and compare with the πDA's obtained in other models.",

We consider a generic model with the CP violating Higgs tensor couplings to gauge bosons. We introduce a new variable describing angular distributions of the secondary WW and ZZ decay products which is very sensitive to the CP properties of the Higgs-boson. Understanding of the detector performance turns out to be crucial, as the influence of the acceptance corrections is similar to the effects of CP violation. From the combined measurement of invariant mass distributions and various angular distributions the phase describing a CP violation can be determined to about 50 mrad after one year of Photon Collider running.",

One of the purposes of the above MMCs is to test the other more sophisticated Monte Carlo programs, the so-called Constrained Monte Carlo (CMC) programs, which will be used as a building block in the parton shower MC. This is why the mapping of the evolution variables (eikonal variable and evolution time) into four-momenta is also defined and tested. The evolution time is identified with the rapidity variable of the emitted parton. The presented MMCs are tested independently, with ∼ 0.1% precision, against the non-MC program APCheb especially devised for this purpose.

    "abstract": "Within the self-consistent constraint Skyrme-Hartree-Fock+BCS model (SHF+BCS), we found equilibrium toroidal nuclear density distributions in the region of superheavy elements. For nuclei with a sufficient oblate deformation (Q_{20} < -200 b), it becomes energetically favorable to change the genus of nuclear surface from 0 to 1, i.e., to switch the shape from a biconcave disc to a torus. The energy of the toroidal (genus=1) SHF+BCS solution relative to the compact (genus=0) ground state energy is strongly dependent both on the atomic number Z and the mass number A. We discuss the region of Z and A where the toroidal SHF+BCS total energy begins to be a global minimum.",

    "abstract": "After a succinct review of the MOND paradigm -with its phenomenology, and its various underlying theories -I concentrate on so-called modified inertia (MI) formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention.These share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed relation.My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ substantially from their \"modified-gravity\" (MG) kin in predicting other phenomena.Because MI theories are nonlocal in time, MOND effects depend on the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG theories.This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not only on the instantaneous value.And, it is even possible to construct MI theories with practically no EFE.Other predictions that may differ are also discussed.Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia formulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these points.",

    "abstract": "The non-selective voltage-activated cation channel from human red cells, which is activated at depolarizing potentials, has been shown to exhibit counter-clockwise gating hysteresis. Here, we analyze this phenomenon with the simplest possible phenomenological models. Specifically, the hysteresis cycle, including its direction, is reproduced by a model with 2×2 discrete states: the normal open/closed states and two different states of \"gate tension\". Rates of transitions between the two branches of the hysteresis curve are modeled with single-barrier kinetics by introducing a real-valued \"reaction coordinate\" parametrizing the protein's conformational change between the two states of gate tension. The resulting scenario suggests a reanalysis of former experiments with NSVDC channels.",

    "abstract": "As it is well known, classical special relativity allows the existence of three different kinds of particles: bradyons, luxons and tachyons.Bradyons have non-zero mass and hence always travel slower than light.Luxons are particles with zero mass, like the photon, and they always travel with invariant velocity.Tachyons are hypothetical superluminal particles that always move faster than light.The existence of bradyons and luxons is firmly established, while the tachyons were never reliably observed.In quantum field theory, the appearance of tachyonic degrees of freedom indicates vacuum instability rather than a real existence of the faster-than-light particles.However, recent controversial claims of the OPERA experiment about superluminal neutrinos triggered a renewed interest in superluminal particles.Driven by a striking analogy of the old Frenkel-Kontorova model of a dislocation dynamics to the theory of relativity, we conjecture in this note a remarkable possibility of existence of the forth type of particles, elvisebrions, which can be superluminal.The characteristic feature of elvisebrions, distinguishing them from tachyons, is that they are outside the realm of special relativity and their energy remains finite (or may even turn to zero) when the elvisebrion velocity approaches the light velocity.",

    "abstract": "As it is well known, classical special relativity allows the existence of three different kinds of particles: bradyons, luxons and tachyons.Bradyons have non-zero mass and hence always travel slower than light.Luxons are particles with zero mass, like the photon, and they always travel with invariant velocity.Tachyons are hypothetical superluminal particles that always move faster than light.The existence of bradyons and luxons is firmly established, while the tachyons were never reliably observed.In quantum field theory, the appearance of tachyonic degrees of freedom indicates vacuum instability rather than a real existence of the faster-than-light particles.However, recent controversial claims of the OPERA experiment about superluminal neutrinos triggered a renewed interest in superluminal particles.Driven by a striking analogy of the old Frenkel-Kontorova model of a dislocation dynamics to the theory of relativity, we conjecture in this note a remarkable possibility of existence of the forth type of particles, elvisebrions, which can be superluminal.The characteristic feature of elvisebrions, distinguishing them from tachyons, is that they are outside the realm of special relativity and their energy remains finite (or may even turn to zero) when the elvisebrion velocity approaches the light velocity.",

By analyzing, within the framework of a Fermi statistical model, the hadron abundance and spectra, the properties of a disintegrating, hadron evaporating, deconfined QGP fireball are determined and can be compared with theory for the energy range 160–200AGeV on fixed target. We discuss in more detail our finding that the pion yields occur near to pion condensation condition. Dynamical models of chemical strangeness equilibration are developed and applied to obtain strangeness production in a QGP phase at conditions found at SPS and expected at RHIC. The sudden QGP break up model that works for the SPS data implies at RHIC dominance of both baryon, and antibaryon, abundances by the strange baryon and antibaryon yields.",

    "abstract": "Fragmentation products from a 92Mo beam on a natural nickel target have been used to study structural properties of the very neutron deficient nuclei around N∼Z∼40. We present the first observation of isomeric decays in the Tz=1 systems 3674Kr, 3980 Y and 4184Nb. The isomer in 74Kr is interpreted as the hindered decay from an excited 0+ state, confirming the prediction of prolate/oblate shape coexistence in this nucleus. Transitions from states below an isomer in the N=Z nucleus 4386Tc have also been tentatively identified, making this the heaviest N=Z system for which decays from excited states have been observed. In addition, we have obtained the first conclusive evidence for the existence of the Tz = -1/2 isotopes 3977Y, 4079Zr and 4283Mo. The data for 3977Y is of particular interest in light of the reported instability in the lighter odd-Z, Tz = -1/2 systems 69Br and 73Rb.",

The formulae are accurate in the range of mass numbers where the transition to rapidly elongating triaxial `Jacobi' shapes takes place. An improved set of formulae is also provided, which takes account of the decreased moments of inertia at low angular momenta. The formulae should be useful in guiding experimental searches for the Jacobi transition. In the second part of the paper we discuss qualitatively some aspects of the dynamics of nucleus-nucleus fusion, and outline a possible way of estimating cross-sections for the synthesis of superheavy nuclei.",

The calculation is performed for both angular independent and dependent parts. We separate the corrections into the outer and inner parts {\\` a} la Sirlin. The outer part is infrared and ultraviolet finite, and involves the positron velocity. The calculation of the outer part is straightforward, but that of the inner part requires a scrutiny concerning the continuation of the long-distance hadronic calculation to the short-distance quark treatment and the dependence on the model of hadron structure. We show that the logarithmically divergent parts do not depend on the structure of hadrons not only for the Fermi part, but also for the Gamow-Teller part. This observation enables us to deal with the inner part for the Gamow-Teller transition nearly parallel to that for the Fermi transition. The inner part is universal to weak charged-current processes and can be absorbed into the modification of the coupling constants up to the order of the inverse proton mass $O(1/m_{p})$. The resulting $O(\\alpha)$ corrections to the differential cross section take the form $ [1+\\delta_{\\rm out}(E)] [ (1+\\delta_{\\rm in}^{\\rm F}) ^2 +g_A^2 (1+\\delta_{\\rm in}^{\\rm GT}) ^2]$, where $ $ and $ $ stand for the Fermi and Gamow-Teller matrix elements; the outer correction $\\delta_{\\rm out}$ is positron energy ($E$) dependent and takes different functional forms for the angular independent and dependent parts.

The kinetic schemes that lead to such uncorrelated trajectories were termed reducible. Here we discuss the reasons that lead to reducible schemes.

In the case of large angular momentum, the condition for stability of circular orbits will change considerably relative to commutative case.",

In particular, we consider two physically relevant examples of geometric stable noises, namely Linnik and Mittag–Leffler.

An attempt to understand it led to the next natural question of how long does a particle need to tunnel a barrier.

A short review of the evolution of these time concepts, followed by an account of experiments involving field-induced tunnel ionization and electron tunneling in a solid state junction is presented here. Whereas the former experiments use sophisticated techniques involving femtosecond laser pulses and determine the tunneling time by mapping the angle of rotation of the field vector to time, like the hands of a watch, the latter provides a simpler method through the measurement of current-voltage characteristics of the junction.",

Smoluchowski Institute of Physics, Jagiellonian University, Reymonta 4, 30-059 Krakow, Poland 2Physics Department, UCC, Cork, Ireland 3Pedagogical University, Podchorazych 1, Krakow, Poland Abstract We analyze stationary accretion of selfgravitating gas onto a compact center within general-relativistic radiation hydrodynamics. Spherical symmetry and thin gas approximation are assumed. Numerical investigation shows that transonic flows exist for small redshifts and they cease to exist for high redshifts and high luminosities. There exist two branches of flows (subsonic or supersonic) that originate at a bifurcation point and that embrace the set of subsonic solutions. The morphology of the set of subsonic solutions is essentially independent of redshifts and flows that belong to their boundary provide estimates of the gas abundance of subsonic solutions. It appears that prescribed boundary data guarantee uniqueness only of the bifurcation point, and that the latter has maximal luminosity.",

    "abstract": "Direct reaction techniques are powerful tools to study the single-particle nature of nuclei. Performing direct reactions on short-lived nuclei requires radioactive ion beams produced either via fragmentation or the Isotope Separation OnLine (ISOL) method. Some of the most interesting regions to study with direct reactions are close to the magic numbers where changes in shell structure can be tracked. These changes can impact the final abundances of explosive nucleosynthesis. The structure of the chain of tin isotopes is strongly influenced by the Z=50 proton shell closure, as well as the neutron shell closures lying in the neutron-rich, N=82, and neutron-deficient, N=50, regions. Here we present two examples of direct reactions on exotic tin isotopes. The first uses a one-neutron transfer reaction and a low-energy reaccelerated ISOL beam to study states in 131Sn from across the N=82 shell closure.

We have considered the eective force felt by the particle as being caused by the curvature of the space. We have analyzed the NC Poisson algebra of classical observables in order to obtain the NC corrections to Newton’s second law analogous to the one caused by a central field. We have also discussed the relation between ane connection and Dirac brackets, as they describe the proper evolution of the model over the surface of constraints in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, respectively. As an application, we have treated the so-called Zitterbewegung of the Dirac electron. Since it is assumed to be an observable eect, then we have traced its physical origin by assuming that the electron has an internal structure.",

There is a lack of experimental data on cross-sections for low-energies, information that is indispensable for modelling energy production in stars. As a consequence, extrapolations are made, with their unavoidable large uncertainty. Of particular interest are (p,γ) and (α,γ) reactions, in particular those, within the CNO cycle that regulate the ratio of C and O and those that burn O and, therefore, regulate the ratio between O and O in the Universe.

On the other hand, the Denton {\\it et al.} (DMP) perturbation theory, a globally-valid framework, has the 1-2 exchange symmetry which is akin to the one in the aforementioned solar-resonance perturbation (SRP) theory. In our picture, the symmetry must be associated with the resonance, not the framework, and if so these two 1-2 symmetries must be identical to each other. We conduct a comparative study of the 1-2 symmetries possessed by SRP and DMP to confirm their identity. An almost identity is verified, but in a highly nontrivial way.",

    "abstract": "Recently we have developed a method called ``Symmetry Finder'' (SF) for hunting the reparametrization symmetry in the three-neutrino system in matter. Here, we apply SF to the Denton {\\it et al.} (DMP) perturbation theory extended by including unitarity violation (UV), a possible low-energy manifestation of physics beyond the $\\nu$SM. Implementation of UV into the SF framework yields the additional two very different constraints, which nonetheless allow remarkably consistent solutions, the eight DMP-UV symmetries. Treatment of one of the constraints, the genuine non-unitary part, leads to the key identity which entails the UV $\\alpha$ parameter transformation only by rephasing, which innovates the invariance proof of the Hamiltonian. The quantum mechanical nature of the symmetry dictates the both $\\nu$SM and UV variables to transform jointly, through which the response of the two sectors are related to reveal their interplay. Thus, the symmetry can serve for a tool for diagnostics, probing the interrelation between the $\\nu$SM and a low-energy description of new physics. Problem of SF symmetry in vacuum is revisited to complete eight symmetries akin to DMP's.",

The modifications of the familiar tunneling process due to driving and dissipation are investigated numerically and explained in terms of the quasienergy spectrum. In absence of dissipation, there is a onedimensional manifold in the parameter space spanned by amplitude and frequency of the driving force, where tunneling is almost completely suppressed by the coherent driving. The influence of dissipation is described on basis of the reduced density matrix in the Floquet representation. In particular, we consider the effect of weak Ohmic damping. In the classical limit, this system corresponds to a damped bistable Duffing oscillator",

We find that the symmetry energy typical for several realistic nuclear potentials, which decreases at high densities, inhibits kaon condensation for weaker kaon-nucleon couplings. There exists a threshold coupling above which the kaon condensate forms at densities exceeding some critical value. This is in contrast to the case of rising symmetry energy, as e.g. for relativistic mean field models, when the kaon condensate can form for any coupling at a sufficiently high density. Properties of the condensate are also different in both cases.",

While the A {approx} 160 nuclei behave in a consistent manner, a more complicated scenario is observed in the mass 130 region. As a result of our experiments on the lightest Pr nuclei, the systematics of these Z = 59 nuclei have been extended, which aids in the understanding of the latter region. Triaxial deformation, a pn interaction, and quadrupole pairing are considered as possible contributors to this effect. As all the chiral-twin bands that are known have signature inversion in the favored band, a possible link between the two phenomena should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies about the impact of the CP-violating complex parameters in supersymmetry on the decays of third generation squarks and about T-odd asymmetries in neutralino and chargino production and decay are reviewed. The CP-even branching ratios of the third generation squarks show a pronounced dependence on the phases of A_t, A_b, mu and M_1 in a large region of the supersymmetric parameter space. This could have important implications for stop and sbottom searches and the MSSM parameter determination in future collider experiments. We have estimated the expected accuracy in the determination of the parameters by global fits of measured masses, decay branching ratios and production cross sections. We have found that the parameter A_t can be determined with an error of 2 - 3%, whereas the error on A_b is likely to be of the order of 50 - 100%. In addition we have studied CP-odd observables, like asymmetries based on triple product correlations, which are necessary to unambiguously establish CP violation. We have analysed these asymmetries in neutralino and chargino production with subsequent three-body decays at the International Linear Collider with longitudinally polarised beams in the MSSM with complex parameters M_1 and mu. The asymmetries, which appear already at tree-level because of spin correlation between production and decay, can be as large as 20% and will therefore be an important tool for the search for CP-violating effects in supersymmetry.",

Due to the main feature of linear fractional oscillations, namely a finite number of zeros, the limit cycle in such a generator has a short life time depending on the order of fractional derivative. The electronic circuit, leading to such auto-oscillations, is studied as an example, and its differential equation is derived. The active device characteristic is represented in the piecewiselinear approximation. The features of electric elements are discussed.",

The energy dependence is determined by the saturation scale, in our approach given by Lambda(2)(sat)(W-2) similar to (W-2)(C2). Imposing DGLAP evolution, we find C-2(theory) = 0.27 in agreement with the model-independent analysis of the HERA data. Different values of the exponent C-2 are correlated with different ratios of the longitudinal to transverse structure function. This stresses the need for experiments to separate longitudinal and transverse contributions in deep inelastic scattering.",

The underlying dynamics is conservative and noise-free. The supply of a sufficient total energy transforms the chain into the nonlinear regime from which an initially, nearly uniform lattice configuration becomes unstable, yielding a redistribution of energy. In an early stage of the dynamics, we estimate the degree of energy exchange enabling the coupled system to form strongly localized modes which eventually grow into a critical nucleus. Upon passing this transition state, the nonlinear chain performs a collective, deterministic escape. We analyze the associated nonlinear dynamics in phase space and relate the escape to diffusion in a separatrix layer.",

Such experiments are necessary in order to study the isospin degree of freedom in electromagnetic nucleon resonance excitations. In particular, experiments with the Crystal Ball/TAPS setup at the Mainz MAMI accelerator and the Crystal Barrel/TAPS setup at the Bonn ELSA accelerator are discussed. Both experiments use electromagnetic calorimeters which cover almost the full solid angle and can detect and identify photons from the decay of neutral mesons, recoil protons and neutrons and partly also charged pions. The complications from the Fermi motion of the bound nucleons and final-state interactions of the final-state particles will be discussed. Examples for the impact of the new data comprising absolute cross sections and polarization observables for single- and multiple-meson production reactions are given.",

At the algebra level, the Lorentz group consists of two copies of the (complexified) su(2) algebra, so one may anticipate that a similar way of thinking about the spacetime structure of scattering amplitudes should exist. In this article, we argue that this is indeed the case, and introduce the chirality-flow formalism for massless tree-level QED and QCD. Within the chirality-flow formalism, scattering amplitudes can directly be written down in terms of Lorentz-invariant spinor inner products, similar to how the color structure can be described in terms of a color flow.",

    "abstract": "We focus on the study of dynamics of two kinds of random walk: generic random walk (GRW) and maximal entropy random walk (MERW) on two model networks: Cayley trees and ladder graphs. The stationary probability distribution for MERW is given by the squared components of the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue \\lambda_0 of the adjacency matrix of a graph, while the dynamics of the probability distribution approaching to the stationary state depends on the second largest eigenvalue \\lambda_1. Firstly, we give analytic solutions for Cayley trees with arbitrary branching number, root degree, and number of generations. We determine three regimes of a tree structure that result in different statics and dynamics of MERW, which are due to strongly, critically, and weakly branched roots. We show how the relaxation times, generically shorter for MERW than for GRW, scale with the graph size. Secondly, we give numerical results for ladder graphs with symmetric defects. MERW shows a clear exponential growth of the relaxation time with the size of defective regions, which indicates trapping of a particle within highly entropic intact region and its escaping that resembles quantum tunneling through a potential barrier. GRW shows standard diffusive dependence irrespective of the defects.",

    "abstract": "After a succinct review of the MOND paradigm -with its phenomenology, and its various underlying theories -I concentrate on so-called modified inertia (MI) formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention.These share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed relation.My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ substantially from their \"modified-gravity\" (MG) kin in predicting other phenomena.Because MI theories are nonlocal in time, MOND effects depend on the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG theories.This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not only on the instantaneous value.And, it is even possible to construct MI theories with practically no EFE.Other predictions that may differ are also discussed.Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia formulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these points.",

We also present the more general case depending ona non-Hermiticity parameter, that allows us to interpolate between thecorresponding three Hermitian Wishart ensembles with real eigenvalues and themaximally non-Hermitian case. All three symmetry classes are explicitly solvedfor finite matrix size NxM for all complex eigenvalue correlations functions(and real or mixed correlations for real matrix elements). These are given interms of the corresponding kernels built from orthogonal or skew-orthogonalLaguerre polynomials in the complex plane. We then present the correspondingthree Bessel kernels in the complex plane in the microscopic large-N scalinglimit at the origin, both at weak and strong non-Hermiticity with M-N greateror equal to 0 fixed.",

    "abstract": "A new mechanism for generating neutrino masses without a high-energy mass scale is proposed. The mechanism needs a fundamental mass scale M in the 100-1000 TeV region and a minimal field content beyond the Standard Model one containing a pair of fermion singlets and a pair of weak doublet fermions for each neutrino mass, all of them with a mass of order M. The neutrino mass appears by a multiple seesaw-type tree-level diagram. We provide an explicit model based on supersymmetry and an abelian symmetry which provides the required fermion mass matrix. The mechanism is natural in the context of string theories with a low fundamental scale. Within an explicit example where the abelian symmetry is also responsible for the generation of fermion masses and mixings, we give a hint relating the fermion mass matrices and the weak mixing angle. By assuming the weak-strong couplings unification, one naturally finds $\\sin^2 \\theta_w = 1/4$ at the fundamental scale.",

We present a simple model in which we study the response of isoscalar t=0 and isovector t=1 pairing correlations to rotational motion. In particular, we address the role played by the t=1 and t=0 pair gaps with respect to the band crossing frequency. We argue that the t=1 neutron-proton pair field is of limited importance in even-even nuclei. For the t=0 pair field, we introduce two different pairing modes. One is invariant with respect to signature symmetry and one is not. The signature conserving mode results in a delay of the band crossing frequency, whereas the signature breaking part enhances the rigidity of the moment of inertia.",

To include $\\Lambda$'s, an additional contribution to their effective lagrangian is systematically constructed within the framework of FST. The relativistic Hartree (Kohn-Sham) equations are solved numerically, and least-square fits to a series of experimental levels are preformed at various levels of truncation in the extended lagrangian. The ground-state properties of any $\\Lambda$-hypernuclei are then predicted. In addition, ground-state $Lambda$-particle-nucleon-hole splittings are calculated where appropriate, and the apporach is calibrated against a calculation of the $s_{1/2}$-doublet splitting in the nucleus $^{32}_{15}P_{17}$.",

    "abstract": "It is interesting that there is a relationship between Schwarzschild solutions with laws of thermodynamics [1–6]. This picture was completed when the black hole evaporation was discovered [7] and the relation between the horizon and temperature was obtained [8–10]. It has been pointed out that the temperature of black hole is usually regarded as a kinetic effect, depending on the coordinate chart used by a class of observers such as free falling and fiducial observers, but not a property of the space-time geometry in general [14–20]. On the other hand, as pointed out in [13], if the horizon links the aspects of microscopic physics with the bulk dynamics, it can provide a link between the statistical mechanics and dynamics of a solid. In this picture, it is interesting that one can connect the field equations of describing the dynamics of gravity with the horizon thermodynamics. So there is an intriguing analogy between the gravitational dynamics and thermodynamics of horizons. This idea was further developed when the thermodynamics interpretation of Einstein equations was obtained [12, 13]. As shown by Kothawala et al. [12], it is possible to interpret the field equations near any spherically symmetric horizon as thermodynamics identity, T dS = dE +PdV . So the thermodynamical interpretation of gravitational dynamics is not restricted to only the spherically symmetric or static horizons but is quite generic in nature and indicates a deeper connection between",

    "abstract": "Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is at present one of the major techniques for non-invasive diagnostics in nuclear medicine. Almost the whole clinical routine is based on collimated cameras, originally proposed by Anger. Due to the presence of mechanical collimation, detection efficiency and energy acceptance are limited by thesystem geometrical features. In order to overcome these limitations, the application of Compton cameras for SPECT is being investigated for several years. A Compton camera prototype is at present under development by our collaboration, for high energy gamma detection in ion beam therapy monitoring and nuclear medicine. We propose in this study to compare our detector to a commercial Anger device, the GE Healthcare Infinia system, through Monte Carlo simulations (GATE v7.1 and Geant4 9.6 respectively). Given the possible introduction of new radio-emitters at higher energiesintrinsically allowed by the Compton camera detection principle, the detectors are exposed to point-like sources at increasing primary gamma energies, from actual isotopes already proposed for SPECT applications. The detector performances are studied in terms of radial event distribution, detection efficiency and final image, obtained by gamma transmission analysis for the Anger system, and with an iterative LM-MLEM algorithm for the Compton reconstruction. The Compton camera prototype is also characterized in terms of rate of random coincidences and at different energy resolutions. Although the rate of random coincidences appears to be close to 50% at clinical source activities, preliminary results show for the Compton camera a detection efficiency increased of a factor greater than an order of magnitude, associated with an enhanced spatial resolution for energies beyond 500 keV. We discuss then the proven advantages of Compton camera application with particular focus on dose delivered to the patient, examination time and spatial uncertainties.",

In this work, RSP calculated on the basis of clinical DECT scanner software (syngo. via) was compared to a validated published procedure (Hudobivnik) for calibration and pediatric head phantoms. Based on material inserts, the average difference between RSP values calculated using syngo. via (Hudobivnik) against reference values were 1.0% (0.7%). This difference excludes the lung inserts as the syngo. via method does not provide Z(eff) values for CT numbers < -500 HU. An analysis of the head phantom showed overall a good agreement with all RSP differences within 1% between the syngo. via and Hudobivnik methods. The use of clinically available syngo. via provides equivalent accuracy as a validated RSP calculation method.",

The appearance of this phase is a general feature of the σ-model and other models based on the chiral dynamics (e.g. the NJL model), and it occurs for a broad range of model parameters. Phenomenological, consequences on the physics of dense matter are discussed, in particular we describe interesting magnetic properties of the phase",

Prior to the bifurcation, in the regime ofdamped oscillations around the stable focus, noise serves as a bifurcationprecursor: the power spectrum includes a peak at the frequency of theself-sustained oscillations. Super- and sub-critical Hopf bifurcations diﬀercrucially in the noise dependence of the width of this spectral line. Incase of a super-critical bifurcation the width is a monotonically growingfunction of the noise intensity. In contrast, for a sub-critical bifurcation,growth of the intensity of the weak noise enforces a decrease of the peakwidth; the width starts to grow only when the noise level exceeds a certainthreshold value. Since the inverse spectral width is a measure of coherence,we conclude that true noise-induced coherence can be found only near thesub-critical bifurcation.PACS numbers: 05.40.Ca, 05.45.–a, 42.65.Sf",

Moreover, the non-perturbative field theory effects may contribute in a crucial way in other physical contexts as shown in Ref.

In Sec. 2, we introduce the formalism of the fermion mixing in QFT. Sec. 3, is devoted to the study of the currents and charges for the flavor mixing and to the discussion of the proper definition of flavor charges and states.

It is shown that the exchange of massive 4D Kaluza–Klein gravitons leads to amplitudes growing linearly with the CM energy squared. If the curvature, m0, of the metric is too small, the gravitational contributions lead to a violation of unitarity. However, m0 must be small enough relative to the 5D Planck mass, MPl 5, to avoid quantum gravitational effects. As a result, we find that there is only a small range of m0/MPl for which the model is consistent. The width of the window is determined by the size of the 4D cutoff of the theory. The extension of the Randall–Sundrum scenario to include curvature-Higgs mixing is also considered and limits on the mixing parameter are determined.",

A major reason is noise originating from the finite lengths of the financial time series used to compute the correlation matrix elements. In recent years, various methods have been proposed to reduce this noise, i.e. to clean the correlation matrices. This is of direct practical relevance for risk management in portfolio optimization. In this contribution, we discuss in detail the power mapping, a new shrinkage method. We show that the relevant parameter is, to a certain extent, self-determined. Due to the chirality and the normalization of the correlation matrix, the optimal shrinkage parameter is fixed. We apply the power mapping and the well-known filtering method, to market data and compare them by optimizing stock portfolios. We address the rle of constraints by excluding short selling in the optimization. (Less)",

    "abstract": "We show that the minimal Gaussian model of nonlocal vacuum quark and quark-gluon condensates in QCD violates the transverse character of the correlator of two vector currents. We suggest the improved Gaussian model of the nonperturbative QCD vacuum, which respects QCD equations of motion and minimizes the revealed gauge-invariance breakdown. We obtain the refined values of pion distribution amplitude (DA) conformal moments 〈ξ2N\n 〉π (N = 1, ..., 5) using the improved QCD vacuum model, including the inverse moment 〈x\n −1〉π, being inaccessible if one uses the standard QCD SR. We construct the allowed region for Gegenbauer coefficients a\n 2 and a\n 4 of the pion DA for two values of the QCD vacuum nonlocality parameter, λ\n 2\n = 0.4 and 0.5 GeV2.",

The lighter isotopes are rather spherical. It is also well established that three shapes co-exist in the transitional odd-A, N = 59, Sr and Zr nuclei. For N > 59, strongly deformed axially symmetric bands are observed. Recently, a new isomer of half-life 1.4(2) lis was observed in Kr-95, the odd-odd Rb-96 has been reinvestigated and a new high-spin isomer observed in the even-even Zr-98. These nuclei were studied by means of prompt gamma-ray spectroscopy of the spontaneous fission of Cm-248 using the EUROGAM 2 Ge array and/or measurements of ps isomers produced by fission of Pu-239,Pu-241 with thermal neutrons at the ILL (Grenoble). To allow spectroscopic studies of isomeric states with lifetimes around 100 ns, across a broad range of medium-heavy neutron-rich nuclei, an experiment was performed at a neutron guide of the ILL using thermal-neutron-induced fission. Fission fragments were identified using a small spectrometer consisting of a section to measure time-of-flight and an ionization chamber. Isomeric gamma rays emitted from complementary fragments were detected in an array of Ge detectors.",

The construction of such a compound process involves renormalized clustering of random number of walker’s spatio-temporal subsequent steps. The family of the renormalized steps defines a new class of coupled CTRWs. The diffusion front of the studied process exhibits properties which help us to enlarge the class of relaxation models discussed yet in the classical CTRW framework.",

    "abstract": "We calculate BSM hadronic matrix elements for K 0 -K0 mixing in the Dual QCD approach (DQCD).The ETM, SWME and RBC-UKQCD lattice collaborations find the matrix elements of the BSM density-density operators O i with i = 2-5 to be rather different from their vacuum insertion values (VIA) with B 2 ≈ 0.5, B 3 ≈ B 5 ≈ 0.7 and B 4 ≈ 0.9 at µ = 3 GeV to be compared with B i = 1 in the VIA.We demonstrate that this pattern can be reconstructed within the DQCD through the nonperturbative meson evolution from very low scales, where factorization of matrix elements is valid, to scales O(1 GeV) with subsequent perturbative quark-gluon evolution to µ = 3 GeV.This turns out to be possible in spite of a very different pattern displayed at low scales with B 2 = 1.2, B 3 = 3.0, B 4 = 1.0 and B 5 ≈ 0.2 in the large-N limit, N being the number of colours.Our results imply that the inclusion of meson evolution in the phenomenology of any non-leptonic transition like K 0 -K0 mixing and K → ππ decays is mandatory.While meson evolution, as demonstrated in our paper, is hidden in lattice QCD results, to our knowledge, DQCD is the only analytic approach for non-leptonic transitions and decays which takes this important strong dynamics into account.",

    "abstract": "The production of light anti-and hyper-nuclei provides unique observables to characterise the system created in high energy proton-proton (pp), proton-nucleus (pA) and nucleusnucleus (AA) collisions.In particular, nuclei and hyper-nuclei are special objects with respect to non-composite hadrons (such as pions, kaons, protons, etc.), because their size is comparable to a fraction or the whole system created in the collision.Their formation is typically described within the framework of coalescence and thermal-statistical production models.In order to distinguish between the two production scenarios, we propose to measure the coalescence parameter B A for different anti-and hyper-nuclei (that differ by mass, size and internal wave-function) as a function of the size of the particle emitting source.The latter can be controlled by performing systematic measurements of light anti-hyper-nuclei in different collision systems (pp, pA, AA) and as a function of the multiplicity of particles created in the collision.While it is often argued that the coalescence and the thermal model approach give very similar predictions for the production of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions, our study shows that large differences can be expected for hyper-nuclei with extended wave-functions, as the hyper-triton.We compare the model predictions with data from the ALICE experiment and we discuss perspectives for future measurements with the upgraded detectors during the High-Luminosity LHC phase in the next decade.",

The second concerns the possible inclusion of the BFKL re-summation of the $(\\alpha_s\\ln (1/x))^n$ terms. The third is the treatment of the heavy-quark thresholds. We show how to include the heavy-quark masses ($m_h$ with $h=c,b,t$) in DGLAP evolution which provides the correct {\\it smooth} behaviour through the threshold regions and how to subtract the low parton virtuality $|k^2|<Q^2_0$ contributions from the DIS and Drell-Yan NLO coefficient functions in order to avoid the double counting.",

These phases, if large O(1), can cause problems with satisfying experimental bounds on lepton, neutron and mercury EDMs [2]. This can be overcome by pushing sfermion spectra above a TeV scale or arranging internal cancelations [3]. Most unambiguous way to detect the presence of CP-violating phases would be to study CP-odd observables measurable at future accelerators — the LHC and the ILC.

The aim of the studies is the determination of partial wave contributions to the production process of the eta meson in nucleon-nucleon collisions. Here we present preliminary results of the extraction of the position of the interaction region with respect to the WASA detector and preliminary results on the degree of polarization of the COSY proton beam used in the experiment.",

The number of accumulated beam pions are 7.8x10^10 and 8.1x10^10 for different beam momenta of 1.92 and 2.01 GeV/c, respectively. No significant structure was observed in the missing mass spectra. Upper limits of the production cross section are obtained to be 0.28ub/sr in the laboratory frame at 90% confidence level for each beam momenta. With a help of theoretical models, an upper limit of the total decay width of Theta+ was estimated to be 0.36 and 1.9 MeV for J^P = 1/2+ and 1/2- states, respectively.",

The polymers are considered on a cubic lattice and their conformations are randomly changed with the help of pivot transformations. After each transformation, it is checked if the topology of the knot is preserved by means of a method called pivot algorithm and excluded area (in short PAEA) and described in a previous publication of the authors. As an application of this method the specific energy, the radius of gyration and heat capacity of a few types of knots are computed. The case of attractive short-range forces is investigated. The sampling of the energy states is performed by means of the Wang-Landau algorithm. The obtained results show that the specific energy and heat capacity increase with increasing knot complexity as in the case of repulsive interactions. The data about the gyration radius allow to estimate the size of the polymer knots at different temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Nonlocal Hamiltonian-type operators, like e.g. fractional and quasirelativistic, seem to be instrumental for a conceptual broadening of current quantum paradigms. However physically relevant properties of related quantum systems have not yet received due (and scientifically undisputable) coverage in the literature. In the present paper we address Schr\\\"{o}dinger-type eigenvalue problems for $H=T+V$, where a kinetic term $T=T_m$ is a quasirelativistic energy operator $T_m = \\sqrt{-\\hbar ^2c^2 \\Delta + m^2c^4} - mc^2$ of mass $m\\in (0,\\infty)$ particle. A potential $V$ we assume to refer to the harmonic confinement or finite well of an arbitrary depth. We analyze spectral solutions of the pertinent nonlocal quantum systems with a focus on their $m$-dependence. Extremal mass $m$ regimes for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $H$ are investigated: (i) $m\\ll 1$ spectral affinity (\"closeness\") with the Cauchy-eigenvalue problem ($T_m \\sim T_0=\\hbar c |\\nabla |$) and (ii) $m \\gg 1$ spectral affinity with the nonrelativistic eigenvalue problem ($T_m \\sim -\\hbar ^2 \\Delta /2m $). To this end we generalize to nonlocal operators an efficient computer-assisted method to solve Schr\\\"{o}dinger eigenvalue problems, widely used in quantum physics and quantum chemistry. A resultant spectrum-generating algorithm allows to carry out all computations directly in the configuration space of the nonlocal quantum system. This allows for a proper assessment of the spatial nonlocality impact on simulation outcomes. Although the nonlocality of $H$ might seem to stay in conflict with various numerics-enforced cutoffs, this potentially serious obstacle is kept under control and effectively tamed.",

    "abstract": "After a succinct review of the MOND paradigm -with its phenomenology, and its various underlying theories -I concentrate on so-called modified inertia (MI) formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention.These share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed relation.My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ substantially from their \"modified-gravity\" (MG) kin in predicting other phenomena.Because MI theories are nonlocal in time, MOND effects depend on the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG theories.This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not only on the instantaneous value.And, it is even possible to construct MI theories with practically no EFE.Other predictions that may differ are also discussed.Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia formulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these points.",

For the study of the QED and hadronic photon structure functions the simulations of two-photon processes were performed at the ILC center-of-mass energy equal to 500 GeV using the PYTHIA and the ILCSoft package. The analysis used information related to the forward detectors, tracking detectors and calorimeters which are parts of the ILD detector concept.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of mesons can be understood as quark-antiquark states.Yet, various other possibilities exists: glueballs (bound-state of gluons), hybrids (quark-antiquark plus gluon), and four-quark states (either as diquark-antidiquark or molecular objects) are expected.In particular, the existence of glueballs represents one of the first predictions of QCD, which relies on the non-Abelian feature of its structure; this is why the search for glueballs and their firm discovery would be so important, both for theoretical and experimental developments.At the same time, many new resonances (X, Y, and Z states) were discovered experimentally, some of which can be well understood as four-quark objects.In this paper, we review some basic aspects of QCD and show in a pedagogical way how to construct an effective hadronic model of QCD.We then present the results for the decays of the scalar and the pseudoscalar glueballs within this approach and discuss the future applications to other glueball states.In conclusion, we briefly discuss the status of four-quark states, both in the low-energy domain (light scalar mesons) as well as in the high-energy domain (in the charmonia region)",

    "abstract": "We briefly review the solution of three ensembles of non-Hermitian random matrices generalizing the Wishart-Laguerre (also called chiral) ensembles.These generalizations are realized as Gaussian two-matrix models, where the complex eigenvalues of the product of the two independent rectangular matrices are sought, with the matrix elements of both matrices being either real, complex or quaternion real.We also present the more general case depending on a non-Hermiticity parameter, that allows us to interpolate between the corresponding three Hermitian Wishart ensembles with real eigenvalues and the maximally non-Hermitian case.All three symmetry classes are explicitly solved for finite matrix size N × M for all complex eigenvalue correlations functions (and real or mixed correlations for real matrix elements).These are given in terms of the corresponding kernels built from orthogonal or skew-orthogonal Laguerre polynomials in the complex plane.We then present the corresponding three Bessel kernels in the complex plane in the microscopic large-N scaling limit at the origin, both at weak and strong non-Hermiticity with M -N ≥ 0 fixed.",

We introduce the technique of multiple time-scales to derive the Fokker–Planck equation for a single, or for a set of interacting Brownian particles, starting from the Liouville equation for the full system (Brownian particles and discrete bath). The limitations of the Fokker–Planck equation will then be emphasized. In particular, we shall point out that under “standard” experimental conditions, the Fokker–Planck description cannot be correct and that non-Markovian effects are expected. A microscopic description in the true experimental limit confirms this breakdown and leads to a generalized (non-Markovian and non-local in velocity space) Fokker–Planck equation, which describes the thermalization of the Brownian particle.",

Its estimation by different theoretical methods has led to a wide range of possible values. We describe a new approach to the determination of g, which exploits the rare radiative decays B∗ → Bγγ and D∗ → Dγγ. It is shown that the branching ratio of D∗ → Dγγ can be expressed as a function of a single unknown g and we calculate it to be in the measurable range between 1.6× 10−6 and 3.3× 10−5 for 0.25 < g < 1.

    "abstract": "We describe the remarkable accomplishments of the current heavy ion Pb–Pb collision experiments involving strange particle production, carried out at 158A GeV at CERN– SPS. These experimental results, together with the earlier 200A GeV S-induced reactions, imply that, at central rapidity, a novel mechanism of strangeness production arises, accompanied by excess entropy formation. We argue that: • these results are consistent with the formation of a space-time localized, highly excited, dense state of matter; • the freeze-out properties of strange hadrons are suggestive of the formation of a colordeconfined, thermally and nearly chemically equilibrated phase, which provides at present the only comprehensive framework to describe all experimental data; • the matter fireball is undergoing a transverse expansion with nearly the velocity of sound of relativistic matter; longitudinal expansion is not in the scaling regime. We present a first analysis of the recent Pb–Pb results and discuss several alternative reaction scenarios. We evaluate quantitatively strangeness production in the deconfined quark-gluon phase and obtain yields in agreement with the experimental observations made in 200A GeV S–W and 158A GeV Pb–Pb interactions. We also present a qualitative discussion of J/� results consistent with our understanding of strange particle results.",

We use the complete ACOT results to NLO, and make use of the MSbar massless results at NNLO and N3LO to estimate the higher order mass-dependent corrections. We show numerically that the dominant heavy quark mass effects can be taken into account using massless Wilson coefficients together with an appropriate rescaling prescription. Combining the exact NLO ACOT scheme with these expressions should provide a good approximation to the full calculation in the ACOT scheme at NNLO and N3LO.",

    "abstract": "As it is well known, classical special relativity allows the existence of three different kinds of particles: bradyons, luxons and tachyons.Bradyons have non-zero mass and hence always travel slower than light.Luxons are particles with zero mass, like the photon, and they always travel with invariant velocity.Tachyons are hypothetical superluminal particles that always move faster than light.The existence of bradyons and luxons is firmly established, while the tachyons were never reliably observed.In quantum field theory, the appearance of tachyonic degrees of freedom indicates vacuum instability rather than a real existence of the faster-than-light particles.However, recent controversial claims of the OPERA experiment about superluminal neutrinos triggered a renewed interest in superluminal particles.Driven by a striking analogy of the old Frenkel-Kontorova model of a dislocation dynamics to the theory of relativity, we conjecture in this note a remarkable possibility of existence of the forth type of particles, elvisebrions, which can be superluminal.The characteristic feature of elvisebrions, distinguishing them from tachyons, is that they are outside the realm of special relativity and their energy remains finite (or may even turn to zero) when the elvisebrion velocity approaches the light velocity.",

These equations are found by the author on the basis of the theory, developed by him, with two affine connections; one called Christoffel and the other, background. The latter is given by the equations of motion of free material particle in the Lobachevsky space. It is independent of the light velocity c",

The present paper proposes a basis for microscopic theory of universal gravitation. Questions like the relation of cosmological constant and quantum theory, black hole radiance and the nature of inertia are addressed. This paper is the second in the series of papers published in Acta Physica Polonica B. It is well known that the classical gravitating systems behave in the way foreign to statistical quantum mechanics. The negative specific heat of those systems and the phenomenon of gravitational collapse are different facets of the same reality. The difficulties arise which necessitate that the complete atomic description of gravitation and space-time be sought after. The departure from Einstein’s General Relativity Theory compatible with the statistical basis of the Universal Second Law of Thermodynamics takes the form of the mass-energy quantization condition. In this paper we show that a gravitating mass M in thermal equilibrium, sometimes called a black hole, behaves statistically like a system of some number",

After the promising results from GS, a second experiment in 126Ba followed at EB-IV, taking advantage of the use of the BGO Inner Ball (IB) for selecting the highest spins. The decay of the Giant Dipole Resonances (GDR) is also studied, and the analysis in progress. The Quasi-continuum transitions in the Jacobi region, show a significant decrease in energy for both 126Ba and 126Xe, compared to the Thomas-Fermi- and the LSD model predictions. Similar effects were recently found for other nuclei by Ward et al.",

    "abstract": "In the ideal pressure conditions of a helium-filled diamond anvil cell, we have been able to probe the resistivity and, for the first time, the specific heat of the heavy fermion superconductor CeCu2Si2 at pressures over 6 GPa, down to temperatures below 100 mK, and in a magnetic field up to 8 T. We clearly observed the superconducting jump using the AC calorimetry technique, which provides a semi-quantitative measure of the sample specific heat. The evolution of the superconducting transition with pressure was observed quasi-simultaneously in a single sample in both the resistivity and heat capacity. The jump in Cp hints at changes in the coupling regime. When Tc is a rapidly varying function of pressure, the resistive transition is broadened and strongly dependent on the measuring current. When Tc has a maximum at 2K, the residual resistivity shows a peak, and the resistivity is linear in temperature above Tc",

    "abstract": "In this paper a hidden extra symmetry of conformally invariant Lagrangians occuring in physics is pointed out. This symmetry is most apparent in a metric independent, i.e. in a Palatini-like presentation of the variational problem. In such presentation, the usual conformal weight of fields can be encoded as local dilatation group gauge charges. The conventional conformal invariance of Lagrangians is then equivalent to dilatation gauge invariance. The claim of the paper is, that the most commonly occurring conformally invariant Lagrangians turning up in physics are not only invariant to local dilatation gauge transformations, but they are also invariant to any change of the dilatation gauge connection, meaning an additional algebraic symmetry property. In terms of dimensional analysis and differential geometry, this additional symmetry means complete insensitivity of the Lagrangian to the choice of the parallel transport rule of local measurement units throughout spacetime.",

We now consider the full bosonic master-field equation from a related supersymmetric matrix model for dimensionality $D=3$ and matrix size $N=3$. In this last equation, the effects of dynamic fermions are included. With an explicit realization of the random constants entering this algebraic equation, we establish the existence of nontrivial solutions.

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to give an explicit example of differential calculus over Fedosov algebra of formal power series with coefficients in functions on symplectic manifold. The term “differential calculus” refers here to an unital N-graded algebra with nilpotent antiderivation i.e. to a structure analogous to the Cartan algebra of differential forms. The motivation for such investigation could be provided by the theory of Seiberg–Witten map [1]. The underlying noncommutativity of this theory is given by Moyal star product. One may ask about generalizations to other types of noncommutativity described by deformation quantization procedures e.g. to the Fedosov ∗-product on a symplectic manifold. When passing from Moyal to Fedosov product one encounters some difficulties. They generally originate in the fact that operators ∂ ∂xi which are derivations of both undeformed algebra of functions and Moyal algebra, are no longer derivations with respect to the Fedosov product. For this reason, the framework of the usual Cartan algebra cannot be used for developing consistent Seiberg–Witten map with Fedosov product. The construction presented in this paper may be regarded as a building block for such a theory. The approach presented here is similar to that developed in [2] and could be considered as its extension which",

    "abstract": "Nonperturbative regime of QCD is a mechanism responsible for the formation of baryons which belong to the low-energy. The difficulty in numerical calculations of lattice QCD leading to alternative models are considered some features of QCD. Lagrangians for these models should be derivable from QCD; in practice one constructs them taking into account relevant features of the underlying theory such as confinement, asymptotic freedom and spontaneous broken chiral symmetry [1]. One of the effective models in describing baryons properties is the linear sigma model which has been suggested earlier by Gell-Mann and Levy [2] to describe nucleons interacting via sigma (σ) and pion (π) exchanges. Linear sigma model sets up to understand the structure of nucleon that should respect the constraints imposed by chiral symmetry. Spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking require the existence of the pion which its mass vanishes in the limit of zero current mass. A few solutions for the Lagrangian of chiral linear sigma model when applied to the nucleon and delta have already been suggested. Birse and Banerjee [3] solved the linear chiral sigma model in mean-field approximation using the hedgehog ansatz for the pion field. After the variation, they performed an approximate projection on angular momentum and isospin ignoring in this procedure the contribution",

In particular it will include discussion of the beautiful shape evolution and coexistence observed in these nuclei along with the identification of a remarkable new family of band structures. The latter are very weakly populated rotational sequences with high moment of inertia that bypass the classic terminating configurations near spin 40-50 (h) over bar, marking a return to collectivity that extends discrete gamma-ray spectroscopy to well over 60 (h) over bar. Establishing the nature of the yrast states in these nuclei beyond the oblate band-termination states has been a major goal for the past two decades. Cranking calculations suggest that these new structures most likely represent stable triaxial strongly deformed bands that lie in a valley of favored shell energy in deformation and particle-number space.

    "abstract": "The rapidly growing computer Network has been the object of intensive studies for over a decade. Among the most commonly studied characteristics are packets count, packets sizes, or arrival times. Because of a different nature and the high complexity of Network Traffic the early attempts to model traffic variables as in the traditional teletraffic failed. The process of packets arrivals is no longer Poissonian, the inter-arrival times are not exponentially distributed and the traditional queuing theory is also not applicable. The studies of Network traffic are mostly empirically founded. The majority of the publications is devoted to statistical analysis of observed variables and their consistency with various ad hoc proposed models. In the modelling of network traffic the predominant role has been attributed to self-similar processes, heavy-tailed distributions and fractional noises. Beginning from the pioneering work of Leland et al. [1] (see also [2–7], and many others), it is claimed that among the most characteristic features of Network traffic are self-similarity and a bursty nature. Such claim is supported by observation of the behavior of some traffic variables, like the throughput traffic",

A strong octupole collectivity is observed in the negative parity states justifying the assignment of 144Ba as an octupole deformed nucleus. Higher lying excited states are studied and its structure is identified by looking at the collective wave functions obtained in the calculations.

    "abstract": "We have recently successfully demonstrated a new technique for production and study of many of the most exotic neutron-rich nuclei at moderate spins. LICORNE, a newly developed directional inverse-kinematic fast neutron source at the IPN Orsay, was coupled to the MINIBALL high resolution -ray spectrometer to study nuclei the furthest from stability using the 238U(n; f) reaction. This reaction and 232Th(n; f) are the most neutron-rich fission production mechanisms achievable and can be used to simultaneously populate hundreds of neutron-rich nuclei up to spins of 16 ~. High selectivity in the experiment was achieved via triple -ray coincidences and the use of a 400 ns period pulsed neutron beam, a technique which is unavailable to other population mechanisms such as 235U(nth; f) and 252Cf(SF). The pulsing allows time correlations to be exploited to separate delayed rays from isomeric states in the hundreds of nuclei produced, which are then used to cleanly select a particular nucleus and its exotic binary partners. In the recent experiment, several physics cases are simultaneously addressed such as shape coexistence, the evolution of shell closures far from stability, and the spectroscopy of nuclei in the r-process path near N = 82. Preliminary physics results on anomalies in the 238U(n; f) fission yields and the structure of the 138Te and 100Sr nuclei will soon be published. A future project, -ball, to couple LICORNE with a hybrid escape-suppressed spectrometer to refine further the technique and achieve a large increase in the observational limit is discussed.",

In a first step the two most important decay modes of the Higgs boson are discussed: decays into a pair of gluons and, alternatively, decays into a bottom-antibottom quark pair. Subsequently the quark mass anomalous dimension is presented which is important for predicting the value of the bottom quark mass at high scales and, consequently, the Higgs boson decay rate into pair of massive quarks, in particular into $b\\bar b$. In the next section the $\\alpha_s^4$ corrections to the vector- and axial-vector correlator are discussed. These are the essential ingredients for the evaluation of the QCD corrections to the cross section for electron-positron annihilation into hadrons at low and at high energies, to the hadronic decay rate of the $\\tau$ lepton and for the $Z$-boson decay rate into hadrons. Finally we present the prediction for the QCD beta-function in five-loop approximation, discuss the analytic structure of the result and compare with experiment at low and at high energies.",

A time-dependent approach is used in combination with a one-dimensional three-body model, which is composed of a heavier core nucleus and two nucleons, with the aim of describing its evolution in two-nucleon emission. The process is calculated from the initial state, in which the three ingredient particles are confined. In this process, two different types of emission can be found: the earlier process includes the emission of spatially correlated two-nucleon pair, like a dinucleon, whereas, at a subsequent time, all the particles are separated from each other. The time-dependent method can be a suitable option to investigate the meta-stable and/or open-quantum systems, where the complicated many-body dynamics should necessarily be taken into account.",

In this paper I review both the flavour structures and then I present an explicit flavour model based on the discrete group S4, in which the PMNS mixing matrix is of the bimaximal form in first approximation and after it receives corrections which bring it in agreement with the data. The resulting spectrum of light neutrinos shows a moderate normal hierarchy and is compatible, within large ambiguities, with the constraints from leptogenesis as an explanation of the baryon asymmetry in the Universe.",

The clustering coefficient $C$ is tuned from zero to 1/3 by adding new links. At the same time, the density of geometrically frustrated links increases. We calculate the magnetic specific heat, the spin susceptibility and the Edwards-Anderson order parameter $q$ by means of the heat-bath Monte Carlo simulations. The aim is the transition temperature $T_x$ dependence on the clustering coefficient $C$. The results are compared with the predictions of the Bethe approximation. At C=0, the network is bipartite and the low temperature phase is antiferromagnetic. When $C$ increases, the critical temperature falls down towards the values which are close to the theoretical predictions for the spin-glass phase.",

    "abstract": "A wide variety of real random composites can be studied by means of prototypes of multiphase microstructures with a controllable spatial inhomogeneity. To create them, we propose a versatile model of randomly overlapping super-spheres of a given radius and deformed in their shape by the parameter p. With the help of the so-called decomposable entropic measure, a clear dependence of the phase inhomogeneity degree on the values of the parameter p is found. Thus, a leading trend in changes of the phase inhomogeneity can be forecast. It makes searching for possible structure/property relations easier. For the chosen values of p, examples of two and three-phase prototypical microstructures show how the phase inhomogeneity degree evolves at different length scales. The approach can also be applied to preparing the optimal starting configurations in reconstructing real materials.",

The equations of the model are reduced to the form which allows a direct comparison between them and the equations of the Einsteinian classical theory of gravity. It is shown that quantized scalar field has a form of a condensate which behaves as an antigravitating medium. The theory predicts an accelerating expansion of the universe even if the vacuum energy density vanishes. An antigravitating effect of a condensate has a purely quantum nature. It is shown that the universe with the parameters close to the Planck ones can go through the period of exponential expansion. The conditions under which in semi-classical approximation the universe looks effectively like spatially flat with negative deceleration parameter are determined. The reduction to the standard model of classical cosmology is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Gravity compresses the matter in the cores of neutron stars to densities which are significantly higher than the density of ordinary atomic nuclei, thus providing a high-pressure environment in which numerous particle processes - from the generation of new baryonic particles to quark deconfinement to the formation of Boson condensates and H-matter - may compete with each other. There are theoretical suggestions of even more `exotic' processes inside pulsars, such as the formation of absolutely stable strange quark matter, a configuration of matter even more stable than the most stable atomic nucleus, iron. In the latter event, neutron stars would be largely composed of pure quark matter, eventually enveloped in nuclear crust matter. No matter which physical processes are actually realized inside neutron stars, each one leads to fingerprints, some more pronounced than others though, in the observable stellar quantities. This feature combined with the tremendous recent progress in observational radio and X-ray astronomy, renders neutron stars to nearly ideal probes for a wide range of dense matter studies, complementing the quest of the behavior of superdense matter in terrestrial collider experiments.",

    "abstract": "Based on a 2D version of the Smoluchowski-type model, formulated in a phase space of the linear objects’ sizes R-s in terms of the mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics (MNET) as a guiding formalism/mechanism, we are looking in a comparative way for its basic trends and characteristics in a suitably designed Monte Carlo (MC) computer experiment on model biopolymer aggregation. The preliminary small-scale simulation results indicate that the examined hydrophobic-polar HP (dis)ordered aggregations bear two-type signatures of the underlying (complex) Smoluchowski dynamics. The first one is associated with a phase-separative tendency, showing up, in suitable conditions, lamellar ordering within the cluster, intermingled randomly with an amorphous phase. This is the case called by us the cylindrolite formation. The second-type signature, in turn, seems to point out some more disordered-from-within overall HP aggregations, presumably resulting in establishing a large HP mega-cluster, tending to span all over the available 2D simulation space. The quantitative characteristics derived so far show up at best an approximative tendency towards interpolating between this two types of aggregation/phase-separation signatures. A certain hope for better adjusting theory to computer simulation may come from realizing a non-Markovian character of the process which, for example, enables one to manipulate with the time scale in a case-sensitive, presumably excluded-area involving manner.",

We propose, however, that such a sterile world can contact with our Standard Model world not only through gravity but also through a portal provided by photons coupled to sterile particles by means of two very weak effective interactions -(f/M^2)\\phi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\phi F_{\\mu\\nu} and -(f'/M^2) (\\bar\\psi \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu} \\psi)\\phi F_{\\mu\\nu}, where M is a very large mass scale and f and f' are dimensionless coupling constants. Thus, in our picture, the electromagnetic field F_{\\mu\\nu} - as the only Standard Model field - participates in both worlds, providing a nongravitational link between them (other than the popular supersymmetric weak interaction, active in the case of neutralinos). In consequence, there appears a tiny quasi-magnetic correction to the conventional electromagnetic current (described in Appendix A).",

    "abstract": "We have investigated phenomenological aspects of kaon photoproduction in three different extreme kinematics.The first kinematics of interest is the threshold region.At the threshold we have investigated the convergence of kaon photoproduction amplitude by expanding the square of the amplitude in terms of the ratio m K /m, where m K is the mass of kaon and m is the averaged mass of nucleon and Λ-hyperon.The amplitude is calculated from the appropriate Feynman diagrams by using the pseudovector theory.The contact diagram as a consequence of the PCAC hypothesis is also taken into account in the amplitude.Our finding indicates that the convergence can be only achieved if the amplitude was expanded up to at least 12 th order.As a consequence, applications of some theoretical calculations based on the expansion the scattering amplitude, such as the Low Energy Theorem or Soft Kaon Approximation, cannot be easily managed in kaon photoproduction.The second kinematics is the forward region, where we could assume only t-channel contributes to the process.Here we have investigated the effect of amplitude expansion on the extraction of the coupling constants g K + Λp and g V K + 1 Λp .The last kinematics is the backward region, where we have also assumed that only u-channel survives and we could extract the leading coupling constants g K + Λp and g K + Σ 0 p .",

    "abstract": "The factorisation scheme (FS) abbreviated as KRK FS including a new definition of the PDFs for initial hadrons was formulated while developing KrkNLO scheme of matching QCD NLO corrections for the hard process with the parton shower heavy boson production in hadron-hadron collision and for deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering. KRK FS (originally called Monte Carlo FS) can be regarded as a variant of the $\\overline{MS}$ system. It is therefore trivially universal, that is process independent. The question of its universality is formulated differently: As the basic role of KRK FS is to simplify drastically NLO corrections, the question is now whether the same {\\em single} variant of PDFs in the KRK FS is able to achieve the same maximal simplification of the NLO corrections for {\\em all processes} with one or two initial hadrons and any number of the final hadrons? Our answer is positive and the proof is elaborated in the present note within the Catani-Seymour subtraction methodology. KRK FS is mandatory in the KrkNLO method of matching NLO calculation and parton shower -- a much simpler alternative of POWHEG and/or MC\\@ NLO. However, the use of KRK FS and the corresponding PDFs simplifies NLO calculations for any other method of calculating NLO corrections and for arbitrary processes as well.",

This historical detection is providing fundamental new insights into the astrophysical site for the r-process and on the nature of dense matter. In this contribution we examine the impact of GW170817 on the equation of state of neutron rich matter, particularly on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Limits on the tidal polarizability extracted from GW170817 seem to suggest that the symmetry energy is soft, thereby excluding models that predict overly large stellar radii.",

    "abstract": "Triggered by the experimentally-driven renewed interest in hyperon properties, we address the subject of weak radiative hyperon decays (WRHD).We start with the issue of Hara's theorem and briefly discuss the question of its possible evasion.Then, we give a short review of the story of vector-meson-dominance (VMD) approach to WRHD.We stress the shift from the Hara's-theorem-violating to Hara's-theorem-satisfying version of the VMD approach that did occur over time.Finally, spurred by a recent theoretical paper, we discuss the pole model description of WRHD, putting special attention to the issue of the contributions from the intermediate Λ(1405) state.We point out that the measurement of the Λ → nγ decay asymmetry could resolve the encountered ambiguities and definitely answer the question of whether Hara's theorem is violated or not.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the two theoretical approaches for the formulation of the tachyonic Dirac equation.The first approach works within the theory of restricted relativity, starting from a Lorentz invariant Lagrangian consistent with a spacelike four-momentum.The second approach uses the theory of relativity extended to superluminal motions and works directly on the ordinary Dirac equation through superluminal Lorentz transformations.The equations resulting from the two approaches show mostly different, if not opposite, properties.In particular, the first equation violates the invariance under the action of the parity and charge conjugation operations.Although it is a good mathematical tool to describe the dynamics of a space-like particle, it also shows that the mean particle velocity is subluminal.In contrast, the second equation is invariant under the action of parity and charge conjugation symmetries, but the particle it describes is consistent with the classical dynamics of a tachyon.This study shows that it is not possible with the currently available theories to formulate a covariant equation that coherently describes the neutrino in the framework of the physics of tachyons, and depending on the experiment, one equation rather than the other should be used.",

Experimental E3 strengths, which as a function of the neutron number peak at around N approximate to 8 8 and N approximate to 1 3 4, indicate enhanced octupole correlations as predicted by theory. Low-energy Coulomb excitation is a highly successful method for establishing the evolution of nuclear shapes, through the measurement of cross sections, to populate excited states that can be directly related to the static and dynamic moments of the charge distribution of the nucleus. A Coulomb excitation experiment at the ALTO facility, Orsay was performed recently to study collective properties of Nd-146 and Sm-148. In particular, the strengths of the and matrix elements will provide a clear distinction between octupole vibration and rigid deformation.",

    "abstract": "A consistent scheme of semiclassical quantization in polygon billiards by wave function formalism is presented.It is argued that it is in the spirit of the semiclassical wave function formalism to make necessary rationalization of respective quantities accompanied the procedure of the semiclassical quantization in polygon billiards.Unfolding rational polygon billiards (RPB) into corresponding Riemann surfaces (RS) periodic structures of the latter are demonstrated with 2g independent periods on the respective multitori with g as their genuses.However it is the two dimensional real space of the real linear combinations of these periods which is just used for quantizing RPB's.Next a class of doubly rational polygon billiards (DRPB) is considered for which these real linear relations are rational and their semiclassical quantization by wave function formalism is presented.It is then shown that semiclassical quantization of both the classical momenta and the energy spectra are determined completely by periodic structure of the corresponding RS's.Each RS can be then reduced to elementary polygon patterns (EPP) as its basic periodic elements building it.Each such EPP can be glued to a torus of genus g.Semiclassical wave functions (SWF) are then constructed on EPP's.The SWF's for DRPB's appear to be exact and have forms of coherent sums of plane waves.They satisfy on the billiards boundaries well defined conditions -the Dirichlet, the Neumannn or the mixed ones.Not every mixing of such conditions is allowed however and the respective limitations can ignore some semiclassical states in the presented formalism.A respective incompleteness of SWF's provided by the method used in the paper is discussed.Families of DRPB's can form dens subsets of angle similar rational polygon billiards allowing for approximate semiclassical quantization of the latter.Next general rational polygons are quantized by approximating them by doubly rational ones.A natural extension of the formalism to irrational polygons is described shortly as well.When the semiclassical approximations constructed in the paper appear really as only approximations the latter are controlled by a general criteria of the eigenvalue theory.Finally a relation between the superscar solutions and SWF's constructed in the paper is also discussed.",

The purpose of this work was to design such a system, especially for high dose rate, small field irradiations under cryogenic conditions for material and bioscience research. In this work, two possible solutions, based either on beam scanning or scattering and collimation, were studied and compared. It was found that under existing conditions efficiency of both systems would be comparable. The latter one was adopted due to its simplicity and much lower cost. The system design was optimized by means of detailed Monte Carlo modeling. The system is being currently fabricated at National Centre for Nuclear Research in \\'Swierk.",

Yet, various other possibilities exists: glueballs (bound-state of gluons), hybrids (quark-antiquark plus gluon), and four-quark states (either as diquark-antidiquark or molecular objects) are expected. In particular, the existence of glueballs represents one of the first predictions of QCD, which relies on the nonabelian feature of its structure; this is why the search for glueballs and their firm discovery would be so important, both for theoretical and experimental developments. At the same time, many new resonances ($X,Y,$ and $Z$ states) were discovered experimentally, some of which can be well understood as four-quark objects. In this lecture, we review some basic aspects of QCD and show in a pedagogical way how to construct an effective hadronic model of QCD. We then present the results for the decays of the scalar and the pseudoscalar glueballs within this approach and discuss the future applications to other glueball states. In conclusion, we briefly discuss the status of four-quark states, both in the low-energy domain (light scalar mesons) as well as in the high-energy domain (in the charmonia region).",

The existence of this effect at the quantum-mechanical level is investigated by considering two analogous processes involving the tunnel effect in a strong field: (1) dissociation of the positronium atom (2) electron pair creation. In case (1) the positronium is taken in the 3P_0 state to simulate the vacuum quantum numbers J^PC = 0^++. Using the nonrelativistic WKB method, the final electron and positron are indeed found to be transversely polarized along \\hat z \\times \\vec p_T. On the contrary, case (2), treated with the Dirac equation, shows no correlation between transverse polarization and transverse momentum both when the field is uniform and when it depends on z and t. The pair is nevertheless produced in a triplet spin state. The difference between these two results and their relevance to transverse spin asymmetry in inclusive reactions is discussed.",

A generalization of the underlying argument to the case of spatially correlated disorder, exemplified by quasi-crystals, has been given by Luck. We address the question, whether a relevance criterion of this type is applicable to the case of spin models coupled to different kinds of random graphs . The geometrical fluctuation exponent appearing in Luck’s criterion is precisely determined for the cases of two-dimensional Poissonian Voronoi-Delaunay random lattices and planar, “fat” φ Feynman diagrams. While previous work for the latter graphs is in accord with the determined relevance threshold, a preliminary analysis of the results of a Monte Carlo simulation of the three-states Potts model on Poissonian Voronoi lattices presented here does not meet the expectations from the relevance criterion.",

The measurement was performed at NBI Riso using the NORDBALL array. Alternating parity, epsilon = +1 band in Sm-150 has been observed up to spin I = 22. This band is crossed by two aligned bands, corresponding to a reflection-symmetric shape. After the second crossing the s = +1 band ends abruptly, suggesting that the octupole shape vanishes in Sm-150 above spin I = 22, as predicted by calculations. Other explanations, assuming continuation of the s = +1 band past the two alignments are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Two-photon collisions at the e + e colliders allow to investigate the formation and the properties of resonant states in a very clean experimental environment. A remarkable number of new results have been recently obtained giving important contributions to meson spectroscopy and glueball searches. The most recent results from the LEP collider at CERN and CESR at Cornell are reviewed here. Two-photon collisions at electron positron storage rings are a good laboratory to investigate the properties of meson resonances and play a crucial role in glueball searches. A resonant state R can be formed by the collision of two photons via the reaction e + e ! e + e R (g. 1). The outgoing electron and positron are usually scattered at very small angles and are not detected (no-tag mode). In this case the two photons are quasi real and the resonant state R must be neutral and unflavoured with C=1 and J6 If one of the two photons is highly virtual, the outgoing electron or positron can be detected at low angle and the spin of the resonant state is allowed to be one (single-tag mode). In both cases the two outgoing particles carry nearly the full beam energy and the mass of the resonant state is much smaller than the e + e centre of mass energy. This fact allows a clean separation between the twophoton and the annihilation process by using a cut in the visible energy. Since there are no particles produced other than R, the reconstruction of the nal state can be performed in a very clean experimental environment. The cross section for this process is given by the convolution of the QED calculable luminosity function L, giving the flux of the virtual photons, with",

First, we give a briefsurvey of the theoretical framework for microscopic nuclear structure cal-culations starting from a free nucleon-nucleon potential. Then, we presentsome selected results of a comprehensive study of nuclei near doubly closedshells. In all these shell-model calculations we have made use of realisticeﬀective interactions derived from the Bonn-A nucleon-nucleon potentialby means of a G-matrix folded-diagram method. We show that this kindof calculation yields a very good agreement with experiment for all thenuclei considered. This leads to the conclusion that realistic eﬀective inter-actions are now able to describe with quantitative accuracy the propertiesof complex nuclei.PACS numbers: 21.60.Cs, 21.30.Fe, 27.60+j, 27.80.+w",

It turns out that if the Higgs-boson mass is close to its lower LEP limit then the upper bound on the scale of new physics that follows from the vacuum stability requirement would be decreased dramatically even for modest values of coefficients of effective operators implying new physics already at the scale of a few TeV.",

    "abstract": "We analyse the dynamics of the Warsaw Stock Exchange index WIG at a daily time horizon before and after its well defined local maxima of the cusp-like shape decorated with oscillations. The rising and falling paths of the index peaks can be described by the Mittag-Leffler function superposed with various types of oscillations. The latter is a solution of our model of index dynamics defined by the nonhomogeneous fractional relaxation equation. This solution is a generalised analog of an exactly solvable model of viscoelastic materials. We found that the Warsaw Stock Exchange can be considered as an intermediate system lying between two complex ones, defined by short and long-time limits of the Mittag-Leffler function; these limits are given by the Kohlraush-Williams-Watts law for the initial times, and the power-law or the Nutting law for asymptotic time. Hence follows the corresponding short- and long-time power-law behaviour (different ”universality classes”) of the time-derivative of the logarithm of WIG which can in fact be viewed as the ”finger print” of a dynamical critical phenomenon.",

The noncontractible space, as an alternative symmetry-breaking mechanism to the Higgs mechanism, can change standard field theoretic calculations of the physical processes mediated through quantum loops for large external momenta or large internal masses. The presence of the W bosons and t-quarks in loops of the B meson mixing can enhance the corresponding semileptonic CP asymmetry when the loop integration is up to the universal Lorentz and gauge invariant UV cut-off. We show that the enhancement is roughly 13%, thus the possible deviation is measurable at the Tevatron, LHCb, SuperKEKB and SuperB facilities.",

    "abstract": "After a succinct review of the MOND paradigm -with its phenomenology, and its various underlying theories -I concentrate on so-called modified inertia (MI) formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention.These share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed relation.My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ substantially from their \"modified-gravity\" (MG) kin in predicting other phenomena.Because MI theories are nonlocal in time, MOND effects depend on the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG theories.This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not only on the instantaneous value.And, it is even possible to construct MI theories with practically no EFE.Other predictions that may differ are also discussed.Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia formulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these points.",

Together, these interactions generate a Hilbert space of states on the black hole horizon, which can be investigated, displaying interesting systematics by themselves. To make such approaches more powerful, a study is made of the black hole complementarity principle, from which one may deduce the existence of a hidden form of local conformal invariance. Finally, the question is raised whether the principles underlying Quantum Mechanics are to be sharpened in this domain of physics as well. There are intriguing possibilities.",

    "abstract": "The Standard Model of particle physics has been very successful in predicting a wide range of phenomena and has so far been confirmed by all existing data to a very high precision.The work described in this thesis tests the limits of validity of the Standard Model (SM) in two areas believed to be sensitive to deviations from the theory: the observation of unpredicted particles and CP violation. The studies were performed within the framework of experiments at two hadron colliders, the future ATLAS detector scheduled for operation in 2007 at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva and the currently running DO experiment at the Tevatron in Chicago.The tau lepton’s distinctive signature is a useful tool in many new physics searches where it is present in the final state. As a first study in ATLAS a Monte Carlo analysis of two-tau final states, which are sensitive to the underlying structure of supersymmetric models, was performed. Several extensions of the SM predict the existence of a charged Higgs boson.The major part of this thesis has consisted in using tau leptons to search for the charged Higgs in the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM). Results from this thesis show that searches for the H± → τντ decay channel extend the charged Higgs discovery reach for the ATLAS experiment compared to previous studies of other channels: the charged Higgs can be observed for masses up to ~ 600 GeV for tanβ > 10. Its mass can be determined with an uncertainty of 1 to 2%, dominated by statistical errors. The tanβ parameter can be derived from the absolute rate of this decay to a precision around 6% for 20 < tan β < 50.By measuring precisely the unitarity triangle parameter sin2β the SM description of CP violation can be put to a test. As a separate study a Monte Carlo analysis was performed in ATLAS, which shows that the systematic uncertainty is half the attainable statistical uncertainty. As part of the effort to search for the charged Higgs in the DO experiment a trigger algorithm for tau leptons was written, extensively tested and implemented in the experiment. Trigger strategies for events containing taus were designed. These trigger studies will be useful also for many other new physics searches at DO.",

This is further specialized to the ``generalized classical description'' of spin, and the ``classical description'' with only one surviving spin tensor component. Closed and open models have to be necessarily shearing while Euclidean models admit also a zero value of shear. A general expression for shear in all classes of models is derived; it is helpful in proving that the singularity may be prevented in the Einstein--Cartan theory thanks to the repulsive spin--spin interaction. This is possible even in those semiclosed models which do not permit any simply transitive group of motions; they may constitute authentically pulsating models with shear and torsion.",

The multiplicity distribution over fractional A energy z has been investigated and the fragmentation function DuΛ(z) has been extracted. The DuΛ(z) found by HERMES is well described with the help of the parametrization based on the experiments on A production in high energy proton-proton collisions, but it is substantially smaller then that deduced from the e+e- annihilation data. The distribution over A transverse momentum squared pT2 has also been analyzed. The results show that at z g 0.2 the pT2 distribution is dominated by the quark transverse motion in the fragmentation process. The longitudinal spin transfer from the beam to the A has been measured. The systematic uncertainty of the spin transfer has been reduced by reversal of the beam polarization several times during the data taking period. The spin transfer coefficient is found to be SΛ = 0.04±0.08(stat)±0.03(syst) at an average fractional energy of the produced A hyperons of 〈z〉 = 0.45. The dependence of the longitudinal spin transfer on z is presented and compared with recent theoretical calculations.",

We demonstrate on the example of one-dimensional periodic potential thatsmall perturbation leading to chaos squeezes instanton gas and increases the rate ofinstanton tunnelling. 1 Introduction Semiclassical properties of classically chaotic dynamical systems (quantum chaos [1]) is areach rapidly developing ﬁeld of research. One of the attractive phenomenon obtained inthis direction is chaos assisted tunnelling ([2] and references therein).In this work we analytically investigate inﬂuence of the perturbation leading to chaos onthe rate of instanton [3] transitions on the example of one-dimensional periodic potential.Instantons represent alternative way to describe quantum tunnelling and play an importantrole not only in quantum mechanics (recent example [4]), but mainly in the modern theoriesof particle physics, e.g. electroweak theory, QCD, SUSY, etc. (for review see [5]). Thesearch of instantons, initiated in DESY, is one of targets of modern QCD [6]. The mainproblem in this direction is an extremely small probability of instanton-induced events.It is of importance to study if chaos can increase probability of instanton tunnelling. Wedemonstrate on the particular example of simple quantum mechanical system that it is reallypossible.Hamiltonian of the system under consideration is taken in the formH˜ =12p˜",

Various charged particle detectors enabled an event-by-event tracking of the incoming radioactive projectiles and the reaction products, thus allowing for a selection of the nuclei of interest and their velocity vector reconstruction. The gamma-ray detection system consisting of the EUROBALL Cluster Ge detectors and the large volume HECTOR BaF2 detectors measured prompt gamma-radiation from nuclei excited in the secondary target. Despite the huge Doppler shift due to the high recoil velocity (beta approximate to 40%), RISING achieved a gamma-energy resolution below 2%. The paper reviews the present status of the RISING project. (Less)",

The computing method is a development of a previous one based on a Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm, with a the grand-canonical limit of the multi-species multiplicity distribution as proposal matrix. The microcanonical average multiplicities of the various hadron species are found to converge to the canonical ones for moderately low values of the total energy.

It is argued that this phenomenon may be also an origin of the unstable dynamical behaviour of the system (i.e. existence of “runaway solutions”). It is proved that a suitable polarisation mechanism of the particle restores the stability, at least on the level of statics. Whether or not it restores also the full, dynamical stability of the theory is still an open question.",

This theorem was first proven by the Author in 1992 in his contribution to the Czyz Festschrift, see Erratum {\\it Acta Phys. Pol. B} {\\bf 23}, 959 (1992). In this paper a completely different proof is given: we derive the partial, differential equation satisfied by the matrix element $ , \\sigma > 0$, and show that the function $\\exp (z)\\cdot (1-z)\\cdot \\exp[-\\sigma z (2-z)], z= e^2/ \\pi$, is an exact solution of this differential equation, recovering thus both the eigenvalue and the probability of occurrence of the bound state.",

The symmetry breaking is tied to a special solution of QCD which can be constructed, at high-energy, via the chiral anomaly and reggeon diagrams. There is confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, but physical states contain both quarks and a universal, anomalous, wee gluon component. A variety of Cosmic Ray effects could be supporting evidence, including the knee in the spectrum and the ultra-high energy events. The sextet neutron should be stable and is a natural dark matter candidate. A large $E_T$ jet excess at Fermilab, and large $x$ and $Q^2$ events at HERA, would be supporting accelerator evidence. Further evidence, including diffractive-related vector boson pair production and top quark related phenomena, could be seen at Fermilab as data is accumulated.",

    "abstract": "The Casimir effect is usually interpreted as due to the modification of the zero point energy of QED when two perfectly conducting plates are put very close to each other, and, consequently, as a proof of the “reality” of this zero point energy. The Dark Energy, necessary to explain the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe is sometimes viewed as another proof of the same reality. The usual interpretation of the Casimir effect is however challenged by some authors who rather consider it as a “giant” van der Waals effect. All these aspects are discussed. The Casimir effect corresponds to the force acting beetween two uncharged parallel condensor plates. It is customarily attributed to the change in zero point energy of the electromagnetic vacuum extending between the plates with respect to the one of the vacuum contained in the same region in the absence of plates. The zero point energy is supposed to result from the standard quantization of the free electromagnetic field. This energy is not directly observable, but the force between the two plates results from the change of the zero point energy contained between the plates when the latter are moved apart from each other. The Casimir effect is generally considered as a “proof” of the reality of the zero point energy. The dark energy, seemingly necessary to explain the observed accelerating expansion of the Universe is sometimes advocated as another “proof” of the same reality. All these aspects are shortly examined below.",

    "abstract": "The beta-delayed neutron emission probability, P-n, of very neutron-rich nuclei allows us to achieve a better understanding of the nuclear structure above the neutron separation energy, S-n. The emission of neutrons can become the dominant decay process in neutron-rich astrophysical phenomena such as the rapid neutron capture process (r-process). There are around 600 accessible isotopes for which beta-delayed one-neutron emission (beta 1n) is energetically allowed, but the branching ratio has only been determined for about one third of them. beta 1n decays have been experimentally measured up to the mass A similar to 1 5 0, plus a single measurement of Tl-210. Concerning two-neutron emitters (beta 2n), similar to 3 0 0 isotopes are accessible and only 24 have been measured so far up to the mass A = 100. In this contribution, we report recent experiments which allowed the measurement of beta 1n emitters for masses beyond A > 200 and N > 1 2 6 and identified the heaviest beta 2n emitter measured so far, Sb-136.",

Technically that involves a familiar transformation from a nonHermitian Fokker–Planck operator to the Hermitian operator (e.g. Schrodinger Hamiltonian), whose negative is known to generate a dynamical semigroup. Under suitable restrictions upon the generator, the semigroup admits an analytic continuation in time and ultimately yields dual motions. We analyze an extension of the duality concept to Levy flights, free and with an external forcing, while presuming that the corresponding evolution rule (fractional dynamical semigroup) is a dual counterpart of the quantum motion (fractional unitary dynamics).",

The analysis confirms that the reaction cross-section appears still dominated by dissipative binary reactions involving the survival of well-defined projectileand target-like fragments. Consistent with such a “gentle” collision scenario are the Galilei-invariant velocity distributions of charged products featuring statistical emission from two fully accelerated projectileand target-like fragments. On the other hand, the Galilei-invariant velocity plots reveal the presence of a third effective emission source with velocity intermediate between the velocities of projectileand target-like fragments. Fragments emitted from the intermediate-velocity source appear to be produced dynamically in the overlap zone of the projectile and target nuclei. The experimental multidimensional joint distributions of neutrons and charged reaction products were found to exhibit several different types of prominent correlation patterns. It makes them a useful tool for probing reactions scenarios, different from the traditional approach of interpreting inclusive yields of individual reaction products.",

    "abstract": "The relatively simple {\\it Fibre-Bundle} geometry of a Yang--Mills gauge theory --- mainly the clear distinction between base and fibre --- made it possible, between 1953 and 1971, to construct a fully {\\it quantized} version and prove that theory's {\\it renormalizability}; moreover, {\\it nonperturbative} (topological) solutions were subsequently found in both the fully symmetric and the spontaneously broken modes {\\it (instantons, monopoles).} Though originally constructed as a model formalism, it became in 1974 the mathematical mold holding the entire {\\it Standard Model} (\\ie QCD and the Electroweak theory). On the other hand, between 1974 and 1984, Einstein's theory was shown to be perturbatively nonrenormalizable. Since 1974, the {\\it search for Quantum Gravity} has therefore provided the main motivation for the construction of Gauge Theories of Gravity. Earlier, however, in 1958-76 several such attempts were initiated, for aesthetic or heuristic reasons, to provide a better understanding of the algebraic structure of GR. A third motivation has come from the interest in {\\it Unification}, making it necessary to bring GR into a form compatible with an enlargement of the Standard Model. Models can be classified according to the relevant structure group in the fibre. Within the Poincar\\'e group, this has been either the $R^{4}$ translations, or the Lorentz group ${\\rm SL}(2,C)$ --- or the entire Poincar\\' e ${\\rm SL}(2,C)\\times R^{4}$. Enlarging the group has involved the use of the {\\it Conformal} ${\\rm SU}(2,2)$, the {\\it special Affine} $\\overline{{\\rm SA}}(4,R)=\\overline{{\\rm SL}}(4,R)\\times R^{4}$ or {\\it Affine} $\\overline{A}(4,R)$ groups. Supergroups have included {\\it supersymmetry}, \\ie the graded-Poincar\\' e group $(n=1\\ldots 8$ in its extensions) or the {\\it superconformal} ${\\rm SU}(2,2/n)$. These {\\it supergravity} theories have exploited the lessons of the aesthetic-heuristic models --- Einstein--Cartan {\\it etc.} --- and also achieved the Unification target. Although perturbative renormalizability has been achieved in some models, whether they satisfy {\\it unitarity} is not known. The nonperturbative Ashtekar program has exploited the understanding of instantons and self-dual solutions in QCD, in the complexification and in the selection of new variables. Note that supergravity involves Lie Derivatives as supertranlations, and several models have treated local spacetime translations similarly. The reduction of the larger groups, down to Poincar\\'e, has involved spontaneous fibration and spontaneous symmetry breakdown. In this context, {\\it noncommutative geometry} may allow for further geometrization.",

Furthermore, gamma decay of CEGR call help to unravel their structure. For example, the gamma-decay of the Gamow-Teller (GT) resonance to the isobaric analogue state (IAS) points to a possible method to study quenching of GT strength. The study of gamma-decay of the spin-flip dipole resonance (SDR) to GT and low-lying states will possibly allow to disentangle the different spin components. These aspects will be discussed in the light of recent (He-3,t) experiments at E(He-3) = 450 MeV and theta = 0 degrees performed to study the proton decay of CEGR in Bi-208 and N-12 and the gamma decay of the GT resonance, IAS and SDR in Nb-90.",

We start with a sketchy presentation of the Quantum Chromodynamics which is the fundamental theory of strong interactions. The structure of hadrons built up of quarks and gluons is briefly discussed with a special emphasis on the confinement hypothesis. Then, we explain what is the quark-gluon plasma and consider why and when the hadrons can dissolve liberating the quarks and gluons. The heavy-ion collisions at high-energies, which provide a unique opportunity to get a droplet of the quark-gluon plasma in the terrestrial conditions, are described. We also consider the most promising experimental signatures of the quark-gluon plasma produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions. At the end, the perspectives of the quark-gluon plasma studies at the future accelerators are mentioned.",

Steinberger with the very successful concept of the pion as the (pseudo)Nambu-Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken global axial symmetry of strong interactions. That inconsistency has been resolved by J. Bell and R. Jackiw in their famous paper on the chiral anomalies. We review the connection between the decay amplitudes of an axion into two gauge bosons in Abelian vector-like and chiral gauge theories. The axion is the Nambu-Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken axial global symmetry of the theory. Similarly as for the vector-like gauge theory, also in the chiral one the axion decay amplitude is determined by the anomaly of the current of the axial symmetry in its non-linear realization. Certain subtlety in the calculation of the anomaly in chiral gauge theories is emphasised.",

When the correlation betweenthese noise signals is strong enough and the amplitudes of the noise arechosen correctly — the life time of the metastable state may be longer thanin the case of the application of only a single noise even by many ordersof magnitude. In this paper, we investigate similar phenomena in systemsexhibiting several chaotic transitions: Pomeau–Manneville intermittency,boundary crisis and interior crisis induced intermittency. Our goal is toshow that, in these systems the application of two noise components withthe proper choice of the parameters in the case of intermittency can alsolengthen the mean laminar phase length or, in the case of boundary crisis,lengthen the time the trajectory spends on the pre-crisis attractor. Insystems with crisis induced intermittency, we introduce a new phenomenonwe called quasi-deterministic giant suppression of activation in which thelengthening of the laminar phase lengths is caused not by the action of twocorrelated noise signals but by a single noise term which is correlated withone of the chaotic variables of the system.PACS numbers: 05.45.–a, 05.40.Ca",

Macroscopically, this can be understood as the coexistence of different potential energy minima within a small energy interval. From microscopical point of view, this phenomenon can be explained invoking particle-hole excitations across the closed shell. The combined effect of monopole, pairing, and quadrupole interaction may cause the intrusion of the bands built on these p–h excitations to very low energies [1], hence leading to mixing between the different bands, i.e. configuration mixing. One of the most spectacular examples is the Pb-region where both microscopic [2,3] and macroscopic [4,5] approaches succesfully describe the dramatic lowering of collective intruder bands towards neutron midshell.",

It combined the EUROBALL Ge-Cluster detectors, the MINIBALL Ce detectors, the HECTOR-BaF detectors, and the fragment separator FRS. The secondary beams produced at relativistic energies were used for Coulomb excitation or secondary fragmentation experiments to study projectile like nuclei by measuring de-excitation photons. The first results of the fast beam campaign is discussed in comparison to various shell model calculations. The discussion focuses on the N = 32, 34 sub-shell closure based on neutron rich Cr isotopes. Alternatively, the relativistic radioactive beams, both in their ground and isomeric states, were implanted and their decay could be investigated. The stopped beam campaign has started in October 2005 with a series of g-factor measurements. It continued from February 2006 with the next, configuration and the main goal of identification of new isomers and angular momentum population in fragmentation reactions. (Less)",

The infrared pole structure is in agreement with the prediction of Catani's general formalism for the singularities of two-loop QCD amplitudes.",

The mass is calculated by using the spectral function in the Walecka model, finding that it is about 380MeV. In addition, we obtain the value of 340MeV for the width of its spectral function. We find that there is a reduction in the mass value compared with that in vacuum. This result is consistent with those reported by other authors who have used different models predicting a decreasing of the mass as a function of the density.",

    "abstract": "A careful treatment of closed fermion loops in quantum electrodynamics is developed starting from Schwinger's gauge invariant formulation of the current, involving a line integral, in an external field problem. The analysis is carried out for multiloop contributions and to all orders of perturbation theory. The derived {\\it vanishing} property of closed fermion loops when any subset of the external photon momenta are set equal to zero has a very important role in the renormalization program as this does not necessitate the introduction of the unwanted light--light scattering contact term in the Lagrangian. This also permits taking the limit of the photon zero-mass at least for Euclidean nonexceptional external momenta. The functional approach, used in this work, is found to be particularly suited for treating the closed fermion loop problem.",

    "abstract": "I review results from recent investigations of anomalies in fermion--Yang Mills systems in which basic notions from noncommutative geometry (NCG) where found to naturally appear. The general theme is that derivations of anomalies from quantum field theory lead to objects which have a natural interpretation as generalization of de Rham forms to NCG, and that this allows a geometric interpretation of anomaly derivations which is useful e.g. for making these calculations efficient. This paper is intended as selfcontained introduction to this line of ideas, including a review of some basic facts about anomalies. I first explain the notions from NCG needed and then discuss several different anomaly calculations: Schwinger terms in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensional current algebras, Chern--Simons terms from effective fermion actions in arbitrary odd dimensions. I also discuss the descent equations which summarize much of the geometric structure of anomalies, and I describe that these have a natural generalization to NCG which summarize the corresponding structures on the level of quantum field theory. \r\nContribution to Proceedings of workshop `New Ideas in the Theory of Fundamental Interactions', Szczyrk, Poland 1995; to appear in Acta Physica Polonica B.",

The latter strongly depends on the topology of the leads. We also provide analytical evidence for an anomalous behavior of the conductance as a function of the contact strength.",

Conversion electrons from electromagnetic transitions preceding the fission of the 3.7 ns Pu-240f Shape isomer have been measured. In a combined analysis of e(-) and high resolution gamma -ray spectroscopy data previously established octupole bands could be studied in more detail. In order to study higher lying states in the second and third minimum the Pu-239(d,pf)Pu-240, and the U-233(d,pf)U-234 reactions have been studied with high energy resolution. The observed fission resonances were described as members of rotational bands with rotational parameters characteristic to super- and hyperdeformed nuclear shapes. The level density of the most strongly excited states has been compared to the prediction of the back-shifted Fermi-gas formula and the energy of the ground state in third minimum has been estimated for the first time in U-234. The fission fragment mass distribution of the hyperdeformed states in U-236 has also been measured. The width of the mass distribution, coincident with the hyperdeformed bands, is significantly smaller than the ones obtained in coincidence with background regions below and above the resonances, which suggests a pear-shaped di-nuclear configuration of U-236 in the third well of the potential barrier.",

Motivated by the superallowed Fermi beta-decay studies, we have investigated the structure of Cr-50 and Zn-62, the daughters of the superallowed beta(+)/EC emitters Mn-50 and Ga-62, with (p,t) reactions. For both nuclei, we reassigned the location of the first excited 0(+) state. The data for these reassignments are reviewed and limits on the possible L = 0 transfer to the previously assigned 0(2)(+) states are determined. For Cr-50, we find no evidence for the presence of a 0(+) state at 3695 keV. For Zn-62, the data allow for a possible contribution of L = 0 and L = 2, indicating a possible 0(+)/2(+) doublet of states at 2342 keV. However, this relies on an enhanced cross section at only one data point, and thus the existence of a 0(+) state at this energy is not clear. A preliminary result from a gamma-gamma angular correlation measurement following the beta(+)/EC decay of Ga-62 weakly favours the existence of a 0(+) state, but requires further study with increased statistics.",

The effects of the dynamical parameters on the stability and the wavelength of the structure are analytically studied and used to propose experimental conditions for which a Turing pattern stops by itself with a decreasing wavelength. The proposed mechanism is successfully checked by the numerical integration of the equations governing the dynamics of the activator and the inhibitor. We conclude that a local increase of the concentration of the reservoir which controls the injection rate of the inhibitor into the system can be used to achieve the appropriate termination of a Turing pattern.",

Similar behaviour is observed for theoretical cross sections evaluated in the two-step model in which the first stage of the reaction is described by intranuclear cascade INCL++ and the second stage by GEMINI++ model or by two other models, namely ABLA07 and SMM.The OES seems to be even more pronounced for theoretical than for the experimental cross sections.",

The method can reconstruct each pulse even for multiple events without losing the count within the small time window.Using this method 4.969 ns time-of-flight value were established and the rise times for scintillation counters, named Tile 1 and Tile 2, were measured about 6.27 ± 0.16 ns and 4.979 ± 0.165 ns, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the aim is to study the spread of a contagious disease and information on a multilayer social system. The main idea is to find a criterion under which the adoption of the spreading information blocks or suppresses the epidemic spread. A two-layer network is the base of the model. The first layer describes the direct contact interactions, while the second layer is the information propagation layer. Both layers consist of the same nodes. The society consists of five different categories of individuals: susceptibles, infective, recovered, vaccinated and precautioned. Initially, only one infected individual starts transmitting the infection. Direct contact interactions spread the infection to the susceptibles. The information spreads through the second layer. The SIR model is employed for the infection spread, while the Bass equation models the adoption of information. The control parameters of the competition between the spread of information and spread of disease are the topology and the density of connectivity. The topology of the information layer is a scale-free network with increasing density of edges. In the contact layer, regular and scale-free networks with the same average degree per node are used interchangeably. The observation is that increasing complexity of the contact network reduces the role of individual awareness. If the contact layer consists of networks with limited range connections, or the edges sparser than the information network, spread of information plays a significant role in controlling the epidemics.",

    "abstract": "The Collins function H 1 , describing the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into an unpolarized hadron [1], plays an important role in studies of the nucleon spin structure. Although H 1 is T-odd, it can be nonzero due to final state interactions. In fact, we were able to show for the first time that a nonvanishing Collins function can be obtained in a field theoretical approach through a consistent one-loop calculation of the fragmentation process [2]. To obtain a reasonable estimate of the Collins function, we calculate it in a chiral invariant approach at a low energy scale [3]. We use the model of Manohar and Georgi [4], which incorporates chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking, two important aspects of QCD at low energies. The Collins function enters several spin and azimuthal asymmetries in oneparticle inclusive DIS. Of particular interest is the transverse single spin asymmetry, where H 1 appears in connection with the transversity distribution, for which we predict effects of the order of 10%. In principle in semi-inclusive DIS only the shape of the Collins function can be studied, while a purely azimuthal asymmetry in e+e− annihilation allows one to measure also its magnitude. For this asymmetry we obtain effects of the order of 5%.",

In fact, the discrepancies between various experimental groups working at the same experiment are of the same size as the differences between RHIC and SPS. Our observation is complementary to the well known fact of the equality of the measured R_side and R_out HBT radii at RHIC and SPS. In essence, it points out that the transverse size of the firecylinder and the strength of the transverse flow are not significantly changed between SPS and RHIC. This suggests that a saturation mechanism is effective already at SPS. We also point out that the dominance of protons over pi^+ at large pT can be seen not only in the RHIC data, but already in the SPS data.",

Applying different coding schemes enables us to extract different information about the phase space structure from the chaotic trajectory. A judicial choice of the method of symbolic coding allows to obtain information which may be missing in the symbolic dynamics from the generating partition. We present results for the 1-D case taking the logistic map as a numerical example. The extension to higher dimension is also discussed.

It was found that inthe special range of control parameters the presence of the second diseasecan signiﬁcantly decrease the number of individuals, who passed the ﬁrstdisease. The speed of propagation of the wave-front of the epidemic iscalculated analytically and good agreement with numerical calculation isobtained. The inﬂuence of additional long range connections on epidemicspreading and phase transition is investigated. It is found that in specialconditions spatio-temporal patterns, in particular spiral waves, can emergein the system.

    "abstract": "In previous papers it was shown that in a quasi-spherical Szekeres (QSS) metric, impulses of gamma radiation can arise that have several properties in common with the observed gamma-ray bursts.This happens when the bang-time function t B (r) has a gate-shaped hump around the origin of the QSS region.The gamma rays arise along two preferred directions of the QSS geometry (coincident with dipole extrema when axially symmetric, otherwise unrelated).In these directions, the rays of the relic radiation are blueshifted rather than redshifted.The blueshift is generated in a thin region between the Big Bang (BB) and the extremum-redshift hypersurface (ERH).But the Szekeres models can describe the real Universe only forward in time from the last-scattering hypersurface (LSH) because the matter in them has zero pressure.The ERH is tangent to the BB at the origin, so in a neighbourhood thereof the ERH lies earlier than the LSH and no blueshift is generated in the physical region.The question thus arose whether the BB and ERH can be \"unglued\" if the QSS region has no origin, but the areal radius function Φ has a local maximum or minimum somewhere.In the present paper it is demonstrated that this is indeed the case.If the hump in t B (r) is centered around the minimum of Φ, then the BB and ERH in general do not coincide there and a stronger blueshift is generated on rays passing nearby.It follows that a lower and narrower hump on the BB set can generate sufficient blueshift to move the initial frequencies of the relic radiation to the gamma range.These facts are demonstrated by numerical calculations in an explicit example of a QSS region.",

After a short conceptual introduction there are two baselines. It is showed first how Goedel's theroem affects the foundation of anthropic principles. Our train of thought shows that Goedel's incompleteness theorem may deny some efforts claiming that anthropic principles can be ruled out.

The theoretical results are calculated within the tensor-pomeron and vector-odderon model for soft reactions. We include absorptive corrections at the amplitude level. To describe the low-energy data measured in the past by the WA102 collaboration we consider also subleading processes with reggeized vector-meson exchanges and reggeons. We discuss possible evidences for odderon exchange at the low energies and try to make predictions at the LHC.",

If so, it would be the only halo nucleus exhibiting a \"pure\" s-wave structure of the ground state. At low collision energies, the effect of this halo structure should manifest as a strong absorption pattern in the angular distribution of the elastic cross section, with a total suppression of the nuclear rainbow due to the large neutron transfer and breakup probabilities, enhanced by the halo configuration. The IS619 experiment, carried out at the HIE-ISOLDE facility at CERN (Switzerland), is the first dynamical study of this nucleus at energies around the Coulomb barrier. It aims to probe the halo structure via the measurement of the elastic cross section on a high-Z 208Pb target. Preliminary results of the elastic cross section are discussed and compared to Optical Model calculations.",

Three independent measurements have been analysed, obtaining the values 771.9(17) ms, 773.9(18) ms, and 770.9(27) ms.

We examine how two different and statistically independent sources of noise - dichotomous multiplicative noise and additive Gaussian white noise - influence the population's extinction time. This quantity is identified as the mean first passage time of the system across the zero population state. We observe the effects of resonant activation (RA) and noise-enhanced stability (NES) and we report the evidence for competitive co-occurrence of both phenomena in a given regime of noise parameters. We discuss the statistics of first passage times in this regime and the role of different pseudo-potential profiles on the RA and NES phenomena. The RA/NES coexistence region brings an interesting interpretation for the growth kinetics of cancer cells population, as the NES effect enhancing the stability of the tumoral state becomes strongly reduced by the RA phenomenon.

    "abstract": "We discuss a simple and analytically solvable measurement model which describes the famous Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) and Inverse Zeno Effect (IZE), that correspond to the slow down and to the increase of the decay rate caused by measurements (or, more in general, by the interaction of an unstable state with the detector and the environment). Within this model one can understand quite general features of the QZE and IZE: by considering an unstable quantum state, such as an unstable particle, whose decay width as function of energy is $\\Gamma(\\omega)=g^{2}\\omega^{\\alpha},$ then -- under quite general assumptions -- the QZE occurs for $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$, while the IZE for $\\alpha \\in(-\\infty,0)\\cup(1,\\infty).$ This result is valid also for more realistic measurement models than the one described in this work. We then apply these considerations to the decay of the neutron, for which $\\alpha=5.$ Hence, the realization of the IZE for the neutron decay (and for the majority of weak decays) is in principle possible. Indeed, trap experiments find a lifetime that is $8.7\\pm2.1$ s shorter than beam experiments, suggesting that the IZE could have taken place.",

    "abstract": "A simple discrete model for the evolution of the interface (or front) in a 2d (square) lattice, based on a complete as well as natural set of a few stochastic rules, has been examined. The interface is initially assumed to be a vertical straight-line which is made of elementary unit pieces called further particles. Once one of the particles is chosen at random it is pushed either left or right, drawing two new horizontal units (particles). Then the process continues to proceed into both main directions, following the rules (reversible and irreversible) that generally rely on creating and annihilating at random the vertical as well as horizontal particles. The scaling properties of the system have been analyzed, recognizing the front as a subdiffusive (anomalous) macromolecular chain or “lattice animal”, with a few residual parts, on the one hand, and as a rough surface with overhangs in a 1 + 1space, on the other. In the former, it turns out that the current length of the front scales more or less like a polymeric chain under an attractive (qualitatively: “supressing”) potential field, while in the latter it seems at a first glance that the problem may fall into an universality class characteristic of the nonlinear nonconservative dynamics with possibly nonconservative noise, exemplified by some dynamics of rough surfaces or interfaces.",

After the experimental discovery of the top quark by the CDF collaboration (with a mass at the right place indicated by the electroweak fits) the challenge of precision physics has moved towards the only remaining unknown particle of the SM, namely the Higgs. However, in this case the game is much harder. The reason is clearly connected to the different behavior of the virtual effects of the two particles in the relevant electroweak corrections: power-like for the top, much milder and just logarithmic for the Higgs. To appreciate how much this logarithmic behavior makes hard the game for the theorists (and the experimentalists also) I consider the effective electroweak mixing angle, sin2θ eff ≡ s 2 eff , that is the most important quantity in the determination of MH, and write it as s2eff ∼ (c1 + δc1) + (c2 + δc2) log y; y ≡ (MH/100 GeV).

We present numerical results for the lepton energy and angular distributions, and for the distribution of the opening angle between the leptons for sqrt{s}=500 GeV. The effects of spin correlations are important in the lepton angular distribution, especially for gaugino-like neutralinos. The opening angle distribution is particularly suitable for distinguishing between higgsino- and gaugino-like neutralinos. The polarized cross sections and lepton angular distributions are very sensitive to the mixing of the neutralinos.",

Stress applied along the c-axis extends the phase diagram to higher pressures and enhances the superconducting phase emerging around the magnetic instability, with a 40% increase in the maximum superconducting temperature and a doubled pressure range. We discuss first the possible effect of anisotropic strain on the physics described only by spin fluctuations. However, the pressure dependence of the resistivity suggests a more complex ground state around the quantum critical point, where the Kondo and excited crystal field energies interact.",

We used the factorization formulae for the unpolarized inclusive and semi-inclusive $ep$ processes which hold in an arbitrary reference frame. The numerical studies were performed for the $ep$ HERA collider for a process with a large-$p_{\\rm T}$ (prompt) photons production, \\ie, the unpolarized Compton process $e p \\rightarrow e \\gamma X$, in the Born approximation. In the $ep$ center-of-mass frame we found that the differential cross section for the longitudinally polarized intermediate photon, $d \\sigma_{\\rm L}$, and the term due to the interference between the longitudinal- and transverse-polarization states of the photon, $d \\tau_{\\rm LT}$, are small, \\ie below $10 \\%$ of the cross section. Moreover, these two contributions almost cancel one another, leading to a stronger domination of the transversely polarized virtual photon, even for its large virtuality $Q^2$. We found that in this frame the interference term gives non-vanishing contributions even for the cross sections integrated over the azimuthal angle, contrary to a naive expectation. Relevance of the contributions of the longitudinal photon in a jet production in DIS events at the HERA collider is commented. A relatively large ($\\sim 30 \\%$) effect due to the interference term $d \\tau_{\\rm LT}$ was found for the considered process at the HERA collider in the azimuthal-angle distribution in the Breit frame. Here this contribution vanishes in the cross section integrated over $\\phi$.",

    "abstract": "We show that the Hamiltonian dynamics of the self-interacting, abelian p-form theory in D=2p+2 dimensional space-time gives rise to the quasi-local structure. Roughly speaking, it means that the field energy is localized but on closed 2p-dimensional surfaces (quasi-localized). From the mathematical point of view this approach is implied by the boundary value problem for the corresponding field equations. Various boundary problems, e.g. Dirichlet or Neumann, lead to different Hamiltonian dynamics. Physics seems to prefer gauge-invariant, positively defined Hamiltonians which turn out to be quasi-local. Our approach is closely related with the standard two-potential formulation and enables one to generate e.g. duality transformations in a perfectly local way (but with respect to a new set of nonlocal variables). Moreover, the form of the quantization condition displays very similar structure to that of the symplectic form of the underlying p-form theory expressed in the quasi-local language.",

Two characteristics of relaxation, the probability density function of the waiting times difference and the relaxation law, are of our particular interest. For systems characterized by Erlang distributions of waiting times, we consider different regimes of relaxation and show that, under certain conditions, the relaxation process can be non-monotonic. By studying the asymptotic behavior of the relaxation process, we demonstrate that heavy and superheavy tails of waiting time distributions correspond to slow and superslow relaxation, respectively.",

The equation of this surface, valid at arbitrary distances from the rotating magnetized sphere, is obtained. Inside the light cylinder this surface can be considered as a force-free surface, i.e. as a place where the particles with strong radiation damping can be trapped due to their energy loss. Outside the light cylinder this surface makes just a geometric locus which moves with a superlight velocity around the axis of rotation. The 2- and 3-dimensional plots of the force-free surface are constructed. Estimation of influence of the centrifugal force on the particle dynamics is made. It is shown, that in case of strong magnetic field the centrifugal force is negligible small everywhere except a narrow neighbourhood of the light cylinder.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this work is to construct a simplified model of the core-halo structures in binary systems, such as Thorne-Żytkov objects, hot Jupiters, protoplanets with large moons, red supergiants in binaries and globular clusters with central black hole.A generalized planar circular restricted three-body problem is investigated with one of the point masses, M , replaced with a spherical body of finite size.The mechanical system under consideration includes two large masses m and M , and a test body with small mass µ.Mass µ, initially, is placed at the geometric center of mass M , and shares its orbital motion.Only gravitational interactions are considered and the extended mass M is assumed to be rigid with rotational degrees of freedom neglected.Equations of motion are presented, and linear instability criteria are derived using quantifier elimination.The motion of the test mass µ is shown to be unstable due to the resonance between orbital and internal frequencies.In the framework of model, the central mass µ can be ejected if resonance conditions are met during the evolution of the system.The above result is important for core-collapse supernova theory, with mass µ identified with the helium core of the exploding massive star.The instability cause off-center supernova \"ignition\" relative to the center of mass of the hydrogen envelope.The instability is also inevitable during the protoplanet growth, with hypothetical ejection of the rocky core from gas giants and formation of the \"puffy planets\" due to resonance with orbital frequency.Hypothetical central intermediate black holes of the globular clusters are also in unstable position with respect to perturbations caused by the Galaxy.As an amusing example, we note that the Earth-Moon or the Earth-Sun systems are stable in the above sense, with the test body µ being a hypothetical black hole created in the high-energy physics experiment.",

It is shown that an arbitrary, real power of a standard Wilson loop (or Polyakov line) can be defined and consistently computed in lattice formulation of non-abelian, two dimensional gauge theories. However, such an observable can excite quantum states with integer fluxes only. Since the non-integer fluxes are not in the spectrum of the theory they cannot be created, no matter which observable is chosen. Also the continuum limit of above averages does not exist unless the powers in question are in fact integer. On the other hand, a new continuum limit exists, which is rather intuitive, and where above observables make perfect sense and lead to the string tension proportional to the square of arbitrary (non necessary commensurate with gauge coupling) charge.",

They extend the analyses of the irreducible background presented in the ATLAS and CMS Higgs papers by taking into account the emissions of off-shell photons by parton showers. Including these effects does not change significantly the Higgs-searches background level, provided that the transverse momentum of each of the final-state leptons is restricted to the range of $p_{T, l} > 7$ GeV. In the kinematical region extended towards lower lepton transverse momenta the parton-shower contribution becomes important. A measurement method for pinning down the parton-shower effects is proposed.",

In this work we have compared the energy levels, electromagnetic transition probabilities, quadrupole and magnetic moments with available experimental data. We have confirmed structure of high-spin states of these two nuclei which were tentatively assigned in the recent experimental work. In the case of $^{87}$Sr, for positive parity states up to $\\sim$ 7.5 MeV, both interactions predict very good agreement with experimental data, while negative parity states are slightly suppressed in jj44b calculation.For the $^{87}$Zr nucleus, the jj44b interaction predicts higher energies for the negative parity states beyond $J \\geq 27/2^{-}$. The configuration, which have one hole in $\\nu g_{9/2}$ orbital, is responsible for generating the states in $^{87}$Sr. In the case of $^{87}$Zr, low-lying positive parity states come with the configuration having three holes in the $\\nu g_{9/2}$, while the odd-parity states have configuration $\\nu (f_{5/2}^{-1}g_{9/2}^{-2})$.",

    "abstract": "Beta-delayed neutrons play a key role in the formation of heavy elements in explosive stellar environments. The final r-process abundance distribution, including the rare-earth peak, is tailored to a large extent by the neutrons released after the beta decay of very exotic neutron-rich nuclei encountered along the r-process path and during the freeze-out phase. Such scenarios involve a vast amount of — yet undiscovered — nuclei, and most of them are expected to be neutron emitters. In this respect, existing beta-delayed neutron emission data is rather scarce, spanning from the lightest isotopes up to the region of the fission-fragments with masses up to A ∼ 150. This contribution gives an overview on the latest measurements of neutron branching ratios in the heavy mass region around N = 126, which was practically unexplored in the past. Present plans to access very exotic nuclei at the RIB-facility of RIKEN in the framework of the BRIKEN project, are presented, together with the expected impact in r-process nucleosynthesis studies.",

    "abstract": "In a series of recent papers it was shown that, when the attractive s-wave interaction is dominant, the spin-orbit coupled fermions form a bound state.Attributed to a convenient momentum representation, it became a common condition of agreement to express the bound state as a function of the center-of-mass momentum Q.In this letter we prove that the bound state of Rashba fermions does not depend on the chosen representation.That is, all the states characterized by nonzero Q fail to obey the translation symmetry.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of mesons can be understood as quark-antiquark states.Yet, various other possibilities exists: glueballs (bound-state of gluons), hybrids (quark-antiquark plus gluon), and four-quark states (either as diquark-antidiquark or molecular objects) are expected.In particular, the existence of glueballs represents one of the first predictions of QCD, which relies on the non-Abelian feature of its structure; this is why the search for glueballs and their firm discovery would be so important, both for theoretical and experimental developments.At the same time, many new resonances (X, Y, and Z states) were discovered experimentally, some of which can be well understood as four-quark objects.In this paper, we review some basic aspects of QCD and show in a pedagogical way how to construct an effective hadronic model of QCD.We then present the results for the decays of the scalar and the pseudoscalar glueballs within this approach and discuss the future applications to other glueball states.In conclusion, we briefly discuss the status of four-quark states, both in the low-energy domain (light scalar mesons) as well as in the high-energy domain (in the charmonia region)",

The effective proton magnetic moment is density-dependent and changes sign at some density n r , and so does the magnetization. Neutron stars with the central density close to n r have dipole magnetic field of the order of 10 12 G. For heavier stars the field decreases fast with the mass, goes through zero and then again increases, albeit in the opposite direction. The abrupt change of the magnetic field occurs on a mass scale of 0.1 solar mass. This model accounts for recent evidence that decay of magnetic field occurs only for neutron stars which accreted matter in their evolution",

    "abstract": "This paper describes principles of Accelerator-Driven Transmutation of Nuclear Wastes (ATW) and gives some flavour of the most important topics which are today under investigations in many countries. Pin assessment of the potential impact of ATW on a future of nuclear energy is also given. Nuclear reactors based on self-sustained fission reactions - after spectacular development in fifties and sixties, that resulted in deployment of over 400 power reactors - are wrestling today more with public acceptance than with irresolvable technological problems. In a whole spectrum of reasons which resulted in today's opposition against nuclear power few of them are very relevant for the nuclear physics community and they arose from the fact that development of nuclear power had been handed over to the nuclear engineers and technicians with some generically unresolved problems, which should have been solved properly by nuclear scientists. In a certain degree of simplification one can say, that most of the problems originate from very specific features of a fission phenomenon: self-sustained chain reaction in fissile materials and very strong radioactivity of fission products and very long half-life of some of the fission and activation products. And just this enormous concentration of radioactive fission products in the reactor core is the main problem of managing nuclear reactors: it requires unconditional guarantee for the reactor core integrity in order to avoid radioactive contamination of the environment; it creates problems to handle decay heat in the reactor core and finally it makes handling and/or disposal of spent fuel almost a philosophical issue, due to unimaginable long time scales of radioactive decay of some isotopes. A lot can be done to improve the design of conventional nuclear reactors (like Light Water Reactors); new, better reactors can be designed but it seems today very improbable to expect any radical change in the public perception of conventional nuclear power. In this context a lot of hopes and expectations have been expressed for novel systems called Accelerator-Driven Systems, Accelerator-Driven Transmutation of Waste or just Hybrid Reactors. All these names are used for description of the same nuclear system combining a powerful particle accelerator with a subcritical reactor. A careful analysis of possible environmental impact of ATW together with limitation of this technology is presented also in this paper.",

Through numerical analysis, it is shown that when the simulations are started from a certain set of initial conditions, thermalization occurs. Besides, an estimation method is proposed to determine the approximate thermalization time. Using this method, we demonstrate that thermalization time vary logarithmically with increasing matrix size when the mass terms differ. Introducing a matrix configuration, we also obtain reduced actions and subsequently analyze how the thermalization time change as a function of the energy.",

Going further, we recall few sporadic suggestions concerning the cancellation of the logarithmic divergences too, which in the framework of supersymmetry has led to the construction of all-loop Finite Theories with the use of the idea of reduction of couplings. Eventually, we concentrate on a specific Finite Unified Theory and its successful predictions for the top and Higgs mass, among others, and the prospects of its final justification in future collider searches.",

The alpha-nucleus effective potential used contains the Coulomb potential, centrifugal potential, and the nuclear potential. The nuclear potential is obtained via the double folding model, with the microscopic NN effective interactions derived from relativistic mean field theory Lagrangian (termed R3Y). Different parametrizations of the R3Y interactions have been employed in the computation of the nuclear potentials. The results obtained using the R3Y NN interactions are compared with the ones obtained using the famous Michigan-3-Yukawa (M3Y) interactions. The use of density-dependent NN interaction is also considered. When compared to available experimental data, there are improvements in the results when density-dependent interaction potentials are used compared to when density-independent interactions are employed.",

    "abstract": "After a succinct review of the MOND paradigm -with its phenomenology, and its various underlying theories -I concentrate on so-called modified inertia (MI) formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention.These share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed relation.My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ substantially from their \"modified-gravity\" (MG) kin in predicting other phenomena.Because MI theories are nonlocal in time, MOND effects depend on the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG theories.This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not only on the instantaneous value.And, it is even possible to construct MI theories with practically no EFE.Other predictions that may differ are also discussed.Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia formulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these points.",

    "abstract": "After a succinct review of the MOND paradigm -with its phenomenology, and its various underlying theories -I concentrate on so-called modified inertia (MI) formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention.These share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed relation.My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ substantially from their \"modified-gravity\" (MG) kin in predicting other phenomena.Because MI theories are nonlocal in time, MOND effects depend on the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG theories.This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not only on the instantaneous value.And, it is even possible to construct MI theories with practically no EFE.Other predictions that may differ are also discussed.Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia formulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these points.",

The PDM description is compared with the experimental systematics obtained from heavy-ion fusion, inelastic scattering of light particles on heavy targets, and alpha induced fusion reactions, as well as with predictions by other theoretical approaches.

In its minimal form, this model could quite naturally accommodate simultaneous solutions to the solar and LSND neutrino oscillation data. The atmospheric neutrino anomaly can be easily accommodated by mirror-symmetrising the minimal model. The model also contains three right-handed neutrinos, with masses in the range 1 keV to ∼ 1 GeV. We investigate the implications of these right-handed neutrinos for early Universe cosmology. It is shown that the minimal model is inconsistent with some of the standard assumptions of the big bang model. This motivates an examination of non-standard big bang cosmology, such as a low reheating temperature scenario with TRH ∼ MeV. In such a Universe, peaceful co-existence between low-scale quark-lepton gauge unification and early Universe cosmology is possible.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction, one of the fundamental forces of nature. The interactions between quarks are mediated by gluons, which are the colour-charged gauge fields in QCD. Hard processes with a large momentum transfer can be calculated using perturbation theory, while soft processes with a small momentum transfer are poorly understood. In this thesis, various aspects of the gluon interactions are studied based on the interplay between hard and soft processes.Soft gluon exchanges do not affect the dynamics of a hard process, but can rearrange the colour topology, resulting in different final states. The soft colour interaction models employ this idea and give a good description of all diffractive hard scattering data observed in pp collisions (W, Z, dijets, bb, J/ψ). This thesis also presents predictions for diffractive Higgs and γγ production at present and future hadron colliders.Multiple gluon exchanges give rise to saturation effects in hadronic collisions at high energies. Implementing this idea in photon-photon collisions gives new insight into the quantum structure of the photon and its interactions at high energies. When combined with perturbative calculations for single gluon exchange, the obtained results are in good agreement with experimental data from e+e- colliders.Off-shell gluon distributions in the photon give another perspective on the photon structure and have been parameterized for the first time in this thesis. These are useful for calculating cross sections of processes where the effects of transverse momenta are crucial, for example heavy quark production in γp or γγ collisions.Quantization of gauge fields which have a richer gauge structure than the gluons in QCD, is studied using the powerful BRST quantization formalism. Thus, first-stage reducible theories, like topological Yang-Mills and spin-5/2 gauge fields, are successfully quantized in an irreducible way.Understanding gluon interactions and the interplay between soft and hard processes paves the way towards solving the longstanding problem of confinement in QCD.",

    "abstract": "The shell structure of the nucleus implies the existence of magic numbers. Since several years many indications have been accumulated, theoretically as well as through experiments at various laboratories around the world, that if one moves away from stability, the location of the magic numbers shifts as an inescapable consequence of the evolving nature of the nuclear force itself. In this respect, it is the balance between the tensor and spin-orbit components that seems particularly instrumental. Illustrative examples from recent experiments at Ganil, at the neutron-rich and proton-rich side of the nuclear chart for N or Z equal 20 or 28, will be presented here.",

In particular, boson interferometry provides a powerful tool for the investigation of the spacetime structure of particle production processes, since Bose–Einstein correlations (BEC) of two identical bosons reflect both geometrical and dynamical properties of the particle radiating source. For our analysis we use a sample of about 500 thousand two-jet events, selected by the Durham algorithm [6] with ycut = 0.006, from e +e−annihilation data collected by L3 at a center-of-mass energy of 91.2 GeV.",

In the A similar to 70-80 region fusion evaporation reactions coupled with the recoil-beta-tagging method have been employed at Jyvaskyla to study low-lying states in odd-odd N = Z nuclei. Results from these and other data for known odd-odd nuclei above mass 60 will be discussed. In the heavier mass 90 region a fragmentation experiment has been performed using the RIS-ING/FRS setup at GSI. This experiment was primarily aimed at searching for spin gap isomers in nuclei around A similar to 96. The objectives of the latter experiment will be discussed.",

As a result, a {gamma}-ray transition between the single-neutron {nu}g{sub 7/2} and {nu}d{sub 5/2} states situated at the Fermi surface was identified. The measured {nu}g{sub 7/2}-{nu}d{sub 5/2} energy splitting was compared with predictions corresponding to various mean-field potentials and was used to calculate multi-neutron configurations in light Sn isotopes.

In this report, we present results on event-by-event elliptic flow fluctuations in Au + Au collisions at √sNN =200 GeV. A data-driven method was used to estimate the dominant contribution from non-flow correlations. Over the broad range of collision centralities, the observed large elliptic flow fluctuations are in agreement with the fluctuations in the initial source eccentricity.",

The model was proposed by L.V. Yakushevich and it is well known that the model supports, for some operating regimes, traveling wave solutions as kink-(antikink) soliton solutions. We have tried to make some progress by performing an analysis of the classical symmetries of this model. Our study shows that the model does not have enough symmetries as to reduce the equations to ordinary differential equations. Nevertheless, the known symmetries have been useful for finding several classes of exact solutions, by imposing adequate Ansatze. Some of them are kink - (antikink) like solutions, but other ones are not traveling wave solutions. For some of the new solutions, we have carried out a qualitative study and analyzed some stability properties. We think that they could be significant for the description of the DNA molecule as well as for some other applications.",

Homogeneity region K is the region where the hadrons with momentum K are produced. The size and shape of he homogeneity region is described by the Wigner function W(K,X) evaluated in the interaction picture after all the hadrons had been produced. Additional information about the interaction region is contained in the emission functio S(K,X). A theorem is presented and discussed which specifies which of the parameters characterizing the Wigner functin can and which cannot be obtained using the HBT method. In order to obtain the complete Wigner fuction additional assumptions are needed. For instance, it is enough to know the distribution of the centers of the homogeneity regions _K. In order to find the emission function further assumptions are required. No systematic analysis is available, but some instructive examples are discussed.",

Currently known as Squeezed or Back-to-Back Correlations (BBC), they should be present if the hadronic masses are modified in the hot and dense medium formed in high energy heavy ion collisions. Although well-established theoretically, such hadronic correlations have not yet been observed experimentally. In this phenomenological study we suggest a promising way to search for the BBC signal, by looking into the squeezed correlation function of phi phi and K^+ K^- pairs at RHIC energies, as function of the pair average momentum, K_{12}=(k_1+k_2)/2. The effects of in-medium mass-shift on the identical particle correlations (Hanbury-Brown & Twiss effect) are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "It is shown that the Mallmann’s energy correlations, introduced a long time ago for the ground state bands of the even‐even nuclei are, in fact, universal. Various bands in all collective nuclei (even‐even, odd‐even, and odd‐odd) obey the same systematics. This unique, universal behaviour indicates the same spin dependence of the energy of the levels and, consequently, a common structure of all collective bands. Based on the second‐order anharmonic vibrator description, parameter‐free recurrence relations between energy ratios are deduced. These relations can be used to predict levels of higher spins in various bands.",

Leptonic CP violation is a key phenomenon that has profound implications in particle physics and cosmology but it is clearly out of reach for the aforementioned experiments. Since late 90’s, a worldwide activity is in progress to design facilities that can access CP violation in neutrino oscillation and perform high precision measurements of the lepton counterpart of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix.",

Exact finite range DWBA analyses were performed with the aim to identify contributions of direct processes and to investigate the applicability of DWBA to such few nucleon systems. It turned out that DWBA can be successfully applied to estimate differential and total cross sections of direct transfer processes in 7Li+7Li interaction. The direct mechanism was found to play a dominant role in most of these reactions but significant contributions of other, strongly energy dependent processes were also established. It is suggested that these processes might be due to isolated resonances superimposed on the backround of statistical fluctuations arising from interference of compound nucleus and direct transfer contributions. Nuclear Reactions: 7Li+7Li at 2≤ Elab ≤ 16 MeV; measured angular distributions and excitation functions of p, d, t, α, and 6He-channels; deduced direct mechanism contribution to t, α and 6He-channels by DWBA analysis; reaction mechanism inferred.

The m{sub T}-dependence is thought to arise from collective, explosive flow of the system, as probed by independent measurements, while the multiplicity dependence reflects the increased spatial extent of the final state with decreasing impact parameter. Qualitatively similar dependences have been reported from high energy hadron and lepton collisions, where the conceptual validity of an impact parameter or collective flow are less clear. We focus on results from elementary particle collisions, identify trends seen in the experimental data and compare them to those from heavy ion collisions. (author)",

The site of the rp-process is related to hydrogen accreting neutron stars in binary stellar systems. Explosive II-burning produces nuclei as heavy as A=100, powering events observable as X-ray bursts. The r-process abundances witness nuclear structure far from beta-stability as well as the conditions in the appropriate astrophysical environment.

The histogram of UH elemental abundances inthe Earth’s neighbourhood is obtained and the UH cosmic ray source abun-dances may be determined by means of an appropiate propagation model.This model describes the travel of UH ions from their sources to near theEarth, through the insterstellar medium (ISM). In our case, a dynamicalLeaky Box (DLB) model has been used for propagation studies. Due tothe nature of the transport equations corresponding to this model, it isnecessary to assume given source abundances, perform the transport calcu-lation to near the Earth, and to compare the result with the experimentalmeasurements. A ‘trial and error’ procedure is applied until the sourceabundances giving the best agreement between the calculated and mea-sured abundances near the Earth are found. Among all variables on whichthe transport equation depend, this work focuses on the eﬀect of the FirstIonization Potencial (FIP) on the propagation process. Although a betteragreement between propagated and measured abundances is found when acorrection for the eﬀect of FIP is used for lighter cosmic ray nuclei, it hasbeen found that the UHCRE experimental results are better reproducedwhen no FIP correction is assumed.PACS numbers: 98.70.

We consider two extreme regimes: One, dilute regime for which fluctuations are made on top of the matter-free vacuum; two, dense systems for which fluctuations are treated on top of the vacuum defined at a given density, with masses and coupling constants varying as function of matter density (Brown-Rho scaling). Based on an intricate -- as yet mostly conjectural -- connection between the in-medium structure of chiral Lagrangian field theory which is a beautiful effective theory of QCD and that of Landau Fermi liquid theory which is an equally beautiful and highly successful effective theory of many-body systems, it is suggested that a chiral Lagrangian with Brown-Rho scaling in the mean field is equivalent to Fermi-liquid fixed point theory. I make this connection using electroweak and strong responses of nuclear matter up to nuclear matter density and then extrapolating to higher densities encountered in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.",

This approach can be easily used in the analysis of other topics in the heavy ion field (e.g. flow, HBT etc.) allowing more precise measurements.",

They display mixing terms between the axial and vector currents. We study the modifications in the nuclear medium of the coupling constants of the axial current, namely the pion decay constant and the nucleonic axial one due to the requirements of chiral symmetry. We express the renormalizations in terms of the local scalar pion density. The latter also governs the quark condensate evolution and we discuss the link between this evolution and the renormalizations. In the case of the nucleon axial coupling constant this renormalization corresponds to a new type of pion exchange currents, with two exchanged pions. We give an estimate for the resulting quenching. Although moderate it helps explaining the quenching experimentally observed.",

The sum sigma_{tot}=sigma_T+sigma_L corrected up to order alpha_s^2 agrees with the well known result in the literature. It turns out that the order alpha_s^2 corrections to the transverse and asymmetric quantities are small in contrast to our findings for F_L^H(x,Q^2) and sigma_L where they turn out to be large.

A very good approximation to the limiting density is given by the threshold for the instability of a uniform n-p-e plasma with respect to density modulations; this threshold is calculated using the Extended Thomas-Fermi approximation for the Skyrme energy functionals. For recent SLy Skyrme forces, which are particularly suitable for the description of very neutron rich nucleon systems, the maximum density at which nuclear structures can exist is 0.08 nucleons/fm^3 (i.e., half of the normal nuclear density); at this density protons constitute only 4\\% of nucleons.",

The absence of alignment of the spins of the outgoing fragments with respect to the orbital angular momentum is found to be in contrast with the alignment as measured for the $^{24}$Mg+$^{24}$Mg resonances. A molecular-model picture is presented to suggest a butterfly motion of two oblate $^{28}$Si nuclei interacting in a equator-to-equator molecular configuration.",

    "abstract": "In this theory, an object is a mass density field in the fabric of space (FS) that satisfies mass–energy equivalence. In contrast with General Relativity (GR), the theory posits a preferred reference frame — namely the reference frame in which the FS is at rest. Also in contrast with GR, gravity between two objects results from the interaction of their mass density fields integrated over the entire FS. This interaction results in two types of gravity: Type I gravity which includes classical gravity, and under certain conditions, Type II gravity which includes a very strong wave gravity. Gravity exerted by large on small objects reduces to classical gravity. Gravity exerted by small on large objects is 3 times the classical value at small kinetic energies. When the small object becomes relativistic, then gravity becomes much larger. Every object has a gravity wavelength, and for the object being acted upon, classical type gravity occurs at distances less than its gravity wavelength while wave gravity occurs at distances greater than its gravity wavelength. The theory yields a set of 8 logarithmic singularities in the gravity force as well as a first-order singularity in the gravity potential. If the FS is quantized into discrete units, these singularities act on the FS to effect changes and interactions in mass density fields instantaneously. As a result, gravity acts instantaneously. We suggest that the 3 degree K cosmic background radiation results from kinetic energy released by the FS units. The theory then predicts that the rest mass of each FS unit is 2 proton masses and its characteristic length is approximately 2 mm. We extend the gravity theory to photons and predict the same results as GR for the classical experimental tests as well as for the change in period of binary pulsars. Finally, we show that the gravity theory makes possible a derivation of the Coulomb force.",

    "abstract": "Over the years many different approaches have been developed to calculate masses of atomic nuclei. These fall into two classes. The first comprises global approaches in the sense that a single formula or algorithm is used to reproduce as closely as possible all known nuclear masses. Once parameters have been fixed from known nuclei, it is then possible to attempt extrapolations to regions away from stability. There exist now three standard global procedures which are complementary since each starts from a different picture of the nucleus. The first is the finite-range droplet model (FRDM) [1] which can be viewed as a sophisticated liquid-drop formula. The second global mass formula is based on the mean-field ansatz of Hartree–Fock– Bogolyubov (HFB) in its different versions, the latest of which is reported in Ref. [2]. The third is a shell-model based mass formula developed by Duflo and Zuker (DZ) [3] which yields the most accurate results in terms of root-mean-square deviation from the measured nuclear masses. Local formulas are based on a different philosophy by focussing on a particular region of the nuclear mass table or, alternatively, by ‘predicting’ the mass of a nucleus through the systematic use of the masses of its neighbours. Local mass formulas obviously have less predictive power but usually attain greater accuracy in a limited region of the nuclear chart. Over the",

The hybrid model consists of two parts-stationary for high rigidities of GCR particles and non-stationary for relatively low rigidities. It is supposed that scattering of GCR particles in the irregularities (turbulence) of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) can be considered as a Brownian motion, and the Einstein–Smoluchowski relation h x 2 i = bKtsc is valid; h x 2 i is the mean-square diffusion distance of the GCR particles, K is diffusion coefficient andtsc scattering time; b = 2, 4 and 6 for one, two and three dimensional space, respectively. We show that a construction of the hybrid model is possible owing to the dependence of diffusion coefficient on the rigidity of GCR particles. We applied the hybrid model to describe the Forbush effect of the GCR intensity. For the assumed Forbush effect the hybrid model consists of the stationary part for rigidities > 21GV and of the non-stationary part for rigidities < 21GV. This model needs ∼ 30% less time for numerical solution than the non-stationary model.",

For the forward going massless leptons, the weak process $(\\nu_l,l)$ on a nucleon, according to Adler's partially conserved axial current theorem, is connected to the pion nucleon scattering. This mechanism is also applicable to the nucleus. Therefore, the modification of the $\\Delta$-peak in a nucleus can be seen in the $(\\nu_l,l)$ reaction since it is connected to the pion nucleus scattering. To investigate this issue quantitatively, the double differential cross sections of the forward going ejectile $l$ energy distribution in the $(\\nu_l,l)$ reaction are calculated in the $\\Delta$-excitation region for both proton and nucleus. The measured pion nucleon and pion nucleus scattering cross sections in the quoted energy region are used in these reactions as input. Since the $(\\nu_l,l)$ reaction is connected to the pion induced scattering, the features of the previous reaction is shown analogous to those of the later.",

Here, we study the main systematic effects in the previous determination, by considering a different representation of the amplitude and different optimization methods of the perturbative series. Moreover, we compare our result for the differential cross section at the minimum t with a different approach, based on collinear kernel improvement.",

We have employed a truncation for the neutrons due to huge matrix dimensions, by allowing one neutron excitation from $g_{9/2}$ orbital to $d_{5/2}$ and $g_{7/2}$ orbitals. Results are in good agreement with the available experimental data. Thus, theoretically, we have identified the structure of many high-spin states, which were tentatively assigned in the recent experimental work. The $^{91}$Zr $21/2^+$ isomer lies at low-energy region due to fully aligned spins of two $g_{9/2}$ protons and one $d_{5/2}$ neutron.",

    "abstract": "At the future high luminosity electron-positron collider FCC-ee proposed for CERN, the precise measurement of the charge asymmetry in $e^+ e^- \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ near the Z resonance is of special interest. In particular, such a measurement at $M_Z \\pm 3.5$ GeV may provide a very precise measurement of the electromagnetic coupling at the scale $\\sim M_Z$, a fundamental constant of the Standard Model. However, this charge asymmetry is plagued by a large trivial contribution from the interference of photon emission from initial state electrons and final state muons. We address the question whether this interference can be reliably calculated and subtracted with the help of a resummed QED calculation.",

    "abstract": "Early deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments at SLAC discovered partons, identified them as quarks and gluons, and restricted the set of the candidate theories for strong interactions to those exhibiting the asymptotic freedom property. The next generation DIS experiments at FNAL and CERN confirmed the predictions of QCD for the size of the scaling violation effects in the nucleon structure functions. The QCD fits to their data resulted in determining the momentum distributions of the point-like constituents of nucleons. Interpretation of data coming from all these experiments and, in the case of the SLAC experiments, even an elaboration of the running strategies, would not have been possible without a precise understanding of the electromagnetic radiative corrections. In this note I recollect the important milestones, achieved in the period preceding the HERA era, in the high precision calculations of the radiative corrections to DIS, and in the development of the methods of their experimental control. I present subsequently the measurement strategies and discuss the advanced radiative correction tools for the HERA experimental program, with an emphasis on their role in the first, model independent, measurement of the partonic densities in the small-$x_{Bj}$ region. These notes are dedicated to Staszek Jadach as a contribution to the celebration of his 60th-birthday.",

We analyze fluctuations of the eccentricity of the fireball created in the collision, in particular the {variable-axes} harmonic moments $\\epsilon^\\ast$, as well as the fluctuations of multiplicity of charged particles. We find moderate model dependence of the scaled standard deviation $\\sigma(\\epsilon^\\ast)/\\epsilon^\\ast$ on the choice of the particular Glauber model. For all considered models the values of $\\sigma(\\epsilon^\\ast)/\\epsilon^\\ast$ range from $\\sim$~0.5 for central collisions to $\\sim$~0.3-0.4 for peripheral collisions. The results are confronted to the recent measurement of the elliptic-flow fluctuations at RHIC. We also find that the dependence of multiplicity fluctuations on the centrality of the collision is too weak to explain the measurements at the SPS energies. The magnitude of the Glauber multiplicity fluctuations increases by about 20% from the RHIC to LHC energies.",

    "abstract": "A coarse-grained model of polypeptide chains was designed and studied. The chains consisted of united atoms located at the position of alpha carbons and the coordinates of these atoms were restricted to a [310] type lattice. Two kinds of amino acids residues were defined: hydrophilic and hydrophobic ones. The sequence of the residues was assumed to be characteristic for α-helical proteins (the helical septet). The force field used consisted of the long-range contact potential between residues and the local potential preferring conformational states, which were characteristic for α-helices. In order to study the thermodynamics of our model we employed the Multi-histogram method combined with the Parallel Tempering (the Replica Exchange) Monte Carlo sampling scheme. The optimal set of temperatures for the Parallel Tempering simulations was found by an iterative procedure. The influence of the temperature and the force field on the properties of coil-to-globule transition was studied. It was shown that this method can give more precise results when compared to Metropolis and Replica Exchange methods.",

When meson masses are substituted for the coupling constants, the action has only a logarithmic dependence on the cutoff, and the two methods yield similar results. The binding of qq excitations is discussed as well as the importance of calculating on-shell meson masses rather than using a gradient expansion of the action. The vector mesons are expected to reduce significantly the modification of a nucleon in nuclear matter. A consistent way to compare the model predictions with experiment is proposed",

The probability that given strategy will be chosen is determined by the polarization parameter P. This parameter differs between strategies that go along or against the existing market trend. Strong polarization of the space leads to the periodic dynamics and, finally, for negative P values to the domination of the single strategy in the system. When P is changed the variability of the process decreases, showing kind of the phase transition region. The dependence of the variability on the polarization parameter can be understood on the basis of the crowd–anticrowd theory.",

One of the goals of the HADES experiment is to study in-medium modifications of hadron properties like effective masses, decay widths, electromagnetic form factors etc. Such effects can be probed with vector mesons (ρ, ω, Φ) decaying into e +e- channel.

Basic understanding of the processes requires reliable knowledge of the GT strength distribution at large excitation energy range as well as in nuclei far from the stability line. Spin-flip and isospin-flip transitions with higher multipolarities are also important. There is a predictable correlation between the cross section of the spin dipole resonance and the neutron-skin thickness of nuclei, which quantity is important for constraining the symmetry energy of the nuclear interaction. These investigations can be extended to unstable nuclei using (p, n) reactions with radioactive nuclear beams in inverse kinematics. Relativistic heavy-ion beams and especially rare-isotope beams open up a new avenue for studying spin–isospin giant resonances. Kinematically complete experiments can be performed in inverse kinematics and a large part of the physical background can be reduced in this way. After a review of the present status of the spin-flip and isospin-flip giant resonances I am going to discuss the future perspectives for studying such interesting giant resonances.",

As a rule, deconvolution represents a class of ill-posed problems for which solutions are usually unstable or numerically ill-conditioned e.g. [1, 2]. In this contribution application of a FIR, (Finite Impulse Response), deconvolution filter with respect to the odd pair of impulses, for processing market data, is discussed. The optimum Chebyshev minimax norm solution for this case of deconvolution filtering has been first presented by Dyka in [3]. It was found that the intrinsic property of the said Chebyshev minimax deconvolution filter is its ability to extract the varying part of the input signal. More specifically, the first order difference (numerical derivative) at the output of the filter is very close, (i.e. strongly correlated), to the detrended value of input signal. This correlation in terms of normalized in L2 covariance coefficient is above 96 percent. In financial time series analysis this property of Chebyshev minimax deconvolution filter can, among others be used for techniques of determining Hurst exponent, which require extraction of the detrended value of input signal, i.e. [4].",

In efiect, photon-photon collisions provide a microscope for testing fundamental scaling laws of PQCD and for measuring distribution amplitudes. The determination of the shape and normalization of the distribution amplitude is particularly important in view of their importance in the analysis of exclusive semi-leptonic and two-body hadronic B-decays. The data from the Belle and CLEO collaborations on single and double meson production are in excellent agreement with the QCD predictions. In contrast, the normalization of the nominal leading-order predictions of PQCD for proton pair production appears to be signiflcantly below recent Belle measurements. I also review issues relating to renormalization scale setting.",

    "abstract": "In this talk we review the important role played by chiral SU(3) symmetry in hadron physics. Exciting new results on the formation of baryon resonances as implied by chiral coupled-channel dynamics are presented and discussed. The results are the consequence of progress made in formulating a consistent effective field theory for the meson-baryon scattering processes in the resonance region. Strangeness channels are found to play a decisive role in the formation of resonances. As a further application of chiral coupled-channel dynamics the properties of antikaons and hyperon resonances in cold nuclear matter are reviewed.",

The calculation of DPS mechanism is performed within factorized ansatz where each parton scattering is calculated within $k_T$-factorization approach. The hadronization is done with the help of fragmentation functions. For completeness we compare results for double- and single-parton scattering (SPS). The SPS components are also calculated in the $k_{T}$-factorization with the help of KaTie Monte Carlo generator. As in the case of double charm production also here the DPS dominates over the SPS, especially for small transverse momenta. We present several distributions and integrated cross sections with realistic cuts for simultaneous production of $D^0 B^+$ and $B^+ B^+$, suggesting future experimental studies at the LHC.",

    "abstract": "Despite simplicity, the synchronous cellular automaton [D.A. Young, Math. Biosci. 72, 51 (1984)] enables reconstructing basic features of patterns of skin. Our extended model allows studying the formatting of patterns and their temporal evolution also on the favourable and hostile environments. As a result, the impact of different types of an environment is accounted for the dynamics of patterns formation. The process is based on two diffusible morphogens, the short-range activator and the long-range inhibitor, produced by differentiated cells (DCs) represented as black pixels. For a neutral environment, the extended model reduces to the original one. However, even the reduced model is statistically sensitive to a type of the initial distribution of DCs. To compare the impact of the uniform random distribution of DCs (R-system) and the non-uniform distribution in the form of random Gaussian-clusters (G-system), we chose inhibitor as the control parameter. To our surprise, in the neutral environment, for the chosen inhibitor-value that ensures stable final patterns, the average size of final G-populations is lower than in the R-case. In turn, when we consider the favourable environment, the relatively bigger shift toward higher final concentrations of DCs appears in the G. Thus, in the suitably favourable environment, this order can be reversed. Furthermore, the different critical values of the control parameter for the R and the G suggest some dissimilarities in temporal evolution of both systems. In particular, within the proper ranges of the critical values, their oscillatory behaviours are different. The respective temporal evolutions are illustrated by a few examples.",

The paper contains three results. First, it is shown that radial timelike geodesics in static spherically symmetric spacetimes are globally maximal (have no cut points) in adequate domains. Second, in one of ultrastatic spherically symmetric spacetimes, Morris--Thorne wormhole, it is found which geodesics have cut points (and these must coincide with conjugate points) and which ones are globally maximal on their entire segments. This result, concerning all timelike geodesics of the wormhole, is the core of the work. The third outcome deals with the astonishing feature of all ultrastatic spacetimes: they provide a coordinate system which faithfully imitates the dynamical properties of the inertial reference frame. We precisely formulate these similarities.",

    "abstract": "We calculate BSM hadronic matrix elements for K 0 -K0 mixing in the Dual QCD approach (DQCD).The ETM, SWME and RBC-UKQCD lattice collaborations find the matrix elements of the BSM density-density operators O i with i = 2-5 to be rather different from their vacuum insertion values (VIA) with B 2 ≈ 0.5, B 3 ≈ B 5 ≈ 0.7 and B 4 ≈ 0.9 at µ = 3 GeV to be compared with B i = 1 in the VIA.We demonstrate that this pattern can be reconstructed within the DQCD through the nonperturbative meson evolution from very low scales, where factorization of matrix elements is valid, to scales O(1 GeV) with subsequent perturbative quark-gluon evolution to µ = 3 GeV.This turns out to be possible in spite of a very different pattern displayed at low scales with B 2 = 1.2, B 3 = 3.0, B 4 = 1.0 and B 5 ≈ 0.2 in the large-N limit, N being the number of colours.Our results imply that the inclusion of meson evolution in the phenomenology of any non-leptonic transition like K 0 -K0 mixing and K → ππ decays is mandatory.While meson evolution, as demonstrated in our paper, is hidden in lattice QCD results, to our knowledge, DQCD is the only analytic approach for non-leptonic transitions and decays which takes this important strong dynamics into account.",

The lack of translational invariance of the shell model is avoided, in the present work, by introducing a scalar-isoscalar fictitious particle that represents the origin of quark shell interaction; in this way the states of the system are eigenstates of the total momentum of the baryon. Only one-particle excitations are considered. A two-quark core takes the place of the diquark, while the third quark is excited to reproduce the baryonic resonances. For the $N(939)$ and $\\Delta(1232)$, that represent the ground states of the spectra, the three quarks are considered identical particles and the wave functions are completely antisymmetric. The model is used to calculate the spectra of the $N$ and $\\Delta$ resonances and the nucleon magnetic moments. The results are compared to the present experimental data. Due to the presence of the core and to the one-particle excitations, the structure of the obtained spectra is analogous to that given by the quark-diquark models.",

    "abstract": "We study the differential branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry, CP-violating asymmetry, CP-violating asymmetry in the forward-backward asymmetry and polarization asymmetries of the final lepton in the B → Xd l+l−decays in the context of a CP softly broken two Higgs doublet model. We analyze the dependencies of these observables on the model parameters by paying a special attention to the effects of neutral Higgs boson (NHB) exchanges and possible CP violating effects. We find that NHB effects are quite significant for the τ mode. The abovementioned observables seems to be promising as a testing ground for new physics beyond the SM, especially for the existence of the CP-violating phase in the theory.

The small values of the branching fractions of the decays involved in the measurement limits the precision, hence a larger dataset has to be accumulated to improve the precision. The Belle~II experiment at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider aims to collect 50~ab$^{-1}$ of data, a factor of 50 more than that of its predecessor Belle. The accelerator has been successfully commissioned in 2016 and the first physics collisions were recorded in April 2018. The best sensitivity to $\\phi_3$ can be achieved by harnessing all possible final states of $B \\to D^{(*)}K^{(*)}$ decays. With the full dataset, Belle~II is expected to achieve a precision of 1$^{\\circ}$ for the angle $\\phi_3$. The expected sensitivities and rediscoveries from 2018 data are presented here.",

It involves only one free parameter and three generation-weighting factors suggested by the successful mass formula found previously for charged leptons (the simplest neutrino mass formula would predict m_1:m_2:m_3 = 1:4:24 and thus, Delta m^2_{32}/Delta m^2_{21} \\simeq 37). A more involved variation of this equation follows from a special seesaw neutrino model with specifically conspiring Dirac and Majorana neutrino mass matrices.

Momentum-dependent deformations of the C, P and T invariance are derived from the \\k{appa}-deformed Poincaré algebra. Deformation of the CPT symmetry leads to a subtle violation of Lorentz symmetry. This entails some small but measurable phenomenological consequences, as corrections to characteristics of time evolution: particle lifetimes or frequency of flavour oscillations in two-particle states at high energy. We argue here that using current experimental precisions on the muon lifetime one can bound the deformation parameter \\k{appa} &gt; 10^14 GeV at LHC energy and move this limit even to 10^16 GeV at Future Circular Collider, planned at CERN. Weaker limits on deformation can be also obtained from interference of neutral mesons. In case of B0s from Υ decay it amounts to \\k{appa} &gt; 10^8 GeV at confidence level 99%.",

The third is determined from the experimental estimate of solar $\\Delta m^2_{21}$. Then, the atmospheric $\\Delta m^2_{32}$ is {\\it predicted} close to its experimental estimation. With the use of these three parameters all light active-neutrino masses $ m_1 < m_2 < m_3$ and heavy sterile-neutrino masses $ M_1 < M_2 < M_3$ are readily evaluated. The latter turn out much more {\\it hierarchical} than the former. The lightest heavy mass $ M_1$ comes out to be of the order $O(10^6 {\\rm GeV})$ so, it is too light to imply that the mechanism of baryogenesis through thermal leptogenesis might work.",

The unintegrated inelastic fluxes (related to proton dissociation) of photons are calculated based on modern parametrizations of deep inelastic structure functions in a broad range of $x$ and $Q^2$. We focus on processes with single and double proton dissociation. Highly excited remnant systems hadronise producing particles that can be vetoed in the calorimeter. We calculate associated gap survival factors. The gap survival factors depend on the process, mass of the remnant system and collision energy. The rapidity gap survival factor due to remnant fragmentation for double dissociative (DD) collisions is smaller than that for single dissociative (SD) process. We observe approximate factorisation: $S_{R,DD} \\approx S_{R,SD}^2$ when imposing rapidity veto. For the $W^+W^-$ final state, the remnant fragmentation leads to a taming of the cross section when the rapidity gap requirement is imposed. Also for $t \\bar t$ quark-antiquark pairs such a condition reverses the hierarchy observed for the case when such condition is taken into account. Our results imply that for the production of such heavy objects as $t$ quark and $\\bar t$ antiquark the virtuality of the photons attached to the dissociative system are very large ($Q^2 <$ 10$^{4}$ GeV$^2$). A similar effect is observed for the $W^+ W^-$ system.",

It is based on the minimization of a boost-invariant distance of the parton system, where all partons have momentum as well as spacetime position assigned. We test the influence of both types of variables, namely the rapidity span and transverse distance, on the actual need to reconnect the system to better describe soft physics measurements. We find reasonable agreement with the data and conclude that spacetime topology of the event can be useful for hadron collision modeling.",

    "abstract": "It is recalled that a ten year old calculation of all meson masses may explain the low value of the recently discovered Ds(2317) meson. This calculation was based on a fully relativistic quasiparticle theory, which has been applied to a large number of bound state problems and scattering processes. In this paper we want to show that also for one-dimensional systems the theory can be formulated in a compact way. After discussing the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for two nonrelativistic particles on a line, we show how to extend this momentum-space formulation to a Poincare invariant theory. We then apply this theory to a simple example and compare the reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as the total diffusion and the bound state spectrum, to the results obtained from the nonrelativistic case. Also the relativistic corrections to the spectrum of two harmonically bound particles are calculated. It is found that especially the higher excited states become less massive.",

Nuclei lying close to the N = Z line are of particular interest being a laboratory where collective excitations as well as fundamental properties of the nuclear force can be tested, like isospin symmetry and isospin breaking terms, proton neutron pairing, dripline effects and coherent neutron and proton contributions to the nuclear excitations. Some of this properties are more evident (degree of isospin mixing) or can be only observed (collective effects) in heavy N = Z nuclei. In this contribution we present the experimental results obtained by our collaboration along and in the vicinity of N = Z line.",

For the first time photon spectra in dependence of scattered protons have been measured to investigate the influence of the multiple-scattering process on the photon production. Based on predictions for the free pn bremsstrahlung amplitude a strong suppression of bremsstrahlung relative to a quasi-free production model is observed in the low-energy regime of the photon spectrum in p+nucleus reactions. We attribute this effect partly to modifications of the bremsstrahlung amplitude in the nuclear medium and partly to interference of proton amplitudes due to multiple scattering of nucleons.",

    "abstract": "The alternative formulated in the title has a chance to be settled, when the existence of the LSND effect is experimentally excluded or confirmed. The first option, much discussed in literature, works in the case of three active neutrinos $\\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu, \\nu_\\tau$, when among their massive states $\\nu_1, \\nu_2, \\nu_3$ there is no direct mixing between $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_3$, and the mass hierarchy $m^2_1 < {\\sim} m^2_2 \\ll m^2_3$ holds. This option is consistent with the observed deficits of solar $\\nu_e$'s and atmospheric $\\nu_\\mu $'s, if $\\Delta m^2_{21} \\leftrightarrow \\Delta m^2_{\\rm sol}$ and $ \\Delta m^2_{32} \\leftrightarrow \\Delta m^2_{\\rm atm}$. On the other hand, the second option is an extension of the idea of the former to the case of four neutrinos $\\nu_s, \\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu, \\nu_\\tau$ (including one sterile neutrino $\\nu_s$), when among their massive states $\\nu_0, \\nu_1, \\nu_2, \\nu_3$ there are no direct mixings between $\\nu_0$ and $nu_2$, $\\nu_0$ and $\\nu_3$, $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_3$, and the mass hierarchy $m^2_0 < {\\sim} m^2_1 \\ll m^2_2 < {\\sim} m^2_3$ is now valid. Such an option, belonging to a class of textures widely discussed in literature, may be consistent with the observed deficits of solar $\\nu_e$'s and atmospheric $\\nu_\\mu$'s as well as with the LSND appearance of $\\nu_e$'s in the beam of accelerator $\\nu_\\mu$'s, if now $\\Delta m^2_{10} \\leftrightarrow \\Delta m^2_{\\rm sol}$, $\\Delta m^2_{32} \\leftrightarrow \\Delta m^2_{\\rm atm}$ and $\\Delta m^2_{21} \\leftrightarrow \\Delta m^2_{\\rm LSND}$.",

A unique pattern of neutrino masses will be hopefully fixed in the future superbeam experiments and neutrino factories. However, the determination of the exact scale is more complicated and depends on the mass of the lightest neutrino ( m{sub {mu}} ){sub min} . If ( m{sub {mu}}){sub min} {>=} 0.35 eV, the future tritium {beta} decay experiments ( e.g. KATRIN) will have a chance to establish absolute neutrino masses. For smaller masses, 0.004 eV {<=} (m{sub {mu}}){sub min} {<=} 0.35 eV, if neutrinos are Majorana particles, an additional information can be derived from the neutrinoless double {beta} decay ({beta}{beta}){sub 0{mu}} of nuclei and again the absolute neutrino masses can be fixed. If, however, (m{mu}){sub min} {<=} 0.004 eV, none of the present and foreseeable future experiments is known to be able to fix the mass scale. (author)",

Then, the sterile neutrino, effective in the fourth row and fourth column of the proposed mixing matrix, is responsible for the possible LSND effect by inducing one extra neutrino mass state to exist actively. The LSND effect, if it exists, turns out to reveal its {\\it perturbative} nature related to small mixing of three active neutrinos with their sterile partner.",

    "abstract": "We report measurements of the magnetic field dependence of the low temperature specific heat of single crystal samples of the heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs{sub 4}Sb{sub 12}. The specific heat anomaly at T{sub c} resides on a large Schottky anomaly and exhibits a double peak structure similar to the behaviour observed in UPt{sub 3}. For B > 2 T, the Schottky anomaly becomes increasingly suppressed. At low T, a maximum develops for B > 4.5 T which sharpens considerably and shifts to higher T with increasing B corresponding to a feature in the electrical resistivity. This suggests a field tuned T = 0 phase transition to a high field phase just above the suppression of superconductivity. (author)",

    "abstract": "Author(s): Kielczewska, Danuta; Super Kamiokande Collaboration, .; K2K Collaboration, . | Abstract: The innermost secrets of the mysterious neutrino are being revealed in underground detectors. Recent data on atmospheric neutrinos, primarily from the Super-Kamiokande experiment, confirm the neutrino flavor mixing and non-zero masses. The high precision measurement of angular distribution allows to determine the value of Delta m(2) between 0.0013 eV(2) and 0.0054 eV(2) at 90% c.l. Studies of up-down asymmetries in different event samples indicate that nu(mu) l-gnu(tau) oscillations are more likely explanation of the data than nu(mu) l-g nu(s). The deficit of the observed solar neutrino Aux compared to the predictions of the standard solar model, often interpreted by neutrino oscillations, is further studied in the SuperKamiokande detector. The energy spectrum is measured above 5.5 MeV for the Sun's positions above and below the horizon. A day-night effect is observed at a statistical significance of 2 sigma. The K2K (KEK to Kamioka) is the first long-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiment. During runs in 1999 the first 3 events were observed in the SuperKamiokande detector caused by neutrinos produced at the KEK accelerator at a distance of 250 km. The predicted number of events without any oscillations is 12.3(-1.9)(+1.7).* Presented at the Cracow Epiphany Conference on Neutrinos in Physics and Astrophysics, Cracow, Poland, January 6-9, 2000.",

The K−/K+ ratios measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions are 1–2 orders of magnitude larger than in proton-proton collisions. The azimuthal angle distributions of K+ mesons indicate a repulsive kaon-nucleon potential. Microscopic transport calculations consistently explain both the yields and the emission patterns of kaons and antikaons when assuming that their properties are modified in dense nuclear matter. The K+ production excitation functions measured in light and heavy collision systems provide evidence for a soft nuclear equation-of-state.",

    "abstract": "We apply our recently formulated Gluon Exchange Model (GEM) to baryon production in proton-nucleus reactions involving N>1 proton-nucleon collisions. We propose a description scheme for the process of soft color octet (gluon) exchange, based on the assumption that probabilities to form an effective diquark are equal for all allowed pairs of quarks. The latter effective diquark can form either from two valence, one valence and one sea, or from two sea quarks. Consequently we calculate the probabilities for different color configurations involving diquarks of valence-valence, valence-sea and sea-sea type. These probabilities appear to depend on the number of exchanged gluons, which results in increasing baryon stopping as a function of the number of proton-nucleon collisions in the nucleus. As such, the nuclear stopping power appears to be governed by the emergence of new color configurations as a function of N rather than by the energy loss of the original valence diquark. The advantage of our approach lies in its high predictive power which makes it verifiable by the new, precise data on proton and neutron production from the CERN SPS. The latter verification, and a set of predictions for the N-dependence of the baryon stopping process, are included in the letter.",

Theories of this kind are adopted to model the onset of spontaneous symmetry breakings, when the fields are sitting on the top of the Mexican hat, and they start to ''roll down'' to the bottom. At present, there exists no rigorous proof that unstable quantum field theories are Lorentz-invariant (in the sense of Wigner's theorem). Here, we show that they shouldn't be. In fact, unstable theories always have a limited regime of applicability, and they are valid only for a very short time. As consequence, there is a preferred simultaneity hyperplane, along which the unstable theory is everywhere applicable, while a generic observer (whose four-velocity is not orthogonal to such hyperplane) must use the full non-linear theory. In summary: the current quantization schemes are ''ok'', independently from whether they lead to a Lorentz-invariant theory.",

    "abstract": "After the discovery of neutrino oscillations by SuperKamiokande three years ago the measurements of their masses and flavor mixing are under way using various neutrino sources and energies. High precision data on atmospheric neutrinos show that the dominant mixings occur between active species. They allow for statistically significant three-flavor analysis, which confirm the almost maximal mixing v(mu) v(tau). Results of searches for tau neutrinos are consistent with this scenario. The K2K experiment, which uses the KEK accelerator as the neutrino source and the SuperKamiokande for their detection, is sensitive to the oscillations observed in the atmospheric neutrinos. The results obtained after one year of the run time provide a check of the oscillation parameters with the well determined beam properties using a set of near detectors and beam monitors. The solution of the solar neutrino puzzle in terms of v, oscillations has been recently much enhanced by exciting new results from the SNO Collaboration. Their comparison with SuperKamiokande results again excludes a sterile neutrino mixing as dominant suggesting instead a large v(e) mixing with other active neutrinos. This interpretation has been favored by recent SuperKamiokande spectral and angular measurements. * Presented at the XXVII Mazurian Lake School of Physics, Krzyze, Poland, September 2-9, 2001.",

Another topic is the studies of underlying event energy originating from fragmentation of partons not associated with the hard scattering.",

Therefore we investigate the influence of the neutrino masses on the unification of gauge and Yukawa couplings in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We estimate the contribution of the neutrino Yukawa coupling to the gauge and Yukawa coupling unification. We find that in the case of the gauge coupling unification the effect of massive neutrinos is small and can be neglected. It appears to be much more significant, if we explore Y_{b} and Y_{tau} equality at the GUT scale. The neutrino contribution can change that relation even by ~12%.",

    "abstract": "The author's idea of {\\it algebraic compositeness} of fundamental particles, allowing to understand the existence in Nature of three fermion generations, is revisited. It is based on two postulates. i) For all fundamental particles of matter the Dirac square-root procedure $\\sqrt{p^2}\\to\\Gamma^{(N)}\\cdot p$ works, leading to a sequence $N=1,2,3,...$ of Dirac-type equations, where four Dirac-type matrices $\\Gamma^{(N)}_\\mu$ are embedded into a Clifford algebra {\\it via} a Jacobi definition introducing four centre-of-mass and $(N-1)\\times$four relative Dirac-type matrices. These define one centre-of-mass and $N-1$ relative Dirac bispinor indices. ii) The centre-of-mass Dirac bispinor index is coupled to the Standard Model gauge fields, while $N-1$ relative Dirac bispinor indices are all free undistinguishable physical objects obeying Fermi statistics with the Pauli principle which requires the full antisymmetry with respect to relative indices. This allows only for {\\it three} $N = 1,3,5$ in the case of $N$ odd, implying the existence of {\\it three and only three} generations of fundamental fermions.",

    "abstract": "We discuss several mechanisms of heavy quark production in (real) photon-nucleon and (real) photon-(real) photon collisions. In particular we focus on the application of the saturation model. We discuss how to generalize the formula from virtual photon-proton scattering and analyze threshold effects. We discuss a possibility to measure the cross section for $\\gamma \\gamma \\rightarrow 2 c 2 \\bar c$\n . In addition to the main dipole-dipole contribution included in a recent analysis, we propose how to calculate within the same formalism the hadronic single-resolved contribution to heavy quark production. At high energies this yields a sizable correction of about 30-40% for inclusive charm production and 15-20% for bottom production. We consider a subasymptotic component to the dipole-dipole approach. We get a good description of the recently measured $\\sigma(\\gamma \\gamma \\rightarrow c \\bar c X)$\n . Adding all possible contributions to $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow b \\bar b X$\n together removes a huge deficit observed in earlier works but does not solve the problem totally. Whenever possible, we compare the present approach to the standard collinear one. We propose how to distinguish different mechanisms by measuring heavy quark-antiquark correlations.",

The total photo-absorption cross section is related to elastic diffraction in terms of a sum rule. The excess of diffractive production over the elastic component is due to inelastic diffraction that contains the production of hadronic states of higher spins.

    "abstract": "The production ofK mesons in heavy ion collisions is presently one of the most challenging topics in nuclear physics. At beam energies below or close to the threshold (in NN collisions Ebeam = 1.583 GeV) we observe a strong enhancement of the kaon production as compared to the extrapolation of pp collisions. Detailed investigations have shown that most of the K’s are created in two step processes via an intermediate ∆ or π and are produced at a density well above the normal nuclear matter density [1,2]. This triggered the conjecture thatK’s may be of use as a messenger of the high density zone. A lot of efforts have been recently done to describe the behaviour of kaons in dense nuclear matter. Especially the directed in-plane (anti)flow of kaons has been proposed to be a good observbable for studying the in-medium interactions of kaons [3]. In this contribution we want to demonstrate that also other effects like e.g. the Delta lifetime influence this dynamic. We use for this pupose the Quantum Molecular Dynamics Model (QMD) [4]. Flow effects of kaons may be caused by different effects: First a flow may already be induced in the moment of the production of the kaon. We will call this flow primordial flow. Afterwards the kaon may change their momenta due to rescattering effects and potential interactions with the medium. Concerning the primordial flow we see in Fig. 1 that the flow of the sources",

The consequence is a challenge to physicists theoreticians toconstruct a contemporary, truly advanced statistical theory of biochemicalprocesses based on simple but realistic models of microscopic dynamics ofbiomolecules involved. A few points which seem to be important in thatfuture theory are presented in this paper. Perhaps the most important oneis the possibility of predominance of the short initial-condition dependentstage of protein involved reactions over the main stage described by thestandardkinetics. This initial stage, and not that described by the standardkinetics, is expected as responsible for the coupling of component reactionsin the complete catalytic cycles and more complex processes of biologicalfree energy transduction.PACS numbers: 87.15.

They are geared towards the precise determination of the quadrupole amplitudes in the $N\\rightarrow {\\mit\\Delta}$ transition and the isolation of the coherent, competing processes ({\\it e.g.} born terms, tails of higher resonances). The issue is of fundamental interest to hadronic physics as it pertains to interquark forces and the structure of hadrons. It is pursed intensively both theoretically and experimentally at many laboratories. The recent precise Bates electroproduction data do not support earlier claims for a strong Coulomb quadrupole amplitude. The available theoretical calculations fail to reproduce the isolated responses.",

    "abstract": "Based on an explicit verification of the coupling matrix elements between the 1p1h and 2p2h states we propose a new method of selecting the most important 2p2h states responsible for fragmentation effects. In this way the dimensionality of the problem is reduced, such that the computation becomes feasible and the spreading of the strength is realistic, as verified by some tests of convergence. Calculations in $^{208}$Pb show that due to sizable mixing effects only about 50% of the total isoscalar giant dipole resonance (ISGDR) $3\\hbar\\omega$ strength is located in the energy region between 20 and 25 MeV. This is the energy region which currently is available in experiment. Even above 30 MeV we find about 10% of the total strength. This indicates that the current experimantal evaluations of the ISGDR centroid energy may significantly underestimate its value.",

The nuclear collective motion is treated in terms of the observable variables: particle density, current density, pressure etc. The nuclear dynamics is influenced strongly by the Fermi-surface distortion (FSD) effect. The relaxation of collective motion and the width of giant multipole resonances in hot nuclei show a saturated behaviour with temperature caused by the memory effect in the collision integral. The development of the bulk and surface instabilities of the nuclear Fermi-liquid is sensitive to the dynamic effects such as the FSD and the relaxation processes. The instability growth rate is reduced due to the FSD effect and depends on the multipolarity of the particle density and surface fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Long-lived particles have significant enough lifetimes as to, when produced in collisions, leave a distinct signature in the detectors. Driven by increasingly higher energies, trigger and reconstruction algorithms at particle colliders are optimized for increasingly heavier particles, which in turn, tend to be short-lived. This makes searches for long-lived particles difficult, usually requiring dedicated methods and sometimes dedicated hardware top spot them. However, taking upon the challenge brings enormous potential, since new, long-lived particles feature in a variety of promising new physics models that could answer most of the open questions of the standard model, such as: neutrino masses, Dark Matter, or the matter-antimatter unbalance in the Universe. Currently, the international high energy physics community is planning future facilities post-LHC, and various particle colliders have been proposed. Crucial physics cases connected to long-lived particles will be accessible then, and in this presentation, three interesting examples are highlighted: Heavy Neutral Leptons, Hidden Sectors connected to Dark Matter, and exotic Higgs boson decays. This is followed by a small review of the preliminary studies assuming different future colliders, exploiting the complementary advantages that different colliding particles and accelerator types provide.",

After some nostalgic reminiscences, I turn to the Standard Model with a minimalistic attitude, the point of view that beyond the SM there is only the Planck scale. Known since long, the gravitational force can be obtained as the gauge theory of local Poincaré symmetry, called gauge gravity. This gauge theory of gravity embodies {\\it per se} a Palatini formulation. This causes the potential of non-minimally coupled Higgs inflation to have an intriguing improved large field behaviour. Some of its effects are experimentally accessible or refutable. The question of quantum corrections is discussed.",

For hard photon production a quark gluon plasma is assumed and calculations are performed in leading order in the strong coupling constant.

Reaction channel separation was achieved with a 4 pi charged particle multi-detector set-up together with a 1 pi neutron detector wall placed in the forward direction. On the basis of gamma gamma-coincidence and angular correlation relations a level schemes of several light Sn, In, Sb, Te and I nuclei were observed for the first time in the present experiment. The observed structure of nuclei are discussed in the framework of the nuclear shell-model. The p-n multiplets in the A similar to 100 region corresponding to the nucleon pairs with mixed configurations has been considered as a playground for the tests of the T = 0 and T = 1 parts of the effective interaction.",

Secondly, to complete UML by an oriented viewpoint method to get a complete software engineering process. U_VBOOM method represent an adaptation of VBOOM (View Based Object-Oriented Method) integrating the UML notation. The new U_VBOOM method keeps main VBOOM concepts and integrates to its development process strong points of UML such as use cases and a new stereotype that allows with the aggegation relationship to implemente the visibility relationship. This new approach encourages the multi-targets code generation and improve the process of development proposed by the VBOOM method.",

The analysis is based on 4.6 pb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity at the CERN SPS p$\\bar {\\rm p}$ collider. The properties of isolated muons produced in association with jets are found to be consistent with the predictions of the minimal Standard Model but no signal for the top quark is observed. An upper limit for the production cross section is determined. From this a lower limit of 61 GeV/$c^2$ (95\\% CL) is obtained for the mass of the top quark in a statistical analysis of all data. A similar analysis gives a lower limit of 41 GeV/$c^2$ for the mass of a fourth generation quark with charge-1/3 (b$'$ quark). The UA2 experiment has obtained in a similar analysis of electron data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 7.1 pb$^{-1}$ preliminarily a lower limit of 67 GeV/$c^2$ for the top mass and 53 GeV/$c^2$ for the b$'$ quark mass. The CDF experiment at the Fermilab p$\\bar {\\rm p}$ collider gives as the result of similar analysis of electron data of integrated luminosity of 4.7 pb$^{-1}$ a preliminary lower limit of 77 GeV/$c^2$ for the mass of the top quark.",

For particles, the main activity is in large and sophisticated cosmic ray detectors on and under ground (or under water) but includes also the AMS on Shuttle. In gravity, the use of interferometer detectors for gravitational waves is proceeding with new vigour; this too will be extended to space.

OPA's can be considered in their simplest ''one-loop'' (ladder) form as solutions of scattering equations but allow for a more natural transition to quantum field theory beyond ladder approximation. Therefore methods for their evaluation are of high interest. One of these methods is the SchVP which we study in the special case of elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering in terms of the Blankenbecler-Sugar equation. Since exact proofs of convergence for the SchVP cannot be found in general, the intention of our paper is to give by a detailed study of this complex example a justification for the application of the SchVP in even more complex situations. Applying the SchVP, it is shown that relatively simple and quite precise approximations for the T-matrix elements can be constructed valid for the whole energy range under consideration.",

New diagrams are found to contribute, which can enhance the cross section above that expected for leading twist. The heavy quarks are produced by a peripheral scattering on the target of hardness μ 2 . This leads, in particular, to a nuclear target dependence of A 2/3 at small μ. Qualitatively, the dynamics in the new limit agrees with earlier phenomenological models of «intrinsic» heavy quark production",

    "abstract": "Results from the experimental program with light ion beams and heavy target nuclei at the CERN SPS could demonstrate the occurrence of an unprecedented state of high density in hadronic matter. The thermal nature of the hadronic system has been investigated by analyzing spectra and production ratios of hadrons which reveal a large degree of rescattering of primary and secondary hadrons.Thermal photons from elementary quark-gluon interactions are considered a promising signal for the occurrence of a phase transition to the quark-gluon plasma. The predictions for thermal photons from elementary parton interactions are discussed and compared to the thermal emission rate of photons from a hot hadronic gas. Recent results from the photon spectrometers in heavy ion experiments are presented. Production cross sections of pi0 and eta mesons are determined and the projectile and target mass dependence is discussed. An upper limit for the single photon yield was determined for central O+Au reactions. Recent S+Au reactions exhibit an excess of photons over the yield expected from hadronic decays. The spectral shape of the expected single photon signal is discussed which might reveal the temperature of hot matter and indicate a phase transition.",

Recent missing energy experiments at the $Z^0$ peak, demonstrate the feasibility of the indirect neutrino detection method in large multi purpose detectors. The importance of missing energy detection capabilities for future experiments is emphasized with several search studies for new exotic phenomena at LEP2, the LHC and at a linear $e^+e^-$ collider.",
