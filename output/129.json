Of the 80 species described (together with subspecies) which are assigned to 11 genera, the following five species or subspecies are new: Ancyrodella sinecarina sp. n., Palmatolepis circularis sp. n., Palmatolepis minuta wolskae subsp. n., Polygnathus sinuosus sp. n. and Pelekysgnathus ? sp.n. The conodont zonation, adopted for the correlation of profiles, enabled the solution of several problems of regional stratigraphy. The history of the Frasnian and Famennian sedimentation has been restored on the basis of their facial (including microfacial) analysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Though the stratigraphical and palaeogeographical framework of the Quaternary in Poland is still to be completed, several crucial points have been confirmed recently. The preglacial series, accepted for years as belonging to the Lower Pleistocene, is undoubtedly of Early Pliocene age, with a huge hiatus above almost until the uppermost Lower Pleistocene. The earliest glaciation in Poland (Nidanian) occurred at about 900 ka BP when the ice sheet reached the mid-southern part of the country. The following Podlasian Interglacial embraced the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary in the middle, in a similar fashion to the corresponding Cromerian Complex in Western Europe. The late Early and early Middle Pleistocene interglacials in Poland comprised 2–3 optima each, whereas every one of the younger interglacials was characterised by a single optimum only. The Late Vistulian ice sheet was most extensive in the western part of Poland (Leszno Phase) whereas the younger Poznań Phase was more extensive in the central and eastern part of the country. This was due to the varied distance from the glaciation center in Scandinavia, making the ice sheet margin reach a terminal position in different times. Palaeoclimatological research in the Tatra Mountains has provided new evidence for the atmospheric circulation over Europe. During cold phases of the Pleistocene in Poland a continental climate extended further westwards, quite the opposite that occurring during warmer intervals.",

Apart from the Middle/Upper Santonian and Santonian/Campanian boundary all other stage and substage boundaries are well recognizable with the inoceramid fauna. Most of the inoceramids, comprising about 40 species, assigned to six genera, are monographed. Two species from the Turonian-Coniacian boundary interval are described as new: Mytiloides turonicus sp. n. and Inoceramus vistulensis sp. n. The Mytiloides labiatus group is thoroughly treated and particular members are discussed, to show that M. suhmytiloides (SEITZ) and M. subhercynicus (SEITZ), the widely cited species of this group, are invalid and thus should be rejected. The names Mytiloides opalensis sensu SEITZ (non BSE) and M. duplicostatus sensu KAUFFMAN (non ANDERSON) are younger synonyms of M. kossmati (HElNZ). A revision of the whole genus Cremnoceramus is also presented. The stratigraphic scheme applied to the Turonian through Santonian deposits of the Central Polish Uplands allows to solve some regional problems, and to construct a unified chronostratigraphic facies scheme for the southern part of the epicontinental areas in Poland. The facies characteristics combined with the paleotectonic setting of the studied area is the base of the distinguishing of the four geotectonic-facies regions: the Circum-Sudetic Trap Basins, the Cracow Swell, the Danish Polish Trough, and the Russian Chalk Sea. The evolution of the studied areas during Turonian through Santonian time is assembled to indicate the primary role of tectonic movements of the Subhercynian phase of the Alpine orogeny.",

    "abstract": "The geodynamic evolution of the Pieniny Klippen Belt (PKB) and the Tatra Mts. assumes that: The Oravic-Vahic Basin developed due to Jurassic rifting processes with thinned continental crust. The oblique rift without rift-related volcanism had probably a WSW-ENE course. Late Cretaceous thrust-folding of the Choc, Krizna and High-Tatric nappes took place underwater and at considerable overburden pressure (~6-7 km). The geometry of the structures was strongly disturbed by pressure solution processes leading to considerable mass loss. Nappe-folding in the PKB was connected with the slow and flat subduction of thinned continental crust of the Vahicum-Oravicum under the northern margin of the Central Carpathians Block. In the terminal phase, the northernmost units of the PKB were transported through gravitational sliding, forming numerous olistolites. In the Tatra Mts. and the PKB, the nappe thrust-folding was influenced by a strike-slip shear zone between the edge of the Central Carpathians and the PKB and caused e.g. the counter-clockwise rotation of the Tatra block and relative changing directions of thrusting. The consequence of Miocene oblique subduction and subsequent collision of the North-European continental crust with the Central Carpathian Block was the activation of NNW-SSE deep fault zones. With one of these – the Dunajec Fault – were connected en echelon shears trading on the andesite dykes swarm. Miocene collision caused the disintegration of the Central Carpathian Block into individual massifs and their rotational uplift. The value of rotation around the horizontal axis for the Tatra Massif is estimated at ~40 o .",

Biostratigraphical calibration and correlation of the sections, mostly by means of conodonts and brachiopods, show the evolution from a shallow carbonate-dominated shelf in the Silurian which, by a drop of sea-level, was transformed into a siliciclastic shelf during the Early Devonian. Fully marine conditions were subsequently re-established in the Middle Devonian to early Frasnian and persisted into the early Late Carboniferous. A widespread uplift in the latest Carboniferous turned the entire area into a continental regime before the onset of a new marine cycle during the late Early Permian. With the exception of the northern zone (Talesh Range, Aghdarband), the Palaeozoic of Iran is characterized by continental to shallow marine deposits showing that enormous portions of the northern margin of this sector of Gondwana have been subducted during the convergence of the Turan and Iran Plates and the elimination of the Palaeotethys during the Late Triassic.",

    "abstract": "Similarities in biotic successions support a unified, composite chronostratigraphy for the Lower-Middle Cambrian of the Iberian and Moroccan margins of West Gondwana. The Cordubian Series (emended from an Iberian stage-level unit) comprises the sub-trilobitic Lower Cambrian of West Gondwana. This series represents ca. half of the Cambrian (ca. 25 m.y.), has a base defined at the lowest occurrence of diagnostic Cambrian ichnogenera in central Spain, and is comparable to the Placentian Series of Avalon. The overlying trilobite-bearing Lower Cambrian (ca. 9 m.y. duration), or Atlasian Series (new), of West Gondwana consists of two stages originally defined in highly fossiliferous (trilobites and archaeocyaths) Moroccan sections where they have great potential for precise U-Pb geochronology. The penultimate Lower Cambrian stage, the Issendalenian, with the near-joint lowest occurrence of trilobites and archaeocyaths, is approximately comparable with the sparsely fossiliferous, Iberian (designation abandoned). The Ovetian as currently revised is invalid because it is an objective homonym of SDZUY’s original “Ovetian.” The Ovetian is not a practically applicable unit as its basal stratotype horizon lacks any identified fossils, and its trilobites are so rare that it cannot serve as a standard for interregional correlation. By contrast, the Banian Stage as defined in Morocco is suitable as the terminal Lower Cambrian stage of West Gondwana. It is based on very fossiliferous successions that allow recognition of three successive trilobite zones and is similar in concept to the Iberian “Marianian Stage” (designation abandoned). The “Marianian” lacks a designated lower boundary stratotype locality, lacks a biostratigraphically defined base at a stratotype, and is so sparsely fossiliferous that no biostratigraphic zonation exists. Long-term problems involving regional definition of the West Gondwanan Lower–Middle Cambrian boundary are resolved. The lowest occurrence of paradoxidid trilobites, the classic index for the base of the Middle Cambrian, is diachronous in West Gondwana and other regions, with the group showing a delayed appearance in Iberia, Sweden, and Bohemia, by comparison with Morocco. Taxonomic revision of Iberian trilobites and new documentation of their ranges in Morocco show that the Iberian terminal “Lower Cambrian” “Bilbilian Stage” (designation abandoned) correlates with the Moroccan upper Banian and lower and middle “Tissafinian” Stages and with the Siberian upper Toyonian (traditionally assigned to the Lower Cambrian in Siberia) and lower Amgan (assigned to the Middle Cambrian in Siberia) Stages. The “Bilbilian” thus includes Middle Cambrian strata in a traditional international concept. Faunas from the base of the Iberian “lowest” Middle Cambrian “Leonian Stage” (designation abandoned) correlate largely into the second trilobite zone of the “Tissafinian” and are now understood to appear above an intra-Middle Cambrian faunal break. This faunal break is still poorly understood and may be an artifact of collection failure immediately above the sparsely fossiliferous, problematical “Valdemiedes event” interval. The base of this “Middle Cambrian”, now termed Celtiberian Series (new designation), in West Gondwana is best defined by the base of the lower Middle Cambrian Agdzian Stage (new designation). The Agdzian includes the “Tissafinian” and overlying lower “Toushamian Stage” designations abandoned) of Morocco, and has its top defined by the base of the middle Middle Cambrian Caesaraugustian Stage, as defined in Spain at the lowest occurrence of Badulesia tenera. The Languedocian, originally defined at the lowest occurrence of Solenopleuropsis (Manublesia) thorali in the southern Montagne Noire of France comprises the third, and terminal stage of the Celtiberian Series. We suggest that the designations “Lower Cambrian” and “Middle Cambrian” be regarded as descriptive and nonchronostratigraphic terms in discussions of the Cambrian. New taxa or taxonomic combinations include Myopsolenites altus (LINAN & GOZALO, 1986), M. boutiouiti sp. nov., M. kielciensis  (BEDNARCZYK, 1970), and Hamatolenus ( Hamatolenus ) vincenti sp. nov.",

The aporrhaid gastropod genus Kaunhowenia gen. n. is established as new. Amongst the bivalves, only one species is introduced as new: Pinna (Plesiopinna) kasimirensis sp. n. A special attention is given for some species, such as Volutispina kasimiri (KRACH, 1931), Pholadomya (Pholadomya) kasimiri PUSCH, 1837 and Pholadomya (Bucardiomya) esmarki (NILSSON, 1827), the taxonomy of which has often been confused. Discussed is also the occurrence of the two tegulated inoceramids, Spyridoceramus tegulatus (v. HAGENOV, 1842) and Tenuipteria argentea (CONRAD, 1858). The latter species is first recorded in Poland, and it is challenged as an alternative index of the Belemnella kazimiroviensis Zone in the uppermost Maastrichtian. Biogeographic comparisons with the Maastrichtian faunas of other regions show that the studies faunas reflect influences of the North Temperate Realm. Palaeoecologic reconstruction of the studied faunal assemblages (since the Campanian/Maastrichtian boundary through the topmost Maastrichtian) indicates an increase in the density and diversity of the faunal assemblages along with the appearance of new trophie groups, and with the decrease both in depths and in the distance to the shore. The latter factors were obviously controlled by the major regressive phase of the mid- to Upper Cretaceous sea which occupied the Central European Basin.",

    "abstract": "Extensive areas of the abyss represent a dynamic environment experiencing seasonally strongly fluctuating organic-matter deposition that in turn affects the oxygen content of the pore water. At high organic-matter deposition, oxygenation of the pore water decreases and forces organisms respiring this water to move upward. Thus, times of benthic food richness on the seafloor affect the behaviour of endobenthic organisms; aside from deepdeposit feeding, temporary surface feeding (including unselective bulldozing) represents an additional nutritional strategy. This has been shown for the producers of Nereites and Scolicia as well as Thalassinoides and  Zoophycos , the latter two have an open tube. Each of these activities leads to intense sediment mixing and prevents or disturbs the formation of near-surface burrows including graphoglyptids. The distribution of organic matter in the sediments is reflected by the orientation and geometry of Phycosiphon . Quantity and quality of food appear to be related to abundance and size of Scolicia . Food selectivity, the ability of selective feeding and organism mobility all appear to be important factors in benthic ecology, however, they are as yet little known. To use the full potential of uniformitarian studies relying on cores taken in soft sediments, they should be based on X-ray radiographs, contain information about the timing of burrow production and focus on ichnotaxonomically determinable burrows.",

A calpionellid zonal scheme is proposed for the Tithonian through Valanginian pelagic carbonates of the Western Balkan Unit, based on the vertical ranges of 57 chitinoidellid and calpionellid species recognized. This zonal scheme consists of calpionellid zones that are widely accepted in the Mediterranean Realm, such as the zones of Chitinoidella, Praetintinnopsella, Crassicollaria, Calpionella, Calpionellopsis, Calpionellites and Tintinnopsella. Subzonal divisions are comparable to those in the Carpathians. Direct correlations between ammonite and calpionellid ranges suggest that the base of the Upper Tithonian corresponds to the FO of Chitinoidella boneti; that of the Upper Berriasian to the FO of the genus Calpionellopsis; and the base and top of the Lower Valanginian to the FO and LO of the genus Calpionellites respectively.

Acta Geologica Polonica, 53 (4), 323-339. Warszawa. The transition from the Early Miocene to the Middle Miocene is a crucial point for the development of mollusc faunas (gastropods and bivalves) in the Central Paratethys. Here, we first discuss the confusing and partly contradictory stratigraphic concepts and correlations of Paratethyan and Mediterranean reference faunas. Then we show that the interplay of sea level fluctuations, climatic amelioration, immigrations, and blooms in autochthonous elements causes a complex pattern of faunal development. We focus on the so-called “Grund Fauna”, which flourished during the Early Badenian and is here treated as transitional between typical late Early Miocene and typical Middle Miocene faunas. This faunal type, originally defined in Austria, is represented within the entire Central Paratethys and is strictly stratigraphically determined. It developed during the early Middle Miocene and is interpreted by us to mirror a phase of optimal climatic conditions. This is most plausible in respect to the marginal position of the Central Paratethys. As a northern appendix of the early Mediterranean Sea, it spans a north-south gradient of about 4° latitude and is suggested to represent a type of “palaeo-thermometer”, which reflects slight expansions or restrictions of climatic belts. The Langhian climatic optimum, for example, seems to be reflected within Paratethyan mollusc faunas by the northward migration of Mediterranean thermophilic species during the Early Badenian.",

    "abstract": "During the Devonian, the eastern Anti-Atlas formed a part of the northwestern continental margin of Gondwana which was a mid-latitudinal (30-40 0  S), temperate-water carbonate province. In the Mader region, ten carbonate mounds (one reef-mound and nine mud-mounds), distributed over five discrete localities, are intercalated within a 200-400 m thick Middle Devonian succession. The arid climate of the northwestern margin of the Sahara has exhumed these mounds which display perfectly their original morphologies and relations to off-mound lithologies. The carbonate mounds of the Mader area consist of massive, stromatactis-bearing boundstones (wackestones and floatstones in a purely descriptive manner) with the bulk of the mound volume consisting of fine-grained carbonate (microspar). High accumulation rates (0.2-0.8 m/1000 a), purity of mound carbonates (>95% CaCo 3 ) and homogeneous Mg-calcite mineralogy strongly argue for in situ carbonate production by microbial (cyanobacterial/bacterial) communities. In addition, other indications (calcified cyanobacteria in the immediate neighbourhood of stromatactis fabrics, dark crusts surrounding stromatactis fabrics and alignment of stromatactis fabrics parallel to the accretionary mound surfaces) suggest a close relationship between stromatactis formation and carbonate production. Microbial communities probably flourished on the mound surfaces, precipitating fine-grained carbonates and consolidating the steepmound flanks by their mucilages. Once embedded, these communities decayed and were successively replaced by calcite cements, finally resulting in stromatactis fabrics. The facies model proposed for the three most conspicuous mound occurrences (Aferdou el Mrakib, Guelb el Maharch, Jebel el Otfal) is a 40 km wide, tectonically-controlled homoclinal ramp, which developed between an area of uplift (Mader Platform) and another area of strong subsidence (depocentre of the Mader Basin). The bathymetric gradient of this ramp is reflected by a Middle Devonian facies pattern varying from shallow to deeper water environments and by different faunal associations of the carbonate mounds. The Aferdou el Mrakib reef-mound was established at moderate water depth (midramp setting), because it contains abundant frame-builders (stromatoporoids, colonial rugose corals) but lacks indications for euphotic conditions, like calcareous algae and micritic envelopes. The Guelb el Maharch and Jebel el Otfal mud-mounds contain a much more impoverished fauna, dominated by crinoids and tabulate corals (auloporids), indicating a deeper bathymetric position (outer ramp setting) on the ramp. Further, but rather unspectacular mud-mounds (SE' Zireg, Jebel Ou Driss) are situatedapart from the ramp at localities in the southern and the southwestern Mader area respectively. Mound growth was possibly initiated by hydrothermalseepage at the seafloor though no evidences for hydrothermal activity, like mineralizations or depleted δ 13 C values, have been found to date. Slightly elevated temperatures may have stimulated the benthic fauna, especially crinoids, forming flat in situ lenses, which in turn served as substrates for microbial colonization. Termination of mound growth in the Mader Basin is connected with the subsidence-caused drowning of the carbonate ramp. Poorly-fossiliferous, laminated mudstones overlie the mounds and suggest a southward-directed extension of basinal facies onlapping the ramp and its mounds and resulting in poorly oxygenated seafloor conditions. Diagenesis of the Mader Basin carbonate mounds includes early marine, shallow marine burial and deeper burial cementation, recrystallization of the fine-grained mound carbonates, stylolitization and dolomitization. Radiaxial calcites (RC) precipitated in the marine environment and are believed to have preserved a nearly primary marine stable isotopic composition of the Mader Basin seawater with mean values of δ 18 O=-2.6(+-0.2)promili PDB and δ 13 C=+2.7(+-0.5) ‰PDB. The exceptional high δ 18 O values,compared with other Middle Devonian data derived from North American studies, are interpreted as resulting from the mid-latitudinal, temperate-water settings of the Mader Basin carbonate mounds. The diagenetic history is characterized by progressive burial conditions. Meteoric influences can be ruled out because the progressively deepening bathymetric evolution of the Mader Basin excludes subaerial exposure. All diagenetic events, especially cement zones, are probably diachronous and therefore cannot be correlated within in the Mader Basin and not even within individual mounds. Fault-related dolomitization, postdating Variscan compression was the last diagenetic event which affected the carbonate mounds of the Mader area.",

The biostratigraphy is based on inoceramid fauna, basically newly collected. Eight inoceramid zones were distinguished, corresponding, in ammonite/belemnite terms, to an interval from the upper Bostrychoceras polyplocum Zone up to the traditional Belemnella occidentalis Zone. From bottom upwards these are zones of: Cataceramus subcompressus ,  Inoceramus  tenuilineatus , Sphaeroceramus pertenuiformis ,  Inoceramus  altus ,  Inoceramus  inkermanaensis , Trochoceramus costaecus ,  Inoceramus  redbirdensis , and of Endocostea typica . The inoceramid assemblages allow a precise correlation with critical sections in Europe, as well as trans-Atlantic correlation to the US Western Interior. The traditional base of the Maastrichtian falls at the base of the Trochoceramus costaecus Zone, whereas the 'Tercis basal Maastrichtian boundary' may fall as high as lower Belemnella sumensis Zone. Based on the correlation to the US Western Interior, a subdivision of the Upper Campanian into Middle and Upper substages is suggested. The boundary between the Middle and the Upper Campanian substages may be defined by the base of the  Inoceramus  tenuilineatus Zone, which in ammonite terms, corresponds to the base of the Didymoceras donezianum Zone (=top of the Bostrychoceras polyplocum Zone). Thirty one inoceramid species level taxa are described, of which  Inoceramus  smirnovi nom.nov. is a replacement name; 10 species are left in open nomenclature. Inoceramids of the Middle Vistula succession represent a uniform fauna characteristic of the whole Euramerican biogeographical region.",

    "abstract": "A group of integrated hydrological and sedimentary qualitative models is introduced for evaporite and selenite (coarsecrystalline gypsum) deposition in ancient drawdown saline basins (salinas). The general model of a salina basin as a framework for intrabasinal models of selenite and gypsum microbialite (a variety of fine-grained gypsum) sedimentation is given. Selected aspects of evaporite, selenite and gypsum microbialite deposition are reviewed and discussed. A salina basin is a depression supplied with marine water by seepage and occasional surface inflows. The intrabasinal environments comprise: (i) ephemeral saline pans, evaporite shoals, and the peculiar majanna environment (recognised in the Recent MacLeod salina, Australia); and (ii) perennial saline pans. The sedimentary dynamic of these environments is controlled largely by seasonal brine level and groundwater table level fluctuations. The perennial saline pans are characterised by three basic hydrological states: (i) meromixis – with a permanent pycnocline, (ii) monomixis to polymixis – with a seasonal or periodic pycnocline, and (iii) polymixis - without a constant pycnocline. Monomictic saline pans showing stratification in the wet period (during seasonal highstand) and mixis in the dry period of the year (during seasonal lowstand) are the most significant for subaqueous evaporite and selenite deposition. Evaporite deposition takes place mainly during a mixis period coinciding with a dry season lowstand and increased evaporation. Within intrabasinal environments selenite crusts can be occasionally deposited from permanent brine sheets on evaporite shoals or majanna flats, but are mainly the product of bottom crystallisation in the hypolimnion of the monomictic (and/or polymictic) saline pans. Shallow-brine and deep-brine selenite pans are distinguished from each other on the basis of the relationship of the seasonally fluctuating pycnocline to the bottom of the pan. Selenite deposition in the mixolimnion of a deep meromictic basin is also possible. The qualitative models can be used for sedimentological analyses of ancient selenite-evaporite basins.",

The paleogeographic setting and the structure of the basin, being a part of the drowned valley, are discussed with a special attention to the littoral zone of the basin. This zone was featured with rubbles and abrasion surfaces, all of which are densely bored by diverse rock-borers (sponges, polychaetes,. pelecypods, acrothoracican cirripedes). Special littoral facies are exemplified by the oyster shellbed, and sandy clay with brackish gastropods, the latter of which is interpreted as confined to coastal swamps of the mangrove type. The main facies of the basin, the Korytnica Clays, is discussed in regard with its sedimentary conditions, taphonomy of the fossils and their burial conditions. The most important organic communities and their vertical succession are presented, and a conclusion on the seagrass vegetation in the basin is drawn. Discussed are also some biological relationships between the particular species, and results of the activity of hermit crabs upon alive mollusks. The decline of .sedimentation in the basin manifested with the extreme shallow marine facies that correspond to a complete filling of the basin with sediments up to sea level. The climatic conditions that prevailed in the Korytnica basin are characterized as very close to those typical of present-day tropical and/or subtropical zones. Finally, the Indo-Pacific elements within the Korytnica assemblages are indicated, and a discussion on the connections of the Miocene sea of Europe with the lndo-Pacific province is presented.",

The new lithostratigraphic units are correlated with those recognized previously by other authors. The formations are considered within a framework of 4 stratigraphic sequence. One of these sequences occurs in the Sierra de los Organos, the others are in the Sierra del Rosario. The sequences correspond to distinct facies belts of the western part of Greater Antilles geosyncline. In the sequence of Sierra de los Organos, deltaic sedimentation was followed by Late Jurassic shallow-water carbonate sedimentation. The latter sedimentation type influenced also the southern sequence of Sierra del Rosario. The carbonate bank submerged in the Tithonian. Then, carbonate pelagic facies spread throughout; the Cordillera de Guaniguanico. During the Early Cretaceous, the facies development in particular stratigraphic sequences became again variable. Deep-water sedimentation started in the Sierra del Rosario; in the northern sequence, it persisted up to the end of the Cretaceous. Pelagic, flysch, and rudaceous sediments were deposited in various facies belts during the Cretaceous. In the sequence of Siena de los Organos, the Late Paleocene to Erly Eocene sedimentation took place under the conditions of an increasing tectonic activity.

Its are rejected on the basis of the sedimentary features and faunal evidence. Arguments are presented in favor of deposition from decelerating currents. This type of deposition is indicated by the sorting of mineral grains and fossils, an approximately positive correlation between the thickness and coarseness of beds and ·dimensions of erosional structures (flutes) on their soles, and a succession of structures in flysch sequences. Proximal, intermediate and distal deposition regions are characterized in each member of the succession. From the sedimentary features the conclusion is drawn that the Carpathian flysch was deposited at depths greater than the neritic zone. It is shown that the makrofauna contains 50 species of Foraminifera which in present-day seas live in waters with normal salinity. Most of these species display a marked preference for bathyal and abyssal depths. Several Foraminifera, closely related to modern deep-water species, also occur in the Carpathian flysch. The presence of calcareous Foraminifera in nearly an stratigraphic members excludes a deposition below the calcium carbonate compensation depth. Consequently, bathyal (mostly upper bathyal) depths are assigned to the Carpathian flysch basin, and changes in depths during the long deposition (uppermost Jurassic through Lower Miocene) are estimated tentatively. It has been found that the number of branched and patterned traced fossils is larger in the beds, to which greater depths are assigned on the basis of sedimentological and microfaunal evidence.",

Documented are all the main biostratigraphically significant macrofossil and microfossil groups: ammonites, bivalves (inoceramids and the genus Didymotis ), planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannoplankton. Also provided are correlations based on stable carbon isotope curves. The base of the Coniacian is defined by the first occurrence (FO) of the inoceramid bivalve Cremnoceramus deformis erectus (Meek, 1876), a cladogenetic successor of the C. waltersdorfensis (Andert, 1911) lineage. This event is well above the first appearance of the classic ammonite marker of this boundary, Forresteria petrocoriensis  (Coquand, 1859), which is first noted high in the Upper Turonian Mytiloides scupini inoceramid bivalve zone at Slupia Nadbrzezna. The boundary at Salzgitter-Salder cannot be precisely defined by means of ammonites; however, there is an apparent local change in one scaphitid lineage a short distance below the boundary. In calcareous nannofossil terms, the boundary falls within the interval between the first occurrence of Broinsonia parca parca and the last occurrence (LO) of Helicolithus turonicus . At present, no planktonic species found in both sections can be used as a close proxy for the base of the Coniacian, as defined by the inoceramid bivalve marker. In terms of carbon stable isotopes, the Turonian–Coniacian Boundary lies in the inflection point from falling to rising δ 13 C values. A comparison of the Salzgitter-Salder and Slupia Nadbrzezna carbon isotope curves indicates a hiatus at the former locality. The base of the Coniacian in the Salzgitter-Salder section is marked by a flood occurrence of Cremnoceramus deformis erectus , constituting the deformis erectus I event. The boundary interval at Slupia Nadbrzezna is expanded: here the first occurrence of C. deformis erectus is separated from both the terminal Turonian C. waltersdorfensis waltersdorfensis event and the C. deformis erectus I event, also indicating the existence of a hiatus at the boundary in the Salzgitter-Salder section. In view of this hiatus at the critical level, it is proposed that the two sections should constitute a candidate composite Coniacian GSSP.",

The rich graptolite fauna they contain permits the whole Silurian system of Poland to be subdivided into zones. These have been defined according to the binding rules. A total! number of 42 zones has been distinguished in the Polish Silurian. Out of these 12 belong to the Velentian, the youngest of them being separated into two subzones; 8 zones characterize the Wenlockian; 13 the Ludlovian, 4 of them forming one index horizon; 9 the Post-ludlovian, with one horizon which can be more accurately defined after its graptolite fauna has been worked out in greater detail. The standard subdivision of the Silurian system, including tone Ludlovian, used in the present paper, follows the international rules. Deposits younger than the Ludlovian but older than the Gedinnian, without an officially recognized stratotytpe or name, are here referred to under the name of Postludlovian. The correlation of the Polish Silurian deposits with other, but only neighboring areas, shows that the Polish profiles contain a complete stratigraphic sequence, particularly in the graptolite fades. Here and there it even passes into the Lower Devonian (Gedinnian) and this makes Poland a region of paramount importance in the study of the evolution of graptolite faunas.",

The Kazakh island arcs and microcontinents within several separate clusters were located in the tropics on both sides of the Equator. Key units, from which the Late Ordovician faunas are now well known, include the Boshchekul, Chingiz-Tarbagatai, and Chu-Ili terranes. The development of brachiopod biogeography within the nearly ten million year time span of the Late Ordovician from about 458 to 443 Ma (Sandbian, Katian, and Hirnantian), is supported by much new data, including our revised identifications from the Kazakh Orogen and elsewhere. The Kazakh archipelago was west of the Australasian segment of the Gondwana Supercontinent, and relatively near the Tarim, South China and North China continents, apart from the Atashu-Zhamshi Microcontinent, which probably occupied a relatively isolated position on the south-western margin of the archipelago. Distinct faunal signatures indicate that the Kazakh terranes were far away from Baltica and Siberia throughout the Ordovician. Although some earlier terranes had joined each other before the Middle Ordovician, the amalgamation of Kazakh terranes into the single continent of Kazakhstania by the end of the Ordovician is very unlikely. The Late Ordovician brachiopods from the other continents are also compared with the Kazakh faunas and global provincialisation statistically determined.",

    "abstract": "The Meta-Carpathian Arch, that comprised cratonic areas of SE Poland, usually experienced in the Mesozoic much less subsidence, or showed uplift, with regard to the Polish part of the Central European Basin situated farther north. In marked contrast, the areas of the Meta-Carpathian Arch were affected by strong subsidence in Middle and Late Jurassic time, and the peri-Carpathian segment of the Polish Rift began to develop in the Middle Jurassic as a southern extention of that rift, the existence of which north of the Holy Cross Lineament dates back to the Triassic or Permian. A stronger attenuation of continental crust can be recognized south of the Holy Cross Transfer Fault, which bounded the peri-Carpathian segment to the north; this is a feature consistent with the extention of the Polish Rift into the domain of the Carpathian Tethys. The Jurassic tectonic events controlled in the studied areas the formation of the three transgressive-regressive tectono-stratigraphic units: the COK Sequence (CaIlovian, Oxfordian and Lower Kimmeridgian, upper boundary near the top of the Hypselocyclum Zone); the LUK Sequence (Lower and Upper Kimmeridgian, upper boundary within the Eudoxus Zone); and the KVB Sequence (topmost Kimmeridgian, Volgian and Lower Berriasian). Coeval tectonic events, corresponding to those recorded in cratonic Poland, can be recognized in different parts of Europe, particularly in the Carpathians. The alternating phases of relative uplift and subsidence, experienced by the areas of the Meta-Carpathian Arch that flanked the Central European Basin on the south, can be attributed to fluctuations of intraplate stresses. The peculiar behavior of the Cracow region in Mesozoic and Miocene time, as an area never affected by strong subsidence, is thought to have resulted from the presence of Variscan granitoids at its depths. A development of the Polish Rift Basin in agreement with models assuming simple shear on Iithospheric scale is suggested.

    "abstract": "Devonian conodonts and ammonoids occurring in association in the Ouidane Chebbi section of the eastern Tafilalt (Anti-Atlas, Morocco) are described and analysed in terms of stratigraphy. The excellently exposed sequence spans the entire Devonian; it includes open-marine carbonates and shales deposited outside the tropical realm. Except for its Middle Devonian part, the Ouidane Chebbi section is not condensed. Although the sequence was only sampled in a preliminary fashion, most of it lithological units have been dated with some precision. The study is an attempt to enhance the precision in the correlation between the Devonian conodont and ammonoid sequences. Graphic correlation method was used for estimating the precise position of the zonal and stage boundaries for the Middle and Upper Devonian intervals. The stratigraphy of the Lower Devonian at Ouidane Chebbi is still poorly defined. The Eifelian/Givetian boundary is well constrained, especially by both conodonts and ammonoids. It occurs within the uppermost part of the Kacak Event-Level, a characteristic shale horizon that begins in the ensensis Zone and ranges into the hemiansatus Zone. Biostratigraphic indications from conodonts show that the top of the Pharciceras limestone unit is located within the norrisi Zone and the Givetian/Frasnian boundary should be placed within the characteristic black styliolinites level of the Frasne Event. The onset of the Kellwasser facies falls within the Zone 12 ( winchelli Zone) of the Frasnian and it extends into the rhomboidea Zone. The combined evidence from ammonoid and trilobite data suggests that the marine deposition persisted at Ouidane Chebbi at least up to the time of the Upper praesulcata Zone.",

The ammonite faunas are of Submediterranean character, although markedly impoverished when compared with those of the most classic areas of the province. This impoverishment is especially well seen in the uppermost Bajocian – lowermost Bathonian part of the succession, where the only numerous ammonites are these of the genus Parkinsonia, together with rare representatives of Cadomites; and in the uppermost part of the Lower Bathonian, where representatives of the corresponding macro- and microconchs –  Asphinctites tenuiplicatus (BRAUNS), and Polysphinctites secundus (WETZEL) – predominate. In the palaeontological part of the paper 14 species belonging to the genera Oxycerites , Parkinsonia , Cadomites , Wagnericeras , Asphinctites  and Polysphinctites are described. Of these, particular attention is paid to a form referred to as Parkinsonia  ( Parkinsonia ) aff. dorni ARKELL from the uppermost Bajocian, represented by several specimens of various growth stages, which may be tentatively compared with the poorly diagnostic small, incomplete type-specimens of P. dorni .",

Seven conodont zones, three of them containing conodont fauna almost identical with that of corresponding assemblages in the Tethyan Middle Triassic, are recognizable here. The Neospathodus germanicus , N. kockeli and Gondolella excelsa zones comprise the Gogolin; Gorazdze and Terebratula beds, as well as part of the Karchowice Beds (Lower Muschelkalk), which correspond to the Lower Anisian, Pelsonian and ,the lowermost Illyrian.

These zones include the Tarnowice, Wilkowice and Boruszowice beds (Illyrian through Fassanian). The Muschelkalk/Keuper boundary in Silesia runs in the lowermost Langobardian and, therefore, the Lettenkohle series is precisely of this age. A conodont assemblage from the Muschelkalk of Opole Silesia departs from all others known so far in its considerable content of eccentric and bifurcated gondolellids. The presence of some lithological and microfacies types,·the formation of which was connected with environments similar to those of the Great Bahama Bank and of the Persian Gulf, occurring throughout the Muschelkalk of Opole Silesia, is also shown.

Warszawa. The taxonomy and stratigraphy of the Upper Campanian and Lower Maastrichtian belemnites from the Vistula (central Poland) and Kronsmoor (northern Germany) sections are revised on the basis of new collections from the Vistula section as well as a reinvestigation of the classic collection of Schulz from the Kronsmoor section. For the taxonomic description a new biometric procedure is proposed, which can be applied to both the genera Belemnella and Belemnitella. For the species-level taxa recognition the Artificial Neural Networks method, the self-organizing Kohonen algorithm, was implemented. This new taxonomic and methodological approach enabled the recognition of nine species of the genus Belemnella. Five of them can be assigned to the existing species B. lanceolata, B. longissima , B. inflata, B. obtusa and B. vistulensis. However, the species concept differs from that applied by Schulz (1979). As a consequence, the stratigraphic ranges of these species are modified. Four species are left in open nomenclature and represent possibly new species. Future studies may reveal that they might be assigned to East European forms from Ukraine or Russia. The species of Belemnella recognized are placed into the stratigraphic framework based on the standard ammonite and inoceramid bivalve zonations, especially those recognized in the Vistula section. The newly proposed belemnite zonation for the Vistula and Kronsmoor sections is correlated via inoceramids with the standard GSSP at Tercis, France, in order to identify the base of the Maastrichtian Stage. The Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary as defined in Tercis is placed here at the base of the newly defined B. obtusa and B. vistulensis Zones [“obtusa/vistulensis”] - thus it is markedly higher than the traditional boundary based on the FAD of representatives of the genus Belemnella . This new boundary coincides well with a distinct turnover of belemnite guard morphology and represents one of the most important points in the early evolutionary history of Belemnella. Three belemnite zones defined by their lower boundaries are recognized in the Campanian-Maastrichtian interval, in addition to three subzones recognized within the B. obtusa Superzone. The B. lanceolata and B. inflata zones as understood here are referred to the Upper Campanian [Tercis definition]. The B. obtusa Zone is subdivided into three subzones, viz.: Belemenlla vistulensis, Belemnella sp. G and Belemnella sp. F, which are referred to the Lower Maastrichtian [Tercis definition]. The fast evolving species of Belemnella enable the proposal of a biostratigraphic scheme with a resolution that is higher than those based on inoceramid bivalves and ammonites - the longevity of a belemnite zone could be as low as 200Ky.",

Late Cenomanian-Turonian (Cretaceous) ammonites from Wadi Qena, central Eastern Desert, Egypt: taxonomy, biostratigraphy and palaeobiogeographic implications. Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (1), 63-89. Warszawa. In Egypt, marine Upper Cenomanian-Turonian strata are well exposed in the Eastern Desert. The southernmost outcrops are located in the central part of Wadi Qena, where the lower Upper Cretaceous is represented by the fossiliferous Galala and Umm Omeiyid formations. From these strata, numerous ammonites have been collected bed-by-bed and 13 taxa have been identified, which are systematically described herein. Four of them ( Euomphaloceras costatum , Vascoceras globosum globosum , Thomasites gongilensis and Pseudotissotia nigeriensis ) are recorded from Egypt for the first time. The ammonite ranges are used for a biostratigraphic zonation of the lower Upper Cretaceous succession in the northern and central part of Wadi Qena: the Upper Cenomanian-Lower Turonian has been subdivided into five biozones (including a new upper Lower Turonian biozone based on the occurrence of Pseudotissotia nigeriensis ), and one biozone has been recognized in the Upper Turonian. Palaeobiogeographically, the ammonite assemblage has a Tethyan character. During the Early Turonian, influences of the Vascoceratid Province were predominant with strong affinities to typical Nigerian faunas. This shows the significance of faunal exchange between Egypt and Central and West Africa via the Trans-Saharan Seaway. Compared to contemporaneous ammonoid faunas from the northern part of the Eastern Desert, Boreal influences are much less obvious in Wadi Qena. Thus, the present study greatly enhances the knowledge of the Late Cretaceous palaeobiogeography and biostratigraphy of Egypt and adjacent areas.",

Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (1), 91-116. Warszawa. The formal definition of the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Maastrichtian Stage at Tercis, southwest France, is based on the first or last occurrences of twelve taxa, including three species of ammonites, Pachydiscus ( Pachydiscus ) neubergicus , Diplomoceras cylindraceum , and Nostoceras ( Nostoceras ) hyatti . The taxonomy and stratigraphical distribution of these, and allied forms, are studied, on the basis of material from the opoka succession across the upper Campanian-lowermost Maastrichtian boundary in the Middle Vistula River section, central Poland. In view of the imprecise location of two ammonite GSSP markers in that section, a direct ammonite-based correlation with the GSSP at Tercis is impossible. However, data available indicate that in the Middle Vistula River section the first occurrence of Pachydiscus ( P. ) neubergicus and the last occurrence of Nostoceras ( N. ) hyatti are situated significantly higher than the first occurrence of Belemnella lanceolata , the traditional belemnite marker for the base of the Maastrichtian Stage in the Boreal Realm, and that Diplomoceras cylindraceum appears significantly below this level. There are no unequivocal records of Pachydiscus ( P. ) neubergicus from the Belemnella lanceolata Zone s.l. in the Middle Vistula River section.",

    "abstract": "A critical verification of the previous stratigraphic Quaternary subdivisions has updated the setting of the stratigraphic units in Poland. Inconsequently applied classification and terminology in the Polish Quaternary stratigraphy has been accompanied by arbitrary correlation with marine isotope stages. This has resulted in the creation of several stratigraphic units, occasionally with ambiguous stratigraphic setting and chronology, and usually devoid of the type sections. A record of most of the Early and Middle Pleistocene is full of sedimentary hiatuses. The detailed stratigraphic setting of 5 glaciations (Nidanian, Sanian 1, Sanian 2, Odranian and Vistulian) and 4 interglacials (Podlasian, Ferdynandovian, Mazovian and Eemian) has been established in the Pleistocene of Poland. The palaeomagnetic Brunhes/Matuyama boundary was determined within the Podlasian Interglacial and therefore, the oldest glaciation (Nidanian) has no equivalent anywhere in Europe. The stratigraphic units distinguished are correlated with those in Western Europe and with the marine isotope stages. The Quaternary stratigraphy in Poland is faced with the necessity of how to define regional stratotypes of the main stratigraphic units and boundaries. A crucial issue is to change the approach from a qualitative description of the stratigraphic units to one based also on selected quantitative criteria.",

The Turonian/Coniacian boundary interval marks a radical change from the Upper Turonian, Mytiloides / Inoceramus -dominated fauna to the Cremnoceramus -dominated fauna of the topmost Turonian and Lower Coniacian. The  Cremnoceramus clade is basically composed of three lineages: waltersdorfensis, with subspecies waltersdorfensis  (ANDERT) and hannovrensis (HEINZ); deformis , with subspecies erectus (MEEK), dobrogensis  (SZASZ) and deformis (MEEK); and crassus , with subspecies inconstans (WOODS) and crassus  (PETRASCHECK). Rare Inoceramus species range throughout the boundary interval, and in the middle Lower Coniacian representatives of the genus Tethyoceramus SORNAY (non HEINZ) appear. Twelve species and/or subspecies of these genera are described and illustrated. The inoceramids provide the basis for the subdivision of the uppermost Turonian – Lower Coniacian boundary interval into 7 inoceramid zones. The upper Upper Turonian is divided into the Mytiloides scupini Zone and the  Cremnoceramus waltersdorfensis Zone.

    "abstract": "In the Subhercynian Cretaceous Basin, six Upper Cretaceous angular unconformities can be observed. The first unconformity, at the base of the Cenomanian transgressive deposits, is not related to the development of the basin. While the second (Lower to Middle Coniacian) unconformity is almost limited to the northern basin margin, four unconformities are developed at the Harznordrand Thrust and span the short period from the Middle Santonian to the late Early Campanian (about 3 Ma). The intra-Coniacian unconformity at the northern basin margin proves tilting of the basin floor to the south-east and is possibly related to the development of the thrust too. The Santonian to Campanian unconformities at the Harznordrand Thrust reflect the formation of a continuously growing fault-propagation fold. Deposition above unconformities occurred when the rate of eustatic sea-level rise exceeded thrusting rate. Transgressions occurred in the earliest Middle Santonian, in the Late Santonian (intra- Marsupites Zone), in the earliest Campanian ( granulataquadrata  Zone) and in the late Early Campanian ( Offaster pilula Zone). The ages of unconformities correlate well with the transgressive pulses proved in Western and Middle Europe and are not related to discrete deformational events.",

The precise relationship of the Palaeoscolecida to the priapulids or alternatively with the nematomorphs remains under discussion, but suggested is their systematic position within the superphylum Ecdysozoa, comprising moulting animals. some of the described cuticular trunks exhibit distinction between the dorsal and ventral sides: nodular sclerites occur on the dorsal and spiny sclerites on the ventral sides of the worm body. Such a pattern of ornamentation may suggest adaptation for a level-bottom, vagile benthic and probably epifaunal mode of life. The Siberian palaeoscolecids are compared with the type species of Palaeoscolex , P. piscatorum Whittard, 1953, and with palaeoscolecid worms from Australia, Bohemia and China. Sclerites recorded with microplates accreted into the basal brim may support a hypothesis that the more complex sclerite structure bearing a series of nodes was derived from simple small sclerites with single node. The biostratigraphic utility of isolated sclerites remains low, because of the same morphology occur in different sclerites may occur in one scleritome.",

Aggradational evaporite deposition was controlled by water or brine level fluctuations within the basin or subbasins.Because the basin was separated from the sea by some emerged barriers these fluctuations were only weakly dependent on world-wide sea-level changes but were rather controlled by regional climate.",

    "abstract": "The Carboniferous paraIic succession (late Visean - Westphalian A ) of the subsurface Lublin Basin in eastern Poland yields carbonate deposits, which dominate in the Visean phase of sedimentation, and become more subordinate towards the younger units (Yoredale-type cyclothems). Numerous, perfectly preserved calcareous algae and microproblematics, as well as fairly frequent conodonts indicate an overlapping of the succeeding uppermost Visean strata, and precise the position of the Visean/Namurian and Namurian B /Namurian C boundaries. The five conodont zones have been distinguished: the Lochriea nodosa, the Lochriea cruciformis, the Gnathodus bollandensis, the ldiognathodus sinuosus-ldiognathodus delicatus, and the ldiognathoides tuberculatus zones. The lower boundary of the cruciformis Zone is postulated to coincide with the Visean/Namurian boundary. The presence of ldiognathoides tuberculatus Zone indicates a close relationship of the Lublin Basin with the upper Bashkirian basins of the East European Platform. A distinction of the five algal zones: the Koninckopora, the Kulikia sphaerica, the Calcifolium punctatum, the Calcifolium okense, and the Masloviporidium-Anthracoporellopsis zones enables to correlate regional complexes as well as distant sections, ranging from northern England to the Ukrainian Lvov-VoIhynian Basin, and farther east to the Moscow and Dneper-Donets Basins, in the interval corresponding to the latest Visean - earliest Namurian. The microfacies spectrum of limestone complexes and bands, dominated by the lagoonal algal and spiculitic, and the more distal foraminiferaI and crinoidal lithotypes, bears evidences of local and temporary shoalings marked by peloid microfacies, featured by structures typical of early cementation and emersion. A comparison of microfacies succession in the Limestone Band C (random arrangement) and Limestone Band F (shalIowing upward), and application of LEEDER & STRUDWICK'S sedimentary models indicate a transformation of sedimentary regime in the earliest Namurian. An autocyclic, deltaic pattern of the late Visean changed into an allocyclic system in the Namurian A , with duration of particular cycles estimated as about 500 k.y. This sedimentary turnover is recognized to coincide with the beginning of the Gondwanan glaciation, and thus it suggests a eustatic cause of the lower Namurian cyclicity in the Lublin Carboniferous Basin.

    "abstract": "Within the generally carbonate and mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sequence pierced by deep boreholes, 21 conodont zones are recognized from the Frasnian punctata Zone up to the lower Tournaisian sandbergi Zone in Western Pomerania, northwestern Poland. Four Famennian conodont species are established as new: Polygnathus limbatus sp. n., Polygnathus pomeranicus sp. n., Polygnathus praecursor sp. n., and Alternognathus costatiformis sp. n. Lateral relationship of litho- and biofacies as well as their vertical succession are recognized within the Late Devonian sedimentary environments. Six conodont biofacies (paImatolepid-polygnathid, polygnathid-palmatolepid, icriodid-polygnathid, polygnathid, polygnathid-bispathodid, and bispathodid) and some mixed conodont biofacies are documented in settings ranging from offshore pelagic to shallow nearshore. The distribution of the Late Devonian litho- and biofacies within the epicratonic Pomeranian sea was influenced by the location of the hinterland to the north (Fennoscandian High) and to the east (Mazurian and/or Byelorussian High) which controlled a north- and eastwardly sea shallowing. The Late Devonian history of Western Pomerania underwent evolution from extremely shallow water and coastal environments in the earliest Frasnian, through deeper environments during the rest of the Frasnian and early Famennian up to the rhomboidea Chron. The presence of Famennian stromatoporoid-coral-crinoid-bryozoan buildups is noticeable in the Early and Middle marginifera Chrons. Extensive shallow water and coastal environments reappeared in the late Famennian, precisely since the Latest marginifera Chron up to the Middle expansa Chron. At the end of the Famennian, beginning with the Late expansa Chron, an open sea environment became prevalent almost over the whole area and continued up to the early Tournaisian. A sequence of 13 events, both eustatic sea-level changes and epeiric movements, as well as those of biotic nature, is revealed and dated in terms of the worldwide standard conodont zonation.

Gnathodus austini sp. n., Gnathodus praebilineatus sp. n., and Paragnathodus cracoviensis sp. n., provide a clear understanding of the origin of Visean gnathodid conodonts. To correlate the Lower Carboniferous deposits in the OIkusz and Sosnowiec area, the preliminary standard conodont zonation of SANDBERG & al.

On the basis of this biostratographic framework, the diachronous nature of the facies is indicated, and this precludes simple correlation of lithological and biostartigraphic units. The significant stratigraphic gap between the Devonian and the Lower Carboniferous deposits covers the interval between the Middle and/or Upper costatus Zone (uppermost Famennian) and the crenulata Zone (Middle Tournaisian). In some places, however, the presence of the sandbergi Zone at the base of the Lower Carboniferous sequence is also suggested.",

The secondary encrusters of a reef frame are bryozoans, serpulids, foraminifers, and cirripedes Verruca . Seven species of coral line algae are common among 21 species found in reef deposits. CoralIines show most species in common with the Ukraine and only some with the Vienna Basin. Of the two ecological assemblages recognized, viz. the reef assemblage and the epi-reef assemblage, the first one inhabited the reef during its growth, and was structured mainly by the presence of hard bottom with abundant fissures and cavities. The second one inhabited the surface of the already dead reef, and it was structured by the presence of hard bottom and ubiquitous noncalcifytng·submarine flora. The reef has developed on positive elements of the·sea bottom in extremely shallow water, under high hydrodynamic conditions, normal salinity, and climate comparable to the present-day eastern part of the Mediterranean. Intensive submarine cementation has initiated the diagenetic evolution of reef rocks. Late diagenetic features in the investigated reefs are attributed to changes in local continental (Upper Miocene till Holocene) environments associated with wandering level of local ground-water tables.",

The analysed assemblage includes 12 species of the Lithistida, 16 species of the Hyalospongea, and also non-lithistid demosponges represented by isolated spicules. The assemblage differs from that one found in the White Jurassic a of Swabia and Franconia, a facies equivalent of the Jasna Gora Beds, as the former is dominated by the Lithistida, while the latter by the Hyalospongea. The investigated sponges inhabited a deeper-shelf environment, not shallower than 150–200 m; they seem to have been slightly implanted in the soft bottom sediment. The sponge assemblage is species diverse in marly beds, but highly dominated by a single species in limestones. Sponge bioherms developed mostly at local slopes of the bottom, due to an improved water circulation. The systematic part of the paper includes descriptions of 28 species, those represented by the material sufficiently rich to permit a departure from the pre-existing oversplitted taxonomy and a recognition of their proper taxonomic position.",

    "abstract": "The Cenomanian ammonites from selected sections in German Democratic Republic (Subhercynian Basin and Saxony), Central Poland (Holy Cross Mts), and the Soviet Union (Podolia, Crimea, Caucasus, and Mangyshlak) are assigned to 98 species and subspecies of 27 genera. A great majority of the species show a wide geographic distribution which permits inter correlation of the investigated sections, as well as a correlation of the regional stratigraphic zonation patterns used in German Democratic Republic, Poland, and the Soviet Union with that used in northwestern Europe (southern England and northern France). There is a considerable variation in composition of ammonite faunules and only a small one in facies among the investigated sections, which indicates that bathymetry was insignificant in controls of ammonite distribution at that time. The phylloceratids, tetragonitids, and gaudryceratids are almost entirely confined to Crimea and Caucasus. The two regions share also most of the species with northwestern Europe, with typical Boreal forms representative of the genera Schloenbachia and Hyphoplites included, which demonstrates a mixing of Boreal and Mediterranean ammonite faunas in that area. Bareal aspects of the Cenomanian ammonites faunas are recognizable also in Mangyshlak and Kopet-Dag in the Soviet Union and in Esfahan area in Iran. The southern boundary of the Boreal province must therefore have been south of the present-day position of Crimea Highland, Caucasus, and Kopet-Dag at the Cenomanian time. The Lower and Middle Cenomanian are very well documented with ammonites in the investigated sections as a rule, whereas the abundance of ammonites is considerably decreased in the Upper Cenomanian all over the investigated area (Upper Cenomanian ammonites have not been recorded in some sections) although there is no significant change in facies. A similar phenomenon can be observed in northwestern Europe, North Atlantic drillings, and also in the Pacific, which is suggestive of its pan-regional cause. In paleontological description of the investigated ammonite taxa, good preservation state and large number of the specimens permitted recognition of micro- and macroconchs among representatives of the genera Sciponoceras, Scaphites, and Puzosia. A peculiar sexual dimorphism has been noted in Sciponoceras baculoide (Mantell), in which species the micro- and macroconchs differ from each other in the aperture type but not in the shell size or ornamentation.",

Classic event stratigraphy has a good potential in refining biostratigraphic correlations as most of the classic bioevents are isochronous within the integrated stratigraphy. Many lithological event beds such as marker marls can be incorporated into the cyclo- and sequence stratigraphic framework, explaining their significance in interregional correlation. The best stratigraphic resolution provides the cyclostratigraphy based on the typical Cenomanian marl-limestone couplets and their stacking pattern, inferred to reflect orbital forcing of the Milankovitch frequency band: detailed bed-by-bed correlation of couplets (precession cycle, ca. 20 kyr) allows a stratigraphic calibration within ~10 kyr time slices. Conspicuous marker marl beds embrace bundles of ~five couplets and are related to the short eccentricity (100 kyr) cycle. However, for the upper Lower Cenomanian ( dixoni  Zone) it appears that the existing couplet scale is incomplete. Sequence stratigraphic analysis demonstrates that the investigated interval comprises the maximum flooding and highstand interval of an Early Cenomanian sequence, capped by a significant late dixoni Zone sequence boundary, followed by uppermost Lower to Middle Cenomanian lowstand and transgressive deposits grading into a Middle Cenomanian maximum flooding zone (“calcimetry break”). Carbon stable-isotope values are stable around 2‰ vs. V-PDB within the mid- and late dixoni Zone, related to equilibrium conditions during maximum flooding and highstand conditions of sea-level. The latest Early to earliest Middle Cenomanian sea-level fall and lowstand was accompanied by a negative δ 13 C excursion of ca. 0.4 ‰ in couplets B34-B40 (Lower-Middle Cenomanian boundary isotope Event, LMCE, new name) followed by a rise of 0.4–0.6‰ δ 13 C in couplets B41-C2 during the early transgressive systems tract (Middle Cenomanian δ 13 C excursion MCE 1). These observations support the interpretation that the δ 13 C signal is a good proxy for (eustatic) sea-level changes. The LMCE is suggested as a proxy marker for the base of the Middle Cenomanian Substage.",

Described are also two new coprolite species, Bactryllium ornatum sp. n. and B. elongatum sp. n., most probably attributable to the investigated megalodontids. On the basis of a succession in facies and their lateral changes, the development of the Rhaetian sedimentary basin in reconstructed. Finally, the Rhaetian deposits of the Tatra Mts are correlated with contemporaneous strata from other parts of the Tethys Ocean.",

Their taphonomy was studied in six localities of the Menilite-Krosno series (Blazowa, Jamna Dolna 1, Jamna Dolna 2, Rudawka Rymanowska, Wola Czudecka, Wujskie). Over 1700 specimens of variably complete fish skeletons, representative of 20 actinopterygian families, were studied. The taphonomic analysis of the skeletal disarticulation and its pattern, deformations of the vertebral column (curved, broken), arrangement of jaws and fins, the spatial array of skeletons with regard to the embedding sediment, as well as identification of unusually preserved specimens, indicate that all of the ichthyotaphocoenoses have resulted from a long-term accumulation of fish carcasses at the burial place, at a very low sedimentation rate, under anoxic conditions in, and above, the sediment/water interface. Two assemblages from the Tylawa limestone Horizon have acquired their unusually good preservation state due to the penetration of calcium carbonate into soft tissues of corpses at the burial place. In other deposits (shales, marls) the fish skeletons are more or less disarticulated as a result of decay in a calm environment. each of the ichthyotaphocoenoses displays some features indicative of mass mortality events (e.g. high density of individuals, the presence of individuals with jaws agape, high number of juveniles); none of them has a set of features indicating it unequivocally. The cause and/or conditions of death were not the same for all individuals. Only some individuals died instantaneously during mass mortalities, whereas the majority died over a period of time as a result of senility, diseases, or other circumstances. All of the ichthyotaphocoenoses show features typical of both necro- and thanatocoenoses. The associated flora and fauna, e.g., amphipods, land-derived dragonflies and bird feathers, indicate that the taphocoenoses originated as a result of accumulation of biotic remains from various environments. Fishes and associated remains settled on the bottom successively, and thus their assemblages display features typical of necrocoenoses. Evidence of fish predation is reported for the first time from the Menilite-Krosno series of Poland.",

The ophiolitic rocks are dismembered and tectonically enclosed within, or thrust over, island arc assemblages. Serpentinites, altered slices of the upper mantle, represent a distinctive lithology of the dismembered ophiolites. Some portions of the serpentinized rocks contain fresh relicts of primary minerals such as chromian spinel and olivine. The abundance of bastite and mesh textures suggests harzburgite and dunite protoliths, respectively, for these serpentinites. Some fresh cores of chromian spinel are rimmed by ferritchromite and Cr-magnetite. The development of alteration rims around chromian spinel cores indicates their formation during prograde alteration and under oxidizing conditions during lower amphibolite facies metamorphism. Fresh chromian spinels are characterized by high contents of Cr 2 O 3 (48.92-56.74 wt. %), Al 2 O 3 (10.29-20.08wt. %), FeO (16.24-28.46 wt. %) and MgO (4.89-14.02 wt. %), and very low TiO 2 contents (&lt;0.16 wt. %). The analyzed fresh chromian spinels have high Cr# (0.62-0.79) characteristic of spinels in mantle peridotite that has undergone some degree of partial melting. The data presented here suggest that the mantle peridotites of the Gabal El-Degheimi area are similar to forearc peridotites of suprasubduction zone environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The published peat:coal compaction ratios range from 1.1:1 to 60:1 and from 1.1:1 to 11:1 for lignites. These probably represent realistic end-member values for the degree of compaction during the transformation of peat into lignite and then to coal. Hence, in many cases, the obtained values of the compaction ratio are under- or overestimated with reference to the entire coal seam. This study focuses on the changes of thickness between a peat bed and the resulting lignite seam. The fundamental question is how many times the thickness of the peat bed, prior to covering the mire by the overburden, was greater than the present-day thickness of the lignite seam. The majority of methods reported in this paper cannot be used directly to quantify the amount of compaction of the lignite seam. In this context, the only category of methods which allow a direct estimation of the peat:lignite compaction ratio are the so-called stratigraphic methods. Therefore, based on comparison of the initial peat bed thickness with lignite seam thickness, the most accurate peat:lignite compaction ratio ranges from 2:1 to 4:1.",

Inoceramid and foraminiferal record and biozonation of the Turonian and Coniacian (Upper Cretaceous) of the Mangyshlak Mts., western Kazakhstan. Acta Geologica Polonica, 63 (4), 469-487. Warszawa. The Turonian and Coniacian (Upper Cretaceous) of the Mangyshlak Mts., western Kazakhstan, yielded a rich and relatively complete inoceramid bivalve record. The faunas and their succession correspond to those known from central and eastern Europe, allowing the zonation established in the latter areas to be applied in a virtually identical form. The gaps in the record of the group in Mangyshlak stem from the regional hiatuses in the geological record in the area and do not reflect any biogeographical differences between eastern and central-western Europe. Planktonic foraminifera are rare. Four successive interval range zones can be distinguished: in ascending stratigraphic order, the Helvetoglobotrunaca helvetica, Marginotruncaca pseudolinneiana, Marginotruncana coronata, and Concavotruncana concavata zones. Their correlation with the inoceramid zonation and, consequently, with the chronostratigraphic scheme, is demonstrated. The zonation and chronostratigraphic subdivision as applied in Mangyshlak may easily be applied to other areas of the peri-Caspian region (Caucasus, Tuarkyr, Kopet-Dagh, SE margin of the East-European Craton).",

    "abstract": "Abstract A well-developed Triassic carbonate platform is exposed in the eastern part of the Tulcea Unit, in the Cimmerian North Dobrogean Orogen, southeastern Romania. Facies analysis of the 200 m thick succession of lower Middle Anisian limestones exposed in a large limestone quarry south of the village of Mahmudia suggests a transition from upper slope towards toe-of-slope carbonate facies, reflecting sea-level fluctuations and tectonic tilting. The slope is dominated by in situ microbialites in the upper portion, consisting of reefal boundstone facies, and by molluscan coquina and cement boundstones. A key role is played by the cosmopolitan micro-encruster Tubiphytes, which became common in the aftermath of the mass extinction at the Permian/Triassic boundary, and by autochthonous micrite and synsedimentary marine cement. The absence of metazoan reef builders, such as sponges and corals, reflects the fact that microbes were the first organisms to recover after the Permian/Triassic crisis under unusual marine conditions and that their main role in reef formation was sediment stabilization along the upper slopes. The lower slope is mostly detrital, being dominated by platform-derived bioclastic rudstones and crinoidal floatstones, which are interbedded with basinal carbonate hemipelagics. The toe-of-slope is composed of pelagic wackestones framed by thin tongues of intraclast breccia. All these observations are in agreement with the slopeshedding model described for the Pennsylvanian microbial margin in Asturias (northern Spain) and the Anisian- Ladinian flat-topped, steep-rimmed Latemar platform (Dolomites, Italy). As most of the Anisian reefs were described from western and eastern Tethys (Southern Alps, Hungary, China), the occurrence of the early Middle Anisian Tubiphytes-reef from North Dobrogea (Romania) contributes to resolving the puzzle of the geographic distribution of reef recovery in the Middle Triassic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ammonite distribution patterns and carbon and oxygen stable isotopes from the Lipnik-Kije (Poland) and Dubovcy (Ukraine) sections allow us to propose a model of sea water paleo-circulation in central Europe for the Coniacian- Santonian interval. The tectonic evolution of the south-eastern part of Poland, and expansion of the Krukienic Island areas, appears to have been one of the most important factors affecting paleotemperatures and the distribution of ammonite faunas in the shallow, epicontinental sea in this part of Europe. In the Lipnik-Kije section, low-latitude Tethyan ammonites, especially of the genera Nowakites, Parapuzosia and Saghalinites, are mixed with the cold water loving ammonite genus Kitchinites in the Lower Santonian. In the Dubovcy section (western Ukraine), Tethyan ammonites disappear abruptly in the earliest Santonian, giving place to temperate ammonites of the Kitchinites group in the early Early Santonian and to Boreal belemnites of the genus Gonioteuthis in the Middle and Late Santonian. Despite evidence for the effects of diagenesis in both sections, bulk-rock δ 18 O records from the limestones support higher seawater paleotemperatures in the Polish sea and cooler conditions in the western Ukraine. The proposed paleo-circulation model and paleotemperature distribution across Europe is supported independently by changes in faunal and nannoflora evidence (ammonites, foraminifera and nannoplankton), and rather unexpectedly with the bulk δ 18 O data. These data allow the recognition of the end-Coniacian-Early Santonian cooling event, resulting from cold currents flowing from the north, which is traceable, with different magnitude, in several European sections. Facies changes in both sections are related to the input of terrigenous material, and linked to Subhercynian tectonic movements which affected the eastern (Ukrainian) and central (Holy Cross) segment of the Mid Polish Trough at different times. Uplift and sediment input moved westwards through time. Clastic input is detectable at the Coniacian-Santonian boundary in the Ukrainian segment. Similar facies changes reached the Holy Cross segment in Poland distinctly later, somewhen in the Middle Santonian. It is likely that tectonics together with paleo-circulation changes markedly restricted or even cut-off the western Ukraine area from Tethyan ocean influences in the Early Santonian.",

    "abstract": "Sediments of palaeolakes located in eastern Poland representing the Mazovian Interglacial (Holsteinian) and the initial part of the succeeding Middle-Polish glaciation (Saalian), are unique in Europe. These sediments are very thick (up to 55 m) and homogeneous, composed of lake marl and calcareous gyttja. They are thoroughly interpreted in terms of geological and palaeobiological studies (palynology, macrofossils, diatoms and malacofauna) and represent continuous deposition. Analysis of stable oxygen and carbon isotopes in these deposits and of the shells of the malacofauna enables interpretation of the changes in the palaeoclimate and sedimentary environment that occurred in lake basins during this part of the Pleistocene. Maximum δ 18 O (-3,6‰) and minimum values of δ 13 C (-6,4‰) correspond to the first part of the interglacial optimum, while minimum δ 18 O values (-10,1‰) and maximum δ 13 C values (10,0‰) correspond to the coldest period, directly preceding the following glaciation. Climatic changes are well documented by isotopic curves correlated with the results of pollen analysis. The isotopic curves indicate relatively cool climatic conditions at the climatic optimum of the Mazovian Interglacial. This may have been caused by increased atmospheric precipitation that led to deepening of the lakes, and/or by influx of ground waters enriched in light isotopes. In the upper part of the successions, corresponding to the initial stage of the following glaciation, the concentration of 18 O and 13 C increases, which was probably associated with the lake shallowing and with enrichment in heavy isotopes through evaporation under conditions of a cool steppe climate and/or with the redeposition of “warm” interglacial deposits from shore areas exposed as the result of lake shallowing. The isotopic curves clearly illustrate changes in the relative influence of maritime and continental air circulation during the Mazovian Interglacial. The studied lakes were oligo- or mesotrophic with dominant influence of continental air circulation before the interglacial climatic optimum. Maritime air circulation prevailed during the interglacial climatic optimum and the lakes became eutrophic. Cyclic climatic cooling during the post-interglacial period is recorded in oxygen isotopic curves trending towards their lower values. The carbon isotopic curves reach higher values, which is related to climatic cooling and shallowing of the lakes, caused by their infilling with deposits.",

It can be shown that a large proportion of deposit-feeding structures, such as  Teichichnus , Rhizocorallium irregulare , and Asterosoma , indicating quiet and stable conditions, although occurring in host sediments indicating high energy conditions. This contradictory observation is attributed to non contemporaneous formation of the sediments and the trace fossils.

The study of trace fossil assemblages thus gives a more detailed and accurate picture of former environmental conditions than sedimentologic methods alone.",

The F-F boundary interval was also oxygen deficient, but there may have been a brief reoxygenation at the boundary itself. By the Famennian crepida Zone, the basin gradually began to reoxygenate, but in the  trachytera Zone another anoxic event, the Annulata Event occurred, causing a bloom rather than extinction of specially adapted taxa such as Guerichia. Thus the gamma-ray spectrometry data suggests that basinal anoxia prevailed through much of the Late Frasnian.

The Tumlin Sandstone, c 100 m thick, is characterized ,by a very large-scale hi~-angle cross-stratification which is thought to have been formed on lee-slopes of aeolian dunes, mainly as a result of a grainfall process. The cross-strata usually pass downdip into sub horizontal, laminated deposits accumulated over the interdune area. These deposits contain in places subordinary intercalations formed by ephemeral waters, both flowing (lenses of structureless sandstones) and stagnant (mudstone layers). The cross-stratified sandstones with the underlying subhorizontal deposits form, as a rule, thick layers separated by extensive erosional bounding surfaces that are subhorizontal, and sligthly concave upward over a considerable distance. Their windward parts usually display a wide scoop-like forms resultant from a wind erosion; the details of its formation remain however unclear. The sedimentary environment of the Tumlin Sandstone is to be regarded as a field of transversal dunes migrating northward due to prevailing unidirectional winds. This field occupied part of a midcontinental basin situated at the axis ,of the maximum subsidence of the Danish-Polish Trough.",

Two maximal depth phases were observed namely the Middle Jurassic and Qxfordian ones. The carbo-silite sequence of the Upper Jurassic is characterized by distinct vertical symmetry in the distribution of noduIar limestone and radiolaritic facies. The Middle Jurassic and Oxfordian (the latter in particular) depth phases were of universal character in the Tethyan troughs of the Carpathians and probably of the Alps as well. The dopocenter of these sediments was probably a slope of trough. The deposition depth is considered in relation to calcite and aragonite compensation depths end based on microfacial anaIysis (selective solution). A sequence of calcareous avalanche turbidites (the Muran limestone) of Hauterivian-Barremian age is analysed and its conditions of sedimentation considered. Its origin was due to avalanche and turbidite current transport from distal and possibly also proximal Urgonian reef-detrital zones. On the basis of facial analysis of these redeposited sediments a direct connection of some of the sub-tatric units (Eastern Tatra Mts) with the most southerly situated Klippen Belt succession (Haligovce) is suggested. An Upper Tithonian ammonite fauna was found in the sub-tatric succession. 9 Upper Tithonian ammonite species and genera are described and 8 of them illustrated.

The faunal dynamics of benthic foraminifera in the Middle Jurassic ore-bearing clays of Gnaszyn (Kraków- Częstochowa Upland, south-central Poland) are used to reconstruct sedimentary environments. Two types of foraminiferal assemblages, distinct in their quantitative and qualitative composition, were distinguished; type I assemblages, characterizing intervals between horizons with sideritic concretions; and type II assemblages, characterising horizons with sideritic concretions. Benthic foraminifers were further subdivided into eight ecological morphogroups, based on their morphological features and micro-habitats. Type I assemblages consist mostly of plano/concavo-convex, small-sized epifaunal morphotypes, with a restricted occurrence of shallow infaunal forms and a scarcity of deep infaunal taxa, which suggests low-oxygen conditions in both sediment and bottom waters, and a high sedimentation rate in an outer shelf environment. Type II assemblages are characterized by high taxonomic diversity, high specimen abundance and variability of epifaunal and infaunal morphotypes representing a mixed group of specialized feeding strategies. This suggests optimum living conditions controlled by a lower sedimentation rate, relatively well-oxygenated bottom waters and sufficient or high food supply.",

Acta Geologica Polonica, 62 (4), 561-580. Warszawa. The sponge fauna from the Upper Campanian-lowermost Maastrichtian succession of the Middle Vistula River valley (central Poland) is represented mainly by dictyid hexactinellid sponges (Hexactinosida and Lychniscosida). Their greatest abundance and taxonomic variability is noted in the “Inoceramus” inkermanensis Zone (Upper Campanian), and they are less diverse in the overlying (Upper Campanian) Trochoceramus costaecus Zone and lower “Inoceramus” redbirdensis Zone. In the upper “Inoceramus” redbirdensis Zone (basal Maastrichtian in the sense of the Tercis rather than the Boreal definition) they are extremely rare. With the beginning of the Maastrichtian the number of dictyid sponges gradually increases. The observed changes in the abundance and taxonomic variability of the dictyid sponges indicate environmental changes in the latest Campanian-earliest Maastrichtian sea in the area. It seems that changes in basin bathymetry, confined to eustatic sea-level changes in the latest Campanian and early Maastrichtian, were the most important factor. Progressive shallowing of the basin in the latest Campanian drastically restricted the development of dictyids. In the peak regression, the sea level could have fallen to only several tens of metres. The gradual recovery of the sponge assemblages correlates with subsequent deepening of the basin with the start of the Maastrichtian",

The palaeobotanical data correspond to the results of clay mineral studies, in particular the kaolinite/illite ratio in the source formations.

The problems of the Lower Tortonian littoral structures in the western part of the southern slopes of the Holy Cross Mts. (Central Poland) are dealt with in the present paper. Various types of mechanical littoral structures, among them abrasion and accumulation forms, have been distinguished and organogenic littoral structures with borings of various lithophags (sponges, polychaetes, pelecypods, cirripeds and echinoids), playing the most important role, examined in detail. The palaeogeography of this region have been reconstructed on the basis of the distribution of littoral structures. The Lower Tortonian transgression arrived here in an area with a varied terrain relief, encroached on the depression of valleys and transformed them into bays. The course of valleys was subsequent in relation to the Laramian tectonic structures (folds) and, consequently, the shores of the transgressing sea became Dalmatian in character. A zone of rocky bays, consisting of four largers bays and a forebay zone, has been distinguished from a general palaeogeographical picture of the marine basin here formed. The sedimentation, developing in ,bays and which resulted in a gradual filling of them with different shallow-water, clastic or carbonate sediments, has been discussed. Furthermore, the entire Lower Tortonian sedimentary cycle, which in the region studied begins with transgressive structures and deposits and terminates on forebays with chemical deposits (gypsum) which characteristic of evaporation and a gradual vanishing of this basin, has been examined.",

Silicified sea life - Macrofauna and palaeoecology of the Neuburg Kieselerde Member (Cenomanian to Lower Turonian Wellheim Formation, Bavaria, southern Germany). Acta Geologica Polonica, 63 (4), 555-610. Warszawa. With approximately 100 species, the invertebrate macrofauna of the Neuburg Kieselerde Member of the Wellheim Formation (Bavaria, southern Germany) is probably the most diverse fossil assemblage of the Danubian Cretaceous Group. Occurring as erosional relicts in post-depositional karst depressions, both the Cretaceous sediments and fossils have been silicified during diagenesis. The Neuburg Kieselerde Member, safely dated as Early Cenomanian to Early Turonian based on inoceramid bivalve biostratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy, preserves a predominantly soft-bottom community, which, however, is biased due to near-complete early diagenetic loss of aragonitic shells. The community is dominated by epifaunal and semi-infaunal bivalves as well as sponges that settled on various (bio-) clasts, and may widely be split into an early bivalve-echinoid assemblage and a succeeding sponge-brachiopod assemblage. In addition to these groups we document ichnofauna, polychaete tubes, nautilids and bryozoans. The fauna provides evidence of a shallow to moderately deep, calm, fully marine environment, which is interpreted as a largescale embayment herein. The fauna of the Neuburg Kieselerde Member is regarded as an important archive of lower Upper Cretaceous sea-life in the surroundings of the Mid-European Island.",

    "abstract": "The Cenomanian to Santonian succession of the Staffhorst shaft, ca. 50 km south of Bremen, because of its structural position in the northern German Upper Cretaceous basin, is intermediate in character and fossil content between the pelagic sediments characterizing the Pompeckj Block in the north and the proximal sediments of the Lower Saxony Block in the south. The biostratigraphic subdivision of the shaft is based on inoceramids, echinoids, belemnites and foraminifera. The various biozonations and zonal boundaries used in the Boreal Realm are compared and applied to the zonation of the shaft succession, and the biostratigraphy of the individual fossil groups is described. A new inoceramid zone, that of Inoceramus gibbosus, is proposed for the topmost Lower Coniacian; and an echinoid assemblage zonation is introduced. The existing benthic foraminiferal zonation of the Middle Turonian to Santonian has been modified, with changed age assignments based on the macrofossil zonation. The proposed basal stage boundary criteria of the Second International Symposium on Cretaceous Stage Boundaries (Brussels, 1995) could be applied only in some cases. The proximity of the Staffhorst shaft to the trial borehole, situated only 39 m away, has permitted the Self Potential (SP) and Resistivity (R) logs to be uniquely directly calibrated against the lithostraligraphical and biostratigraphic succession of the shaft. The previous identification of some stage and substage boundaries on the logs of northern German boreholes based on foraminiferal zonation will need to be shifted by several tens of metres as a result of thid calibration.",

The reconstruction of early diagenetic environments is based on such factors as: the dynamics of compaction, isolation from oxygenated sea-water, and availability of carbonate ions. All these factors are attributed to changes in the rate of sedimentation.

    "abstract": "The Oxfordian and Early Kimmeridgian ammonite provincionalism, gradually arising through that time, makes it necessary to set up the separate zonal schemes for different parts of Europe. Besides the generally known differences in ammonite faunas between four distinct bioprovinces, there is a growing evidence that, beginning from the Middle Oxfordian, the ammonite faunas of the western part of the Submediterranean Province differ from those of the eastern part of this province. The two subprovinces, the Iberian-Aquitaine Subprovince and the German-Polish Subprovince, are thus recognized within the Submediterranean Province. The correlation of the Boreal and Subboreal zonal schemes with the Submediterranean one in the Upper Oxfordian and Lower Kimmeridgian is based on the invasions of Boreal ammonites of the genus Amoeboceras into the Submediterranean Province, and on the comparison of the evolutionary development of the family Aulacostephanidae in the Subboreal and Submediterranean Provinces. The successive migration waves of Boreal and Subboreal ammonites into the Submediterranean Province corresponded therein to the marked changes in ammonite faunas of Submediterranean/Mediterranean origin which could also be related with faunal invasions. These changes in ammonite faunas have possibly been controlled by transgressive impulses during the Late Oxfordian - Early Kimmeridgian in Europe.

The spotty marls arc followed by variegated shales and then by turbiditic deposits. The upper boundary of the variegated shales is diachronous - older in the Rata zone (Santonian) and younger in the Klynica zone (Campanian/Maastrichtian). The turbiditic deposits of the marginal (northern) zone of the Magura Nappe display palaeocurrent directions from the NW in the western part and from the NE in the eastern part. In other parts of this unit palaeocurrent directions from the SE and E were observed. The northern source area of the Magura Basin is commonly connected with the Silesian Ridge, while the south-eastern one could be connected with an accreted fragment of the Inner Carpathians. The heavy mineral assemblages of the Magura Nappe are dominated by stable and ultrastable species. Chromian spinels occur additionally in the Krynica zonc and to some extent in the Bystrica and Raca zones. Investigation of the chemical composition of the heavy minerals showed that that the southern source area was built of low- to medium-grade metamorphic rocks, as well as igneous rocks associated with ophiolite sequences. The chemical composition of minerals deriving from the NW indicates that they Clystallized mainly in low- to high-grade metamorphic rocks and granitoids.",

These facies, recognised within primary selenite and fine-grained gypsum deposits, are: (i) selenites with vertical crystals; (ii) selenites with horizontal crystals; (iii) selenite debris flow facies; (iv) selenite debris facies; (v) gypsum microbialite facies; and (vi) alabastrine facies. The facies represent various environments (from shallow-brine to subaerial) of a giant salina-type basin without open-water connections with the sea and showing evaporite drawdown. Integration of facies analysis and event stratigraphic studies in the gypsum basin allowed reconstruction of its sedimentary history. The architecture of the gypsum facies suggests that the margin of the basin was occupied by a system of variable perennial saline pans (dominated by selenite deposition) and evaporite shoals (dominated by gypsum microbialite deposition). The basin was infilled with evaporite deposits by aggradation. After initial evaporite drawdown, the northern margin of the basin evolved from a large perennial saline pan (or system of pans) into an evaporite shoal and then back again into a perennial pan, whereas the east area of the basin was a vast evaporite shoal dominated by gypsum microbialites. Separate selenite pans of oligotrophic-type developed both at the periphery and in the interior of this shoal. Later, predominantly clastic gypsum deposition developed throughout the basin margin, presumably due to a drastic change in the chemistry and salinity of the brine. Evaporite deposition was arrested by a flood of marine waters and rapid deepening.",

    "abstract": "The Middle Miocene (Badenian) evaporites of the northern Carpathian Foredeep were deposited in a salina-type basin. Calcium sulphate sediments were deposited mainly on the broad northern margins of the basin, on vast evaporite shoals (mainly as fine-grained microbialite gypsum) and in large shallow saline pans (as coarse-crystalline selenites). 125 sections of these primary deposits, exposed from Moldova, Ukraine, Poland to the Czech Republic, were subjected to stratigraphic analysis based principally on the methodology of event and high-resolution stratigraphy. Due to an extremely gentle relief and a predominantly aggradational type of deposition, typical of a salina basin, the environmental changes or events were recorded nearly instantaneously in the whole area. Some events, such as water-level or brine-level fluctuations (emersions and floods, which can be very rapid in a salina basin), fluctuations in the average pycnocline level, aeolian dust or ash falls, accretion of specific gypsum microbialites, produced sets of marker beds which are perfectly correlated over distances of tens to hundreds of kilometres. Some thin grass-like selenite beds, representing deposits of shallow flat-bottomed saline pans, were correlated precisely over such great distances and are interpreted as isochronous or near-isochronous. Each bed was presumably deposited during the average pycnocline level highstands in the saline pan. The thick-bedded selenite units do not show long-distance bed-by-bed correlation, presumably because they were deposited in deeper pans in which the pycnocline fluctuations were recorded by bedding planes (i.e. by intercalations of fine-grained gypsum or dissolution surfaces) only on the shallow slopes or swells. However some apparent growth zones in the gypsum crystals from such selenite units were correlated throughout the basin, proving that the selenite growth was isochronous.",

Spatially, they are related to the position of well-known base metal occurrences the Kupferschiefer type. In the areas of ore grade mineralization an inorganic oxidation effect of soluble organic material has been recognized. Base metal content and degree of oxidation expressed by a ratio of phenanthrene to the sum of metylphenanthrene (Ph/ΣMePh) increases and then decreases towards the epigenetic Rote Faule facies. This suggests that ascending, low-temperature and oxidized ore-bearing solutions were responsible for the enrichment of the Kupferschiefer bed. The Kupferschiefer, acting as a geochemical hydrogen-sulphide screen, was a site of the redox type reactions that resulted in base metal reduction (precipitation) and hydrocarbon oxidation within this Upper Permian (Zechstein) bed.",

Taxonomically more varied are the faunas from Mangyshlak (15 species in 6 genera); the Opole assemblages comprise 9 species in 3 genera. One species, Micraster ( Micraster ) praerogalae , a transitional form between Micraster ( Micraster ) cortestudinarium  (GOLDFUSS) and Micraster ( Micraster ) rogalae NOWAK, is described as new. Micraster ( Micraster ) rogalae is markedly diachronous within the North European Province, first appearing in the late Coniacian in Mangyshlak and reaching central and western Europe during the late Early Santonian. A similar pattern is revealed by a large morphotype of Echinocorys ex gr. scutata LESKE. Palaeoecological and actualistic data show the taxa studied to have been shallow infaunal ( Catopygus ), shallow epifaunal [ Conulus ( Conulus ) subrotundus ], deeper infaunal [ Micraster ( Micraster )], deeper semi-infaunal [ Micraster ( Gibbaster ), Plesiocorys ( Sternotaxis ) plana ], deeper epifaunal [ Echinocorys , Plesiocorys ( Plesiocorys ) placenta ], and deeper infaunal ( Hemiaster ). Echinoid bioevents described originally from the Salzgitter-Salder section (Lower Saxony, Germany) can also be recognised in the Opole area, but not further afield in Mangyshlak.",

    "abstract": "The northern part of theWestern Carpathians suffered polyphase deformation at the boundary between their Central and Outer parts. Palaeostress analysis in the Orava region revealed the existence of five different stress fields in the period from the Late Eocene to the Quaternary. The evolution of the stress fields was determined by detailed structural analysis of the fault slip and fold orientation data. The orientation of the stress fields shows an apparent clockwise rotation from the Late Eocene to the Quaternary. During the Late Eocene to Oligocene, E–W compression and perpendicular tension affected this area. This was the time when the Central Carpathian Palaeogene Basin formed.After this compression, the palaeostress field rotated approximately 40–50°, and NW– SE compression and NE–SWtension took place in the EarlyMiocene. TheMiddleMiocene to Pliocene was characterised by progressive rotation of the palaeostress field from NW–SE to the NE–SW direction of the maximum principal compressional stress axis (σ 1 ). This clockwise rotation of the Oligocene to Quaternary palaeostress fields here is explained by the effect of the counterclockwise rotation of theALCAPAmicroplate, and by the regional stress field changes in this region. The Quaternary stress field was reconstructed on the basis of structural measurements in the Pliocene sedimentary formations of the Orava–Nowy Targ Basin. The results of the palaeostress analysis show that the Quaternary stress field is characterised by E–W-oriented S h (minimum horizontal compression) and N–S-oriented S H (maximum horizontal compression).",

The trilobites in the queues appear almost intact, having been preserved in the position they kept when forming the queues, and are interpreted showing migratory behaviour known in various present-day arthropods, but unreported from the fossil state. This queuing was induced by environmental stress caused by a dramatic drop in sea level, temporarily leading to emersion. The preservation of the queues at omission horizons is thus ascribed to a mass mortality event, caused by subaerial exposure. The trilobites were suffocated and fossilized in a mortal spasm, and finally blanketed by calcareous ooze when inundated at a highstand.

    "abstract": "Based on lithofacies analysis of clastic, clay and carbonate rocks, wireline logs and sequence stratigraphy, sixteen depositional sequences have been distinguished in the paralic Carboniferous succession of the Lublin Basin from the Visean to the base of Westphalian B. The facies evolution and depositional architecture of the deposits belonging to three types of depositional systems tracts, i.e. lowstand (LST), transgressive (TST) and highstand (HST) have been reconstructed. The sequences are bounded by type 1 basal unconformities formed during subaerial erosion following relative sea-level fall and lowstand. This erosion, that in some cases reached down to the LST deposits of the underlying sequences, mainly affected the HST deposits. Relative sea-level rise controlling the base level of the rivers during lowstand was the basic factor influencing facies development, cyclicity and thickness of fluvial deposits, as well as the vertical and lateral transformation of rivers in the paralic Carboniferous succession. Vertical transition of high- to low-energy fluvial environments can be observed within the LST. The LST deposits typically occur in incised shelf valleys and in non-incised fluvial systems. Within the LST of sequences 2 and 4 to 10 commonly occur medium and large systems of simple incised valleys that developed in a coastal-plain system. The LST of sequences 11 to 15 comprises large systems of compound incised valleys that developed in a piedmont system. Relative sealevel rise in the late lowstand, sea-level oscillations during transgression and highstand and the volume of sediment supply were the main factors influencing facies development, cyclicity, thickness and lateral distribution of the deltaic deposits, shallow-shelf shales and limestones. Within the TST commonly occur coarsening-upward and non-gradational cyclothems that correspond to parasequences and were formed in the distal parts of the inner-shelf delta lobes. In the HST, the most common types are coarsening-upward cyclothems developed during the progradation of innershelf delta lobes and small lake deltas, as well as non-gradational cyclothems formed in lakes on a delta plain without influence of delta lobes. The transgression of sequence 7 probably had the widest extent of all the sequences in the paralic Carboniferous succession of the Lublin Basin. It was presumably much wider to the N, NE and NW than the presently accepted boundaries of the basin. Based on analysis of three curves of relative sea-level changes in the paralic Carboniferous succession of the Lublin Basin and the transgressive-regressive curve for the Carboniferous of Western Europe, the sequences distinguished have been correlated with the chronostratigraphic scheme for the Carboniferous System. The diachronous commencement of sedimentation has been confirmed and evaluated. The lack of deposits of sequence 5 in the eastern part of the basin suggests the presence of a stratigraphic gap encompassing the upper Brigantian. The position and range of stratigraphic gaps present elsewhere in the basin has also been indicated. In the north-westernmost and easternmost parts of the study area the gap has the widest range, encompassing the upper Arnsbergian to lower Marsdenian strata. The mid-Carboniferous boundary between the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian has been located at the base of sequence 8.",

The mantelliceratines were collected from lower Cenomanian silty shales while the rest of the fauna stems from lower middle Cenomanian glauconitic sandstones in the upper part of the formation. the ammonite association allows recognition of the lower lower Cenomanian  Mantelliceras mantelli and the lower middle Cenomanian Acanthoceras rhotomagense zones. the upper lower Cenomanian M. dixoni Zone is not proven by its index but is most likely represented by a unit of fossil-poor shales intercalated between the two above-mentioned zones. the lowermost middle Cenomanian Cunningtoniceras inerme Zone, however, is potentially at least partly missing due to a major sea-level fall and lowstand in the latest Early to earliest middle Cenomanian. A preliminary sequence stratigraphic interpretation of the successions suggests the presence of lower Cenomanian sequence boundaries sb Ce 1–3. The Aitamir Formation is truncated along a major regional unconformity at the base of the overlying Abderaz Formation (Turonian–Coniacian). The upper Cenomanian and most likely also (parts of) the lower Turonian are missing. This major unconformity has a tectonic origin as it deviates from the eustatic sea-level trend which was very high at this time. Furthermore, contemporaneous tectonic unconformities are also known from Central Iran and may have their origins in rotational movements of the Central-East Iranian microcontinent.",

Calcite cements and the stratigraphical significance of the marine δ 13 C carbonate reference curve for the Upper Cretaceous Chalk of England. Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (2), 173-196. Warszawa. The hypothesis of Jarvis et al. (2006) that a δ 13 C (calcite) reference curve based upon bulk samples from the Upper Cretaceous Chalk of England can be used as a primary criterion for trans-continental correlation is reviewed in the light of new stable isotope data from the Upper Albian and Cenomanian chalks of eastern England and from the Cenomanian to Campanian chalks of southern England. Evidence demonstrates that in the coloured chalks of eastern England the cements invariably have positive δ 13 C values (up to 3.5‰) except where they have been affected by hardground development when the cements have negative δ 13 C values down to -6.5‰. In contrast, the White Chalk of southern England may have cements with δ 13 C values as negative as -8‰. Modelling indicates that the coloured chalks may preserve a truer record of the primary palaeo-oceanographic δ 13 C signal than the white and grey chalks of southern England. It is suggested that (1) many of the 72 isotope events described from the δ 13 C (calcite) reference curve and proposed for correlation may reflect the effects of variations in the type and extent of calcite cementation; and (2) until much more is known about the patterns of calcite cementation in the Upper Cretaceous Chalk the use of minor isotope events for trans-continental stratigraphic correlation can only be applied with the utmost caution.",

New ammonite faunas consisting of 13 taxa provide the first reliable biostratigraphic dating of the Debarsu Formation of the Yazd Block, west-central Iran, indicating several levels in the Upper Albian and Lower Cenomanian, while a foraminiferal assemblage places the top of the Formation in the Middle Turonian. Among the identified ammonite taxa, Acompsoceras renevieri (Sharpe, 1857) is recorded from Iran for the first time. The upper part of the lower Upper Albian is proved by the occurrences of mortoniceratines of the Mortoniceras (M.) inflatum Zone in the lowermost part of the Debarsu Formation. For the upper Upper Albian (traditional Stoliczkaia dispar Zone), the M. (Subschloenbachia ) rostratum and M. (S.) perinflatum zones are proved by their index taxa. However, there is no evidence of the terminal Arrhaphoceras (Praeschloenbachia) briacensis Zone. The upper part of the lower Lower Cenomanian Mantelliceras mantelli Zone (M. saxbii Subzone) is proved by M. saxbii and M. cf. mantelli. Below, there is an ammonite- barren interval of ca. 100 m in thickness between M. (S.) perinflatum zonal strata and the M. saxbii Subzone. The upper Lower Cenomanian is documented by the presence of typically M. dixoni zonal ammonites such as Acompsoceras renevieri. Upper Cenomanian and Turonian ammonites have not been found in the upper part of the Debarsu Formation, but micro-biostratigraphic evidence (planktonic foraminifers) from the uppermost part of the formation indicate that the formation ranges into the Turonian. For the development of the major tectonic unconformity at the base of the overlying Haftoman Formation (which yielded Lower Coniacian inoceramids near its base), only 2-3 myr remain, stressing the geodynamic activity of Central Iran during mid-Cretaceous times.",

The chronostratigraphy is based on inoceramid biostratigraphy.

The basinal unit of the 119 m thick succession includes thin red pelagic limestone interlayers and conglomerates dominated by volcanic clasts. The overlying upper slope and lower slope units of the sequence consist of an alternation of allochthonous calcarenite/calcirudite beds and pelagic marls and mudstones. Calcarenite/calcirudite beds dominate the upper slope unit of the succession and are composed of transported material, including benthic foraminifers, red algae, bryozoan, crinoid and rudist fragments, inoceramid bivalve prisms and neritic and pelagic carbonate lithoclasts. The occurrence of Helicorbitoides boluensis (Sirel) extracted from the calcarenite/calcirudite beds indicates a Campanian age. Identifiable rudists such as Joufia reticulata Boehm, Bournonia cf. anatolica Ozer, Biradiolites cf. bulgaricus Pamouktchiev and ?Biradiolites sp. from the upper slope unit of the succession indicate a late Campanian- Maastrichtian age. The planktonic foraminifers within the red pelagic limestone beds, marls and mudstones throughout the succession consist mainly of Campanian-Maastrichtian forms and suggest mainly basinal depositional conditions. The presence of Radotruncana cf. calcarata (Cushman) accompanied by Globotruncanita elevata (Brotzen) in the basinal unit of the succession indicates an early late Campanian age for the lower part of the succession. Inoceramid bivalves have been collected from the upper part of the succession. The fauna is dominated by ‘Inoceramus’ tenuilineatus Hall and Meek, 1854 and Cataceramus haldemensis (Giers, 1964); other taxa recognised are: ‘Inoceramus’ algeriensis Heinz, 1932, Platyceramus vanuxemi (Meek and Hayden, 1860), ‘Inoceramus’ cf. nebrascensis Owen, 1852, Cataceramus aff. barabini (Morton, 1834), Cataceramus gandjaensis (Aliev, 1956), and ‘Inoceramus’ sp.; the assemblage indicates the ‘Inoceramus’ tenuilineatus Zone; corresponding to the middle-late Campanian boundary interval. The uppermost part of the succession is characterized by the presence of the trace fossils Scolicia strozzii and Scolicia isp., indicating a mixed Skolithos-Cruziana ichnofacies. This ichnofacies suggests a well-oxygenated environment.",

Abrupt transitions from an impoverished polygnathid to polygnathid-ancyrodellid (frequently enriched in Polygnathus? dengleri ) to that of diverse pelagic polygnathid-mesotaxid (or icriodontid) biofacies, were a response to pulsatory eustatic rises. A sequence of early Ancyrodella species, crucial for recognition of the Middle/Upper Devonian boundary, is established at Wietrznia and Czarnow sections; in particular, a phyletic succession in the Wietrznia-I profile permits subdivision of the Mesotaxis falsiovalis Zone into at least 3 Ancyrodella levels of global correlation potential. Need of quantitative study of the early ancyrodellid variability, and revision of the series boundary-point in the global stratotype are emphasized, as well as complex ecologic provenances of ancyrodellids.

Two new chronosubspecies, Perisphinctes ouatius ouatoides and Perisphinctes arkelli wysokae of the subgenus Otosphinctes , are distinguished.

These echinoids represent a new species, Echinocardium leopolitanum sp.nov., and are assumed to have had a similar mode of life as the extant, cosmopolitan species E. cordatum (PENNANT, 1777), i.e. relatively deep burrowing and confined to the sublittoral. Violent storms and/or storm-generated currents are held responsible for stirring up the sand and for bringing live specimens, of all ontogenetic stages, to the surface upon which followed deposition of a heavy-loaded sediment from which they could not escape. Thus, specimens are interpreted to have been buried alive, with all spines attached. Mass aggregation of tests occured either in patches laid down in vortical flutes on the current-swept seafloor, or within tabular scrolls of cross-bedded strata where they are locally imbricated. A functional analysis of the spines of Echinocardium leopolitanum sp.nov., and primarily of the large, triangular fan of plastron spines, suggests specimens to have been adapted to rapid burrowing throughout a weakly coherent and nutrient-poor sandy bottom. Ascribed to Echinocardium leopolitanum sp.nov. burrows, whose structure is comparable to, if not identical with, those of other Echinocardium species. The taxonomic potential of such burrows is discussed and it is suggested that names applied recently in ichnological analyses are in need of a modern revision.",

Fourteen taxa are described belonging to 12 genera: Glomerula Brunnich Nielsen, 1931, sensu Regenhardt, 1961; Cementula Brunnich Nielsen, 1931, sensu Regenhardt, 1961; Ditrupula Brunnich Nielsen, 1931, sensu Howell, 1962; Filogranula Langerhans, 1884; Laqueoserpula Lommerzheim, 1979; Metavermilia Bush, 1904; Mucroserpula Regenhardt, 1961; Neovermilia Day, 1961; Pannoserpula Jager, Kapitzke & Rieter, 2001; Pursimonia Regenhardt, 1961; Placostegus Philippi, 1844; Serpula Linnaeus, 1758. Only very few, or no representatives of these genera have formerly been reported from the Jurassic of Poland. Five species are established as new: Ditrupula meandrica sp.nov., Laqueoserpula intumescens sp.nov., Mucroserpula jaegeri sp.nov., Pannoserpula couiaviana sp.nov., Placostegus conchophilus sp.nov. The ecology of this assemblage, which comprises typically epizoans of sponges, and of brachiopods upon whose shells they often formed 'serpulid gardens', is discussed. In the case of the brachiopods, live specimens were favoured, to which the tube-dwelling polychaetes became commensals located preferably on their ventral valves. Some of the polychaetes had their own commensal, the hydroid Protulophila gestroi Rovereto, 1901, whose stolonal network was embedded in their tubes. The lithology of the source deposits indicates their transport by storm agitation and/or mass movements. Concequently, rapid burial affected all biota, including the living brachiopods, some of which were bearing living polychaetes.",

The youngest deposits of the Mszana Dolna tectonic window are correlated with zone NP24 (Dukla Unit) and NP23-NP25 (Grybow Unit). In the Szczawa tectonic window (Grybow Unit), the NP22-NP24 Zone was determined in the Grybow Beds, whereas the Cergowa Beds belong to zone NP24. Such age determination corresponds well with that of the southern part of the Silesian and Dukla units. The deposits of the Dukla and Grybow units are tectonically covered by the Cretaceous-Eocene deposits of the Magura Nappe.During the latest Oligocene a thrusting of the Magura Nappe onto the Fore-Magura sedimentary basin began (Grybow and Dukla). This process was probably initiated under the submarine condition. The last of the over thrusting stages took place probably during the Middle Miocene, and resulted in the development of the Mszana-Dolna duplex structure.",

To this end, the hermeneutic method has been employed, which begins with a pre-understanding of a natural phenomenon, then proceeds with data analysis, thus leading to improved understanding, etc. Three large bulk samples have been analysed, each of them consisting of two spatially adjacent subsamples; these samples cover much of the paleosynecological variability discovered previously in the Korytnica Clays. Sample representativeness analysis did not reject the null hypothesis of subsample identity (and hence sample representativeness) in two of three considered samples; for the third one, its subsamples have been consequently analysed separately from each other. Taphonomic analysis focused on the preservation condition of mollusk shells, left-to-right valve ratio among mollusks, bivalve articulation and gastropod preservation, scaphopod preservation, and size-frequency distribution of a number of species. This analysis leads to the conclusion that fossils experienced only local post-mortem transportation, virtually no chemical dissolution, and very little time-averaging, except for the one nonrepresentative sample. Fossil fragmentation is mostly due to compaction. Prey analysis has largely focused on the bivalve Corbula gibba and the gastropod Nassa hoernesi, which has been commonly drilled. Predator analysis concerned both naticid and muricid gastropods. Quantitatively, prey-size preference by the predators, drillhole location distributions, and predation efficiency have been studied, whereas some other questions, such as the preference hierarchy of prey species by the predators could be addressed only qualitatively. Beyond the conclusions concerning the fossil assemblage of the Korytnica Clays, the study also points to the inevitable limitations of qualitative paleoecological inference.",

A review of formerly reported cysts of coeval age from Europe and western Asia permits the distinguishing of several types that differ in shape and/or location on the echinoderm skeleton. Although the studied cysts qualify as trace fossils (which require a separate ichnotaxonomy), their ethological and ecological characteristics are presented in terms of interspecific parasite-host relationships. The classical interpretation of VON GRAFF (1885) is affirmed for myzostomidan endocysts in crinoid stems, whereas for echinoid tests a new interpretation is offered for large exocysts ('Halloween pumpkin-mask' type) as having been induced by copepods, comparable in their ethology to those on prcscnt-day biota (hydrocorals) other than echinoderms. A copepod attribution by MERCIER (1936) of cysts ( Castexia type) on some Middle Jurassic collyritid echinoids from France is fully accepted. This is supplemented by some new finds in Poland, a re-study of the Castexia cysts from France, and a re-interpretation of former reports from the literature. Eco-ethological consequences of the location of copepods in the ambulacral and peristomial parts of cidaroid and hemicidaroid echinoids are discussed; larval settling apparently took place at the tubefeet pores and gonopores, through which the copepod larvae reached the echinoid's interior and began to parasitize it. Attribution of the discussed cysts to copepods yields, consequently, an extension of the stratigraphical range of the class Copepoda H. MILNE-EDWARDS, 1840, to the Early Jurassic.  In POSTSCRIPT, suggested is the bald-sea-urchin disease to have caused some lesions in the collyritid echinoids (Middle Jurassic: Callovian) from France.",

Its complex structure is dominated by algal buildups composed of interfingering red-algal (lithothamnian) colonies and blue-green-algal crusts, associated locally with numerous hermatypic corals ( Tarbellastraea reussiana , Porites vindobonarum prima ), either isolated, or overlapping each other. The holes amidst, and the crevices in, the buildups are filled with coarse bioclastic sediment (shell-grit), burrowed commonly by crustacean decapods (alpheid shrimps). The alpheid burrows, filled with coarser or finer shell-grit, served frequently as taphonomic traps for crustacean decapods (squat lobsters and crabs) and echinoids. Special attention is paid to the activity of rock-boring bivalves ( Jouannetia semicaudata , Lithophaga lithophaga ) in coralgal buildups and/or in particular coral colonies, some of which are redeposited, and riddled densely by bivalve borings. Emphasis is given to the environmental significance of alpheid shrimps, the tiered burrows of which are recorded in the Fore-Carpathian Basin for the first time. Crustacean decapods and echinoids are systematically studied. A comparison of the studied coralgal facies with others of the Lviv-Ternopil region, and those from the territory of Poland, indicates their faunistic and biogeographic identity.",

One shows the predominance of species preferring moist, meadow and poorly wooded environments, the other contains the species inhabiting a variety of environments, including snails thriving in shaded habitats. Tufas and travertines were deposited on flat valley floors, in the midst of moist and watery meadows, brushwood and forests, as well as in water basins.

    "abstract": "Sierra de los Organos, western part of the Cordillera de Guaniguanico, Cuba, have been formed at Middle Eocene time, the nppes being transported northwards. Their tectonic style can be characterized by differential displacement of the rook masses forming ultimately partial nappes; subsequent structural inversion of the tectonic units relative to their original position; and zonation of tectonic deformations. Three lineation types have been recognized, representing different deformation phases. The oldest lineation type occurs within metamorphosed units. It may be related to metamorphic processes acting previously to the nappe overthrusting toward the north. The main lineation occurs in all tectonic units and resulted from the main overthrusting phase. The youngest lineation has originated after the main orogenic phase. Among small folds, the northerly displacements occur most commonly although southerly ones prevail in the Alturas de Pizarras del Norte. Nappe-scale units of the Sierra de los Organos reveal features of gravitation structures. Serpentinites and ultrabasic rocks present within the melange zones solid gravitationally down at the final stage of wildflysch sedimentation. They came from another facies-structural zone. Sedimentary basin of the Sierra de los Organos represented the southern part of Cuban orthogeosyncline, south to Zaza eugeosynclinal zone. During the main orogenic phase, tectonic units of the Sierra de los Organos were thrust over Zaza zone which may have been already folded during the Late Cretaceous or at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. A subduction zone occurred probably in the southern part of leptogeosyncline and the northern part of Cuban eugeosyncline. Rotations and displacements along the Caribbean faults have resulted from differential displacements of the North and South American continents toward the west.",

The 2.5 km thick succession, defined here as the Nowa Slupia Group, has been subdivided into 9 formations (from bottom to top: Trzcianka, Trochowiny, Winnica / Rachtanka, Sarnia Zwola / Bronkowice, Podchelmie, Rudki and Bostow formations).

The lower part of the Nowa Slupia Group (Trzcianka and Trochowiny formations) represents the underfilled stage of the basin development and is composed of flysch-like sediments. The upper part of the group represents the filled to overfilled stage of the basin. In the latter stage the lateral migration of two main facies: red continental deposits (represented by the Rachtanka and Podchelmie formations) and open shelf hemipelagic sediments (represented by the Sarnia Zwola and Rudki formations and referred here to the Podlasie facies), is observed. The lateral facies migrations probably resulted fromeustatic fluctuations. The twomain facies zones are separated by a narrowbelt of neritic sediments (represented by the Winnica, Bronkowice and Bostow formations), which are known for their rich benthic fauna. The facies trends observed show that during the latest Ludlovian through early Pridolian, the boundary between the continental and marine facies in the Łysogory Region was oriented parallel to the Baltica margin (NNW-SSE).",

Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) ore-bearing clays at Gnaszyn, Krakow-Silesia Homocline, Poland. Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (3), 463-484. Warszawa. Multidisciplinary studies of the Middle-Upper Bathonian ore-bearing clays at Gnaszyn revealed variable palaeoenvironmental conditions during the deposition of this seemingly monotonous sequence. We interpret the conditions in the bottom environment and the photic zone, and also evaluate the influence of the adjacent land areas, based on sedimentology, geochemistry, sporomorphs and palynofacies composition, benthic (foraminifera, gastropods, bivalves, scaphopods, echinoderms), planktonic (calcareous nannoplankton, dinoflagellate cysts), and nektonic (sharks) fossils. The Gnaszyn succession originated relatively close to the shore, within reach of an intense supply of terrestrial fine clastic and organic particles. The latter are mainly of terrestrial origin and range from 1.5 to 2.5 wt.%. The precise water depth is difficult to estimate but most likely ranges from several tens of metres to a few hundred metres. All fossil groups show minor changes throughout the succession. As the climate seems to have been quite stable during this period we consider sea-level fluctuations to have been the main factor responsible for the changes. The terrestrial input, including freshwater and land-derived clastic and organic particles (sporomorphs and cuticles), increased during periods of sea-level lowstand. As a consequence, stress conditions (lower salinity, higher nutrient availability, lower water transparency) in the photic zone caused blooms of opportunistic planktonic taxa. Furthermore, a faster sedimentation rate led to oxygen depletion and deterioration of the living conditions in the bottom environment due to an increased accumulation of organic matter. As a result, the benthic biota became taxonomically impoverished and commonly dominated by juvenile forms. During periods of high sea level, the source areas were shifted away from the basin, resulting in a decrease in the terrestrial influx, increase in the salinity of surface waters, the appearance of more diverse phytoplankton assemblages, a lower sedimentation rate, and an improvement of living conditions at the bottom.",

Early Aptian bay deposits at the southern margin of the lower Saxony Basin: Integrated stratigraphy, palaeoenvironment and OAE 1a. Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (1), 35-62. Warszawa. The present study establishes a lithostratigraphic subdivision, a bio- and chemostratigraphy and describes the sedimentology of the Alstatte Bay at the southern margin of the Lower Saxony Basin in northern Germany. The socalled Fischschiefer is developed in the lower part of the section, a 2.1 m thick laminated interval that shows TOC values of up to 2 % and is interpreted as local expression of the global Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE 1a). The basal part of the Fischschiefer is fairly continuously laminated, whereas its upper part is characterized by an alternation of laminated and non-laminated beds. Stable carbon isotopes (δ13 C carb ) show a characteristic pattern for the Fischschiefer interval that can be correlated with sections from the Tethyan Realm. Immediately above the Fischschiefer, however, the studied section might reveal a diagenetic overprint as indicated by very negative carbon stable isotope values. The remaining part of the section is characterized by a rather monotonous claystone succession, terminated by a greenish layer rich in glauconite overlain by glacial till of Pleistocene age. The fauna is typically Boreal in the lower part of the section, but changes around 2 m above the Fischschiefer towards an assemblage indicating a distinct Tethyan influx. The faunal shift is considered to be due to the maximum flooding of the continuous, long-term sea level rise of the Early Aptian which led also to a supposed shift from a restricted to open bay environment.",

They are associated with dinosaur bones and freshwater ostracod assemblages that suggest a Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) age. This is the first detailed systematic account of charophyte gyrogonites from the Lameta Formation. This charophyte assemblage is compatible with the biostratigraphic attribution provided by the ostracods. From a biogeographic viewpoint, it exhibits considerable similarity to other infratrappean assemblages of the Nand, Dongargaon, and Dhamni-Pavna sections (Maharashtra), and some intertrappean assemblages of Kora in Gujarat, Rangapur in Andhra Pradesh and Gurmatkal in South India. Globally, the genus Microchara is well distributed throughout Eurasia, whereas the genus Platychara occurs richly in the Upper Cretaceous deposits of Europe, Asia, America and Africa. However, at the specific level, Platychara cf. sahnii shows close affinities with charophytes from the Maastrichtian of Iran whilst Nemegtichara grambastii shows distinct affinities with two species of Early Palaeogene deposits of China and Mongolia. The presence of charophyte gyrogonites in the Lameta sediments is attributed to local lacustrine and palustrine conditions within a flood plain environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Early Triassic witnessed the highest taxic diversity of coelacanths (or Actinistia), a clade with a single living genus today. This peak of diversity is accentuated here with the description of a new coelacanth discovered in the lower Spathian (Upper Olenekian, Lower Triassic) cropping out in the Tulcea Veche (Old Tulcea) promontory, in the city of Tulcea, in North Dobrogea, Romania. The bone remains were preserved in a block of limestone, which was chemically dissolved. The resulting 3D and matrix-free ossifications correspond mostly to elements of the skull and branchial apparatus. Posterior parietals, postparietal with associated prootic and basisphenoid allow a precise description of the neurocranium. Ossifications of the lower jaw, together with branchial and pectoral elements, complete the description of this coelacanth and support the coining of a new generic and specific name, Dobrogeria aegyssensis. A phylogenetic analysis of actinistians with the new species recovers clades which were found in most recent analyses, i.e. the Sasseniidae, the Laugiidae, the Coelacanthiformes, the Latimerioidei, the Mawsoniidae and the Latimeriidae, and identifies the new taxon as a non-latimerioid coelacanthiform.",

    "abstract": "The lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy, ammonite and inoceramid faunas of the Upper Albian, Cenomanian, and Lower Turonian Karai Formation, the highest unit of the Uttatur Group in the Pondicherry Sub-Basin of the Cauvery Basin in Tamil Nadu, south India, are documented. Detailed logs and descriptions of sections between Karai and Kulakkalnattam, Odiyam and Kunnam, and north-west of Garudamangalam are presented. They provide the evidence for an ammonite zonal scheme that can be correlated in detail with sequences developed in Europe, with successive Upper Albian zones of Pervinquieria (Subschloenbachia) rostrata and P. (S.) perinflata (the latter on slight evidence), Cenomanian zones of Mantelliceras mantelli, Cunningtoniceras cunningtoni, Calycoceras (Newboldiceras) asiaticum, Pseudo calycoceras harpax, Euomphaloceras septemseriatum and Pseudspidoceras footeanum. The Lower Turonian is represented by a Neoptychites cephalotus–Mytiloides borkari fauna. Over 120 ammonite species are described, of which Puzosia (Bhimaites) falx, Protacanthoceras parva, Watinoceras elegans, Euomphaloceras varicostatum, Kamerunoceras multinodosum, and Carthaginites multituberculatus are new. The new genus Kunnamiceras, with Ammonites tropicus Kossmat, 1865 as type species, is interpreted as a paedomorphic dwarf derivative of Pseudocalycoceras harpax (Stoliczka, 1864). Ammonite faunas from shales are dominated by feebly-ornamented taxa: leiostraca; those from sandstones by strongly ornamented taxa: trachyostraca, differences interpreted as reflecting the preferred habits of adults in life. 15 species of inoceramid bivalves, including a newly described species Inoceramus chiplonkari, are recognised, with a mixed East African–Euramerican–North Pacific affinity. On the basis of the stratigraphic framework developed, a sequence stratigraphic interpretation of the Karai Formation is proposed, and correlated with those recognised in Europe, Morocco, and the United States Gulf Coast and Western Interior.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The occurrence of rich Albian ammonite faunas in what is now northern Pakistan has been known for more than 80 years, but there has been no comprehensive account of the assemblages present. A total of 36 taxa are described below. The middle part of the Lumshiwal Formation yields Upper Aptian ammonites south of the Samana Range. Elsewhere, it yields Douvilleiceras leightonense Casey, 1962, of the lower Lower Albian Leymeriella regularis Zone and the Sonneratia perinflata and S. kitchini Subzones of the Sonneratia chalensis Zone of the northwest European sequence. The top one to two metres of the Lumshiwal yields an abundant fauna of rolled and phosphatised ammonites that includes elements from much of the Albian. Of these, Prolyelliceras gevreyi (Jacob, 1907) first appears in the lower Lower Albian Leymeriella tardefurcata Zone. The commonest ammonite is Douvilleiceras mammillatum (Schlotheim, 1813) sensu lato, which ranges from the perinflata Subzone of the chalensis Zone to the Otohoplites bulliensis Subzone of the O. auritiformis Zone of the Lower Albian. The presence of Lyelliceras pseudolyelli (Parona and Bonarelli, 1897) indicates the uppermost, pseudolyelli Subzone of the auritiformis Zone. The presence of Lyelliceras lyelli (d’Orbigny, 1841) indicates the basal Middle Albian lyelli Subzone of the Hoplites dentatus Zone. There is no evidence for the higher parts of the Middle Albian. Dipoloceras (Rhytidoceras ) sp. indicates the presence of lower Upper Albian, possibly the pricei Zone. There is evidence, in the form of specifically indeterminate Mortoniceras (Mortoniceras) sp., of a level within the inflatum to fallax Zone inteval from a single locality, but no evidence of the succeeding parts of the upper Upper Albian. The base of the Kawagarth Formation that succeeds the Lumshiwal yields lower Upper Albian Mortoniceras (M.) geometricum Spath, 1932 of the Mortoniceras pricei Zone, northwest of Darmasand in the Samana range.",

Significant results relate the introduction of Lopeziceras gen. nov., grouping himalayitid-like forms with two rows of tubercles, and Praedalmasiceras gen. nov., grouping the early Berriasian Dalmasiceras taxa. Study of the ontogenetic sequences of both genera show that they were derived from late Tithonian Himalayitidae.

The stratigraphic position of the Amoeboceras Layer (MATYJA & WIERZBOWSKI 1988) has been partly revised: it lies in the litocerum horizon of the Hauffianum Subzone of the Bimammatum Zone. The layer marks a short-time invasion of the Boreal/Subboreal ammonites into the Submediterranean Province, including such forms described previously as Amoeboceras ( Plasmatites ) bauhini (OPPEL), A . ( P .) praebauhini (SALFELD), and A . ( P .) lineatum (QUENSTEDT), as well as the recently discovered Pictonia densicostata BUCKMAN and Prorasenia bowerbanki SPATH. The presence of these ammonites, and especially of P. densicostata , shows that the lower boundary of the Subboreal Kimmeridgian corresponding to the base of the Baylei Zone, lies not higher than the litocerum horizon of the Hauffianum Subzone in the Submediterranean Succession; in fact, it may lie still lower, somewhere between an upper Bimammatum Subzone and a lower Hauffianum Subzone of the Bimammatum Zone. Precise location of the lower boundary of the Submediterranean Kimmeridgian, corresponding to the base of the Platynota Zone, is not possible in the Subboreal Succession; that boundary in the Boreal Succession lies at the base of the Kitchini Zone.

These communities are indicative of a spectrum facies that ranges from near-shore ones, confirmed either to rocky (Korytnica) or to flat sandy shores (Nawodzice, Niskowa), through the variable offshore facies (Rybnica, Łychow), to those approaching a deep neritic or even bathyal zone (Beczyn).

The richest numerically and most taxonomically assemblage is that of the world-famous Korytnica Basin which contains 105 taxa belonging to 47 families. A comparison with ololiths of the present-day fishes (NOLF'S Collection) allowed to revise a number of taxa of ancient forms, and to recognize the presence of some forms formerly unknown from the fossil state. Of the revised taxa, noticeable is the well-known species  Gadus  vel  Colliolus  friedbergi , established the Polish material by CHAINE & DUVERGIER in 1928, and which revealed to be identical with Trisopterus sculptus (KOKEN, 1891). Moreover, highlighted is the occurrence species indicative of tropical and/or subtropical climatic conditions and of the lndo-Pacific bioprovince affinitties.

The inoceramid record at Slupia Nadbrzezna below the terminal Turonian entry of Cremnoceramus is shown to be more complete than at the standard Salzgitter-Salder Quarry section. A new inoceramid event ( Inoceramus lusatiae Event) identified at Slupia Nadbrzezna is inferred to be present at the Sonnenberg Quarry, Waltersdorf, the type locality of Inoceramus lusatiae , as well as of I. glatziae and  Cremnoceramus waltersdorfensis , and it is possibly represented in the condensed Navigation Hardgrounds in southern England. The absence of this event at Salzgitter-Salder suggests a significant hiatus. An inoceramid assemblage characterised by a taxon of uncertain affinities that immediately precedes the flood occurrence of Cremnoceramus ( waltersdorfensis 1 Event) at Salzgitter-Salder has been identified at a comparable biostratigraphic position in eastern England (Yorkshire) and, tentatively, also in southern England.

A biometrical computer analysis was used in order to solve the systematical problems of the species concept. The test shape and chamber development of the investigated species, taking in consideration relevant Recent species, demonstrated the phylogenetic relations and the differences between the species in question. Two main groups can be separated immediately. The first includes the species Amphistegina mammilla (FICHTEL & MOLL), A. hauerina D'ORBIGNY, and A. radiata (FICHTEL & MOLL), and is represented in the Miocene by only one species, namely A. mammilla. The Indo-Pacilic origin of this fauna is proved by the close relation with A. radiata. The Amphistegina lessonii D'ORBIGNY- species group is shown to have been represented by an independent species in the European Miocene, by Amphistegina bohdanowiczi BIEDA. It inhabited the Central Paratethys from the early Miocene to the early Badenian. The Miocene forms were generally dextrally coiling. The existence of a subtropical climate during the Middle Miocene in Central Europe is supported. By means of the Amphistegina assemblages a biostratigraphic determination of the Korytnica Clays as early Badenian (corresponding the Lower Lagenidae Zone) was possible.

    "abstract": "Living corals are remarkably broad in their thermal and bathymetric ranges. But corals that could tolerate abnormally high temperatures (higher than 40°C) are unknown both in the living communities and in the fossil record. Here we report the discovery of small thermophilic rugose corals in the Devonian vent community of southeastern Morocco. These organisms were adapted to conditions prevailing within chimney conduits of a hydrothermal system that developed on the roof of a submarine volcanic high. The coral larvae followed a calice-in-calice settlement and growth strategy to survive the contact with thermal fluids. This adaptation was not related to taxonomy and characteristic of all coral taxa present in the vents. Monospecific coral population was identified in several Emsian vents whereas the coral fauna of the single Givetian vent was more diverse and included four species. The entry of different rugose coral species into the hot vents resulted from a trophic relation to ostracods flourishing in the chimneys.",

Mineral phases that are the source of silica solute were pointed out on bedrock mineralogy and saturation state analysis. Interpretation of aqueous chemistry in terms of mineral stability confirms that partial geochemical equilibrium is maintained. In groundwater with pH values below 4.8 from the fissured aquifer in Carboniferous siliciclastic rocks, kaolinite controls silica solubility. Congruent dissolution of the allophane phase and/or incongruent reaction between the Al(OH) 3 form and kaolinite/ halloysite or allophane can be responsible for silica activity in groundwater, with pH values between 5.5 and 6.7, from the regolith on Carboniferous rocks and from the fissured aquifer in Cretaceous mudstones. Groundwaters with pH values above 6.7 occur in the Permian and Cretaceous fissured aquifers which contain calcite/dolomite minerals. Silica and aluminium concentrations in these aquifers are clearly maintained by equilibrium with the hydroxyaluminosilicate HASB. The solubility constant of HASB estimated on groundwater chemistry is lgK HASB = -44.88 (±0.48), which is lower than the recently published experimental value (SCHNEIDER & al. 2004). In groundwater with pH values between 4.8 and 5.5 from the regolith sampled during snow melt, equilibrium, even with reversible secondary aluminosilicates, is not maintained. Silicon and aluminium concentrations result from kinetics or steady-state between weathering release and hydrological removal.",

    "abstract": "Alkaline felsic magmatism represents the final phase of the late Precambrian acid magmatism in south Sinai. The studied felsic suites occur as dyke-like intrusions, exhibit features characteristic of A-type granites. There were two main cycles of magmatic activity separated by a period of magmatic quiescence, which led to a composition gap between them. The earlier cycle includes quartz syenite that represents the precursor of the A-type granite series in south Sinai, whereas the second cycle includes more felsic volcanic-subvolcanic intrusive complexes. Intrusion of the two cycles was controlled by the preexisting structure and individual igneous bodies were emplaced in an extensional tectonic regime during a phase of fracturing and uplift at the end of the Pan-African orogeny. The high variability in geochemical signature of A-type magmas in south Sinai suggests a variety of petrologic processes and reservoirs which reflects the participation of an intraplate mantle reservoir and evolved continental crust. Kenrichment in the rhyolite is a primary feature and attributed to the effect of volatiles which accumulated in the upper part of the magma chamber. In general, A-type magmas in south Sinai can be differentiated according to their magma source and tectonic setting into (1) non-primitive A-type magma (A Np ) and (2) primitive A-type magma (A p ). The non-primitive A-type magma is commonly known in Sinai as Iqna granite, which belongs to the highly fractionated, late- to post-orogenic, calc-alkaline 1- type granites. The primitive A-type magma shows within-plate geochemical characteristics and was emplaced in an anorogenic setting. It is distinguished further into: (i) a magma having characteristics indicative of OIB-mantle contribution (A 1 )' and (ii) magma derived from crustal sources (A 2 ).",

The coral encrusted only the outer shell surfaces of the ammonoids; the inner surface remained unaffected. such a Cretaceous community and the relationship between the two fossil groups are described for the first time. The shells of dead ammonoids sank to the sea bottom and became colonized by the coral larvae, as documented by the location of the epibionts on only one side of the shells. The coral was fixed to the ammonoid shell for its entire life. Only the ‘sediment free’ upper side of the ammonoid shells could be inhabited by epibionts such as corals and serpulids. The encrustation of ammonoid shells by the bivalve Placunopsis represents a different situation in that both sides of the ammonoid shells were affected, pointing to encrustation of floating ammonoids. This long-term infestation in the water column contrasts with coral settlement on the sea-floor. Ammonoid specimens encrusted by Placunopsis never exhibit encrustation by corals. The ammonoid-coral relationship from the Dolomites is documented from the Valanginian to Aptian interval. examples of coral epibionts on ammonoids and other fossil groups throughout the geological column are briefly reviewed.",

    "abstract": "The geometry and morphology of joints have been examined in the flysch rocks in the western part of the Podhale synclinorium. They form a regular network, which has been developed in several stages connected with the structural evolution of the synclinorium. The initiation of the oldest diagonal system (D R , D L sets), in the form of strength anisotropy in horizontal beds, took place during the successive increase in NNE–SSWcompression. The formation of the majority of the L’ set and of a small portion of the L set took place during gentle open folding connected with the setting of the general structural framework of the synclinorium. The beginning of the formation of the T set was related to WNW–ESE extension connected with the uplift of the synclinorium. The youngest joints – the majority of the L and a small portion of the L’ set, were formed as the result of stress relaxation in the rock masses during progressive uplift lasting up to recent times. The formation of the joints proceeded in two stages: (I) their initiation in the form of joint-anisotropy and (II) opening of joints. These stages have often been significantly separated in time. Sometimes the process of joint opening continues up to recent times. There is a regional tendency that the double shear angle (2Θ) values increase from the axial zone towards the marginal parts of the synclinorium, as well as downward in the flysch lithostratigraphic section. This is probably caused by the increase in confining pressure and rock ductility attributed to the increase in overburden load. The 2Θ values could also have been controlled by tectonic factors.",

The lithology, sedimentary structures and trace fossil association from the Bathonian organic-rich mudstones from Krakow-Silesia Homocline (SW Poland) are described and a preliminary interpretation of the palaeoenvironment is presented. The ore-bearing clays exposed in the Gnaszyn clay-pit are developed as dark grey claysilt deposits with a few horizons of sideritic concretions. Sedimentological analysis has revealed that these deposits originated in the offshore part of a marine basin, below the fair weather wave base. Relict parallel lamination suggests that the predominant mechanism of deposition was quiet settling from suspension. However, locally preserved storm deposits indicate that the sea bottom was affected by offshore flows, deriving coarser material from the nearshore area. The degree of bioturbation is high but the diversity of the trace-fossil association is low. It consists mainly of Chondrites , Trichichnus , pyritized burrows and less common Palaeophycus . Other traces, including Thalassinoides , Planolites , Taenidium and some undetermined burrows, occur mainly in the lower part of the succession. This ichnoassociation combines features of distal Cruziana and Zoophycos ichnofacies, suggesting poor oxygenation of the bottom sediment. Temporary improvements in bottom oxygenation, linked with more intense mixing of water during major storms, resulted in the more diverse trace fossil suite that is found in some intervals of the succession.",

The Cladocera assemblages provide a rich and relatively complete record of the Cladocera succession of the Eemian Interglacial, and are similar to those from other Eemian sites in Poland. The species composition and the variability in frequency of specimens of Cladocera made it possible to distinguish five zones of their development, which correlate well with pollen data. The Slawoszewek palaeolake existed from the early Eemian to the late Eemian Interglacial; at the end of the middle Eemian, the lake dried up temporarily. The cladoceran assemblages show that the initial shallow, oligotrophic status of the lake was followed by an increase to eutrophic status, especially during the interglacial optimum. Based on cladoceran composition, changes in climatic conditions in the mid-pollen zone E1, the late pollen zone E5 and in pollen zone E7, were recognized. It appears that cladoceran development was due mainly to climate changes, but also to changes in the locally prevailing conditions within the water body. The high frequency of cladocerans and the presence of cladoceran taxa preferring warmer water in mid-pollen zone E1 show an increase in temperature. The appearance of cold-tolerant Cladocera species at the end of pollen zone E5, suggests unfavourable conditions, probably cooling. Changes in Cladocera patterns in pollen zone E7 show that warm conditions still obtained in this area.",

Coprolites and an unidentified trace fossil A are also described. The trace fossils allow the discrimination of five ichnoassociations in the Raciborowice Gorne section: (IA 1) Rhizocorallium- Pholeus, (IA 2) Rhizocorallium-Palaeophycus, (IA 3) Thalassinoides, (IA 4) Trypanites-Balanoglossites and (IA 5) Planolites-Palaeophycus. The Lower Muschelkalk succession was deposited on a shallow carbonate ramp affected by frequent storms. Deposition commenced with sedimentation in a restricted lagoon on the inner ramp with a short episode of sabkha formation. It continued on the middle and outer ramp and then on a skeletal shoal of the outer ramp and in an open basin. Ichnoassociation IA 5 is related to a maximum transgression that commenced with the deposition of the Spiriferina Bed and which probably marked the opening of the Silesian-Moravian Gate. The basin underwent two shallowing episodes, as evidenced by ichnoassociations IA 3-IA 4, resulting in the formation of hardgrounds. Bathymetric changes in the Raciborowice Gorne section correspond well with a general transgressive trend in the Germanic Basin.",

Thus, the hiatus at the Albian-Cenomanian boundary at Annopol embraces the latter zone.

The fauna is dominated by parautochthonous organisms which were swept into the sills by gentle transport. Ammonites are characterized by perfect preservation and small size, a feature which is due to the predominance of microconchs but also of stunting. The most complete sill is 0.7 m thick and could be separated into 17 levels which range in age from the early Toarcian into the late Kimmeridgian, thus representing the most extreme case of palaeontologically and depositionally documented stratigraphic condensation in Earth history. The unique feature of the Rocca Busambra sills is due to the interaction of three processes: extreme stratigraphic condensation on the sea floor, weak tectonic fracturing of the host rock and repeated reopening on top of already existing sills. Contrasting percentages of gastropods in individual levels reflect sea-level oscillations which correspond to long known low- and highstands during the Jurassic of the western Tethys. Comparisons with other ammonite-bearing sill faunas reveal several similarities, but represent only short-timed phases of tectonic pulses and deposition.",

The analysis was performed using REDFIT spectral estimation, continuous wavelet transform and signal filtering techniques. As a result two 4 th order and five 5 th order cycles were distinguished and named in all sections. The correlation of cycles between sections was calibrated with the graptolite biozones.

    "abstract": "Abstract The regional hardening of the Late Cenomanian to Early Turonian Chalk of the Northern Province of eastern England has been investigated by examining the pattern of trace elements and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in the bulk calcite of two extensive and stratigraphically adjacent units each 4 to 5 m thick of hard chalk in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. These units are separated by a sequence, 0.3-1.3 m thick, of variegated marls and clayey marls. Modelling of the geochemistry of the hard chalk by comparison with the Standard Louth Chalk, combined with associated petrographic and geological evidence, indicates that (1) the hardening is due to the precipitation of a calcite cement, and (2) the regional and stratigraphical patterns of geochemical variation in the cement are largely independent of each other and have been maintained by the impermeable nature of the thin sequence of the clay-rich marls that separate them. Two phases of calcite cementation are recognised. The first phase was microbially influenced and did not lithify the chalk. It took place predominantly in oxic and suboxic conditions under considerable overpressure in which the Chalk pore fluids circulated within the units, driven by variations in compaction, temperature, pore fluid pressure and local tectonics. There is evidence in central and southern Lincolnshire of the loss of Sr and Mgenriched pore fluids to the south during an early part of this phase. The second phase of calcite precipitation was associated with the loss of overpressure in probably Late Cretaceous and in Cenozoic times as the result of fault movement in the basement penetrating the overlying Chalk and damaging the seal between the two chalk units. This greatly enhanced grain pressures, resulting in grain welding and pressure dissolution, causing lithification with the development of stylolites, marl seams, and brittle fractures. Associated with this loss of overpressure was the penetration of the chalk units by allochthonous fluids, rich in sulphate and hydrocarbons, derived probably from the North Sea Basin. Microbial sulphate-reduction under anoxic conditions within these allochthonous fluids has been responsible for dissolving the fine-grained iron and manganese oxides within the chalk, locally enriching the Fe and Mn content of the calcite cement. The possibility is discussed that the pattern of cementation preserved in these regionally hard chalks of Late Cenomanian and Early Turonian age may be different from that preserved in the younger (late Turonian to Campanian) more basinal chalks of eastern England.",

The succession of gastropods in the Gnaszyn section is quite monotonous and shows significant changes only in the proximity of concretion layers, at least partially because of diagenetic reasons. Otherwise, the section is dominated by gastropods (cylidrobullinids, bullinids, and mathildids) most of which preyed probably on sedentary organisms (polychaetes and/or coelenterates) that possibly flourished on the sea bottom at that time. The other groups of gastropods are represented by larval or juvenile shells. Their presence shows that the environmental conditions that were probably unfavourable for gastropods living directly on the sea bottom most likely because of a soupy substrate consistency, possible oxygen deficiency near the sediment-water interface and/or oxygen content fluctuations. Adult and/or subadult individuals of these gastropods occur only in the higher part of the section, reflecting a time when these conditions improved. A new heterostrophic gastropod species, Promathildia gedli , is described.",

Terrestrial particles include black opaque phytoclasts, dark brown phytoclasts, cuticle remains and subordinate sporomorphs. The latter are represented by eighty-four taxa of spores and pollen grains. They represent various groups of plants, including Bryophyta, Sphenophyta, Lycophyta, Pteridophyta , Pteridospermophyta, Cycadophyta or Ginkgophyta and Coniferophyta. The most frequent sporomorphs in almost all samples from Gnaszyn are Callialasporites (Araucariaceae), Cerebropollenites and Perinopollenites elatoides (Taxodiaceae) pollen grains, fern spores with triradiate tetrad mark, bisaccate pollen grains belonging to conifers (Pinaceae or Podocarpaceae) and also to Pteridospermophyta. Quantitative analysis of the palynofacies shows fluctuations of particular element ratios, which correlate with lithology. Clay intervals that contain siderite concretion levels yielded lower amounts of cuticles in relation to sporomorphs (mainly pollen grains) and dinoflagellate cysts. Intervals of monotonous clays and silts are characterized by a higher ratio of cuticles in relation to other elements, especially dinoflagellate cysts. Also, quantitative analysis of the sporomorphs shows changes in frequency of the representatives of various plant communities, which coexisted during the Jurassic: Upland, Lowland, River, Pioneer, Coastal and Tidally-influenced. These changes might have reflected sealevel fluctuations, which affected vegetation growing on adjacent land. However, the dominance of Callialasporites pollen grains, which belong to the Coastal community, indicates that the Gnaszyn assemblage was mainly influenced by the seashore vegetation. The high frequency of Araucariaceae pollen grains and the presence of ferns representing the Osmundaceae, Cyatheaceae, Dicksoniaceae, Schizeaceae, Gleicheniaceae and Matoniaceae indicate a warm climate without large seasonal amplitudes during the deposition of the Gnaszyn succession.",

Acta Geologica Polonica, 63 (4), 625-655. Warszawa. Lower and Middle Cenomanian ammonite assemblages have been collected on a bed-by-bed basis from localities at Vohipaly and Mahaboboka, Madagascar, as well as from outcrops around Berekata, all in the Morondava Basin, southwest Madagascar. These collections demonstrate the presence of the upper Lower Cenomanian Mantelliceras dixoni Zone and the lower Middle Cenomanian Cunningtoniceras inerme Zone of the north-western European standard sequence. These records indicate that the striking anomalies in the zonal assemblages of the classic divisions of the Madagascan Cenomanian are based on mixed assemblages, rather than a succession that differs radically from that elsewhere in the world. The dixoni Zone fauna is: Desmoceras cf. latidorsatum (Michelin, 1838), Pachydesmoceras kossmati Matsumoto, 1987, Forbesiceras sp., F. baylissiWright &amp; Kennedy, 1984, F. largilliertianum (d’Orbigny, 1841), Mantelliceras cantianum Spath, 1926a, M. dixoni Spath, 1926b, M. mantelli (J.

The presence of Calycoceras in a Lower Cenomanian association represents a precocious appearance of a genus typically Middle and Upper Cenomanian in occurrence, and matches records from Tunisia. The inerme Zone yields a more restricted assemblage: Pachydesmoceras kossmati, Forbesiceras baylissi, Acanthoceras sp. juv., Cunningtoniceras cunningtoni (Sharpe, 1855) and Hypoturrilites taxyfabreae.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A high-resolution latest Early Campanian to Early Maastrichtian carbon and oxygen stable isotope record from the northern German Boreal shelf sea based on 537 analyses of co-occurring belemnites, brachiopods, inoceramids, oysters, and bulk rock samples is presented. All samples are precisely related to their stratigraphic, systematic and facies backgrounds and form an integrated, nearly 10-myr-long dataset with considerable palaeoenvironmental and palaeoceanographical implications. Petrographic studies indicate that low-magnesium calcitic coccoliths and calcispheres (i.e., planktic carbonate) predominate the bulk-rock data (marl-limestone rhythmites and chalks), thus representing a sea-surface water signal, and that only minor diagenetic alteration of the carbonate muds took place. Based on TL and CL microscopy, the investigated belemnites are extraordinarily well preserved, which may in part be explained by their early diagenetic surficial silicification (container effect), while the other macroinvertebrate groups are all less well preserved. The (plankton-dominated) δ 13 C values of the marl-limestone rhythmites and chalks (+1.1 to +2.5 ‰), recording a surface water signal, compare well with the δ 18 C data of inoceramids while δ 13 C brach . values (+1.5 to +3.0 ‰) are heavier than the bulk rock data. The large variation in the δ 13 C bel . (-0.1 to +3.6 ‰) is attributed to isotopic disequilibrium of the biogenic carbonate formed by the belemnite animal. The bulk rock δ 18 O values show a remarkable low scatter, supporting petrographic observation of only minor diagenetic stabilisation/cementation, and can be approximated with northern German shelf sea-surface temperatures of ca. 20°C for the Late Campanian (ca. -2 ‰ δ 18 O), being slightly cooler during the Early Maastrichtian. The δ 18 O values of the belemnite rostra are even less variable and quite rich in heavier 18 O (-0.7 to +0.6 with a mean of -0.1 ‰ δ 18 O bel .) in comparison to bulk rock and other skeletal components. Based on their excellent microstructural preservation and non-luminescence, we conclude that the belemnite rostra are diagenetically unaltered and have preserved the primary δ 18 O signal of ambient seawater (12 ± 2°C). In the absence of any indication for migration from cooler water masses and evidence for authochtonous populations we assume that the belemnites of the genera Belemnitella and Belemnella lived as nektobenthos near the sea-floor and thus record the temperature of the bottom mixed layer of the seasonally weakly stratified north German shelf sea at water depths of 100 to 150 m; the temperature gradient was thus 12.5-18.75 m/1°C. A conspicuous latest Campanian cooling event is evident in both sea-surface and bottom-water temperatures. The δ 18 O values of nearly all investigated benthic fossils lie between the isotope values of pristine belemnites and bulk rock, and, therefore, should be used for palaeotemperature reconstructions only with great care.",

However, the European record of the Early to early Late Cretaceous brachauchenines is largely limited to isolated tooth crowns, most of which have been attributed to the classic Cretaceous taxon Polyptychodon. Nevertheless, the original material of P. interruptus, the type species of Polyptychodon, was recently reappraised and found undiagnostic. Here, we describe a collection of twelve pliosaurid teeth from the upper Albian-middle Cenomanian interval of the condensed, phosphorite-bearing Cretaceous succession at Annopol, Poland. Eleven of the studied tooth crowns, from the Albian and Cenomanian strata, fall within the range of the morphological variability observed in the original material of P. interruptus from the Cretaceous of England. One tooth crown from the middle Cenomanian is characterized by a gently subtrihedral cross-section. Similar morphology has so far been described only for pliosaurid teeth from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. Even though it remains impossible to precisely settle the taxonomic distinctions, the studied material is considered to be taxonomically heterogeneous.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A spectacular epigenetic silicification was encountered in the Oxfordian bedded limestones exposed in the Sokole Hills situated in the Krakow-Częstochowa Upland. The main epigenetic mineral is microcrystalline quartz accompanied by minor goethite, hematite, barite, galena and sphalerite. Locally, the mineralized limestones reveal Pb and Cu contents exceeding over 150 times the background values of these metals in unmineralized limestones. The epigenetic mineralization of the bedded limestones was probably a two-stage process. During the first, Early Cretaceous stage, silicified limestones formed at the erosional surface of a denuded carbonate complex. Such silicification greatly limited the progress of the first karstification phase of the Upper Jurassic carbonates initiated in the Hauterivian. The sources of silica accumulated in the limestones were descending solutions enriched in silica derived from the weathering zone. This silicification affected the topmost part of the Upper Jurassic massive limestones and the deeper portions of the bedded limestones along the fracture systems and stylolites. Early Cretaceous tectonic activity generated new dislocations and re-opened the existing faults, which were subsequently filled with permeable Albian quartz sands. These openings became the migration pathways for ascending, warm, relict, sulphide-carrying hydrothermal solutions at the second formation stage of the epigenetic mineralization. The newly supplied silica from the Albian sands precipitated on the silicified limestones and, as concentric rims, on brecciated, early diagenetic cherts. The second-stage mineralization proceeded under phreatic conditions, presumably close to a fluctuating mixing zone of ascending, warm hydrothermal solutions and descending cold groundwaters. The brecciated cherts acting as silica crystallization nuclei indicate that the last mineralization stage probably followed the final phase of Cenozoic faulting",

On every side it is surrounded by faults along which flexures have formed emphasizing the brachysynclinal structure of this unit. The evolution of the brachysyncline has gone on during a long period of time. The subsiding movements commenced towards the close of the Turonian continuing through the Senonian. Their intensity was probably strongest during the Upper Coniacian. Sedimentation associated with these movements built up a 900 m. thick series of Upper Cretaceous beds. This is the maximum, thus far ascertained, thickness of Cretaceous sediments in the Klodzko region where the average thickness is 500 m. The beginning of the brachysynclinal subsiding movements coincides with the evolution of the Nysa graben. It subsided by gravity forces along the axis of the widespread rising anticlinal structure consisting of the Orlickie and Bystrzyckie Mountains and the Śnieznik Massif. The elevation of this structure preceded the evolution of the Nysa graben, having begun during the Middle Turonian. After the formation of the graben through gravity force the growing compression caused the steepening of slopes or the overturning of marginal flexures and local overthrusting of Cretaceous strata by metamorphic rocks.",

In many studied profiles, we noted the incompleteness in the pollen record of the Eemian vegetation succession – hiatuses occur usually in the hornbeam (E5) and/or spruce phase (E6). Moreover, the thickness of the same pollen zone and the development of its palynological record are strongly differentiated between individual profiles, e.g. the hornbeam zone (E5) is contained in an exceptionally thick sediment layer (3.7 m) in the PWS1-19 profile, and the oak zone (E3) in the WH-123 and PWS2-19 profiles (1.0 and 1.2 m, respectively), while in other profiles they are represented only by single pollen spectra. If we only had a single profile with a hiatus and/or a poorly developed pollen record, it would be impossible to reconstruct a complete interglacial succession of vegetation. However, having several such imperfect profiles which complemented each other enabled us to do it.",

The principal cusps are similar to O. texensis but usually(?) are not serrated, and the base is usually wider than long but has a thin or sometimes thick labial margin beneath a single intermediate cusp. A few dozen very small isolated teeth define two ? Xenacanthus dentitions . ? X. ossiani sp. nov.

Based on the evidence of a regression in the Late Turonian (Cretaceous) scupini Zone of the Miinster­ land Cretaceous Basin (Westphalia), the exposures Nettlingen and GroB-Flothe are investigated in order to discover whether or not a comparable event can be observed in Lower Saxony.

The lower sequence, the base of which is located above the main Hyphantoceras Event in the middle Late Turonian of northern Germany, is termed the flexuosum Sequence. The sequence above the sequen­ ce boundary, which ranges into the Lower Coniacian Cremnoceramus deformis Zone, spans approxi­ mately the reported range of costatus. It is, therefore, named the Didymotis Sequence. It can be shown that the observed sequence boundary can also be recognized in Spain, southern England, Poland and the Czech Republic.",

Its numerous trilobites (e.g. Homalonotus knighti, Acastella spinosa) and position in the lithological column testify for the late Ludfordian age of this formation. The sedimentary environment of the Jadowniki Formation is interpreted as extremely shallow-barrier environments with episodes of emersion and subaerial early diagenesis and erosion. However, these shallows were not connected with the nearshore belt of Baltica land and were separated from them by a belt of deep basin sedimentation – the graptholitic shales. Silurian shallow marine sediments of the ¸ysogory Unit were deposited on top of a clastic wedge, which in the Ludlovian infilled the offshore – deep basin of the SW margin of the East European Craton. The wedge was probably connected with the process of dockage of new terranes onto the south-west periphery of the East European Craton The second factor that led to the development of shallow marine environments was probably the uppermost Ludfordian regressive event.",

Detailed sedimentological analyses are performed for fourteen exposures. Four petrographic rock types: quartz arenites, quartz arenites with limeclasts, calcarenites with quartz and biocalcarenites have been distinguished. The lithology and microfacies of these rocks point to a high-energy, shallow-water, normalmarine environment connected with the shore zone. Moreover, diversified sets of sedimentological structures, including depositional, deformational and biogenic, are ascribed to the shallow-water high-energy environment. The characteristics of the Badenian succession allow an interpretation of the environment and its change during sedimentation. Deposition during the Badenian in the Roztocze area was connected with the evolution of the Carpathian Foredeep. Initially sedimentation was mainly dependent on hydrodynamic factors, however the influence of diastrophic factors gradually increased.",

Upper Tithonian - Berriasian); and at the Stankowa-Skala klippe, the Czorsztyn Limestone Formation (Oxfordian - Klmmeridgian) and the Rogoźnik Member (Tithonian - Berriasian). It is suggested that the Rogoza Coquina ranges down to the Kimmeridgian (and Oxfordian ?), its lower part thus being coeval with the Czorsztyn Limestone of other sections. A new formal lithostratigraphic unit is suggested which should comprise the white micritic coquinas that form the upper part of the present Rogoźnik Member and overlie the Rogoza Member. The succession of Early and Middle Tithonian ammonites in both localities comprises i. a. the genera Semiforfmiceras , Taramelliceras, Sutneria and Simocosmoceras, the representatives of which are described and illustrated, and a new species, Semiformiceras birkenmajeri sp. n., is established. An analysis of the ammonite faunas of the classical section at Stankowa Skala allows to conclude that in the Czorsztyn Limestone there appears a stratigraphic gap which corresponds to the uppermost Callovian and Lower Oxfordian. The Mediterranean ammonite assemblages of the Late Jurassic Czorsztyn ridge show affinities with assemblages from platformic Europe and several units of the Alpine and Carpatho-Balcanic regions; this indicates migration of ammonites across bathyal basin. A special attention is paid to stratigraphic and biogeographic aspects of the genus Pseudovirgatites, and arguments are put forward in favour of approximate stratigraphic equivalence of the Middle/Upper Tithonian and Lower/Middle Volgian boundaries.",

These folds developed in the Holy Cross Mountains in Palaeozoic unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks during Variscan deformation. During folding, layerparallel shortening prevailed, although a layer-parallel shear component, resulting from deformation of multilayers by compression at low angles to the layering, has also been recognized. Different contraction and extension fault sets, as well as cleavage, small-scale duplexes, boudinage and stylolites, developed progressively on both gradually steepening limbs of the symmetric folds, as well as mainly on the short limbs of the asymmetric folds. Based on the comparison of  laboratory data for different types of rocks, the range of values of horizontal compressive stress levels occurring during fold growth has been estimated. The stress levels for the high pore fluid pressures probably did not exceed 150 MPa. These conditions and temperatures below 150°C favoured buckle folding. In the late phase of the folding or in the post-folding stage of Variscan deformation, the separation of the Kielce Unit into fault-bounded block domains was initiated along longitudinal and transverse faults. This resulted in changes in trend of parts of the map-scale folds.",

These burrows, situated at the tops of oolitic shoals/banks at Malogoszcz, casually served both as habitats of cryptic faunas (mostly comatulids, dwarf-sized gastropods) and as preservational/taphonomic traps for others, primarily echinoderms (ten taxa of echinoids, three stalked crinoids, two ophiuroids, one asteroid) swept into by highly agitated waters, most likely during storms, to produce an Echinodermenlagerstdlte.

    "abstract": "The Karkonosze-lzera block in the Sudetes Mts (Southern Poland), consisting of the Karkonosze ganite massif and its gneiss-schist cover, named the lzera area, bears numerous pegmatites and pneumatolytic-hydrothermal bodies: veins, silicified cataclastic zones, and metasomatites (leucogranites, greisens and tourmaline nests). A scheme of the formation of early zones of pegmatites by metasomatic recrystallization of aplite under pneumatolytic conditions is presented, being established on textural features. The mode of crystallization of the individual types of veins depended on the type of fracture and the changes of temperature during the fracture filling with minerals. Both pegmatites and veins from Karkonosze formed originally under action of pneumatolytic, and subsequently of hydrothermal fluids, contrary to veins and metasomatites in the Izera area, formed by an activity of essentially hydrothermal fluids. Measurements of temperatures of the homogenization of fluid inclusions and evaluation of the pressure permitted a discussion of real temperatures of the crystallization of hydrothermal mineral assemblages. Geochemistry of major elements in the inclusion fillings i.e. sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, iron and chlorine, was characterized. High fluorine content in inclusions, expressed as atomic ratio l000F/Cl is typical of metasomatites and ore-bearing rocks in the Izera area, being a possible prospecting tool. Minor and trace elements in inclusion flulids, especially Li, Be and B, have characteristic regional distribution. Bromine content in inclusions gives some genetic suggestions on the origin of mineral-forming solutions. Discussed are also possible relations between diverse hydrothermal deposits in the metamorphic lzera cover and the Karkonosze granite massif.",

These fault-controlled basins are filled with thick series of Neogene terrestrial deposits.

The origin of theses basins may be correlated with a sinistral transtensional regime which occurred in the Early to Middle Miocene.

    "abstract": "The Sungun porphyry copper deposit (PCD) is located in EastAzarbaijan, in northwestern Iran. The felsic rocks occur as stocks and dykes ranging in composition fromquartzmonzodiorite through quartzmonzonite. The stocks are classified into porphyry stocks I and II. Porphyry stock II, hosting the copper ore, experienced an intense hydro-fracturing leading to the formation of stockwork-type veinlets and micro-veinlets of quartz, sulphides, carbonates and sulphates. Three distinct types of hydrothermal alteration and sulphide mineralization are recognized at Sungun (1) hypogene, (2) contactmetasomatic (skarn), and (3) supergene.Hypogene alteration is developed in four kinds: potassic, phyllic, propylitic and argillic. Three types of fluid inclusions are typically observed at Sungun: (1) vapour-rich, two-phase, (2) liquid-rich two-phase and (3)multi-phase.Halite is the principal solid phase inmultiphase inclusions. Primary multiphase inclusions (LVH type fluid inclusions) within the quartz crystals in quartz-sulphide and quartzmolybdenite veinlets (quartz associated with sulphideminerals) were selected formicro-thermometric analyses and considered to be suitable for pressure calculations and estimation of hydrothermal fluid density.Homogenization temperature, salinity, pressure and density were measured and calculated in forty-seven selected samples None of the variables could distinguish the potassic from phyllic alteration zones clearly. In the potassic alteration zone, the average of homogenization temperature is about 413oC, while in the phyllic alteration zone its average is about 375 oC. It was expected that the temperature in the potassic alteration zone would be higher than that in the phyllic zone, but the difference found was not very significant The fluid inclusion salinity within both alteration zones obviously relates to their homogenization temperature: the average salinity in the samples from the potassic zone is 46.3 (wt%NaCl equiv.), which is higher than that in the samples from the phyllic zone.. Based on the estimated depth of the potassic alteration domain, it is expected that the lithostatic pressure was higher than in the phyllic alteration zone.According to the fluid inclusion studies and pressure  alculation, it is estimated that the average pressure for the potassic alteration zone was about 512 (bars) while the average pressure for phyllic zone was about 310 (bars). The average density of fluids in the samples from the potassic alteration zone is 1.124 (g/cm3), which is higher than that in the phyllic alteration zone (1.083 g/cm3).",

Early representatives of the belemnite genus Belemnella (Cephalopoda) from the uppermost Campanian-Lower Maastrichtian of the Middle Vistula River section, central Poland. Acta Geologica Polonica, 62 (4), 535-559. Warszawa. Representatives of the belemnite genus Belemnella from the uppermost Campanian and lowermost Maastrichtian of the Middle Vistula River Valley section (central Poland) have been studied, using the species concept proposed by Schulz in 1979. Results have been compared to a recently proposed new interpretation of the genus Belemnella based on artificial neural networks, as put forward by Remin in 2007 and 2012. In the interval studied, four taxa have been recognised: Bln. longissima, Bln. inflata, Bln. obtusa and Bln. vistulensis, the last-named being a senior synonym of Bln. pseudobtusa. Three additional forms have been left in open nomenclature: Bln. cf. lanceolata , Bln. ex gr. lanceolata/inflata and Belemnella sp. Based on their documented vertical ranges, three Belemnella standard zones, as originally distinguished in the Kronsmoor section by Schulz (1979), northern Germany, have been defined, in ascending order: the Bln. lanceolata, Bln. vistulensis and Bln. obtusa zones. The bases of the lanceolata and obtusa zones in the Middle Vistula River Valley section can be directly correlated with the same zones at Kronsmoor, and appear to be isochronous within limits of stratigraphic resolution. The base of the vistulensis Zone (Bln. vistulensis according to the species concept of Schulz in 1979), however, is probably diachronous, being older in the Middle Vistula section. Although Schulz’s and Remin’s species concepts differ quite considerably, they do result in similar stratigraphic subdivisions of the Kronsmoor and Middle Vistula River sections.",

Facies and integrated stratigraphy of the Upper Turonian (Upper Cretaceous) Grosberg Formation south of Regensburg (Bavaria, southern Germany). Acta Geologica Polonica, 62 (4), 595-615. Warszawa. The Upper Turonian Grosberg Formation of the Regensburg area (Danubian Cretaceous Group, Bavaria, southern Germany) has a mean thickness of 20-25 m and consists of sandy bioclastic calcarenites and calcareous sandstones which are rich in bryozoans, serpulids and bivalves (oysters, rudists, inoceramids). Eight facies types have been recognized that characterize deposition on a southward dipping homoclinal ramp: the inner ramp sub-environment was characterized by high-energy sandwave deposits (sandy bioclastic rud- and grainstones, bioclastic sandstones) with sheltered inter-shoal areas. In mid-ramp settings, bioturbated, glauconitic, calcareous sand- and siltstones as well as bioturbated, bioclastic wacke- and packstones predominate. The carbonate grain association of the Grosberg Formation describes a temperate bryomol facies with indicators of warm-water influences. An inferred surplus of land-derived nutrients resulted in eutrophic conditions and favoured the heterozoan communities of the Grosberg Ramp. Carbon stable isotope geochemistry cannot significantly contribute to the stratigraphic calibration of the Grosberg Formation due to the depleted and trendless bulk-rock δ13 C values, probably resulting from a shallow-water aquafacies with depleted δ13 C DIC values and low δ13 C values of syndepositional and early diagenetic carbonate phases. However, strongly enriched skeletal calcite δ13 C values support a correlation of the Grosberg Formation with the mid-Late Turonian positive Hitch Wood isotope event (Hyphantoceras Event of northern Germany). This interpretation is supported by biostratigraphic data and a range from the Mytiloides striatoconcentricus Zone into the lower My. scupini Zone is indicated by inoceramid bivalves. Both the base and top of the Grosberg Formation are characterized by unconformities. Sequence boundary SB Tu 4 at the base is a major regional erosion surface (erosional truncation of the underlying Kagerhoh Formation in the Regensburg area, fluvial incision at the base of the Seugast Member of the Roding Formation in the Bodenwohr area towards the north and northeast). It is suggested that this unconformity corresponds to a major sea-level drop recognized in many other Cretaceous basins below the Hitch Wood or Hyphantoceras Event. The transgression and highstand of the Grosberg Formation is concomitant to the deposition of the fluvial Seugast Member and the onlap of the marginal-marine “Veldensteiner Sandstein” onto the Frankische Alb. The unconformity at the top of the Grosberg Formation (late Late Turonian SB Tu 5) is indicated by a ferruginous firm-/ hardground and an underlying zone of strongly depleted δ13 C values. The abrupt superposition by deeper marine marls of the lower Hellkofen Formation (uppermost Turonian-Lower Coniacian) may be connected with inversion tectonics at the southwestern margin of the Bohemian Massif.",

The planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy of the Maltese Lower Globigerina Limestone member has been investigated. The member was dated to early planktonic foraminiferal P22 Zone and nannofossil NP25 Zone (upper Chattian). A climate-stratigraphic approach, based on the quantitative analyses of calcareous nannofossils, was used additionally to achieve a more precise chronology. The species Coccolithus pelagicus (diameter £11 μm) and the genus Umbilicosphaera were selected for the recognition of cold and warm surface waters intervals respectively. The ratio of their percentages enabled the construction of a Climatic Factor (CLF) curve. The CLF values were consistent with a warm climatic phase, which is probably represented by the portion of the oxygen stable isotope curve of Miller et al. above the Oi2c event and below the beginning of the cooling trend that culminates in the Mi1 event. Considering these two climatic events and the upper boundary of the NP25 Zone, it can be inferred that the deposition of the Lower Globigerina Limestone member took place between 25.1 and 24.3 Ma.",

Geochemical and stable isotope patterns of calcite cementation in the Upper Cretaceous Chalk, UK: Direct evidence from calcite-filled vugs in brachiopods. Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (2), 143-172. Warszawa. The history of research into the cementation of the Upper Cretaceous Chalk of the UK is reviewed. Calcitefilled vugs within the shell cavities of terebratulid brachiopods from the Cenomanian Chalk of eastern England have been investigated by cathodoluminesence imaging, staining, electron microprobe and stable isotope analysis. This has provided the first detailed analysis of the geochemistry of the Chalk’s cement. Two cement series, suboxic and anoxic, are recognized. Both start with a Mg-rich calcite with positive δ 13 C values considered to have been precipitated under oxic conditions influenced by aerobic ammonification. The suboxic series is characterized by positive δ 13 C values that became increasingly so as cementation progressed, reaching values of 3.5‰. Manganese is the dominant trace element in the earlier cement, iron in the later cement. Mnand Fe-reducing microbes influenced cement precipitation and the trace element and δ 13 C patterns. The anoxic series is characterized by δ 13 C values that became increasingly negative as cementation progressed, reaching values of -6.5‰. Trace elements are dominated by iron and manganese. Sulphate-reducing microbes influenced cement precipitation and the trace element and δ 13 C patterns. Both cement series are related closely to lithofacies and early lithification pre-dating the regional hardening of the Chalk. The suboxic series occurs in chalk which was continuously deposited and contained hematite pigment and limited organic matter. The anoxic series was associated with slow to nil deposition and hardground development in chalks that originally contained hematite pigment but no longer do so, and an enhanced supply of organic matter.",

In the Miechow Segment of the Szczecin-Miechow Synclinorium in southern Poland, it occurs in the Upper Campanian-Lower Maastrichtian deeper shelf sediments, which were deposited below wave base and are characterized by total bioturbation and a trace fossil assemblage comprising Planolites, Palaeophycus, Thalassinoides , Trichichnus, Phycosiphon, Zoophycos and Helicodromites that is typical of the transition from the distal Cruziana to the Zoophycos ichnofacies. L. lewesiensis was produced by a burrowing predator or scavenger of fishes. The tracemaker candidates could be eunicid polychaetes or anguillid fishes.",

High (ultrahigh) pressure metamorphic terrane rocks as the source of the detrital garnets from the Middle Jurassic sands and sandstones of the Cracow Region (Cracow- Wieluń Upland, Poland). Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (2), 231-245. Warszawa. The Middle Jurassic (Upper Bathonian/Lower Callovian) sands and sandstones of the Cracow-Wieluń Upland contain detrital garnets with high contents of the pyrope molecule (30-73 mol %). The predominance of detrital pyrope garnets, and inclusions represented mainly by omphacite and kyanite, show that the garnets were derived from high (ultrahigh) pressure (H/UHP) metamorphic terrane rocks (garnet peridotites, eclogites and granulites). Their source is unknown. The Moldanubian Zone of the Bohemian Massif is closely comparable. However, the terranes between this zone and the Cracow- Wieluń Upland are dominated by almandine garnets. The relatively low proportion of almandine garnets in the examined samples indicates that transport of the detrital material could not have been from a far distant source as the garnet assemblage would otherwise be strongly dominated by almandine. A less distant possible source could have been the Gory Sowie Mts., which incorporate UHP/HP metamorphic rocks, but the exposed areal extent of these rocks is too small. It is possible that larger portions of these metamorphic rocks are buried beneath the Cenozoic cover and might have earlier represented a larger source area. Reworking of the entire heavy mineral spectra from older clastics is improbable because of the low maturity of the heavy mineral assemblages (higher proportion of less stable minerals). The source area therefore remains unknown. Most probably it was formed by primary crystalline complexes of lower crust to mantle origin, outcrops of which were not far distant from the area of deposition. Similar detrital garnet compositions were also recorded in the Outer Western Carpathians (Flysch Zone, Pieniny Klippen Belt), i.e. the crustal segments which formed the Silesian and Magura cordilleras; the Czorsztyn Swell was also formed by similar rocks.",

The huge lithosome of the Middle Miocene (Early Badenian) Mykolaiv Sands, developed at the external margin of the Fore-Carpathian Basin in western Ukraine, is recognized to represent a shallowing-up sequence. Special attention is paid to burrows of the Ghost Crab Ocypode which are pantropical in present-day littoral habitats. In the Stratyn section, burrows of this type become a crucial tool in the interpretation of basin bathymetry, which starts from distal offshore depths, through the foreshore, to the backshore where the Ocypode burrows record a temporary break in sedimentation. Lithification of the sand layers and the Ocypode burrows subsequently progressed in beachrock mode. The Stratyn section demonstrates that the development of submerged shoals and/or emergent parts, throughout the huge mass of the Mykolaiv Sands, is probably responsible for their great variation in thickness in western Ukraine, which has long proved difficult to explain.",

Nine architectural elements were recognized: CH: Channels, GB: Gravel bars and bed forms, SB: Sand bars and bedforms, SB (p): sand bedform with planar cross-stratification, OF: Overbank flow, DA: Downstream-accretion macroforms, LS: Laminated sandsheet, LA: Lateral-accretion macroforms and FF: Floodplain fines. The lithofacies types and facies associations were interpreted as having been generated by alluvial systems characterized by (i) high energy perennial braided river systems and (ii) ephemeral river systems. Aeolian sand dunes and sand sheets generated by the reworking of braided alluvial deposits can also occur. The paleocurrent measurements show a main dispersion pattern to S, SE and SW, and another to NE/E. These features imply a paleodrainage flowing into the basins of the Recôncavo-Tucano-Jatobá.",

The study area, typical of large river valleys, was investigated by detailed monitoring of groundwater levels. Based on statistical analysis and the geo-statistical modeling of monitoring data for 1999-2013, the range and dynamics of groundwater level fluctuations were determined for the entire interval and for the vegetation periods. The values of retention and infiltration recharge in various periods were compared with average values, indicating intervals of potential groundwater deficiency in GDEs. The amplitude of groundwater fluctuations, retention and infiltration were determined for vegetation periods characterized by the highest water intake by plants and the highest evapotranspiration. Particular attention has been drawn to the analysis of low groundwater levels in the vegetation periods, with water deficiencies potentially threatening the correct functioning of plant communities in GDEs. Moreover, the study has allowed us to indicate areas with insufficient groundwater levels during vegetation periods that may be hazardous to plant communities. The results may be a basis for the elaboration of correct management plans, protection measures and projects, or GDE renaturalization.",

    "abstract": "In the Balkans, the Serbo-Macedonian Unit (SMU), Serbia, is thrust bounded by the composite Tethyan Vardar Zone and the Carpatho-Balkanides. The SMU actually emerges from beneath the Neoalpine Miocene–Pliocene deposits. Both provenance and geodynamic position of the SMU are poorly known and still debated. This paper reviews the data hitherto published and includes some new field data interpretations. The SMU is composed of a Neoproterozoic–Cambrian high-grade (para- and ortho-) gneiss with peraluminous magmatic arc components (560–470 Ma). The SMU is in the contact with Neoproterozoic upper Ordovician–Carboniferous low-grade metasedimentary succession of an accretionary wedge assembly represented by the Supragetic basement. The SMU basement became folded, sheared and metamorphosed around 490–450 Ma. Paleomagnetic data point to high southern latitudes and a peri-Gondwanan position of the SMU at that time, which concurs with glaciomarine evidence recorded from the upper Ordovician sediments at the base of an accretionary wedge succession. Based on the published data and field survey in the Stalać region, we correlate the SMU with the pre-Mesozoic gneiss terrane exposed in the Strona-Ceneri zone of the Alps. This terrane, identified as the Cenerian orogen of the Alaskan subduction type, developed at an active margin of Gondwana during middle Ordovician times. The SMU basement, with augen and migmatitic gneisses and arc-related peraluminous magmatic bodies, developed at this margin as part of the Cenerian belt or its equivalent. Such an orogenic edifice proved transient and in the earliest Silurian the SMU fragments drifted away being bound for Baltica (amalgamated Moesian microplate and Danubian terrane) to which they became accreted in the Carboniferous and included in the southern European branch of the Variscan orogen (Marginal Dacides/Carpatho-Balkanides). Despite considerable Variscan and Alpine reworking, the pre-Variscan, Cenerian-type crustal assembly along with an inferred boundary between the magmatic arc and the accretionary wedge, accompanied by back-arc/forearc deposits, are still decipherable in the Western Balkan countries.",

    "abstract": "A rich assemblage of echinoids, primarily regular ones, is reported from the Lower Kimmeridgian part of an over 1km thick Upper Jurassic carbonate sequence, developed over cratonic (epicontinental) areas of Poland (Holy Cross Mountains in Central Poland, and Western Pomerania in NW Poland). The echinoids, either underestimated or even overlooked in the former literature, appear to be significant components of ubiquitous organic assemblages contained in various deposits of the bahamite type of facies. The most diversified taxonomically are the echinoids from Malogoszcz in the Holy Cross Mountains (22 species, of which 4 dominate:  Rhabdocidaris orbignyana , Hemicidaris intermedia , Gymnocidaris agassizi , Holectypus corallinus ). The richest numerically is the collection from Czarnoglowy in Western Pomerania (13 species, of which only 2 dominate: Hemicidaris hoffinanni and Nucleolites letteroni ).  The systematically accounted forms, totalling over 2,000 specimens, represent 31 species of 20 regular genera, and 10 species of 5 irregular genera. Of these, four species are new to science, viz. Pseudosalenia malogostiana  sp.n., Pseudocidaris sanctacrucensis sp.n., Trochotiara kongieli sp.n., and T. suleiovense sp.n. The well preserved specimens, although usually devoid of spines and apical plates, display the SEM-recognizable features of the tests (i.a. pore-pairs morphology, tubercle arrangement) substantial for a functional analysis of 14 more commonly occurring species. This analysis stimulated a paleobiologic interpretation focused on the behavioral and environmental (very shallow up to subtidal) conditions under which the studied echinoids lived and were buried, i.a. by such catastrophic events as storm-induced and mass-movement deposition. A separate, short section of the paper concerns the grazing traces of regular echinoids [classified in ichnology as Gnathichnus pentax BROMLEY, 1975], caused by browsing the epibionts, and preserved in the studied sequence on various organic (shelly) substrates, the other echinoid tests including.",

    "abstract": "Fossiliferous Upper Cenomanian to Lower Maastrichtian strata in Navarra, northern Spain, particularly in the eastern Barranca, were investigated in terms of litostratigraphy, macrofossil biostratigraphy and event stratigraphy. Extensive bed-by bed-collections of ammonites, inoceramids, and echinoids allow the establishment of combined standard zonal schemes of inter-regional significance. Data on geochronological boundaries, macrofossil distribution, the succession of events and the inter-relations between bioevents, eustato-events and tectonic movements in northern Spain are presented. The Upper Cenomanian - Turonian successions of the Barranca sections (Arardi, Izurdiaga, Satrustegui) and of the Estella area (Ganuza, Ollogoyen), differ considerably in both lithofacies and thickness and periodically, in faunal composition, as a result of their palaeogeographical positions within an stable outer shelf and an unstable mit-shelf, respectively. The Ganuza/Ollogoyen standard section is revised. In the context of the established event stratigraphical scheme, discrepancies in previously applied ammonite zonation are pointed out and discussed in terms of their regional relevance. The expanded and relatively complete Turonian of the Estella area is subdivided into an unnamed interval devoid of ammonites (Upper Cenomanian Metoicoceras geslinianum Zone to the mid-Lower Turonian), six ammonite zones and an inoceramid/ammonite assemblage zone. The upper Lower Turonian Kamerunoceras ganuzai / Mammites nodosoides Zone is succeeded by the Middle Turonian zones of K. turoniense , Romaniceras kallesi , R. ornatissimum and R. deverianum ; and the Upper Turonian Subprionocyclus neptuni and Cremnoceramus waltersdorfensis / Prionocyclus germari zones. The Lower Turonian zonal scheme given by WIEDMANN (1979a) for the Estella area is shown to be impracticable, and neither Lower Turonian Choffaticeras quaasi Zone sensu SANTAMARIA (1992) nor a Watinoceras coloradoense Zone sensu LAMOLDA & al . (1989) can be recognized. On the other hand, the refined French Middle Turonian ammonite zonation of AMEDRO & al . (1982) is readily applicable, while the application of a Collignoniceras woollgari Zone is hardly possible. The base of the Middle Turonian has been placed at the FAD of K. turoniense , at a level stratigraphically lower (upper Lower Turonian) than the one recently accepted. C. woollgari is rare and appears no lower than the ornatissimum Zone. The base of the Upper Turonian is placed at the FAD of Subprionocyclus neptuni . Romaniceras deverianum appears considerably lower than the former, but has its main occurrence in the neptuni Zone, ranging up to overlap with Prionocyclus germari . The Barranca succession is condensed and includes hiati from the Upper Cenomanian Neocardioceras juddii Zone to the upper ganuzai / nodosoides Zone; between the Middle Turonian kallesi and ornatissimum zones; and in the lower Upper Turonian neptuni Zone. Twelve bio-events that are significant for regional and inter-regional correlations are differentiated and dated: the Mytiloides kossmati , ganuzai , reveliereanus , turoniense / hercynicus , kallesi / ornatissimum , Scaphites geinitzii , Subprionocyclus I, Micraster ex gr. normanniaecortestudinarium , Subprionocyclus II events. Most of these events are time-equivalents of events already recognised by ERNST & al. (1983) in Germany. The biostratigraphic framework permits a dating and correlation of the major tectono-sedimentary and eustato-events, namely the Cenomanian-Turonian Boundary Event (CTBE), the Middle Turonian Event (MTE) and Lower Upper Turonian Event (LUTE). The calcareous Coniacian - Santonian succession of the eastern Barranca (Izurdiaga, Ecay and Zuazu sections), is divided into Lower Izurdiaga, Zuazu and Upper Izurdiaga formations, and into numerous component members. The succession is rich in echinoids, and is biostratigraphically important because of the co-occurrence of inoceramids and ammonites. The Coniacian ammonite assemblages show affinities to those of the French type region and to the largely endemic ones of the Spanish standard sections in Burgos. The data obtained permit a confident correlation of the biostratigraphic frameworks of these two areas for the first time. In contrast to the widespread basal Coniacian hiatus, the Barranca succession at this level is locally relatively complete. The lower Coniacian Cremnoceramus rotundatus , Forresteria petrocoriensis and Peroniceras subtricarinatum zones, the Middle Coniacian Gauthiericeras margae Zone and the lower Upper Coniacian Protexanites bourgeoisi Zone are recognized. In marginal sections, the bourgeoisi Zone is followed by an hiatus which comprises the late Upper Coniacian Magadiceramus subquadratus and the Lower Santonian Cladoceramus undulatoplicatus inoceramid zones recognized in the continuous section of the western Barranca. By means of ammonites, the Santonian at Olazagutia is divided into an unnamed interval devoid of ammonites; the middle Coniacian Texanites quiquenodosus and the Upper Santonian Jouaniceras hispanicum / Scalarites cingulatum Zone. This scheme has affinities with the zonation applied by KENNEDY & al. (1995) in the Corbieres, France. In addition to a sequence of regionally important events and marker-beds, some events, namely the Didymotis II, Micraster ex gr. cortestudinarium and Cladoceramus undulatoplicatus events, are of inter-basinal importance.",

These dark grey mudstones contain calcareous nannoplankton belonging to the Aquitanian NN1 zone, which can be correlated with the Egerian Stage of the Central Paratethys. The marine mudstones are underlain by conglomerates and sandy-silty deposits of Oligocene age, which overlapped the Early Palaeozoic-Precambrian platform basement. The conglomerates display features of fan delta deposits, and were supplied with material derived from erosion of the uplifted part of platform basement (Cieszyn-Slavkov Ridge). The Egerian mudstones from the Andrychow 6 borehole, and the Eggenburgian Zebrzydowice Formation known from the Karvina and Cieszyn area, reflect a progressive flooding of the European Platform during the Egerian/Eggenburgian transgression.

    "abstract": "Campanian to Lower Maastrichtian strata of the eastern Barranca (Navarra, northern Spain), based on 11 exposures near Irurzun, were investigated in detail and correlated with coeval strata of the western Barranca and the Oroz-Betelu Massif (Navarra). The Sarasate Formation exposed in the Barranca is divided into ten members. Deposition was influenced by uplift of the Anoz-Ollo salt structure during the latest Santonian and Early Campanian. The Campanian – Maastrichtian of Navarra is characterised by thick and relatively complete successions containing biostratigraphically significant fossil groups (ammonites, inoceramids, echinoids). Detailed bed-by-bed collecting has enabled the establishment of an integrated zonal scheme with potential for interbasinal correlation. In addition to local peak, partial range and assemblage zones, based on echinoids and ammonite – echinoid assemblages, an ammonite zonation, based on an unnamed interval and the following 10 partial range (PRZ) and assemblage zones (AZ) of Scaphites hippocrepis III, S. hippocrepis  III/ Menabites spp., Hoplitoplacenticeras marroti , Trachyscaphites spiniger , Pseudoxybeloceras phaleratum ,  Nostoceras ( Bostrychoceras ) polyplocum , Trachyscaphites pulcherrimus , N . ( Didymoceras ) archiacianum ,  N . ( Nostoceras ) hyatti , and Pachydiscus neubergicus / Pachydiscus epiplectus , is presented. The ammonite zonation markedly refines both the existing regional and the so-called European standard zonal schemes. Correlation with other Spanish areas (Cantabria, Burgos and Guipuzcoa), the Aquitaine (France), Westphalia and Lower Saxony (Germany) and the Vistula valley (Poland) is discussed. Twelve of the recognised bio-events, characterised by mass-occurrences of irregular echinoids and of monospecific, or taxonomically more variable, mostly heteromorph ammonite assemblages, are significant for regional correlation. Three Offaster maxima are of interbasinal importance as they can be correlated to Germany, Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The origin of these bio-events is closely related to the transgressive and regressive pulses recognised in Navarra, of which the pomeli Transgression I and the hippocrepis , subglobosa  and polyplocum regressions are the most pronounced. The tectonic phase at the Santonian/Campanian boundary is related to the Wernigerode Phase. The onset of the second phase is placed in the lower Upper Campanian marroti Zone, the onset of a third phase (UCTE) in the upper Upper Campanian polyplocum  Zone.",

These changes are expressed by eleven (from A to K) climatic cycles. Each of them comprised a glaciation and a following interglacial. The number and duration of these cycles seem to support their possible correlation with 110-90 kyrs astronomic cycles. In the older cycles (from F to K) there were presumably more glaciations and separating interglacials than accepted at present. Grouping either of two or three climatic cycles into megacycles is presumably due to the varied duration of the former, either because of shorter interglacials (e.g. Eemian) or glaciations (e.g. Liviecian). The recognition of climatic megacycles could result from grouping some Pleistocene glaciations into megaglaciations in order to establish close correlation to the classic scheme of the Alpine glaciations.",

The feldspars contain numerous inclusions of minerals (mainly plagioclases), which form inner rims, marking successive zones of megacryst growth, and they are surrounded by a plagioclase mantle (rapakivi texture). Although, due to maturation and coarsening, the feldspars display a heterogeneous exsolutions pattern, in the core part some homogeneous sectors (without visible decomposition) are also preserved. Chemical composition of alkali feldspar megacrysts (including barium concentration) and of plagioclases (inner inclusions and mantle) has been determined and used for evaluation of thermal conditions of melt crystallization. The highest calculated temperature for single equilibrium and close-to-equilibrium pairs of un-decomposed domains in alkali feldspar + plagioclase inclusion ranges 809-750 o C. The differences in crystallization temperature calculated for the pairs alkali feldspar domains (megacryst) and plagioclase inclusions from successive inner rims or for the pairs alkali feldspar domains (megacryst) – plagioclase mantle varied within 100 o C. Common lack of equilibrium for neighbouring pairs of plagioclase inclusion – alkali feldspar is noticeable. Growth morphologies of plagioclases (inclusions and mantle) and alkali feldspar have been proved by means of CL. Mostly the feldspars display signs of resorption and re-growth at many stages of their formation. The barium concentration in the feldspars also points to discontinuous growth. The crystallization path of the megacrysts and the formation of rapakivi texture were influenced by magma mixing, not by decompression processes.",

    "abstract": "A detailed stratigraphic log of the 28 m thick Cenomanian succession at Zilly (Sachsen-Anhalt) is presented. The succession is composed of 11 m of middle Cenomanian hemi-pelagic marl–limestone alternations (‘Planer Limestones’) grading into 15 m of upper Cenomanian calcareous pelagites (‘Poor rhotomagense Limestones’) unconformably overlain by 1.5 m of red-coloured marly clays and limestones (‘Rotplaner’). The proof of the interregional marker beds of the Pycnodonte  Event at the 11 m level, the Facies Change at 26 m, and the base of the plenus Bed at 26.9 m allow a bio-/chronostratigraphic correlation of these levels with the middle/upper Acanthoceras jukesbrownei Zone (upper middle Cenomanian), the Calycoceras ( Proeucalycoceras ) guerangeri / Metoicoceras geslinianum Zone transition, and the lower Metoicoceras geslinianum  Zone, respectively (middle upper Cenomanian). Litho-/microfacies and sequence stratigraphic analyses indicate an overall increase of pelagic influence up to the Facies Change. This retrogradational trend was shortly interrupted by the  Pycnodonte Event, the base of which correlates with the late middle Cenomanian sequence boundary SB Ce IV and the succeeding transgressive surface. The Facies Change indicates a significant mid-late Cenomanian sea-level fall (sequence boundary SB Ce V), followed by more shallow water Rotplaner deposition. The Pycnodonte Event is very thick and proximal in character at Zilly. Its monospecific oyster fauna consists of small pycnodonteines assigned to Pycnodonte ( Phygraea )  vesicularis (LAMARCK) vesiculosa (J. SOWERBY), a secondarily free-lying oyster which lived as a ‘cup-shaped recliner’. The patchy occurrence of the oysters, the sorting and partial damage of valves prior to final burial along with significant supply of terrigenous materials suggest episodically elevated water energy and strong environmental stress during deposition of the Pycnodonte Event. This situation promoted colonization of the sea-floor by, and reproductive success of the inferred eurytopic oyster. The Pycnodonte Event is a classic example of an ‘onlapping bioevent’, the formation of which was controlled by different factors such as sea-level rise, terrigenous influx, environmental stress, and preferential preservation.",

Above the bone bed, there is a rapid drop in gyrogonite abundance. This could have been caused by changes in environmental conditions: increase in salinity, or increase in water energy.

Vegetation cover was probably patchy due to low amount of precipitation. -There is no indication of contemporaneous continental glaciation, however small ice-caps may have grown on tops of stratovolcanoes and in high mountain groups. The Early Tertiary saw climatic and environmental conditions initially similar to the precedent ones. Increase in amount of rainfall with time resulted in wide spreading of vegetation cover, with Nothofagus forests rich in fern undergrowth, including tree ferns, and with Araucaria, during Palaeocene and Eocene, followed by Nothofagus -podocarp forests poorer in fern undergrowth during Oligocene. Climatic seasonality is well marked in petrified wood logs as annual growth-rings. Terrestrial animaI life (marsupials, large birds) is recorded at the beginning of PaIaeogene. There is no indication of continental glaciation in the Antarctic Peninsula sector during the whole Palaeogene. The uppermost Oligocene plant-bearing beds (dated at about 24.5 Ma) still evidence a non-glacial -climate. There are, however, evidences from lahar-type debris-flow agglomerates of existence of local ice-caps on tops of stratovolcanoes. The onset of continental glaciation (ice-sheet at sea level) in the Antarctic Peninsula sector, :slightly post-dates the Oligocene/Miocene boundary. Early Miocene brachiopod-bearing shallow-marine sediments contain pieces of carbonized wood, and are still devoid of convincing glacial climate indicators. The succeeding Early Miocene highly fossiliferous glacio-marine strata are ;crowded with iceberg-rafted debris, often of large dimensions, of Antarctic continent provenance. Andesite dykes which cut through these strata have been K-Ar dated at about 20 Ma. The K-Ar dating of the geological events leaves a narrow bracket for the onset of continental glaciation in :the Antarctic Peninsula sector at between 24 and 20 Ma.",

    "abstract": "The oolitic/pisolitic dolostones of the Late Precambrian Dunoyane Member (Hoferpynten Dolomite Formation) in south Spitsbergen reveal a set of features attributable to a physico-chemical accretion of the ooids/pisoids, the enormous size of which (attaining 9.7 mm in diameter for simple ooids, and up to 15 mm for complex ooids) is assumed to have resulted from a profuse ,carbonate precipitation, possibly of primary dolomite. Under such conditions, the accretionary bodies were prevented more effectively from abrasion, and were kept in suspension longer than in present-day calcium-carbonate oolitic environments. The environmental model of the Dunoyane oolites is reconstructed as comprising a pattern of facies from the shallow subtidal through the supratidal zones, the latter being evidenced by the formation of half-moon ooids that owed their structure to a dissolution of some envelopes, composed of soluble salts, presumably calcium sulphates (anhydrite or gypsum). The final sedimentation occurred in a subtidal zone, to which all the recognized inter- or supratidal deposits underwent redeposition. This facies pattern is compared to the present-day Bahamian oolite facies, and a conclusion as to the composition of its Precambrian equivalents is presented. The study of diagenetic deformations in the Dunoyane ooids shows them as being mostly confined to pressure solution (pitted, cracked, snouted, and distorted ooids). The commonly known distorted ooids appear to result from subsequent deformations of the pressure-solution contacts in ooids if the latter were pinch-and-swelled and contorted under conditions typical of sedimentary boudinage.",

High 18 O/ 16 O, D/H ratios and probably high boron concentration are due to the presence of metamorphic water. Concentration of calcium, magnesium, strontium and probably other divalent metals as well as silica seems to be governed by mineralogical control, being in this case the form of buffering by solid carbonates. Alkaline metals fit rather perfectly the dilution pattern, though, it is modified by rock dissolution and other geochemical processes. The behaviour of halogens follows the trend of alkaline metals dilution.

The three distinct varve types (A, B, C) were deposited in proximal, intermediate, and distal zones of the basin, respectively. The so-called composite varves may also occur within deposits of the intermediate and distal zones. Interseasonal lamination in light layers of the varves is interpreted as a reflection of subordinate rhythms in terrigenic influx and wave activity. The sediment type, distribution of sedimentary structures, and occurrence of inset sections is indicative of a complex and multistage development of the varve fades in the Warsaw Ice-Dammed Lake during the younger Pleistocene.",

    "abstract": "THE SUDETES THERMAL WATERS SUMMARY Occurrence, origin and perspectives of prospection for thermal waters in the Sudetes are dealt with in the paper. The Sudetes are considered as a whole, nevertheless, particular attention has been given to the areas within the boundaries of Poland. Thermal waters occurring in form of natural springs have been exploited for medical purposes since several centuries. They gave origin to such health resorts as Cieplice, Janske Lazne, Lądek, Velke Losiny and Bludov. In all the above localities the waters occur within crystalline rocks of Precambrian or Paleozoic age (Fig. 1.). During recent years an increased demand caused a necessity to perform several boreholes in order to increase the water resources. Such drillings have been pierced at Cieplice, Lądek and Velke Losiny and gave positive even sensational results. The thermal waters of the Sudetes are characterized by small general minerallisation (Table 1) (usually less than 1000 mg/l, in some cases less than 200 mg/1) and by increased fluorium content (up to 12 mg/l), silicium content (up to 120 mg/l H 2 Si0 3 ), and sometimes by content of sulphuretted hydrogen (up to 5 mg H 2 S+HS - ) and the tiosulphate ion as well as in some cases by increased radioactivity (up to 22 nCi/l). AImost all the waters show increased pH values (7.5–9). Nitrogen prevails in their gas composition (over 90%). Temperatures of waters from natural springs do not exceed 45° centigrade (Cieplice), whereas the maximal temperature of natural outflow obtained from the depth of 750 m in a borehole at Cieplice was 63°C (Table 2). Waters of temperature higher than normal occur in other localities in the Sudetes as well. They are more mineralized than those mentioned above which is connected with considerable amounts of CO 2 (Duszniki) or with occurrence of sedimentary rocks above the crystalline aquifer (Batnovice). Both chemical and gas composition of the thermal waters and the results of isotope investigations (D, 18 O, 32 S, 14 C, T) point to infiltration origin. The age of warmest water at Lądek and Cieplice that occur in natural springs has been defined as early Holocene and late Pleistocene (Table 3). Higher helium quantities in relation to nitrogen as compared to air composition indirectly prove the conclusion about infiltration of those waters at times mentioned above. Relative enrichment in helium proves long period of underground flow. Reckoning from SiO 2 content it may be assumed that only in such sites where it exceeds 50 mg/I the water has attained temperature higher than 100° centigrade during flow (Fig. 3). Such situation is to be noted at Cieplice and at Czerniawa where actually cold carbonated waters occur. Basing on the analysis of results of all investigations done so far and geological premises it may be concluded that much greater resources of thermal waters do occur in the crystalline formations of the Sudetes than those known up to date and exploited although no positive anomalies of heat flow density have been observed in the region. The zones in which such resources may be expected at depth not exceeding 2000 m are: the Karkonosze granite and its metemorphic cover, southwestern margin of the Central Sudetic depression and the Nysa Klodzka Graben (the Kudowa granite, metamorphic formations of the Bystrzyckie and Orlickie Mts), the Zlote Gory Mts, the Snieznik Massif, the Hruby Jesenik Massif and some areas of the Foresudtic Block.",

The water chemistry varies from fresh calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate groundwater at the recharge area to calciumsodium-sulphate mineral water downwards the basin. Geochemical mass balance modelling confirms that the main chemistry features of the sulphate mineral water are controlled by dedolomitization and calcium common-ion effects. Congruent dissolution of gypsum promotes incongruent dissolution of dolomite with calcite precipitation. Cation exchange between Ca 2+ (and Mg 2+ ) solutes and Na + (and K + ) also takes place. The sulphate mineral water shows elevated concentrations of numerous trace elements. Iron, zinc and manganese originate from dissolution of carbonates (dolomite and/or siderite) and/or sulphides. The hydrogeological system studied should be considered as a series of individual flow systems. The results of preliminary geochemical modelling corroborate the role of mixing in the formation of the spatial pattern of the aqueous chemistry in the system. The main factor that controls groundwater chemistry is the mixing of two components: modern (tritium-bearing) fresh water and older (pre-bomb Holocene) sulphate mineral water.",

The excessive development of alimentary area in agnostiids is a character shared with extant arthropods feeding on fluids, and in combination with the flattened shape this indicates that agnostids, including Trinodus , were ectoparasitic.

Palaeoenvironmental significance of iron carbonate concretions from the Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) ore-bearing clays at Gnaszyn, Krakow-Silesia Homocline, Poland. Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (3), 307-324. Warszawa. Iron carbonate concretion horizons are characteristic features of the Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) claystone-mudstone succession at Gnaszyn. They occur in single horizons, which generally represent the same genetic type. The siderite concretions are the main type of iron carbonate concretions at Gnaszyn; a second type is represented by phosphate-siderite concretions. On the basis of the fieldwork, and their petrographical and mineralogical characteristics, the genesis of the concretions and their palaeoenvironmental significance is discussed. The results of this study (based on the localization, mode of occurrence, mineralogy of iron carbonate concretions and also the textural relationship between the concretions and host sediment layers) suggest an early diagenetic origin of the concretions. The preferential occurrence of the concretion horizons in single layers in the ambient sediments was associated with particular conditions of their deposition and early diagenesis, favored by a slower sedimentation rate and more intense bioturbation, and related primarily to the greater availability of reactive iron ions. From the viewpoint of physicochemical conditions the horizons with iron carbonate concretions in the study area reflect the redox boundary between oxic/bioturbated and anoxic/non-bioturbated zones. The conditions favoring the formation of such horizons was possibly due to longer periods of diminished sedimentation rate when the redox boundary remained in the same position within the sediment.",

This paper reports the results of X-ray diffraction quantitative mineralogical studies of the clay-rich Middle Jurassic sedimentary rocks from Gnaszyn, central Poland and their palaeoenvironmental interpretation. The palaeoenvironmental interpretation is aided by the fact that the sediments have not been significantly altered by diagenesis. The mineral composition is uniform throughout the succession: quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, calcite, gypsum, anhydrite, pyrite, illite, kaolinite, chlorite, and glauconite. The clay assemblage is dominated by illite, which alone accounts for about 20 wt% of the total mineral content. Kaolinite amounts usually &lt;10 wt% and chlorite and glauconite occur in subordinate quantities. The clay mineral assemblage is largely of detrital origin and indicates rather cool and/or dry climatic conditions favouring mechanical erosion of the source rocks.",

Trace fossils were studied and graphically represented by preeminent naturalists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Konrad Gesner, Johann Bauhin and UlisseAldrovandi – who defined ichnofossils as “exceptionally beautiful”. In this study, the representation of trace fossils in the Renaissance is explored by employing a method widely used in studying visual perception – fractal geometry. In particular, this paper focuses on the reasons for the aesthetic appeal of traces and proves that (1) the aesthetic perception of traces is closely tied to their fractal dimension, and (2) many traces are aesthetically appealing because they have fractal behaviour.  In particular, graphoglyptids and chondritids display significant fractal-like features that are linked with their constructional program and function. Such fractal traces are hierarchically structured and their whole geometric structure can be regarded as an expression of self-organization processes producing correlations between different orders of scale.",

Primary REE-enriched fluorapatite and fluorbritholite-(Ce) in nepheline syenite from the Mariupol Massif (SE Ukraine), contain textural and chemical evidence of late- to post-magmatic metasomatic alteration. REE mobilization and replacement of the primary phases by fluid-mediated coupled dissolution-reprecipitation strongly depended on the distance between the altered minerals in the host rock. Fluorapatite and fluorbritholite-(Ce) forming individual pristine grains were partially replaced by the same phase with a new composition, resulting in the presence of patchy zoning in altered grains. The increased REE contents in altered fluorapatite rim domains are related to REE mobilization from the altered REE-depleted rim domains of the fluorbritholite-(Ce). The REEs were transported by a fluid with high F activity. The alteration of fluorapatite and fluorbritholite-(Ce) grains in contact resulted in the partial replacement of the primary phases by the same phase with a new composition, but also in the partial replacement of the fluorapatite by secondary monazite and fluorite. The REE mobilized from the fluorbritholite-(Ce) in the presence of a F-rich fluid in an alkali-rich system promoted formation of monazite as the new phosphate REE-host. The presence of secondary parisite in the altered domains of the fluorapatite and fluorbritholite-(Ce) indicates a CO 2 component in the fluid during metasomatic alteration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lukeneder, A. and Grunert, P. 2013. Palaeoenvironmental evolution of the Southern Alps across the Faraoni Level equivalent: new data from the Trento Plateau (Upper Hauterivian, Dolomites, N. Italy). Acta Geologica Polonica, 63 (1), 89-104. Warszawa. New stratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental data are presented for the northeastern part of the Trento Plateau (Puez area, Southern Alps, Italy). The studied section corresponds to the upper Hauterivian Balearites balearis and “Pseudothurmannia ohmi” ammonite zones and normal palaeomagnetic chron upper M5. A c. 30-cm-thick bed is identified as the equivalent of the Faraoni Level, based on its position within the Pseudothurmannia mortilleti Subzone, the composition of its ammonite fauna and the peak of a minor positive trend in the δ 13 C bulk record. Microfacies and geochemical proxies compare well with those of the southeastern part of the Trento Plateau and indicate palaeoceanographic continuity along the eastern margin of the plateau. The abundances of radiolarians and nannoconids suggest a turnover in the trophic structure from eutrophic conditions around the Faraoni Level equivalent to oligotrophic conditions. Low organic matter and sulphur content and frequent bioturbation indicate a well-oxygenated environment. Ammonite diversity and life-habitat groups document the influence of sea level on the plateau: while epi- and mesopelagic ammonites occur commonly during sea-level highstands, all life-habitat groups become reduced during a sea-level lowstand in the Spathicrioceras seitzi and P. ohmi subzones. The Faraoni event is heralded by a faunal turnover expressed as the diversification of epipelagic ammonites. Palaeoenvironmental conditions along the eastern margin of the Trento Plateau during the Faraoni event contrast with those of the organic-rich black shales in the west. A re-evaluation of the depositional model based on the new results suggests a general water depth of 300-500 m for the plateau. The severe reduction of mesopelagic ammonites during the sea-level lowstand indicates a shallowing towards the epi-/mesopelagic boundary. During the Faraoni event, the eastern areas of the Trento Plateau were located at the upper limit of the oxygen-minimum layer and were thus only occasionally affected by oxygen depletion, whereas the western areas were located well within the upper part of the oxygen-depleted layer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Ordovician sedimentary succession of the Pol-e Khavand area, situated on the northern margin of the Yazd block, has important differences from those in other parts of Central Iran. It has been established that the presumably terminal Cambrian to Lower Ordovician volcano-sedimentary Polekhavand Formation, exposed in the Pol-e Khavand area, has non-conformable contact with greenschists of the Doshakh Metamorphic Complex. The succeeding, mainly siliciclastic Chahgonbad Formation contains low to moderately diverse faunal assemblages, including brachiopods, cephalopods, trilobites and tentaculitids. The Darriwilian age of the lower part of the formation is well established by the co-occurrence of brachiopod genera Camerella, Phragmorthis, Tritoechia and Yangtzeella. The associated rich cephalopod fauna is different from the Darriwilian cephalopod associations of the Alborz terrane and may show some affinity with warm water faunas of North China and South Korea. It is likely that the Mid Ordovician fauna recovered from the lower part of the Chahgonbad Formation settled in the area sometime during a warming episode in the late Darriwilian. By contrast the low diversity mid Katian brachiopod association includes only three taxa, which occur together with the trilobite Vietnamia cf. teichmulleri and abundant, but poorly preserved tentaculitids questionably assigned to the genus Costatulites. This faunal association bears clear signatures linking it to the contemporaneous cold water faunas of the Arabian, Mediterranean and North African segments of Gondwana. Four brachiopod species recovered from the Chahgonbad Formation, including Hibernodonta lakhensis, Hindella prima, Lomatorthis? multilamellosa and Yangtzeella chupananica are new to science.",

The current state of knowledge of the Silurian in the Zagros Basin, Alborz, Kopet-Dagh and Talysh regions, as well as in a few areas scattered across the Sabzevar Zone, and the Sanandaj-Sirjan terranes is also reviewed. Silurian volcanism in various parts of Iran is briefly discussed. The end of the Ordovician coincided with a widespread regression across Iran synchronous with the Hirnantian glaciation, and only in the Zagros Basin is there a continuous Ordovician-Silurian transition represented by graptolitic black shales of the Sarchahan Formation. In the Central-East Iranian Platform marine sedimentation re-commenced in the early to mid Aeronian. By the Sheinwoodian, carbonate platform depositional environments were established along its north-eastern margin. In other parts of Iran (e.g., Kopet-Dagh and the Sabzevar Zone), siliciclastic sedimentation continued probably into the late Silurian. The Silurian conodont and brachiopod biostratigraphy of Central Iran is significantly updated facilitating a precise correlation with the Standard Global Chronostratigraphic Scale, as well as with key Silurian sections in other parts of Iran. The Silurian lithostratigraphy is considerably revised and two new lithostratigraphical units, namely the Boghu and Dahaneh-Kalut formations, are introduced.",

The cladoceran-based temperature reconstructions reflect cold conditions during the Younger Dryas (YD) and allow a division of this period into two phases: an older colder phase, between 12,800 and 12,000 cal yrs BP, and a younger, warmer phase, between ca. 12,000 and 11,500 cal yrs BP. The geomorphological features of the study sites and local environmental forces are also taken into consideration.

Tectonic features of the south-eastern margin of the Orava Basin and the adjoining part of the fore-arc Central Carpathian Palaeogene Basin were studied. Field observations of mesoscopic structures, analyses of digital elevation models and geological maps, supplemented with electrical resistivity tomography surveys were performed. Particular attention was paid to joint network analysis. The NE-SW-trending Krowiarki and Hruštinka-Biela Orava sinistral fault zones were recognized as key tectonic features that influenced the Orava Basin development. They constitute the north-eastern part of a larger Mur-Mürz-Žilina fault system that separates the Western Carpathians from the Eastern Alps. The interaction of these sinistral fault zones with the older tectonic structures of the collision zone caused the initiation and further development of the Orava Basin as a strike-slip-related basin. The Krowiarki Fault Zone subdivides areas with a different deformation pattern within the sediments of the Central Carpathian Palaeogene Basin and was active at least from the time of cessation of its sedimentation in the early Miocene. Comparison of structural data with the recent tectonic stress field, earthquake focal mechanisms and GPS measurements allows us to conclude that the Krowiarki Fault Zone shows a stable general pattern of tectonic activity for more than the last 20 myr and is presently still active.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The lower part of the Frasnian succession in the Radlin Syncline (Kielce–Łagów Synclinorium, southern region of the Holy Cross Mountains), in the two studied successions: Józefka at Górno and (for the first time) Radlin, consists of the rhythmic marly Szydłówek Beds, the fossil-rich limestones of the Wietrznia Beds (locally) and the atypically developed, calcareous Kostomłoty Beds. The carbon isotope chemostratigraphic pattern overall corresponds well to the global Early–Middle Frasnian biogeochemical perturbation, even if the major punctata positive excursion is only fragmentarily recorded in the Kostomłoty intrashelf basin. Two brachiopod assemblages are abundantly represented in both sections: the Phlogoiderhynchus polonicus Assemblage, typical of the Szydłówek Beds, and the Biernatella lentiformis Assemblage, limited to the middle part of the Wietrznia Beds. Both are highly dominated by the index species. Twenty nine lower Frasnian brachiopod species (Craniida – 1 species, Strophomenida – 1, Productida – 2, Protorthida – 1, Orthida – 5, Pentamerida – 1, Rhynchonellida – 4, Atrypida – 4, Athyridida – 3, Spiriferida – 4, Spiriferinida – 3) are described from the Szydłówek and Wietrznia Beds. Seven new species are introduced: Skenidioides cretus Halamski sp. nov., Biernatium minus Baliński sp. nov., Monelasmina montisjosephi Baliński sp. nov., Atryparia ( Costatrypa ) agricolae Halamski and Baliński sp. nov., Davidsonia enmerkaris Halamski sp. nov., Leptathyris gornensis Baliński sp. nov., and Echinocoelia parva Baliński sp. nov. Davidsonia enmerkaris Halamski sp. nov. is intermediate between Davidsonia Bouchard-Chantereaux, 1849 and Rugodavidsonia Copper, 1996 and is the youngest known representative of the suborder Davidsonioidea Copper, 1996. Skenidioides cretus Halamski sp. nov. is the last representative of the genus. Statistical investigation of a large sample of Spinatrypina ( Exatrypa ) explanata did not confirm the existence of two dimorphic forms, coarse- and fine-ribbed. The high-diversity Biernatella lentiformis Assemblage is quite dissimilar to coeval brachiopod assemblages described heretofore from the Holy Cross Mountains region. It is interpreted as consisting of mostly parautochthonous dwellers of deep-slope muddy habitats and a local, occasionally storm-agitated, intra-basin brachiopod-crinoid-coral shoal. The fauna was adapted probably to cooler and nutrient-poor waters during an initial phase of the severe carbon cycle perturbation.",

The palaeoecological analysis of these two assemblages indicates the presence of eight different guilds, of which epifaunal suspension feeders (fixo-sessile and libero-sessile guilds), comprising approximately half of the trophic nucleus of the lower interval, increased to a dominant 86% in the upper interval, including a considerable proportion of rhynchonelliform brachiopods. It is tempting to relate this shift from the lower to the upper interval to an increase in nutrient supply and/or a shallowing of the depositional environment but further data including geochemical proxies are needed to fully understand the macrofossil distribution patterns in the Lower Maastrichtian of Kronsmoor.",

In the north the Żegocina zone borders on the Czchow anticline, a tectonic element of the Silesian nappe, while in the south and east it is bounded by the Magura nappe. Upper Cretaceous and Palaeogene deposits of the Sub-Silesian nappe, as well as Lower Cretaceous rocks of the Silesian nappe, build the geology of the Żegocina zone. Upper Cretaceous beds of the Sub-Silesian series consist of three distinct facies which may be regarded as stratigraphic members. These facies are: a) grey marls with exotics, b) variegated marls with Żegocina marls, c) glauconitic sandstones from Rajbrot as well as sandstones and conglomerates from Rybie. In the Upper Cretaceous different diastrophic phenomena occurred in the sedimentation basin of the Żegocina zone, such as the emergence of an island, accompanying volcanic disturbances, etc. These processes constitute a stage directly followed by Laramide orogeny. Two main dislocation zones embracing the southern limb of the Czchow anticline were formed after the overthrusting of the Silesian nappe onto the Sub-Silesian unit. The longitudinal Żegocina dislocation stretches somewhat obliquely to the axis of that anticline. The transversal dislocation of Rajbrot covered by the Magura nappe has a north-south direction. Along these faults the western part of the southern limb of the Czchow anticline has been considerably uplifted in relation to the eastern part. Tortonian erosion processes denuded the younger rocks of the Silesian series in the uplifted area down Lower Cretaceous strata, locally even stripping off those of the Sub-Silesian series. Tortonian sediments occurring at Żegocina (Opolian substage?) were deposited on the eroded surface of the Żegocina zone to be subsequently subjected to simultaneous folding.",

The Salides embrace the marginal element mantled by the Miocene salt formation and constituting depth element hidden under the exterior Carpathians. When drawing conclusions as to the tectonics of the Carpathian Mts., the present writer has taken into consideration the recent gravimetric and seismographic data as well as latest evidence supplied by deep borings in Western Carpathians. Some inferences concerning the history of Carpathian orogeny end up the paper.

I hoped that not all the profiles with interglacial sediments in Poland may be found in such a confused stratigraphical situation that the interpretation of their age would need correction. The study of the recent Polish and foreign literature enabled me to get certain correlations first of all between the Quaternary of the Niemen basin, investigated with my co-operation; and the territory of Poland on the one hand, and also between Poland and the west and east of Europe - on the other.",

This study examines ten disarticulated plates from different parts of the body of S. olenkae: paramedian, lateral, ventral and appendicular osteoderms. The armour of S. olenkae has a diploe structure composed of layers of external and basal cortex surrounding an internal cancellous core. In the basal layer of the osteoderms, bundles of Sharpey’s fibres and skeletochronological structures are present. The internal structures of the osteoderms indicate extensive remodelling processes, and the weak vascularization and bone tissues that constitute the plates – lamellar bone and parallel-fibred bone – suggest considerable mechanical resistance. Elements of the armour’s osteology adapted to distribute and reduce mechanical stress might provide confirmation of the protective function of the armour as well.",

    "abstract": "A wide stratigraphic gap spanning the middle Miaolingian to early Tremadocian in the succession of the northern Małopolska Block, exposed in the southern Kielce Region of the Holy Cross Mountains in south-central Poland, was hitherto indicated as the key argument for its different tectonic evolution compared to the adjacent northern Łysogóry Block. As these two blocks form part of the Trans-European Suture Zone, deciphering their early Palaeozoic history has profound impact on our understanding of the evolution of this major Central European tectonic domain. Based on data from the Lenarczyce PIG 1 well (Kielce Region), we analyse here the stratigraphy and sedimentary record of the upper Cambrian in the Holy Cross Mountains. Rich acritarch assemblages coupled with rare macrofossil specimens from this well indicate the presence of a Miaolingian and Furongian succession showing different tectonic styles and separated by a stratigraphic gap. The stratigraphic gap separating these successions spans the middle to late Miaolingian and the early to middle Furongian, and it has proved to be much narrower than previously considered. The upper Furongian siliciclastic succession recognised here can be defined as a shallow-water flood-dominated delta system, developed after the tectonic event responsible for the intense deformation of the lower and middle Cambrian strata. In the latest Furongian, this sedimentary system passed rapidly upwards into an offshore mud belt produced by a relative sea-level rise (transgressive event). The unconformity at the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary in the southern Holy Cross Mountains is shown to be of a complex nature resulting from pre-Furongian folding and thrusting, and post-Furongian changes of relative sea-level/accommodation space.",

This paper presents the results of investigation of fluid inclusions in celestine from the Tarnobrzeg native sulphur deposits (SE Poland). Several different morphological types of celestine were selected from Machów open-pit mine. Study of the fluid inclusions has been carried out using microscopic and microthermometic methods. The data show that two types of chloride fluids were responsible for the formation of celestine and native sulphur and further transformation of the native sulphur deposits. The first type of fluid, containing a relatively higher salt content and lower NaCl/CaCl2 ratio, also points to the role of hydrocarbons during the formation of native sulphur deposits. The second type of fluid contains a relatively lower amount of salt and a higher NaCl/CaCl2 proportion and reflects the subsequent evolution of the chemistry of the fluids forming the deposits. The results of the study of fluid inclusions in celestine are in good agreement with its stable isotope composition.",

Abundant material of the scalpellid Scalpellum multangulatum (Lea, 1843) permits the first description of all the plates of this species and allows a reconstruction to be made. A new species of Membranobalanus Hoek, 1913, M. distortus sp. nov., a genus which has an obligate relationship with clionaid sponges, represents only the second fossil record of this extant genus. New records of the extinct whale barnacle Coronula bifida Bronn, 1931 are the first from the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the eastern USA and indicate that the migration paths of humpback whales in the Pliocene ran close to the palaeocoastline. The material includes the only known juvenile specimens of the species and allows reconstruction of the ontogeny of C. bifida. We report the second and third North American occurrences of the verrucid barnacle Verruca stroemia (O.F. Müller, 1778) and the second known record of Fistulobalanus multiseptatus (Ross, 1964). The barnacle assemblage represents a warm water fauna, brought into the region during the Mid-Piacenzian Warm Period by the basal Rushmere Member transgression at 3.25 Ma.

Species described previously in adequate detail and specimens from our collection display great morphological diversity. This and the lack of data on intraspecific variability for most species described so far resulted in the introduction here of six new species (Dibunophylloides differentialis, D. parcus, D. colligatus, D. similis, D. infirmis and D. complexus). An additional species is identified as Dibunophylloides cf. valeriae (Newell, 1935) and four species are left in open nomenclature. Stressful extrinsic conditions, documented by common rejuvenations and possibly variegated micro-environmental niches on the one hand and close relationships of specimens on the other hand are suggested as responsible for the large morphological variability and repetitions of some skeletal features across species. Dibunophylloides supplements a group of genera suggested by Fedorowski (2023) as having originated in the Paleotethyan superprovince before migrating to the North American superprovince. Paleobiogeography, including that based on rugose corals) provides an important tool for tectonic and paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

This technique enables the identification of mineral phases whose chemical composition differs only slightly in the content of individual elements. This is important in the case of carbonate minerals containing magnesium, because as the amount of Mg increases, successive carbonate phases are formed, starting with low-magnesium calcite and ending with magnesite. The following carbonate phases: low-Mg calcite, high-Mg calcite, proto-dolomite, ordered dolomite, de-huntite, huntite and magnesite were identified in samples collected from the Precambrian magnesite rock of the Braszowice deposit of Lower Silesia and the Triassic, Muschelkalk limestones and dolomites of Opole Silesia and Upper Silesia in Poland. Based on the results of the study, the chemical formulas of low-magnesium calcite, high-magnesium calcite, proto-dolomite, ordered dolomite, de-huntite, huntite and magnesite were formulated. The data obtained made it possible to determine the range of magnesium content in the chemical formulas of the identified carbonate phases. In addition, schematic crystal structures of the studied carbonate phases were also developed.",

It is the only known site showing evidence of rarely explored Paleocene shallow-water areas in the Magura Basin. Corallines occur as abraded coralline algal debris and rhodoliths. The upper Paleocene coralline algal debris consists of rounded, sand- to pebble-size clasts. Two types of rhodoliths were distinguished: abraded sub-spheroidal boxwork up to 0.5 cm in diameter, and irregular boxwork rhodoliths larger than 1 cm in diameter. In the coralline algal assemblage, the most abundant component is Sporolithon sp., with subordinate Lithothamnion sp. and Mesophyllum sp. Karpathia sphaerocellulosa and Spongites sp. are also present. Bioerosions, such as Entobia isp., Gastrochaenolites isp., Trypanites isp., and microborings are common in the coralline debris.

Alpha-quartz/moganite flints are associated with the high quartz smectite-mica clay assemblage that probably derived its silica from mainly oceanic sources related possibly to the development of the Atlantic Ocean, and opal-CT flints that are associated with the low-quartz smectite-mica clay assemblage that derived its silica ultimately from the deep weathering of continental rocks on the Mid-European Island. Eight different groups of alpha-quartz/moganite flints are described based on mineralogy, colour, core/cortex definition, size, relationship to bedding, and location. The presence of authigenic paramagnetic and non-paramagnetic minerals demonstrate that certain of these groups of flints developed in the oxic and suboxic diagenetic zones although the majority formed in the anoxic zone. Their major, minor and trace element chemistry is discussed in relation to the timing of their development. A predictive schematic model is put forward linking flint development with diagenesis, burrow-type and the plumbing system of the Chalk.

Such attacks are thus recognized as unsuccessful for the crabs which have given up a further damage of the come-acrossed ammonite shells when having felt them empty. The successful attacks realized in a complete crushing of the ammonite shells, the hashed fragments of which remained dispersed over the seafloor litter. Based on the foregoing, discussed is the relation of the crabs’ attacks to the mortality and, consequently, to the extinction of this ammonite species by the Late Cretaceous decline.

    "abstract": "The predation of the stomatopod crustaceans (oder Stomatopoda, subclass Eumalacostraca, superclass Crustacea) upon diverse gastropods is recognised within the much diversified, shallow-marine communities of the Korytnica Basin (Middle Miocene; souther slopes of the Holy Cross Mountains, Central Poland). The results of both the spearing and smashing activity of stomatopods are evident to documnet diverse methids of their attacks upon the gastropods, and to be well comparable to those recently presented either from the Plio-Pleistocene of Florida, or from the Holocene of Benguela region, off south-western Africa. The reparated (regenerated) injuries in shells, indicative of the stomatopod attacks upon live gastropods, are first recorded from the Geologic Past. The larger damages, that destroy the gastropod shells almost totally, are compared to those produced by predatory crabs. A high precentage (up to 54.4%) of the shells subjected to stomatopod attacks suggests the stopatopod predation to have been of considerable importance in the ecological history of the tropical.subtropical, Indo-Pacific influenced, Korytnica Basin. An overview of the gastropod monographs from other Miocene basins in Europe (the Tethyan Mediterranean, the Atlantic Gulfs, the North Sea Basin, and the so-called Paratethus basins) delivers many examples of shell famages by stomatopods, compatible with those from the Korytnica Basin. All these recognitions extend importantly the range of the predatory behavior of stomatopods down to the Tertiary, precisely to the Miocene epoch, the Korytnica Basin of which is dated as about 15 m.y. ago, close to the Langhian/Serravallian stage boundary in the standard geochronologic scale.",

Interregional stratigraphic correlations are discussed in the paper, especially those between the Tithonian and Volgian Stages.

The dissolution took place within soft, water saturated and not fully consolidated, laminated gypsum, and led not only to the brecciation but to the complicated soft-sediment deformations as well. The dissolution produced the residual thin-grained gypsum or clay deposits within the halite-bearing horizons and, in many cases, the zone of the collapse breccias above. The most characteristic collapse breccias are composed of fragments or blocks of the laminated gypsum, practically without any matrix or cement. The horizontal flow or creep of slurry residual gypsum could take place directly on the sea bottom.",

    "abstract": "Study of Jurassic seawater chemistry comprised has revealed two successive stages of water mass organisation. The first stage, the unstable development of stratified zones, lasting until the mid Oxfordian, was characterised by large fluctuations of sea water temperatures and was interrupted by two episodes of opposite nature. The early Toarcian episode was related to expansion, whereas the Bajocian-Bathonian (B-B) episode was connected to temporary mixing of stratified seawater zones. The next stage, the breakdown of the stratified zones was characterised by stable,relatively warm seawater temperatures; it was also interrupted by boundary events, and depended, increasingly withtime, on oceanic circulation. The presence, development and retreat of stratified zones was manifested by massive CaCO 3 precipitation and CaCO 3 precipitation crises. Thus, interpretation of delta  13 C in terms of burial and reburial of C org in the which requires existence and mixing of stratified seawater zones resulted in secular changes of CaCO 3 saturation states. This led to the picture of a Jurassic aragonitic sea, contrary to the generally accepted model. Those CaCO 3 precipitation crises, emphasised by omission surfaces and specific mineral parageneses,suggested that Phanerozoic carbonate seas could have been suitable sites for reverse weathering. Although geochemical perturbations did not coincide with the major mass extinctions postulated for the Jurassic, they expressed changes, of primary productivity, and in the structure of organic assemblages. These changes as well as detailed palaeoenvironmental conditions, may be monitored by the elemental tracer i.e. Ba concentrations.",

The Boreal character of the ammonite faunas in the epicontinentaI area of Poland, and the Tethyan one in the Tatra Mts are well displayed by the composition of the anaIyzed assemblages. During Middle Albian time the Boreal hoplitids migrated to the Polish areas from the west or north-west, and they gradually spread, through the western Ukraine, towards the High-Tatra Swell located far within the Tethyan Realm (Alpino-Carpathian geosyncline). In the Upper Albian, in spite of an increasing marine transgression, a distinct provincialism became evident both in the Boreal and in the Tethyan ammonite assembIages. This distinction apparently resulted from the depth/distance filter which bad separated the High-Tatra Swell from the platform areas of Poland, a filter which worked more efficiently than . it had during Middle Albian time. This event was of regional character in Europe, and was caused by change in climatic and bathymetrical conditions rather than by the development of physical barriers (lands or cordilleras).",

Most significant there were mass accumulation of a single echinoid species, Psammechinus dubius (L. AGASSIZ, 1840), tests of which preserved spine canopies and Aristotle's lanterns in position. Other echinoids represented were rare, e.g. Spatangus austriacus LAUBE, 1871, 'Giant Psammechinus sp.', Echinocardium peroni COTTEAU, 1877, and Echinocyamus pusillus (O.F. M LLER, 1776). The pit has since been abandoned and recultivated entirely; in view of this an updated review of, and supplement to, previous data on the Świniary biotic assemblages, and their environmental living conditions, is here presented. The mass accumulations of Psammechinus dubius are interpreted to have been of storm origin, i.e. mass transportation and burial of live, or freshly dead, specimens.Hinted at is a predatory activity of the starfish Astropecten forbesi HELLER, 1858, upon juveniles of Psammechinus dubius absent from the storm-related thanatocoenoses. Associated with echinoderms are, amongst other groups, verrucid barnacles Verruca sp. and inarticulate brachiopods Discinisca leopolitana (FRIEDBERG, 1921) derived from eulittoral habitats, as well as pieces of terrestrial amber swept out of the shore.

Although both genera appear to have been euryhaline forms, the hybodont Tribodus occurred in fresh/brackish water habitats (e.g. deltas) to shallow marine lagoons, whereas the ray Pseudohypolophus lived in brackish water to coastal marine environments. Palaeobiogeographically, their global distribution displays two distinct but adjoined areas, with Tribodus being present in the northern part of Gondwana (Brazil and NorthAfrica), and Pseudohypolophus occurring on both sides of the NorthAtlantic (NorthAmerica andWestern Europe). However, the two genera coexisted during Cenomanian times within a small overlap zone, localized in western France. A trophic competition may have arisen from this situation between these two selachians belonging to the same trophic guild. This peculiar situation is well documented within the Cenomanian transgressive series of Charentes (SWFrance), where a turnover between the two forms is observed (replacement of Tribodus by Pseudohypolophus ).",

A revised inoceramid biozonation for the Upper Cretaceous based on high-resolution carbon isotope stratigraphy in northwestern Hokkaido, Japan. Acta Geologica Polonica, 63 (2), 239-263. Warszawa. Biostratigraphic correlations of inoceramid bivalves between the North Pacific and Euramerican provinces have been difficult because the inoceramid biostratigraphy of the Japanese strata has been based on endemic species of the northwest Pacific. In this study, carbon stable isotope fluctuations of terrestrial organic matter are assembled for the Upper Cretaceous Yezo Group in the Haboro and Obira areas, Hokkaido, Japan, in order to revise the chronology of the inoceramid biozonation in Japan. The carbon isotope curves are correlated with those of marine carbonates in English and German sections with the aid of age-diagnostic taxa. According to the correlations of the carbon isotope curves, 11 isotope events are recognised in the sections studied. As a result of these correlations, the chronology of the inoceramid biozones of the Northwest Pacific has been considerably revised. The revised inoceramid biozones suggest that the timing of the origination and extinction of the inoceramids in the North Pacific biotic province is different from the stage/substage boundaries defined by inoceramids, as used in Europe and North America.",

Experimental method for estimation of compaction in the Oxfordian bedded limestones of the southern Krakow-Częstochowa Upland, Southern Poland. Acta Geologica Polonica, 63 (4), 681-696. Warszawa. The Upper Jurassic carbonates exposed in the southern part of the Krakow-Częstochowa Upland are well known for their significant facies diversity related to the presence of microbial and microbial-sponge carbonate buildups and bedded detrital limestone in between. Both the buildups and detrital limestones revealed differential susceptibility to compaction which, apart from differential subsidence of the Palaeozoic basement and synsedimentary faulting, was one of the factors controlling seafloor palaeorelief in the Late Jurassic sedimentary basin. The compaction of the detrital limestones has been estimated with an experimental oedometric method in which specially prepared mixtures made of ground limestones from a quarry in the village of Żary were subjected to oedometer tests. The diameters of the detrital grains and their percentages in the limestones were determined by microscopic examinations of thin sections. The diameters were assigned to predetermined classes corresponding to the Udden-Wentworth scale. The rock samples were then ground down to the grain sizes observed in thin sections. From such materials, mixtures were prepared of grain size distributions corresponding to those observed in thin sections. After adding water the mixtures were subjected to oedometer tests. Analysis of the compression of such mixtures under specific loads enabled preparation of a mathematical formula suitable for the estimation of mechanical compaction of the limestone. The obtained values varied from 27.52 to 55.53% for a load corresponding to 300 metres burial depth. The most significant effect of mechanical compaction was observed for loads representing only 2 metres burial depth. Further loading resulted in a much smaller reduction in sample height. The results of the oedometer tests cannot be used directly to determine compaction of the detrital limestones. Mainly because microscopic observations of thin sections of the experimental material show that chemical compaction was also an important factor influencing thickness reduction of the limestones.",

A total of 30 ammonite species are present, of which two: Forbesiceras reversum and Calycoceras (Newboldiceras) algeriense are new. The fauna allows recognition of the Northwest European upper Lower Cenomanian Mantelliceras dixoni Zone, the succeeding lower Middle Cenomanian Cunningtoniceras inerme Zone, the Acanthoceras rhotomagense Zone and its subzones of Turrilites costatus and Turrilites acutus. The sequence of index species occurs in the same order in both north-eastern Tunisia and the Southerham Grey Pit in Sussex (and indeed elsewhere in Northwest Europe), indicating these to be robust assemblage zones and subzones that can be recognised on both the north and south sides of the Tethys. Other occurrences of taxa that are common in both sections and regions are markedly different, and include the co-occurrence of Cunningtoniceras inerme (Pervinquière, 1907) with Acanthoceras rhotomagense (Brongniart, 1822) in the costatus Subzone in north-eastern Algeria and central Tunisia, the extension of Acompsoceras renevieri (Sharpe, 1857) into the lower Middle Cenomanian in north-eastern Tunisia, whilst the acme of Turrilites scheuchzerianus Bosc, 1801, is in the dixoni Zone in Northwest Europe, and in the inerme Zone in northeasten Algeria and adjacent parts of Central Tunisia. These differences are not a result of collection failure or non-preservation, but must rather reflect environmental controls on occurrence and abundance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tsunami deposits are currently a subject of intensive studies. Tsunamis must have occurred in the geological past in the same frequency as nowadays, yet their identified depositional record is surprisingly scarce. Here we describe a hitherto unrecognized example of probable palaeotsunamites. The Upper Silurian (Pridoli) carbonate succession of Podolia (southwestern Ukraine) contains variously devel-oped event beds forming intercalations within peritidal deposits (shallow water limestones, nodular marls and dolomites). The event beds are represented by stromatoporoid and fine-grained bioclastic limestones, in some places accompanied by flat-pebble conglomerates. The interval with event beds can be traced along the Zbruch River in separate outcrops over a distance of more than 20 km along a transect oblique to the palaeoshoreline. The stro-matoporoid beds have erosional bottom surfaces and are composed of overturned and often fragmented massive skele-tons. The material has been transported landward from their offshore habitats and deposited in lagoonal settings. The flat-pebble conglomerates are composed of sub-angular micritic clasts that are lithologically identical to the sediments forming the underlying beds. Large-scale landward transport of the biogenic material has to be attributed to phenomena with very high energy levels, such as tropical hurricanes or tsunamis. This paper presents a tsunamigenic interpretation. Morphome-tric features of redeposited stromatoporoids point to a calm original growth environment at depths well below storm wave base. Tsunami waves are the most probable factor that could cause their redeposition from such a setting. The vastness of the area covered by parabiostromal stromatoporoid beds resembles the distribution of modern tsunami deposits in offshore settings. The stromatoporoid beds with unsorted stromatoporoids of various dimensions evenly distributed throughout the thickness of the beds and with clast-supported textures most probably represent deposition by traction. In some sections, the stromatoporoids are restricted to the lowermost parts of the beds, which pass upwards into bioclastic limestones. In this case, the finer material was deposited from suspension. The coexistence of stromatoporoid beds and flat-pebble conglomerates also allows presenting a tsunami interpretation of the latter. The propagating tsunami waves, led to erosion of partly lithified thin-layered mudstones, their fragmentation into flat clasts and redeposition as flat-pebble conglomerates.",

Samples of the boundary clay were examined for microtektites and shocked minerals to confirm the impact origin of the sediment. The spheroidal fraction reveals morphological and mineralogical features, e.g., spherules, similar to material from the K-Pg boundary as described from elsewhere. The impact genesis of the spherules is confirmed by the presence of nickel-rich spinel grains on their surfaces. The spinels are considered to be primary microlites and, thus, the spherules at Lechówka can be classified as microkrystites. No shocked minerals were noted. The deposits with spherules comprise Aland Mg-rich smectite (Cheto smectite). This almost pure Mg-rich smectite, forming up to 100% of the clay fraction, derived from the weathering of the impact glass. It is proposed that the spherules isolated from the Cretaceous- Paleogene boundary clay at Lechówka come from the Chicxulub crater in Mexico.",

The formation of a large contractional structure at the Late Cretaceous – Cenozoic transition displays the significant role of strike-slip faulting along the western border of the Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone, in the foreland of the Polish part of the Carpathian Orogen. Theoretical relationships between the maximum fault offsets/ mean step length, as well as between the maximum fault offsets/mean step width allowed the estimation of the values of possible offsets along the Snochowice and Mieczyn faults forming the Mnin stepover. The estimated values suggest displacements of as much as several tens of kilometres. The observed offset along the Tokarnia Fault and theoretical calculations suggest that the strike-slip faults west of the Late Palaeozoic Holy Cross Mountains Fold Belt belong to a large strike-slip fault system. We postulate that the observed significant refraction of the faults forming the anastomosing fault pattern is related also to the interaction of the NW-SE-striking faults formed along the western border of the Teisseyre- Tornquist Zone and the reactivated WNW-ESE-striking faults belonging to the fault systems of the northern margin of the Tethys Ocean.",

The geochemical analysis included determination of Cr, V, Sr, Ba, Ni, Cu, Co, As, Pb and Zn concentrations. Results indicate that the main factors affecting the pattern of features in the floodplain of this area are (1) the highly dynamic flood flow in the narrow section of the gorge and (2) the relief of the top surface of the sub-alluvial basement. The variable concentrations of trace elements are closely related to the floodplain features. Their concentrations can be considered as valuable geochemical proxies that enable a more thorough reconstruction of the sedimentary evolution of the Vistula River Valley and other similar river valleys, especially in gorge sections.",

    "abstract": "Many geological problems have not been convincingly explained so far and are debatable, for instance the origin and changes of the Neogene depositional environments in central Poland. Therefore, these changes have been reconstructed in terms of global to local tectonic and climatic fluctuations. The examined Neogene deposits are divided into a sub-lignite unit (Koźmin Formation), a lignite-bearing unit (Grey Clays Member), and a supra-lignite unit (Wielkopolska Member). The two lithostratigraphic members constitute the Poznań Formation. The results of facies analysis show that the Koźmin Formation was deposited by relatively high-gradient and well-drained braided rivers. Most likely, they encompassed widespread alluvial plains. In the case of the Grey Clays Member, the type of river in close proximity to which the mid-Miocene low-lying mires existed and then were transformed into the first Mid-Miocene Lignite Seam (MPLS-1), has not been resolved. The obtained results confirm the formation of the Wielkopolska Member by low-gradient, but mostly well-drained anastomosing or anastomosing-to-meandering rivers. The depositional evolution of the examined successions depended on tectonic and climatic changes that may be closely related to the mid-Miocene great tectonic remodelling of the Alpine-Carpathian orogen. This resulted in palaeogeographic changes in its foreland in the form of limiting the flow of wet air and water masses from the south and vertical tectonic movements.",

Acta Geologica Polonica, 75 (2), e41. A new species of agglutinated tube, Cryptosiphon oboloides sp. nov., is described from the Furongian of Estonia. The agglutinated tubes are composed of pieces of lingulate shells that are placed to form an overall pattern. The studied agglutinated tube strongly resembles cases of modern caddisfly larvae, though we do not suggest any phylogenetic affinity to caddisflies. The tubes originally contained an organic inner lining with a sticky external surface that enabled worms to glue on shell fragments and sand grains. The relatively well-arranged grains in the tube wall suggest that the animal actively assisted in gluing the shell fragments, orienting, and finding the right place for them. It is possible that worms capable of building agglutinated tubes from shell material originated in Baltica and later dispersed to the Armorican Terrane Assemblage and other regions in the Early to Middle Ordovician.",

The carbonate strata of the Khasib Formation in the East Baghdad Oilfield of the Mesopotamian Basin were chosen as a model. The paleoenvironment was reconstructed using petrological characteristics and concentrations of major, trace, and rare earth elements (REEs), as well as carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotopic studies. The data suggest that the paleotemperature of the seawater was 28ºC, that suboxic-anoxic paleoredox conditions were present, that the paleosalinity of the seawater was minimal, and a biological explosion occurred when the temperature dropped to a point where life could survive. Dolomite dissolution, influenced by early meteoric water, established the groundwork for high-quality reservoirs, and leftover dolomite also protected natural oil. This research adds to the paleoenvironmental record and offers a theoretical foundation for future natural oil exploitation.",

The comatulids and isocrinids coexisted in shallow (&amp;lt;30 m), high-energy coastal environments, whereas the roveacrinids were Chalk Sea dwellers in the upper water column that were washed into the shallows by currents. The presence of isocrinids in such shallow habitats is remarkable given that these environments are characterised by high biodiversity, intense predation pressure, strong currents and wave-agitated waters – conditions typically considered unsuitable for these slow-moving stalked crinoids, and the reason they are thought to be confined to depths in excess of 100 m in present-day oceans. The Ivö Klack specimens presented herein represent the only known occurrence of isocrinids in a rocky shoreline deposit, marking a notable shift in isocrinid ecology and habitat preference. The limited stratigraphical ranges of the roveacrinids in expanded chalk successions elsewhere corroborates other age assignments of the succession at Ivö Klack.",

    "abstract": "Around the town of Konin in central Poland, lignite deposits are exploited in opencast mines. Surface mining has enabled the discovery of many sediments and structures, both tectonic and sedimentary. However, the greatest research challenge appeared in the Tomisławice lignite opencast mine in 2022, when a so-called lignite-free zone was found during mining activity. Initially, due to limited data, its genesis was associated with syn- or post-depositional tectonics and peat-to-lignite compaction. In 2024, two deeper boreholes were drilled in which no lignite and tectonic denivelations of the Mesozoic bedrock were detected in the mentioned zone, meaning that the above hypotheses were disproved. Therefore, in this paper a new hypothesis was proposed for the creation of the aforementioned lignite-free zone crossing the Tomisławice lignite deposit – palaeochannel I – and as well as marking its NE border – palaeochannel II. The inclusion of data from a larger number of boreholes and the reinterpretation of the depositional architecture of the fills of the lignite-free zones indicate the palaeochannel avulsion of the late Neogene fluvial system. The palaeochannels are filled with fine-grained and multi-coloured Poznań Clays. Unfortunately, they are mainly massive, and the poorly visible sedimentary structures are masked by post-depositional weathering processes. The palaeochannels were incised into the underlying lignite seam and sub-lignite sands during the initial stages of major floods and then filled by the accretion of heterolithics, mainly from suspension, during subsequent flood episodes. Rather than a tectonic/compactional origin, data are consistent with palaeochannel avulsion. Finally, the current paper is the first in Poland devoted exclusively to the effects of avulsion in the rock record.",

This difference is probably the result of different facies conditions in the Early Maastrichtian sea in both areas.

The previously cited long range of the genus within the Upper Campanian was based on poorly known occurrences, and it seems that the genus is limited to the Lower (and ?lowermost Upper) Maastrichtian.

    "abstract": "The Lower Badenian (Middle Miocene) patch reef of Grobie (southern slopes of the Holy Cross Mountains, Central Poland) is the only coral buildup in the Polish Miocene. It contains four hermatypic coral taxa, of which Tarbellastraea reussiana (MILNE EDWARDS & HAIME) and Porites collegniana MICHELIN dominate, whereas Montastraea sp. and  Stylophora reussiana MONTANARO-GALLITELLI & TACOLI are subordinate. Wide diversities of colony shapes in this coral assemblage reflect natural development of the reefal structure and/or energy of environment; it varies from platy colonies (first settlers on an unconsolidated, pebble-strewn substrate), through branching, to massive forms. Wave activity was the most significant factor that influenced the reef core and distribution of associated facies. Disintegration and removal of reef core sediment led to the formation of crack crevices in freshly lithified deposits. Redeposited sediment formed the back-reef talus, where its composition varied with distance from the reef core. Reef-associated molluscs and decapods are abundant, the bivalves being represented by high-energy resistant borers ( Lithophaga sp., Jouannetia ( J .) semicaudata  DESMOULINS) and the squatter Sphenia ( S .) anatina (BASTEROT). Among 21 decapod taxa, the species Dardanus hungaricus  (LORENTHEY, 1929) is reported from Poland for the first time. Recognition of the diversity of facies and their distribution enabled reconstruction of Grobie area during the Early Badenian transgression. Slowing and/or stopping of sealevel rise encouraged development of the patch reef, while the subsequent, rapid transgressive pulse caused its demise. Shortly after all reefal deposits were buried, diagenetic processes of neomorphisation and/or dissolution of aragonitic skeletal elements took place. This diagenesis could have continued till the Late Miocene and Pliocene, synchronously with rapid erosion that progressed since the Early Sarmatian until the Pleistocene glaciations.",

This series belongs to a large province of flood basalts extending over an area of ca 140 000 km 2 in the western part of the East European Craton. The series is underlain by the terrigenous rocks of the Polesie Series, with volcanic ashes and dolerites in its upper part. The effusive-tuffogenic rocks of both series, together with hypabyssal dolerites, represent the Volhynian Trap Formation. Within the lower – Zabollotya and Babino Beds of the Volhynian Series there have been found alkali basalts and olivine tholeiites, whereas the basalts of the upper, Ratno Beds are quartz tholeiites exclusively. All the basalts are mainly within plate continental basalts. The diversity of basalt composition within the Volhynian Series suggests that in the Early Vendian, during the process of formation of parent magmas for basalts of particular beds, the mantle material beneath Volhynia has been melted to various degrees. Distinct variability can also be observed in basaltic pyroxene composition (particularly in the Babino and Ratno Beds) as well as in variations of REE distribution patterns in the studied basalts. Most likely, the strongly differentiated pyroxenes were not in a state of equilibrium with the magma. The native copper mineralization of basalts from the Ratno, Babino and Zabolottya Beds is described. Higher concentration of Au and Ag in the rocks with a high content of copper supports the hypothesis that the mineralizing hydrothermal solutions originated in a common igneous source. The Vendian magmatic activity in the study area was associated with the last stages of breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent.",

Frechastraea ] and branching [ Disphyllum kweihsiense YOH, 1937,  Peneckiella ? fascicularis (SOSHKINA, 1952), Thamnophyllum monozonatum (SOSHKINA, 1939), Peneckiella szulczewskii  ROZKOWSKA, 1979], developed on the carbonate platform extending along the edge of the East European Craton. The similarity of these faunas to Rugosan faunas from southern Poland is significant. The coral fauna was reduced significantly after the Kellwasser crisis. Colonial corals disappeared altogether and solitary dissepimented forms were markedly reduced. The subsequent Late Famennian radiation caused a significant quantitative and qualitative differentiation of the coral faunas. In addition to the well-known ' Cyathaxonia fauna', warm and shallow-water solitary corals appeared in the latest Famennian. The stratigraphically important taxa of the latest Famennian include: Campophyllum MILNE-EDWARDS & HAIM, 1850, ? Palaeosmilia aquisgranense (FRECH, 1885),  Bounophyllum pomeranicum sp. nov. and Guelichiphyllum kowalense ROZKOWSKA, 1969. The latest Famennian regression caused subdivision of the Pomeranian area into at least two sedimentary basins, separated by shallows, with peculiar ecological conditions, and the appearance of numerous endemic taxa. This regressive interval contains, however, numerous levels yielding less restricted faunas, which suggest the intermittent appearance of more open-sea conditions.",

The isotopic composition of this calcite indicates low-temperature crystallization conditions and its vadose origin. U-Th dating of the flowstone-like calcite indicates ages of ~2.5-6.5 ka. The calcite grew on a rough and fresh andesite surface, and hence its age may correspond to the age of the extensional fractures. Rhythmically distributed intergrowths of clay minerals present in the calcite may reflect annual climatic oscillations and show that the calcite grew for at least 500 years. The calcite filling the extensional fractures, like the calcite cementing the loosened cataclastic zones cutting the andesite, does not show any features indicating younger deformations. The origin and geometric features of the fractures show that they could have formed in response to increased strike-slip activity within the deep fault zone known as the Dunajec Fault, which may coincide with the fracture zone between the Upper Silesian and MaΠopolska blocks.",

    "abstract": "Most of the thickness of Frasnian sediments in the central segment of the Lublin Basin, i.e. up to 300 metres, is represented by a single transgressive-regressive Cycle VIa, developed in the carbonate-sulphate platform facies. The age of the transgressive part falls into the interval between the upper part of the Upper hassi Zone and the jamieae  Zone, whereas the upper boundary runs between the upper part of the Lower rhenana Zone and the lower part of the Upper rhenana Zone. Basin architecture and conodont biostratigraphic data confirm the tectonic nature of the cycle, which represents a short-term increase in Frasnian subsidence and depositional rates. Based on the conodont data, it is plausible that the onset of the tectonic subsidence in the Lublin Basin and the incipient Pripyat Graben rifting correspond closely in age. They can thus be attributed to the common tectonic mechanism of regional extension in the south-west part of the East European Platform. The lack of any Late Devonian magmatic activity in the Lublin Basin and the synchronous development of this basin with the Pripyat Graben favour the idea that intraplate stresses were the primary factors controlling subsidence in both depocentres during themid Frasnian to Famennian. The hypothetical mantle plume could have merely amplified the effects of crustal extension in the Pripyat Graben, thus facilitating a typical rift development.",

In the study area the Silesian nappe comprises two tectonic units: the Central Carpathian Depression and the Fore-Dukla thrust sheet, separated by a fault. The Central Carpathian Depression is built of several mapscale slices. The slices comprise map-scale NE-verging anticlines, with additional synclines to the south-east. The slices are separated by steeply dipping forelimb-thrusts, which connect together at a depth of ca. 6-7 km into a single sole thrust and form a leading imbricate fan. To the west of the Rabe-Baligrod fault zone the fault between the Central Carpathian Depression and the Fore-Dukla thrust sheet is a typical thrust. Eastwards from this fault zone it becomes a steeply NE-dipping normal fault. The Silesian nappe is cut by map-scale oblique and transverse, mainly strike-slip faults – some of them are tear faults. Longitudinal strike-slip faults indicate dextral movement along the pre-existing thrusts. The structural evolution of the Silesian nappe comprises here eight pre-, syn- and post-orogenic stages beginning with the formation of clastic veins, followed by folding, thrusting, strike-slip faulting and terminating with normal faulting.",

Palygorskite is the common clay mineral in the rocks studied, together with small amounts of illite, chlorite, and kaolinite, in addition to various amounts of quartz, feldspar, dolomite and calcite. It is believed that most of the clay minerals are detrital in origin, except palygorskite, which is formed by authigenesis in evaporitic environments.

The Badenianwas generallywarmer,with a lower availability of nutrients, andwas characterized by carbonate units and patch reefs and associated microfossil assemblages (e.g., Eponides spp.). Riverine plumes brought fresh water into the Styrian Basins during the Badenian and induced high productivity and the proliferation of species highly tolerant of low salinity such as Ammonia tepida . The passage from calcareous nannofossil Zone NN4 to NN5 is characterized by a reorganization ofwatermasses and the transition fromcooler and nutrient-rich towarmer and nutrient-poorerwaters. Based on themicrofossil abundance trends we interpret the planktonic foraminiferal species Globigerina tarchanensis as preferring cooler nutrient-rich waters and Reticulofenestra minuta as preferring warmer and nutrient-poor waters. The application of cluster analysis based on the Bray-Curtis Similarity and non-metric MultiDimensional Scaling (nMDS) adds important information to that obtained only from microfossil abundance curves, enabling identification of cryptic trends and correlationwith sequence stratigraphy.

This paper presents the results of sedimentological, stratigraphical and paleobotanical researches undertaken in Colonia Cehă open cast mine in Anina, where the Steierdorf Formation outcrops widely. Several sedimentary facies associations have been described, these associations permitting the reconstruction of various depositional systems such as alluvial fans, braided and meandering river systems, as well as lacustrine and coal generating marsh systems of the Steierdorf Formation. The sedimentary associations recorded within the Steierdorf Formation show a gradual fining upward trend, pointing to a rising marine water table and a decreasing relief within the source area.",

The succession starts with the Hazara Formation, which contains complete and incomplete Bouma sequences suggesting its deposition in deep marine turbidite settings. The overlying Tanawal Formation, rich in massive sandstone, shale and siltstone, was deposited in shallow marine conditions, as indicated by the presence of parallel lamination, large scale tabular, trough cross- and hummocky cross-stratifications. The Tanawal Formation facies shift laterally from proximal (south-southeast) to distal (north-northwest). The glaciogenic Tanaki Boulder Bed, overlying the Tanawal Formation, was deposited during the Maronian glaciation. It is equivalent to the Blaini Formation of India, and to the Sinian diamictites of South China. The Abbottabad Formation of Cambrian age overlies the Tanaki Boulder Bed, and is composed of dolomite, chert nodules and phosphate-rich packages; similar successions are documented in India and South China at the same stratigraphical interval. The similarities of the Neoproterozoic successions of Lesser Himalaya (both in Pakistan and India) and South China suggests their possible proximity during the break-up of Rodinia and the assembly of the Gondwana Supercontinent.",

The Gieraltow Gneiss Formation is composed of rocks having at least two sets of folded metamorphic foliations, with relics of compositional banding and records of early shearing prior to migmatization and metablastesis which produced quartzofeldspathic segregations (D1–D2 events). Such aggregates, even if isometric and shared (D3) may, but must not be mistaken for original augens (porphyroclasts in the original granite). Modal contents of the feldspars differ widely (20–40% of plagioclase feldspar, 16–40% of alkali feldspar) as well as their composition (Ab 0-90 , An 6-38 ); the biotites can be either poor or enormously enriched in Al (0.26–1.07 Al Vi ). Such heterogeneities are consistent with the inferred metamorphic transformations of originally diversified sedimentary-volcanogenic protoliths. in contrast, the Śnieznik Gneiss Formation is composed of metagranites, dynamically metamorphosed into the augen gneisses. They possess only one set of mylonitic foliation and one rodding lineation, both developed during a regional shear event (D3). Nearly equal modes of feldspars and quartz, uniform composition of plagioclase feldspar (An 6-23 ) and a rather stable amount of Al (0.3–08 Al Vi ) in the biotites are indicative of homogenization of a granitic protolith. Anatectic provenance of the gneisses is evidenced by enclaves. Felsic microgranular enclaves are chilled fragments of the parental intrusion, while xenoliths and surmicaceous enclaves are akin to rocks of the Gieraltow Formation, thus the latter or equivalent rocks formed a migmatic envelope of the Śnieznik granite pluton.",

Most are described for the first time from the Cambrian of Scandinavia. Their affinities point to a strong connection with East Gondwana, Laurentia, Kazakhstania and Siberia. Exotic trilobites appear in the succession directly after periods of very low oxygen concentration in the Alum Shale Sea; their occurrences correspond to the ranges of agnostoid arthropods in the succession and seem to be linked to global transgressive events causing an influx of cool and/or oxygen-depleted waters onto the shelf of the Baltica palaeocontinent.",

Systematically, the teeth represent five taxa including Sphenodus sp., Protospinax sp. 1, Protospinax sp. 2, Palaeobrachaelurus sp. and another, indeterminate orectolobiform. The presence of two species of the flattened and bottom-dwelling Protospinax and two different orectolobiforms that are likely to have lived near the bottom, is a strong indication of oxygenated bottom conditions at the time of deposition. The dietary preferences of these taxa included a wide variety of benthic invertebrates. The synechodontiform Sphenodus may have been the first pelagic predatory neoselachian in the Jurassic, equipped with high and slender piercing teeth that formed a tearing-type dentition. The diet of Sphenodus probably included bony fish, smaller sharks and cephalopods.",

    "abstract": "During Middle Triassic times, the Peri-Tethys Basin bordered the north-western Tethys shelf and was connected to the open Tethys Ocean via three seaways. Today, lower Muschelkalk carbonates of this epeiric sea cover large parts of Central Europe, documenting the evolution of a low-relief, homoclinal, mud-dominated ramp system during the Anisian. In view of their geotectonic/climatic setting, depositional processes, facies architecture, and distribution, the rocks are considered as an outcrop analogue for layer-cake reservoirs of world-wide importance, e.g. the Permo-Triassic Khuff or Jurassic Arab carbonates in the Middle East. In general, two different reservoir types and their interplay might be considered: The proximal stacks of muddy dolostones (NW part of the basin) and the more distally developed grainy limestones (central and sE part of the basin). The rather uncommon depositional setting with minor relief and minimal accommodation contributed to both, the stratal and lateral facies development, and to unusual and possibly even “inverted” facies patterns with thick, grainy facies found in the more distal environments. Based on litho- and microfacies analyses, six main facies types are distinguished, building characteristic cyclic facies successions of different hierarchies. The stratal architecture of small-scale depositional sequ ences systematically changes in relation to their relative proximal-distal position on the Muschelkalk ramp system. here, we present porosity and permeability data of the different facies types and within the basin-wide sequence stratigraphic framework. dolo-wacke-/packstones and peloid grainstones attain the highest porosities of up to 24%, whereas bioclastic grainstones show porosities of up to 8%. The platy and nodular mud-/wackestone and most of the bioclastic wacke-/packstones typically show porosities below 2%. Even in the most porous strata, permeabilities do not exceed 10 mD, and only a few carbonates show higher permeabilities up to 90 mD. Within large-scale, third-order depositional sequences late highstand deposits represent the most permeable sediments.",

It represents the younger part of the climatic optimum of the Mazovian (Holsteinian) Interglacial (~MIS 11) and possibly the postoptimal period. The mollusc assemblage is composed of both standing and running water species, mostly connected with temperate climate. The presence of biostratigraphical indicators of the Mazovian, Viviparus diluvianus (Kunth, 1865), Lithoglyphus jahni Urbański, 1975 and Pisidium clessini Neumayr, 1875, is noteworthy. Variability in the structure and composition of the assemblage enables palaeoecological reconstruction. Changes in the water-level, vegetation and energy conditions are inferred from the malacological succession. Three stages of the lake development were distinguished. The first one is connected with deeper conditions and predominance of V. diluvianus and L. jahni. The second one, dominated by Bithynia tentaculata (Linnaeus, 1758), records a fall of the water-level and the growth of aquatic plants, evidenced by high frequencies of Valvata cristata Muller, 1774 and Acroloxus lacustris (Linnaeus, 1758). The third stage corresponds to another rise of the water-level and an increase in V. diluvianus, L. jahni, Valvata piscinalis Muller, 1774 and Pisidium henslowanum (Sheppard, 1823), which evidence some higher energy conditions.",

Sixteen species of echinoids are distinguished and/or commented. A new brissid, Rhabdobrissus tarnopolensis sp. nov., is established. A mass occurrence of some species (Psammechinus dubius and Hemipatagus ocellatus) contrasts with that of mass aggregations (sand dollars and Echinocardium leopolitanum) by dynamic events in selected layers of proximal tempestites. Of special note is the occurrence of very small specimens, interpreted as juveniles (‘babies’) having been swept out of their restricted biotopes (‘nurseries’). Some species hitherto regarded as of Early Miocene age, and the problem of their persistence beyond the Fore-Carpathian Basin and/or migration into that basin during the Middle Miocene transgression are discussed.",

The comparison of the compression and permeability characteristics from field and laboratory tests has been performed. Laboratory consolidation tests carried out with up to 20MPa vertical stress, revealed two yield stress values, one in the range of a couple hundreds kPa, the other in the range of a couple thousands kPa. Based on those results, the reliability of the soil preconsolidation assessment, with the use of the two different methods is discussed. The aspect of the triaxial strength reduction under the dynamic loading of diverse frequency and amplitude is raised. The research results depict a variety of possible geological-engineering characteristics, under the divergent constraints scenarios, of compression or strength weakening origin. The effects of the specialized research program will widen the possibilities of physio-mechanical and structural characterization of soils for geological-engineering purposes.",

The stope investigated is 72 meters long. At its entrance a sedimentary rock appears, farther on there·are metamorphic rocks and andesite. On all extent of the stope a mineral vein passes, a thickness of which does not overpass 3-4 cm. The vein consists of limonite in which galena crystals are visible. The material of the vein was segregated by means of panning and heavy liquids. The microanalytic methods were used for determination of minerals present in grains smaller than 1 mm diameter. This work of the author is a continuation of prof. S. Malkowski's previous researches concerning this vein carried out in 1918. The results of the author's investigation in which considerable quantities (1 kg) of the vein material have been used are as follows: beside limonite, galena, pyrite, pyrrhotite, quartz, apatite, gypsum, calcite stated by St. Malkowski, 14 minerals were found, namely the native metals: gold, silver, copper, mercury, and lead (the last to verify), and also chalcopyrite, bornite, covellite, malachite, azurite, cerussite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, and magnetite. The chemical analysis of four samples taken from four different places in the stope confirms the presence of gold. The amount of Au oscillates between 0,00005 and 0,0003%. One of these samples contains silver and copper: AgO,003, Cu 0,16%.",

Echinoids and other macrofossils (brachiopods, stalked crinoids, belemnites) have proved useful, but many are long-ranging or uncommon. Some marker beds, including flints and marl seams, provide useful correlations across the basin, but are locally absent. For the Upper Santonian, the stemless benthonic crinoids Uintacrinus and Marsupites provide high-resolution correlation, both within the basin and to other regions. The successions on the basin margins, in the far north of France (Nord, Pas de Calais) and the southwest (Touraine) are condensed and yield ammonites in association with important inoceramid species. The controls on sedimentation caused by sea-level changes are evaluated on a basinal and global scale, most especially for the Upper Santonian.",

This new genus has a unique combination of characters (lower jaw articulation located under the posterior part of the orbit; abdominal scutes well developed with 3 to 5 in the gular region, 11–14 prepelvic scutes associated with ribs, 11–12 postpelvic scutes; several striae on the frontals; an opercle with 6–12 thin radial ridges; a horizontal ramus of the preopercle shorter than the vertical one; 42–44 vertebrae; 8–10 supraneurals; a dorsal fin with 18–22 rays, and an anal fin with 21–23 rays), supporting recognition of a new genus and species within the Family Alosidae Svetovidov, 1952. Similarities and differences between fossil and extant genera of the Clupeiformes are discussed to shed more light on their relationship. Moreover, the palaeobiogeography, diversity and distribution of Oligocene clupeiform fishes in the Paratethys are presented and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Palynofacies and palynological investigations conducted on the Neogene–Quaternary succession from the NDO B-1 well, located in the offshore Nile Delta, Egypt, in the Eastern Mediterranean, suggest generally shallow marine (neritic) conditions. These environments are manifested by the overall palynofacies composition and the occurrence of dinoflagellate cysts (e.g., Spiniferites spp., Lingulodinium spp., Hystrichokolpoma spp., Homotryblium spp. and Selenopemphix spp.). Neritic environments are suggested for the lower and middle Miocene Sidi Salim, and the Pliocene to Pleistocene upper Kafr El Sheikh, El Wastani and Mit Ghamr formations, while shallower, coastal to inner neritic settings were interpreted for the late Miocene (Qawasim and Rosetta formations) and early Pliocene (Abu Madi and lower Kafr El Sheikh formations). Anoxic conditions existed during the deposition of the studied well succession, which can be seen from the occurrence of imprints of pyrite crystals and some types of oxygen-sensitive dinoflagellate cysts. The palynofacies fluctuated repeatedly between Amorphous Organic Matter (AOM)-dominated and phytoclast-dominated intervals, of kerogen types II and III, respectively. The spore coloration index (SCI) of indigenous thin-walled palynomorphs confirms thermally mature sediments, generative of dry gas and wet gas/condensates. Reworking during the deposition of the upper Sidi Salim, Qawasim and Rosetta formations is inferred from the occurrence of Cretaceous dinoflagellate cysts and pollen.",

    "abstract": "A stratigraphic and microfacies study of the pelagic carbonate sequence of late Middle Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous age of the Czorsztyn Succession in the Spisz area of the Pieniny Klippen Belt is presented. The sequence begins with the Czorsztyn Limestone Formation which developed on subsiding blocks of shallow-water crinoid limestones during the time interval from the Bathonian to Early/Middle Tithonian. The three succeeding microfacies are recognized and dated: the filament microfacies (Bathonian-Callovian, and ?earliest Oxfordian), the Globuligerina microfacies (Oxfordian), the Saccocoma microfacies (Kimmeridgian to Early/Middle Tithonian). The still younger microfacies of the Dursztyn Limestone Formation include the Globochaete microfacies, and calpionellid microfacies of Middle/Late Tithonian to Middle Berriasian age. The organogenic limestones and breccias of the Łysa Limestone Formation are of Late Berriasian age; their origin was related to tectonic activity which produced a highly diversified sea bottom topography markedly changing the previous sedimentation pattern. The lowermost part of the Spisz Limestone Formation is extremely condensed, and corresponds to a large part of the VaIanginian, excluding its uppermost part. The most important new findings of Valanginian ammonites include representatives of genera: Thurmanniceras , Karakaschiceras , Olcostephanus , and Jeanthieuloyites .

Formation of magnesiocopiapite, aluminocopiapite, pickeringite (and its new variety ferropickeringite), fibroferrite, slavikite, gypsum, epsomite, and alunogen is recognised in the studied weathering zone. Analyses of the sulfur and oxygen isotope rations in sulfate ions, and oxygen and hydrogen isotope rations in crystallization water, were used to characterise the origin and stability ranges of the studied minerals. Sulfur isotope ratios in sulfates indicate water as the main source of oxygen. The best soluble mineral display seasonal changes of isotope composition of crystallization water, which can be likely correlated to composition of atmospheric precipitation.",

Upper Albian to Lower Cenomanian biostratigraphy in the Oyubari area, Hokkaido, Japan: toward a Cretaceous biochronology for the North Pacific. Acta Geologica Polonica, 53 (2), 81-91. Warszawa. An integrated planktonic foraminifer and ammonoid biostratigraphy for the Oyubari area, Hokkaido, Japan, provides new insights into the late Albian to early Cenomanian biochronology of the North Pacific province. The following foraminifers extend Tethyan zonation to the Oyubari area: Biticinella breggiensis (lower Upper Albian), Rotalipora subticinensis - Rotalipora ticinensis (middle Upper Albian), Rotalipora appenninica (upper Upper Albian), and Rotalipora globotruncanoides (Lower Cenomanian) zones. Co-occurring age-indicative ammonoids such as Mortoniceras rostratum, Mariella bergeri, and Mantelliceras saxbii, are in accord with these foraminifer ages. The base of the Cenomanian stage in Hokkaido is recognized as the first occurrence of Rotalipora globotruncanoides, which is close to the horizon of the occurrence of Mantelliceras. The first occurrence of Desmoceras (Pseudouhligella) japonicum, regarded as a Cenomanian marker species in the North Pacific province, is of latest Albian age in the global biochronological scale.",

    "abstract": "The research was carried out to determine the origin of carbon dioxide and to track the possible isotopic evolution of carbonated waters of the flysch Carpathians. Carbon isotopic composition (-9.2‰ < δ 13 C C0[2 (g)] <-1.8‰, -7.1 ‰ <δ 13 C TDC <+5.4‰) of the unusually CO 2 -rich, cold waters of various salinity,  with bicarbonate as the dominant anion, is characteristic for an CO 2 -water open system. It differs  from carbon isotopic composition of waters of the closed-CO 2 system with δ 13 C TDC values  reaching up to +28‰, that have chloride as the dominant anion. From the detailed isotopic measurements  of CO 2 (g) (δ 13 C C0[2(g)] ) and of the corresponding total dissolved carbonates (δ 13 C TDC ) it is found  which fluids are in isotopic equilibrium with accompanying CO 2 gas and which are not. Because of  the variability of the δ 13 C C0[2(g)] values simple assignment of a definite single or multiple CO 2 source ( s) is rather ambiguous. To evaluate the main factors which influence the isotopic composition, two  limiting models of kinetic fractionation occurring during a vertical advective flow of carbonated solution  and/or CO 2 gas are derived. The models suggest that both the δ 13 C C0[2(g)] and δ 13 C HC0[3] values  can be modified on the way of the CO 2 -H 2 0 mixture to the Earth surface. The model of parallel flow  of CO 2 (g) and carbonated solution predicts that the δ 13 C C0[2(g)] and δ 13 C HC0[3] values can be only slightly  changed towards negative δ 13 C values at Damkohler number (Da) equal 1. In the one-phase CO 2 flow model, due to decreasing C C0[2(g)] /C HC0[3] the δ 13 C C0[2(g)] and δ 13 C HC0[3] equilibrium values (Da=l) display  a clearly declining trend along the vertical profile. Generally, the isotopic shift with respect to  the original input value depends mainly on P CO[2] gradient, Damkohler number and the difference in  the velocity of CO 2 gas and carbonated solution. Because during both the equilibrium or non-equilibrium  fluid flow the δ 13 C C0[2(g)] values decrease, only the highest δ 13 C C0[2(g)] values can be considered  as non-fractionated and may possibly reveal the origin of CO 2 . Lower δ 13 C C0[ 2 (g)] values result from  isotopic fractionation and are not useful as indicators of CO 2 origin. These findings support the view  that low δ 13 C C0[2(g)] values considered sometimes as an evidence of mantle or organic provenance of  carbon dioxide in the West Carpathians or elsewhere are in fact significantly modified during the  ascendence flux of CO 2 gas to the Earth surface. The common assumption that δ 13 C C0[2 (g)]  remains constant during CO 2 -H 2 0 flow to the surface has been shown to be invalid. High δ 13 C C0[2(g)]  values around -2‰ suggest that CO 2 gas in the CO 2 -charged waters in the West Carpathians is predominantly derived from the thermal decomposition of the carbonate and silicate rocks. In the closed  systems with respect to CO 2 , ( δ 13 C TDC up to 28‰), carbon dioxide originates from the decarboxylation of acetic acid.",

Other inclusions in magmatic rocks are trapped and have their composition determined by a variety of types of fluid immiscibility.",

In terms of goniatite stratigraphy, the formation ranges into the early Namurian E2 interval which has been identified by the occurrence of the conodont Gnathodus bollandensis . The investigated conodont fauna includes exclusively deep-water forms and is dominated by species of Gnathodus and Lochriea . The former genus is represented primarily by the bilineatus lineage, in which a new species Gnathodus cantabricus sp. nov. has been recognized and is described herein. Representatives of the another gnathodontid girtyi lineage,generally present in the late Visean/early Namurian deep-water faunas, are extremely rare. The vertical succession of Lohriea species is closely comparable to those recognized in Northern England, Poland and Ukraine. The Visean/Namurian boundary is thus placed at the first occurrence of Lochriea cruciformis , 4.7 m below the top of the Alba Formation.",

    "abstract": "The analyzed menilite facies (Early Oligocene Lower Menilites of the Tarcau Nappe, Romanian Carpathians, formed by bedded cherts and black shale-like deposits), document the upward evolution of a mainly turbiditic sequence. The stratigraphical relationships with the underlying turbidites are marked by a sudden and sharp transition to a predominantly pelitic menilite-bearing succession, probably as a consequence of a drastic decrease in the terrigenous supply. This type of sedimentation ceased at the Rupelian-Chattian boundary, when new turbiditic flows occurred. The multi-source provenance characterizing the basal turbidites (quartzarenite and litharenite sandstones which were probably derived from external cratonic areas and from inner crystalline belts respectively), is here interpreted as closely linked to tectonically induced palaeogeographic modifications. This hypothesis is in agreement with literature data, which relate these menilite facies to an Eocene-Oligocene widespread anoxic event that occurred in the western and central Paratethys, linked to drastic palaeogeographical modifications and to a global climatic deterioration. These palaeogeographical modifications may have corresponded to the Paleogene microplate reorganization and progressive exhumation of the Alpine-Dinaric-Balkan fold-thrust belt, which was responsible for the increasing isolation of the Paratethian basin from the World Ocean. Early Oligocene cooling events, consequent stratification of different salinity water layers and/or upwelling currents, could have produced anoxic conditions at the bottom of the flysch basin and the deposition of the menilite facies.",

The sedimentary basins of the RRFZ are grouped into three main sections: along the Red River Valley, the Chay River Valley and the Lo River Valley. The sedimentary basins are filled with thick series of Palaeogene and Neogene clastic deposits that differ in type and origin. In the lower part of the basin fill, coarse-grained deposits predominate. In the upper part, different types of sandstones, siltstones and brown coal occur. There are no sediments of Late Pliocene age. Quaternary deposits are represented by sands and gravels. Biostratigraphical data are very poor, therefore only lithostratigraphical subdivision is applied. Thus, it is possible that deposits from adjacent basins associated with the RRFZ represent strata of different ages.  The investigations were focused on the Lo River Basin (associated with the Chay River fault), Yen Bai Basin (associated with the Red River fault) and Co Tiet Basin (associated with the southwesternmost branch of the Red River fault). Thirteen sedimentary facies were recognised in deposits filling the investigated basins. The facies were grouped into five facies associations representing five distinct depositional environments. These comprise alluvial fan, gravel-dominated fluvial channel, sand-dominated fluvial channel, alluvial plain and lacustrine environments. In addition, the basin fills show features characteristic of strike-slip basins.",

A previous record of a U.S. Western Interior scaphitid ammonite, Jeletzkytes dorfi , from the lower part of the upper Maastrichtian in northeast Belgium, is demonstrated to have been based on specimens which reveal features typical of the indigenous European Hoploscaphites constrictus lineage. However, one of the individuals in this collection combines distinct mid-ventral swellings, characteristic of the H . constrictus stock, with irregular flank ornament, typical of J. dorfi . It is speculated that this specimen may be a product of interspecies hybridization.  Hoploscaphites sp., allied to H. nicolletii or to H. comprimus , previously known only from the U.S. Western Interior, is recorded from the lower upper Maastrichtian of Austria, and Discoscaphites gulosus , hitherto regarded to be confined to the U.S. Western Interior, Gulf Coast, and Atlantic Seaboard, has been recognised in the upper Maastrichtian of Bulgaria. Additionally, poorly preserved material referred to as  Discoscaphites ? sp. is recorded from the uppermost lower Maastrichtian of Denmark, and from the upper Maastrichtian of southern Sweden. These records of scaphitids support earlier conclusions that the base of the European upper Maastrichtian roughly corresponds to the base of the Hoploscaphites birkelundae Zone in the U.S. Western Interior.",

    "abstract": "JURASSIC STROMATOLITES OF POLAND The present paper is concerned with all the Jurassic stromatolites of Poland; those known previously as well as the new ones found by the writer. They come from the Bathonian of the Tatra Mts., the Lower- and Upper Callovian of the Mesozoic margin of the Holy Cross Mts., the Callovian and Lower Oxfordian of the Cracow-Czestochowa Jura and the Callovian boreholes in the Polish Lowland. Speculations as to the organic or inorganic origin of the Jurassic stromatolites are made and their biosedimentary nature is clearly shown. Various stromatolitic forms and character of their association are described. Stromatolitic microstructures are described in greater detail. Stress is laid on the abundance of detrital material and its selective deposition in Jurassic stromatolites, as well as on the dependence of stromatolitic microstructures on the character of the surrounding rocks. Profiles are presented to illustrate the position of stromatolites in the development of Jurassic sedimentation. The foIlowing constant features in the occurrence at stromatolites have -been emphasized and interpreted: their connection with sratigraphic gaps, with transgressive or regressive deposits, with stratigraphic condensation and the stirring up of variously aged faunal remains, also with distinctly shallow-water deposits. It is pointed out that stromatolites seem to occur exclusively in epicontinental areas and on intrageanticlinal ridges in geosynclinal areas. The potential value of Jurassic stromatolites as facial index is discussed on the results at analyses of profiles bearing Jurassic stromatolites, and by comparison with recent stromatolites. It has been found that in the mode of origin Jurassic stramatolites are analogous with the recent marine forms. Hence they may be reasonably accepted as indicators of the littoral zone as well as of the shallowest part of the infralittoral zone. The occurrence zone of some types of stromatolites is particularly limited. A comparison of the Jurassic and other Mesozoic stromatolites with pre-Mesozoic and recent forms shows closer analogies of the Mesozoic stromatolites with the recent forms than with the old-Paleozoic and Precambrian stromatolites. On the presence and characteristic features of stromatolites conclusions have been drawn concerning the sedimentation and paleogeography of their occurrence area.",

New micropaleontological and palynological data about the ordovician, Silurian and devonian in the Northern Camdag have allowed a better understanding of the early Palaeozoic evolution of this critical area between the Istanbul Terrane in the west and the Zonguldak Terrane in the east. The Middle ordovician age obtained from the conodont-bearing limestone band within the Aydos formation in this study is in agreement with the data from the Zonguldag Terrane. Acritarch evidence suggests a Late ordovician age of the upper part of Aydos formation. This paper concerns the Northern unit. Three members are distinguished in the findikli formation and dated biostratigraphically. The lower member (Black Shale Member) of the findikli formation is absent from the kabalak dere section, but was assigned elsewhere to the Llandovery on the basis of graptolites. The middle member (Shale–Siltstone Member) is dated as Wenlock and Ludlow on the basis of acritarchs. The upper member (Shale–Limestones Member) spans a continuous upper Silurian – Lower devonian succession. The overlaying ferizli formation is assigned to the Middle devonian on the basis of conodonts. The new stratigraphic data indicate that the Southern Camdag unit corresponds to the Istanbul Terrane and the Northern Camdag unit to the Zonguldak Terrane. The tectonic contact between the Northern and the Southern units is a steep south-verging thrust-fault.",

The paper presents results of research on tonstein, which constitutes an interburden in coal seam 405 at the Sośnica- Makoszowy coal mine, Makoszowy field (mining level 600 m), Upper Silesia, southern Poland. The mineral and chemical compositions of the tonstein differ from the typical compositions described earlier for tonsteins from Upper Silesia Coal Basin area. Additionally, minerals present in the tonsteins include kaolinite, quartz, kaolinitised biotite and feldspars. The presence of the phosphatic minerals apatite and goyazite has been recognized. The presence of gorceixite and crandallite is also possible. The contents of CaO (5.66 wt%) and P 2 O 5 (6.2 wt%) are remarkably high. Analysis of selected trace elements demonstrated high contents of Sr (4937 ppm) and Ba (4300 ppm), related to the phosphatic minerals. On the basis of mineral composition the tonstein has been identified as a crystalline tonstein, transitional to a multiplied one.",

Acta Geologica Polonica, 63 (2), 153-174, Warszawa. Samples from populations of Polygnathus serotinus Telford 1975 and P. bultyncki Weddige 1977 from the Prague Basin and Nevada display normal variation for Devonian conodont species. A considerable number of previous authors, however, have proposed unnecessary synonyms of these two species, primarily because they have not recognized ontogenetic variation. In contrast, we interpret the variation as ontogenetic as well as intraspecific and present detailed synonymies as a result. A third species, P. praetrigonicus Bardashev 1992, which has been carried in open nomenclature for many years, is an important indicator of the basal costatus Zone in the Prague Basin, New York, and Nevada. We review the stratigraphic distribution of these three species and the conodont zonation across the Emsian-Eifelian (Lower-Middle Devonian) boundary. Polygnathus pseudocostatus sp. nov. (partitus-costatus zones, central Nevada) is described herein. We have observed a decrease in the pit size during ontogeny in P. bultyncki although we have not measured enough specimens to rule out intraspecific versus ontogenetic variation.",

It displays characteristics of irregular echinoid burrows such as overall shape and a double meniscate filling with a chevron dorsal suture, in addition to the feature typical of the so far monospecific Bichordites Plaziat and Mahmoudi, 1988, that is a single central core around a single drainage tube. Its miniature size can be related to the small size of the tracemaker (ontogenic feature) or to its dwarfism in a stressed deltaic environment (palaeoecological feature). Its occurrence indicates a period of fully marine conditions during accumulation of the deltaic sediments of the Mezardere Formation.",

The sediments here are facially strongly differentiated as is shown in many synthetic profiles of the various tectonic units. Microscopic and chemical studies reliably indicate that the calcite carbonate content of the sediments here considered cannot be correlated with the origin of the rock material. The chemical composition variability is controlled solely by the intermittent influence of the land. The physical properties of the deposits suggest the varying degree of their lithification which is not connected with the structural development.

Shimenolepis from Lixian County in north-western Hunan, which was dated as the Telychian (late Llandovery), has long been regarded as the oldest representative of the placoderms in the world. As such, in addition to eastern Yunnan and the Lower Yangtze Region, north-western Hunan represents another important area in South China that yields important fossil material for the research of early vertebrates and related stratigraphy. Here we summarise the Silurian fishes known in north-western Hunan so far, and classify them into three vertebrate assemblages (i.e., the Wentang, Maoshan, and Yangtze assemblages). Based on the updated Silurian vertebrate and stratigraphic databases, the Silurian fish-bearing strata in north-western Hunan can be subdivided into the Rongxi, Huixingshao, and Xiaoxi formations in ascending chronological order, which can be correlated with the Lower Red Beds, the Upper Red Beds, and the Ludlow Red Beds in South China, respectively. A new look at the Silurian strata in Lixian suggests that the age of Shimenolepis is late Ludlow rather than late Llandovery as previously suggested. The research on Silurian fishes and biostratigraphy in north-western Hunan not only provides morphological  data of early vertebrates, but also offers new palaeoichthyological evidence for the subdivision, correlation, and age assignment of the Silurian marine red beds in South China. The establishment of a related high-precision Silurian stratigraphic framework in north-western Hunan will help to elucidate the temporal and spatial distribution of Silurian fossil fishes, deepen the understanding of the evolution of early vertebrates, and unravel the coevolution between Silurian vertebrates and the palaeoenvironment.",

However, the exact age of the sedimentary basin infill has been under discussion for a long time. Because of new published data, the authors have decided to revisit this basin. Palynological data has allowed us to assign the Cao Bang Basin infill to the Lower Oligocene PC1 complex of the Shangcun Fm. (southern China). Among the saccate grains of gymnosperms, the domination of Cathaya and Pinus was observed, whereas angiosperms are represented by Carya , Celtis , Hammamelidaceae, Ulmus and also Pterocarya , Quercus , the Castanea – Castanopsis – Lithocarpus group, and the Loranthaceae. Among pteridophytes occur Laevigatosporites , Osmundaceae, and Pteris . The sedimentological features of the Cao Bang Basin are distinct from those of other basins from the Cao Bang-Tien Yen Fault Zone. The basin is filled with a wide variety of clastic deposits, from some of coarse-grained, alluvial-fan origin, through sandy beds of fluvial origin up to fine, organic-rich lacustrine deposits. The coarse-grained lithofacies are built of clasts derived mainly from local sources. The sandstones from the basin equally are submature or immature. They contain a lot of lithoclasts, the composition of which depends on the sample location within the basin. The potential source area is composed of older sedimentary units and of granitic rocks. The geochemical samples studied reflect the geochemical composition of silicic source rocks with only a minor contribution of basic components. The succession that fills the basin is interpreted as a typical fill for relatively long-lasting evolving half-graben or strike-slip basins. Moreover, the basin is partly occupied by a subsequent present-day sedimentary basin of Quaternary age.",

The Pelplin Formation consists of organic carbon- rich mudstones that have recently been the target of intensive investigations, as they represent a potential source of shale gas. The Pelplin mudstones host numerous calcite concretions containing authigenic pyrite and barite. Mineralogical and petrographic examination (XRD, optical microscopy, cathodoluminoscopy, SEM-EDS) and stable isotope analyses (δ13Corg, δ13C and δ18O of carbonates, δ34S and δ18O of barite) were carried out in order to understand the diagenetic conditions that led to precipitation of this carbonate-sulfide-sulfate paragenesis and to see if the concretions can enhance the understanding of sedimentary settings in the Baltic and Lublin basins during the Silurian. Barite formed during early diagenesis before and during the concretionary growth due to a deceleration of sedimentation during increased primary productivity. The main stages of concretionary growth took place in yet uncompacted sediments shortly after their deposition in the sulfate reduction zone. This precompactional cementation led to preferential preservation of original sedimentary structures, faunal assemblages and early- diagenetic barite, which have been mostly lost in the surrounding mudstones during burial. These components allowed for the reconstruction of important paleoenvironmental conditions in the Baltic and Lublin basins, such as depth, proximity to the detrital orogenic source and marine primary productivity. Investigation of the concretions also enabled estimation of the magnitude of mechanical compaction of the mudstones and calculation of original sedimentation rates. Moreover, it showed that biogenic methane was produced at an early-diagenetic stage, whereas thermogenic hydrocarbons migrated through the Pelplin Formation during deep burial.",

The aim of this research is to reconstruct the sedimentary environments and the palaeoredox conditions in the axial part of the Baltic-Podolian Basin during the event. For these purposes, the Pasłęk IG-1 core section has been examined using microfacies analysis, framboid pyrite diameter and carbon isotope measurements. The prelude to the event records an increased influx of detrital dolomite interpreted as eolian dust, coupled with a pronounced decrease in the diameter of the pyrite framboids, indicating persistent euxinic conditions across the event. The event climax is recorded as the Reda Member and consists of calcisiltites, composed of calcite microcrystals (‘sparoids’), which are interpreted as suspensoids induced by phytoplankton blooms in the hipersaturation conditions present in the epipelagic layer of the basin. Both the prelude and climax facies show lamination, interpreted as having resulted from periodical settling of marine snow, combined with hydraulic sorting within a ‘benthic flocculent layer’, which additionally may be responsible for a low organic matter preservation rate due to methanogenic decomposition. Contrary to the observed basinward CIE decline in the benthic carbonates in the basin, the Reda Member records an extremely positive CIE (up to 8.25‰). Given the pelagic origin of the sparoids, the CIE seems to record surface-water carbon isotope ratios. This points to a large carbon isotope gradient and kinetic fractionation between surface and bottom waters during the mid-Ludfordian event in a strongly stratified basin. The Reda facies-isotope anomaly is regarded as undoubtedly globally triggered, but amplified by the stratified and euxinic conditions in the partly isolated, Baltic-Podolian basin. Hence, the common interpretation of the basin record as representative for the global ocean needs to be treated with great caution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The sedimentary succession of the Permian to Middle Triassic of the Albanian Alps is described, as part of the eastern Adria passive margin towards the Tethys. A carbonate ramp deepening towards NE in present day coordinates developed during the Middle Permian and was affected by block faulting with the deposition of carbonate breccia. The Early Triassic was characterized by intense terrigenous deposition with several cobble conglomerate units up to 80 m-thick, and by oolitic carbonate shoals. The fine clastic deposition ended gradually during the earliest Anisian and a wide calcarenitic ramp occupied the area, with small local carbonate mounds. Basinward, the red nodular limestone of the Han Bulog Formation was interbedded with calcarenitic material exported from the ramp. Drowning to more open conditions occurred towards the end of the Pelsonian. Subsequently, cherty limestone and tuffitic layers spread over the entire area. Towards the end of the Ladinian, with the end of the volcanic activity, red pelagic limestone was deposited locally for a short period. By the latest Ladinian most of the area returned to shallow-water conditions, with a peritidal carbonate platform. In the Theth area, in contrast, a basin with black organic-rich dolostone and limestone developed which seems to be unique in that part of the Adria passive margin. The occurrence of cobble conglomerate units in the Lower Triassic testifies to very active block faulting and high accommodation, not yet described for the area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The lower and middle Berriasian sedimentary succession of the Sidi Kralif Formation has been a subject of biostratigraphic study in two key sections in Central Tunisia. Our contribution is an attempt to better define the basal Berriasian interval, between the Berriasella jacobi Zone and the Subthurmannia occitanica Zone. Zonal schemes are established using ammonites and calpionellids, and these permit correlation with other regions of Mediterranean Tethys and beyond. The use of biomarkers afforded by microfossil groups has allowed characterization and direct correlation with four widely accepted calpionellid sub-zones, namely Calpionella alpina, Remaniella, Calpionella elliptica and Tintinopsella longa. The two ammonite zones of Berriasella jacobi and of Subthurmannia occitanica are recognised on the basis of their index species. The parallel ammonite and calpionellid zonations are useful as a tool for correlation and calibration in time and space, thus allowing a better definition of a J/K boundary. The presence of four Berriasian calpionellid bioevents is recognised: (1) the ‘explosion’ of Calpionella alpina, (2) the first occurrence of Remaniella, (3) the first occurrence of Calpionella elliptica and (4) the first occurrence of Tintinopsella longa. The last is here documented as coeval with the presence of Subthurmannia occitanica, which marks the lower/middle Berriasian boundary.",

This assemblage has many species in common with the late late Albian faunas from condensed deposits of England, Switzerland, and France. The presence of Callihoplites tetragonus indicates the lowermost upper upper Albian Mortoniceras fallax Zone. The ammonites studied are the youngest elements in the phosphate bed, which also contains taxa as old as the middle Albian Hoplites dentatus Zone. This bed originated through condensation and reworking of nodules and fossils in a period of low net sedimentation rate, being probably a reflection of a sea-level drop at the boundary between the classic ammonite zones of Mortoniceras inflatum and Stoliczkaiella dispar.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The cerium anomalies preserved in the Chalk have been investigated as possible palaeoredox indicators of the Late Cretaceous Sea and its sediment. This has been based upon over a hundred new rare earth element analyses of selected samples and grain size fractions from the Chalk. Particular attention has been given to the methodology of differentiating between the cerium anomalies preserved in the bioclastic calcite and those in carbonate-fluorapatite preserved in the acetic acid insoluble residues of chalks. Variations in the cerium anomaly of different particle size fractions of uncemented chalks suggest that fractionation of rare earth elements between the Chalk’s seawater and the various organisms that contributed skeletal material to the bioclastic calcite of the Chalk may have occurred. Post-depositional processes of calcite cementation and late diagenetic sulphidisation have had no apparent effect on the cerium anomaly of the acetic acid insoluble residues. The cerium anomalies associated with the acetic acid insoluble residues from (1) an alternating sequence of chalks and marls from Ballard Cliff (Dorset, UK) typical of Milankovitch cyclicity show a marked diagenetic pattern, whereas those from (2) non-volcanic and volcanic marls display a pattern that is best explained by the variations in the availability of phosphorus and the timing of argillisation of volcanic glass during diagenesis. The general conclusion is drawn that the cerium anomalies preserved in the Chalk can provide an insight into the changing palaeoredox conditions in the Late Cretaceous Sea as well as in the pore fluids of its sediments.",

The lowest comes from the glauconitic basal transgressive unit of the first cycle, and comprises 21 species, including Kamerunoceras douvillei (Pervinquiere, 1907), Kamerunoceras turoniense (d’Orbigny, 1850), Spathites (Jeanrogericeras) revelerianus (Courtiller, 1860), Spathites (Jeanrogericeras) combesi (d’Orbigny, 1856), Mammites nodosoides (Schluter, 1871), Mammites powelli Kennedy, Wright and Hancock, 1987, Fagesia tevestensis (Peron, 1896), Neoptychites cephalotus (Coutiller, 1860), Thomasites rollandi (Thomas and Peron, 1889), Wrightoceras wallsi Reyment, 1954, and Choffaticeras (Choffaticeras) quaasi (Peron, 1904). This is a Lower Turonian assemblage referred to the Mammites nodosoides Zone, although the possibility that elements from the preceding Fagesia catinus Zone are also present cannot be excluded. The fauna from the transgressive glauconitic interval of the succeeding cycle comprises nine species, including Romaniceras (Romaniceras) mexicanum Jones, 1938, Romaniceras (Yubariceras) ornatissimum (Stoliczka, 1864), Pseudotissotia galliennei (d’Orbigny, 1850), Collignoniceras woollgari (Mantell, 1822) sensu lato, Coilopoceras springeri Hyatt, 1903, and Eubostrychoceras (Eubostrychoceras) saxonicum (Schluter, 1872). They indicate the Middle Turonian Romaniceras (R.) mexicanum and R. (Y.) ornatissimum zones. The highest fauna, from the Marnes superieurs de Saint-Louis of the Saint-Louis syncline, is: Subprionocyclus sp. juv., Prionocyclus sp. and Worthoceras cf. rochatianum (d’Orbigny, 1850). The Subprionocyclus are minute individuals that resemble S. bravaisianus (d’Orbigny, 1841), and suggest the presence of the lower Upper Turonian bravaisianus Zone.",

C. tourtiae is recorded for the first time in Poland. The studied material consists of reworked phosphatised internal moulds of phragmocones, which may be of early or middle Cenomanian age, given the stratigraphic range of the associated ammonites. The nautilid moulds vary in inferred mode of infilling, and in intensity of abrasion, bioerosion and mineralisation. The sediment entered the phragmocones in two ways: 1) through punctures in the shell, the result of bioerosion or mechanical damage; 2) through siphonal openings by intracameral currents. In contrast to the fossil moulds from the Albian phosphorites of Annopol, which originated via direct precipitation of apatite around and/or inside fossils, the present nautilid moulds seem to have originated through secondary phosphatisation of the initially calcareous moulds. Diversity of taphonomic signatures in nautilid material from the middle Cenomanian interval at Annopol is compatible with the complex, multievent depositional scenario proposed for this level.",

We report two occurrences of encrustation of Discinisca on a scaphitid ammonite (scaphite) and several inoceramids from the lower Maastrichtian Baculites baculus / Endocostea typica Biozones of the Pierre Shale at two localities. Six specimens of Discinisca are present on a single specimen of Hoploscaphites crassus from east-central Montana. They occur along the furrow at the mature apertural margin. Because the brachiopods are restricted to the margin and do not occur on the rest of the shell, it is likely that they encrusted the ammonite during its lifetime. If so, this implies that the soft body of the scaphite did not cover the outside surface of the aperture, leaving this area vulnerable to epizoan attachment. A total of 13 specimens of Discinisca are also present on four specimens of Cataceramus ? barabini from east-central Wyoming. The brachiopods occur in crevices on the outside of the shells and may have encrusted the inoceramids after their death as the shells began to break down and delaminate, resulting from the decomposition of the organic matrix holding them together. Based on the faunal assemblages at both localities, the presence of Discinisca may indicate environments with either low oxygen levels and/or few predators or competitors.",

Considering the short period of time covered by MIS 5e, the amount of data is surprisingly large. There is still an ongoing debate on whether the age of some assemblages is Eemian, latest Saalian or even earliest Weichselian. There are faunal assemblages or stratigraphically isolated finds with some disputable evidence. The full picture of the evolution of the Eemian vertebrate fauna in the present-day territory of Poland is still far from being complete. The finds of various groups of vertebrates (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) from the Eemian Interglacial of Poland are analysed in terms of their environmental preferences. A number of thermophilic species or forms which preferred temperate climate conditions are known from this period. Among them, Clethrionomys glareolus, Glis glis, Meles meles, Martes martes, Lynx lynx, Felis silvestris, Sus scrofa, Palaeoloxodon antiquus, and Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis indicate a forest environment. The presence of species that preferred more open environments ( Cricetus cricetus, Mammuthus primigenius, Coelodonta antiquitatis, and Equus ferus) is also recorded for the Eemian Interglacial of Poland. Characteristic was the presence of the large broad-toothed and flat-headed Ursus arctos taubachensis, which additionally often outnumbered remains of Ursus spelaeus sensu lato in the contemporary layers. The Eemian vertebrate fauna of Poland consisted of about 150 species (representing 61 genera and 26 families), most of which were recorded earlier from other localities of this age in central and eastern Europe.",

The sedimentary structures featuring the ichnotope and a comparative study of the life requirements of the present-day burrowing sea-anemones indicate a shallow sublittoral environment in which these coelenterates have gregariously lived. An ichnological analysis shows that the newly established ichnotaxa should be included into the Bergaueria group of the sea-anemone burrows. The taphonomical conditions under which the swarmy populated biotopes of the sea-anemones were suddenly buried had resulted from the deposition of sandy material from storm-agitated waters ( i.e., formation of tempestites). It is also suggested that other gregariously occurring sea-anemone burrows display a similar thanatocoenotic character.",

The relation can be well matched by a curve described by a formula: f(x) = 5.7103 x 0.81633 . The size of the measured specimens must therefore be taken into account in those studies of the stromatoporoid morphology, where it is concerned a palaeoenvironmental indicator. The stromatoporoids adopted several types of initial surfaces, corresponding to various growth strategies in the first phase of their growth in response to various environmental conditions, such as substrate consistency and sedimentation rate. Latilaminae arrangement well records the stromatoporoid growth history and therefore its studies are crucial in environmental interpretations, as the conclusions inferred from the shape alone might be very misleading.",

This offers a new insight into content of the genus Paracidaris POMEL, 1883, to which the species Paracidaris blumenbachi (MUNSTER in GOLDFUSS, 1826), P. elegans (MUNSTER in GOLDFUSS, 1826), P. florigemma (PHILLIPS, 1829), P. laeviscula  (L.

    "abstract": "The modern microbial mat from clastic depostis of the Puck Bay coastal shallows and Holocene siliciclastic, laminated deposits were studied by means of sedimentological and geomicrobiological methods. It was discovered that the latter one originated as a result of burial of microbial mats. This is indicated by structural features of the deposits ( i.e. relatively high organic matter content, lamination) and by species composition of microfossils of which cyanobacteria, green algae and diatoms are the most abundant. Amongst cyanobacteria there both coccoid and filamentous forms occurred. Filamentous forms were represented by genera Lyngbya, Oscillatoria, Phormidium and Spirulina . These are the main matforming microorganisms during the summer bloom of cyanobacteria (late August - early September). The predomination of Opephora olsenii amongst diatoms and relatively high content of filamentous cyanobacteria indicate that Holocene laminated deposits originated as a result of fossilization of microbial mats at their maximum development i.e. during the bloom of cyanobacteria. At that time the Puck Bay mat possesses the highest preservation potential. This is favored by high organic matter content, elimination of zoobenthos, low activity of hydrodynamic factors and rapid burial of the mat by the sediments. The origin of Holocene laminated deposits is connected with the Puck Bay water level rise during the last millenium.",

A second bentonite, T C2 , only recently recognised at Sohlde-Loges, is now identified at Woltwiesche and in the distal/expanded white limestone successions of the Salzgitter-Salder Quarry and the Floteberg road-cutting (both Lower Saxony).

On this basis, a bentonite, previously identified as T C at Hoppenstedt must be reassigned as T C2 . Examination of the major, trace, and rare-earth element (REE) data of all the five bentonites identified in Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt shows that it is possible to discriminate between them to some extent. Bentonites T C and T C2 are geochemically similar and separable from T D , which is itself distinct from T E and T F .",

On such a basis, shallow marine conditions are reconstructed and the paleogeography of the region discussed. The Lower Tortonian transgression was the only marine invasion in the Miocene herein and its sedimentary cycle resulted from subsequent changes in the morphology of both the flooded area and the adjacent Holy Cross land. In this cycle, the sedimentation of diversified·sandy and calcareous, mostly lithothamnian facies was succeeded by a widespread sublittoral accumulation of dertrital material derived from the contemporaneously block-uplifted marginal parts of the basin. The progressing block-faulting processes in the Holy Cross land resulted in the gradual emersion of the area in which the marine basin had consequently vanished.",

Two main, mature stage, stromatoporoid growth modes have been discerned: erect and semi-buried. The growth orientations of the stromatoporoids were studied in 17 sections that expose four different facies in the quarry. The inclinations of the basal surfaces of specimens and direction of the growth axes were measured and compared in terms of different growth modes, facies and positions in the organic buildup. The results support the earlier opinions that the inclined contact between the Kadzielnia stromatoporoid-coral limestones and the detrital limestones is depositional and represents an inclined depositional surface, and that the Kadzielnia buildup developed in a calm water setting below the storm wave base on a slope or at its foot. General conclusions emerging from the studies are: 1) stromatoporoid growth directions hold a key to reconstructing ancient topography; 2) erect stromatoporoids that grew on inclined surfaces changed the growth axes to the vertical direction during their growth; and 3) stromatoporoid growth directions and particularly the changing mode of growth of erect forms support the view that Palaeozoic stromatoporoids acted photosensitively.",

A wide range of carbonates occurring in the sediments was analysed for δ 18 O and δ 13 C records, including shells of several gastropod species, the bivalve genus Pisidium and carapaces of ostracods belonging to the subfamily Candoninae. The δ 18 O and δ 13 C records reveal changes commonly observed for the Late Glacial and early Holocene with the exception of the low oxygen isotope values of the Bolling andAllerod Interstadials. The latter is interpreted as a consequence of 18 O-depletion of the lake water resulting from gradual melting of the dead ice that still filled the deepest parts of the Lake Lednica valley during the period described. TheYounger Dryas Stadial begins with the isotopically lightest values in the sequence; however, due to the 18O-depleted values of theAllerod Interstadial the Allerod/Younger Dryas boundary is poorly marked. The Younger Dryas/Preboreal transition is documented by a significant shift in δ 18 O values of about 2–3‰, resulting from an increase in the mean annual temperature. The δ 13 C record reflects the productivity level in the lake, with 13 C-enriched carbonates during the Bolling andAllerod Interstadials, and the Preboreal and Boreal, when photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton and macrophytes was the most intensive. Differences in δ 18 O and δ 13 C values between mollusc shells and ostracod carapaces reflect the specific season and subhabitat of each carbonate secretion.",

Synsedimentary block-faulting and jointing affected the Jurassic limestone-basement, causing the uplift of a local horst (the Glanow Horst), to within the littoral zone so that it became exposed to abrasion. It is inferred that a hurricane or catastrophic storm surge swept limestone debris fallen from the cliff out to the sandy offshore, where nucleation of soluble silica was presumably favoured by the decay of the soft tissue of live or dead rock-borers. After filling the empty borings and solution of the limestone clasts, the nucleation progressed intensely, finally completed by precipitation of siliceous sinter in the hollow interiors of some of the concretions during subsequent diagenesis and/or epigenesis.",

A succession of Middle-Upper Bathonian (Subcontractus-Retrocostatum zones) ore-bearing clays exposed at Gnaszyn has been investigated for the presence of dinoflagellate cysts. The assemblages are dominated by Ctenidodinium . However, analysis of diversity shows some subtle differences throughout the succession, possibly related to the palaeoenvironmental conditions in the photic zone. Impoverished assemblages, dominated by Ctenidodinium , occur mainly in monotonous muddy intervals. More diverse assemblages, albeit also dominated by Ctenidodinium , occur in intervals which contain siderite concretion levels. The taxonomic composition of the former assemblage seems to reflect slightly restricted conditions in the photic zone, possibly related to a minor reduction in salinity and/or increase in nutrient availability. More diverse dinoflagellate cyst assemblages reflect periods of less intense terrigenous influx and relatively higher, possibly normal, salinity. These changes were possibly caused by variable intensity of freshwater influx into the basin, controlled by sea-level fluctuations. Sea-level changes may be related to migrations of Tethyan water masses, which were probably partly responsible for the composition of the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bituminous coals and clastic rocks from the Lublin Formation (Pennsylvanian, Westphalian B) were subjected to detailed biomarker and Rock-Eval analyses. The investigation of aliphatic and aromatic fractions and Rock-Eval T max suggests that the Carboniferous deposits attained relatively low levels of thermal maturity, at the end of the microbial processes/initial phase of the oil window. Somewhat higher values of maturity in the clastic sediments were caused by postdiagenetic biodegradation of organic matter. The dominance of the odd carbon-numbered n-alkanes in the range n-C 25 to n-C 31 , high concentrations of moretanes and a predominance of C 28 and C 29 steranes are indicative of a terrigenous origin of the organic matter in the study material. This is supported by the presence of eudesmane, bisabolane, dihydro-ar-curcumene and cadalene, found mainly in the coal samples. In addition, tri- and tetracyclic diterpanes, e. g. 16β(H)-kaurane, 16β(H)-phyllocladane, 16α(H)-kaurane and norisopimarane, were identified, suggesting an admixture of conifer ancestors among the deposited higher plants. Parameters Pr/n-C 17 and R dit in the coal samples show deposition of organic matter from peat swamp environments, with the water levels varying from high (water-logged swamp) to very low (ephemeral swamp). Clastic deposits were accumulated in a flood plain environment with local small ponds/lakes. In pond/lake sediments, apart from the dominant terrigenous organic matter, research also revealed a certain quantity of algal matter, indicated, i.a., by the presence of tricyclic triterpanes C 28 and C 29 and elevated concentrations of steranes. The Paq parameter can prove to be a useful tool in the identification of organic matter, but the processes of organic matter biodegradation observed in clastic rocks most likely influence the value of the parameter, at the same time lowering the interpretation potential of these compounds. The value of Pr/Ph varies from 0.93 to 5.24 and from 3.49 to 22.57 in the clastic sediments and coals respectively. The microbial degradation of organic matter in both type of rocks and during early stages of diagenesis is confirmed by a high concentration of hopanes, the presence of drimane homologues, bicyclic alkanes and benzohopanes. Moreover, bacteria could also have been connected with the primary input of organic matter, which is shown by the presence of e.g. C 30 neohop-13(18)-ene.",

Les variations climatiques concues en tant que methode que l’auteur definit comme methode climato-stratigraphique peuvent servir de base a la division de la stratigraphie du Quaternaire. Les divisions climato-stratigraphiques doivent se baser sur des unites definies representant un ordre adequat de variations climatiques. L’auteur propose leur disposition et leurs denominations suivantes: Les variations climatiques de I-er ordre - p e riodes (glaciaires et interglaciaires, pluviaires et interpluviaires ev. arides), de II-e ordre – stades (glaci-stades, inter-glaci-stades, calido-stades, frigid-stades, pluvio-stades, arido-stades), de III-e ordre – phases (glaci-phases, inter-glaci-phases, calido-phases, frigido-phases, phyto-phases, etc.), de IV-e ordre - etapes (etape d’arret des glaciers, oscillations d’etapes etc.). Comme base de parallelisation il est le plus juste d’admettre les moments critiques dans l’evolution des phenomenes dependant des changements de climat (de la tendence des changements) que l’on peut discerner assez surement au moyen des methods dont nous disposons. Se referant a celles-ci l’auteur propose un systeme adequant de symbolique stratigraphique.",

The upper part of the Kościeliska valley in the Tatra Mts. is built of metamorphic and granitoid rocks belonging to the crystalline core of the Tatras, also of the autochthonous sedimentary cover. The geological field observations suggest that the metamorphic rocks represent a parametamorphic complex which resulted from Variscan lithogenesis and metamorphism. In relation to the Variscan diastrophism the granitoids are late-orogenic, being essentially plutonic rocks but in the top parts and within the metamorphic cover they are metasomatic in character. The sedimentary series belong to the Alpine cycle. New mapping of the terrain and a statistical analysis of the plotted structural measurements reveal that, during Variscan orogeny, the crystalline rocks were subjected to very moderate, disturbances of a brachy-fold character. The Alpine orogeny, however, had a disjunctive character in the crystalline massif, being of a mixed nature in the sedimentary cover. An analysis of the observations made throughout the Tatras suggests -that the main Variscan trends in these mountains were probably vertical to those so far accepted, i.e., that they had a N-S - NE-SW direction. As for the Alpine orogeny - probably :in the crystalline massif of the, whole Tatra range - it was responsible for the formation of major dislocations; blocks, delimited by these dislocations, represent the transversal elevations and depressions long known within the Tatras. Numerous microstructures formed in the crystalline massif during the Alpine phases, mostly slickensides and striae, locally also fracture cleavage and microfolds.",

The Supragetic basement (external section of the Carpatho-Balkan arch) represents a tectonically reworked basement vestige of the Neoproterozoic–Lower Paleozoic oceanic floor system recrystallized under regional low temperature greenschist-facies conditions. The regional geological constraints associated with this low-grade basement are integrated with information from the overlying Silurian, Devonian and Lower Carboniferous cap-rocks of the “Kučaj Unit” to demonstrate the presence of a major Paleozoic ocean crossing this segment of SEE. In connection with the Lower Paleozoic north Gondwanan Pan- African processes, the low-grade Supragetic basement (including its Devonian cover) is in a complex relationship with the occasionally anchimetamorphic Silurian, Devonian, and Lower Carboniferous deep-water record of the polymetamorphic “Kučaj Unit”. The Upper Devonian–Lower Carboniferous flysch and molasse of the “Kučaj Unit” are interposed with the Neoproterozic–Lower Paleozoic oceanic vestige or with the Supragetic basement with the corresponding Devonian Balkan-Carpathian back-arc ophiolite-bearing lithosphere and its carrier (Danubian Unit). This regional-scale synthesis demonstrates that a segment of the Rheic Ocean referred to as the Saxo-Thuringian seaway and its suture lay to the east, underneath the Permian red-bed overstepping sequence and to the west of the Danubian aggregation. Unlike many of the high-pressure rocks characterizing the segment of the Rheic suture in the Central European Variscides, the SEE zone described here has only a mild overprint.",

This parallelism is interpreted as evidence that the trackmakers were entrained in flowing water and had to change course due to the current. If this interpretation is correct, then morphological differences between B. laqueatus and terrestrial insect trackways could be explained by the trackmaker moving subaqueously. Further, B. laqueatus would constitute only the second insect trackway from this region to be recognized as being made subaqueously. From an ecological standpoint, the aquatic insects that made B. laqueatus were probably near the base of the local food chain, the apex predators of which were piscivorous theropod dinosaurs.",

Six outcrops from the Rio Claro municipality and surrounding areas, from the Brazilian State of São Paulo, were investigated. The vertebrate groups are Chondrichthyes (Xenacanthiformes, Ctenacanthiformes and Petalodontiformes), Osteichthyes (Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii) and Tetrapodomorpha. They occur as loose teeth, scales, spines and bone remains. The sandy facies is characterized by fining upward deposition. The coarser sandstone immediately above the underlying Tatuí Formation is rich in Chondrichthyes. However, the fine sandstone above, immediately beneath the silty shale facies, is devoid of Chondrichthyes, though Osteichthyes scales, teeth and bones were present. The taphonomy is important for inferring sedimentary processes and then the paleoenvironments. The poor sorting of the sandstone and the presence of fossils that are mostly abraded or worn are indicative of a high energy environment. In contrast, the presence of fossils in a good state of preservation, some without abrasion and breakages are indicative of only limited transport. Differences of fossil spatial density, numbers of specimens and taxa may be explained by the dynamics of deposition, from details of the palaeoenvironment can be obtained.",

The δ 13 C carb values range from -2‰ and +4‰ (VPDB). They agree with previous data from the eastern BCB sections (Aralar) confirming the ammonite age of the OAE1a in the Basque-Cantabrian basin: Deshayesites forbesi, Deshayesites deshayesi, and Deshayesites deshayesi-Dufrenoyia furcata transition Zones. Interregional δ 13 C carb correlation with pelagic (Cismon, Italy, and Mid-Pacific Mountains, DSDP Site 463) and neritic (Roquefort-La Bédoule, France) core sections, reveals a common profile of a wide negative excursion characteristic of the OAE1a. It consists of a double trough separated by a flat relative maximum, with two negative spikes in the upper trough of neritic sections. TOC absolute values range from 0.12% to 1.37%. Segments of the TOC curve with persistent low values closely correspond with descending segments of the δ 13 C carb curve, and are attributed to lesser organic productivity in the BCB. Detailed bulk-rock δ 18 O carb data (-5.71‰ to -1.05 ‰ PDB) and variation curve show two main positive O-isotope shifts and three minor positive inflections, within a general negative trend characteristic of the OAE1a. The two major positive shifts correspond to both shallowing upwards sequences and the lowermost can be related to a eustatic sea level fall. Independent interregional correlation of the O-isotope shifts with C-isotopes supports their interpretation as punctuating colder events within a general warming trend.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mineralogical studies of the Karkonosze granite (ca. 322-312 Ma) and its surroundings in West Sudetes (SW Poland) have provided data on Nb-Ta-REE minerals from pegmatites in the NE part of the pluton and several new finds of Ag minerals and 15 oxygenic Bi phases, hitherto not reported from the massif. The Karkonosze pegmatites are enriched in HREE as fergusonite-(Y) or xenotime-(Y) appear in almost every studied pegmatite, together with a subordinate assemblage of the aeschynite, euxenite or columbite group. The abundance of LREE minerals such as allanite-( Ce) and the monazite group, correlates inversely with the Nb-Ta-Ti minerals, whilst an early generation of monazite-(Ce) revealed an exceptionally high amount of Nd (up to 22 wt.% of Nd 2 O 3 ). The physical and chemical conditions during the magmatic and post-magmatic processes were reconstructed and the effects of contact metamorphism in amphibolites from hornfelsed zones examined. Changes in solution composition and concentration at the early magmatic stage (825-920°C), pegmatitic stage overlapping with hydrothermal (560°C which ended at 160-90°C) and clearly hydrothermal stage (400 to 110°C) were studied in detail by means of melt and fluid inclusions in quartz. Furthermore, post-magmatic fluids, including some enriched in Li and B, were identified in rock-forming quartz from the whole pluton. In turn, study of the amphibolites indicates that the pair cummingtonite + anorthite or the presence of Ca-rich plagioclase with actinolite seem to be reliable mineral proxies of the thermal impact of the granitoid body on amphibolites in its envelope. The inferred conditions of the contact processes (450-550°C, 2.5- 4.8 kbar) point to an elevated geothermal gradient (ca. 32-45°C/km) probably reflecting the heat flow induced by the Karkonosze intrusion. Moreover, despite the textural and mineral changes imposed by regional and contact metamorphism, the amphibolites have their pre-metamorphic (magmatic) geochemical features undisturbed.",

    "abstract": "The presented studies focus on changes in groundwater levels and chemistry, and the identification of important factors influencing these changes on short- and long-term scales in urban areas. The results may be useful for rational and sustainable groundwater planning and management in cities. The studies concerned three aquifers: (1) the shallow Quaternary aquifer, (2) the deep Quaternary aquifer, and (3) the Oligocene aquifer in the capital city of Warsaw (Poland). The spatial variability of groundwater recharge was determined and its changes in time were characterized. The characteristics of groundwater levels were based on long-term monitoring series. The results indicate that urban development has caused overall reduction in infiltration recharge (from 54 to 51 mm/ year), which is particularly clear in the city suburbs and in its centre, where land development has significantly densified during the last 30 years. Studies of groundwater levels indicate variable long-term trends. However, for the shallowest aquifer, the trends indicate a gradual decrease of the groundwater levels. In the case of the much deeper Oligocene aquifer, groundwater table rise is observed since the 1970s (averagely c. 20 m), which is related with excessive pumping. Based on the studied results, the groundwater chemistry in the subsurface aquifer indicates strong anthropogenic influence, which is reflected in multi-ionic hydrogeochemical types and the occurrence of chemical tracers typical of human activity. The Oligocene aquifer is characterized by a chemical composition indicating the influence of geogenic factors.",

These studies included an analysis of the morphological (topographic) situation of the loess cover, its grain size and heavy mineral composition, the preserved structures of loess sedimentation as well as mollusc and pollen analyses of this loess. They revealed that the accumulation of Upper Younger Loess (UYL) might have been more dependent on the prevailing moisture conditions than previously thought. These conditions could have been caused by cold air masses from an ice sheet and warm air masses from the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic coming together in the Carpathians and the Holy Cross Mountains and favouring the formation of dust storms and precipitation. In this process, a loading of loess dust (formed from local rocks weathering in periglacial conditions) by atmospheric moisture particles was especially significant. The moist substrate not only favoured the periodic development of vegetation and molluscs but also enabled the interception of dust and the accumulation of an increasingly thick loess cover. Westerly and south-westerly winds predominated in the UYL as indicated by the topographic position of loess patches and the mineral composition of the studied loess. Periodically an increased air circulation from the east and northeast occurred.",

Vertical thermal gradient of the parent fluids was 6 to 10°C, and the ore crystallization temperature ranges varied from < 10°C at deep levels to 25°C at shallow levels. The peculiarities of formation of primary and secondary fluid inclusions from organic-matter-bearing water-dominated medium, position of the inclusions in crystals, features of secondary inclusions, the inclusion refilling phenomena, their bearing on recrystallization of ores, and Th distribution in single fissure fillings were considered. The ore-forming fluids were Iiquid-hydrocarbon-bearing aqueous solutions of Na-Ca-CI type with lower Ca contents in the south and higher Ca contents in the north of the region. The ore-forming fluids had salinities from nil to c . 23 wt. % of NaCl equivalent. Three types of fluids were recognized: (1) low-to-moderate salinity versus high Th , (2) high salinity versus moderate Th , and (3) low salinity versus low-to-moderate Th , attributed to ascending fluids, formation brines, and meteoric descending waters, respectively. The three fluids mixed during ore precipitation.

By correlating the field data derived from applying different analysis, four karstification levels could be identified and assigned to the regional landscape development. The oldest and highest level L IV represents only scattered relics of Late Tertiary karstification. Levels L II and L III are clearly determined by terraces and cave levels. They correspond to major stagnation phases of the regional base level of the river Danube and the pre-alpine glaciation in the Late and Middle Pleistocene. The lowest level L I evolved during the major glaciation of the Riss-period and is still active in the upper reaches but buried under younger deposits in the lower reaches of the area. The study points out the necessity of using different methods to characterise the evolution of karstification.",

It consists of  Inoceramus  crippsi MANTELL, 1822,  I  hoppenstedtensis TROGER, 1967, Inoceramus virgatus scalprum BOHM, 1914 and I. virgatus virgatus SCHLUTER, 1877, as well as transitional forms between I. virgatus virgatus and I. virgatus scalprum and an apparently undescribed sulcate form. The inoceramid fauna is well preserved and very rich in individuals. Many of the inoceramids occur either as double-valved individuals or with the valves in close association and appear to be cocentrated in distinct layers. Co-occurring ammonites are Mantelliceras dixoni SPATH, Mantelliceras sp., Schloenbachia varians (J. SOWERBY), Hypoturrilities gravesianus (D'ORBIGNY) and Scaphites obliquus J. SOWERBY. Using event stratigraphy, the stratigraphic interval of the collected fauna can be assigned to the lower part of the Lower Cenomanian Mantelliceras dixoni ammonite Zone. It predominantly comprises material from the Inoceramus virgatus acme-event (the Schloenbachia / virgatus event of German event stratigraphy) at the top of the lower subzone ( Mantelliceras dixoni & M. saxbii Subzone) of the dixoni Zone, which is known from the Lower Saxony, Cleveland (eastern England) and Anglo-Paris basins, where it invariably occurs in carbonate-rich rocks with low diversity faunas. The lithofacies and geochemistry of the strata are documented and the  Inoceramus  crippsi and Inoceramus virgatu s groups are discussed, including the problematic provenance of the type series of Inoceramus virgatus scalprum.",

Corrosional undercutting and the subsequent gravity collapse of rocks is the chief mechanism involved in the retreat of karst walls and the formation of flat-floored karst depressions. This mechanism comes into action when the negative forms produced by vertical corrosion reach the ground-water level and it is effected by agressive swamp waters or, at sea level, by subsaline marine waters. The role of tropical climate is important in providing huge amounts of solvent by means of heavy rainfalls and by elimination of frost splitting, which in temperate climatic zones is the most effective factor acting upon the exposed limestone walls.",

The thin development of the transgressive terrigenous sequence (8 m) points to slow subsidence and a rapid advance of marine conditions. These deposits are overlain by carbonate-terrigenous (chiefly dolomitic) rocks containing a diversified open-marine fauna. The paleogeography of the early Devonian is discussed. Evidence is presented for a swell, trending E-W, in the southern part of the Holy Cross area; also for the presence of an epicontinental basin filled with Lower Devonian deposits over 1 km thick in the northern periphery of that area.

The paleomagnetic analysis confirms the presence of the three components of characteristic remnant magnetization. Two magnetite-bearing components display reversed (component A) and normal (component B) polarity. The third component (C) is recorded on hematite and shows reversed polarity. Component B is of synfolding origin and has been recorded during the Visean, whereas components Aand C are of postfolding origin and represent Early Permian and Permo-Triassic overprints. These results confirmthe stable position of the Malopolska Massif with respect to the East European craton, at least since the Visean. Results of fold tests imply that the earliest phases of Variscan deformation can be datedmost probably as Visean, while formation of the main Variscan fold structures was completed during the Early Permian. It is also documented that representative Variscan folds did not significantly change their geometry during Maastrichtian-Paleocene reactivation.",

Palaeolimnological reconstructions are based on stable isotope composition (δ 13 C and δ 18 O) of a wide range of biogenic carbonates occurring in the sediments, including shells of several gastropod species and the bivalve genus Pisidium , carapaces of ostracods belonging to the subfamily Candoninae and encrustations and oogonia of the aquatic macrophyte genus Chara . According to the radiocarbon dates obtained, accumulation of the sediment sequence began in the early Atlantic and terminated in the early Subboreal. Both δ 13 C and δ 18 O records reveal significant and frequent fluctuations that are attributed to repeated changes in the Lake Niepruszewskie water balance. However, conditions of prevailing long water residence time, accompanied by high productivity within the lake, are reflected in a 13 C-enriched carbon-isotope record.Minimum δ 13 C and δ 18 O values were recorded for the earliest Atlantic and maximum values characterize the interglacial optimum during the middle and late Atlantic. Discrepancies observed between isotope records of particular taxa reflect the specific season and subhabitat of each carbonate secretion. 13 C-enriched Chara encrustations and oogonia are consistent with their precipitation within the photic zone, which is commonly 13 C-enriched due to the photosynthetic activity of macrophytes and phytoplankton. The carbon isotope composition of Lymnaea auricularia shells indicates that breathing behaviour leaves its imprint on δ 13 C in snail shells. In aquatic air-breathing pulmonate gastropods this results in 13 C-depletion in shells. Isotope records of individual shells of two snail species, Valvata piscinalis and Gyraulus laevis , indicate that in order to obtain mean δ 13 C and δ 18 O values that are representative of a 5 cm thick sampling interval, stable isotope signatures of more than five shells must be obtained.",

Studied samples represent a range in present burial depth from 340 to 2150 m. The carbonate cement is dominantly ferroan dolomite that occurs as dispersed patches of poikilotopic crystals. Temperatures of dolomite precipitation, based on δ 18 O values, range from27°C in the shallow buried to 95°C in the deep buried sandstones. The burial historymodelling points to development ofmost of the dolomite cement during rapid Silurian-Devonian subsidence and Carboniferous-early Permian uplift. Awide range of precipitation temperatures indicate that temperature was not a major factor in triggering the carbonate cementation. Dolomite precipitation is related to early stages of organic matter maturation and thus to the oil generation history in the basin. δ 13 C values vary from +0.03‰to -6.2‰(PDB), suggesting limited addition of carbon from an organic source, with the major part derived from marine bicarbonate. The sourcing of carbon from the organic-rich Cambrian shales is identified from the distribution of δ 13 C values in the dolomite cement within the Cambrian section. The chemical composition of the dolomite cement shows a depth-controlled trend that is  oincident with the present-day hydrochemical zonation of the Cambrian aquifer. The increase in the Fe content of the dolomite towards the deeper buried part of the Baltic basin is related to increasing sourcing of ions (Fe and Mg) from adjacent shales.",

This is expressed by the fact that the joints occur in various stages of development – from the directionally oriented zones of increased internal strains and the macroscopically undetectable cracks to fissures opened up in a varying degree. 4) The appearance of joint in result of directionally oriented zones of increased internal strains may be referred to the earliest phases of tectonic movements which are responsible for the formation of the Podhale depression. 5) The morphology of the joints closely resembles that of the fatigue-cracks which are apt to arise for example in metals.",

Geographically intermediate contemporaneousMoroccan faunas also show a fundamentally different composition but the Afro-Appalachian migration route must have been viable in the uppermost Famennian. Migrations through regions without leaving a trace in available very rich fossil records (“ghost distributions”) create a bias for the palaeobiogeographical analysis of nektonic organisms.

Quartz c-axis fabrics in constrictionally strained orthogneisses: implications for the evolution of the Orlica-Śnieżnik Dome, the Sudetes, Poland. Acta Geologica Polonica, 63 (4), 697-722, Warszawa. The Orlica-Śnieżnik Dome (OSD), NE Bohemian Massif, contains in its core several gneiss variants with protoliths dated at ~500 Ma. In the western limb of the OSD, rodding augen gneisses (Spalona gneiss unit) are mainly L&gt;S tectonites with a prominent stretching lineation. The few quartz LPO studies have produced somewhat discrepant results. Reexamination of these rocks revealed that texture formation was a protracted, multistage process that involved strain partitioning with changing strain rate and kinematics in a general shear regime at temperatures of the amphibolite facies (450-600°C). Quartz c-axis microfabrics show complex yet reproducible patterns that developed under the joint control of strain geometry and temperature; thus the LPOs are mixed features represented by pseudogirdle patterns. Domainal differences in quartz microfabrics (ribbons, tails, quartzo-feldspathic aggregate) are common in the Spalona orthogneisses but uncommon in the sheared migmatitic gneisses. In the latter rocks, the constrictional strain was imposed on the originally planar fabric defined by high-temperature migmatitic layering. The constrictional fabric of the Spalona gneisses may have developed in the hinge zones of kilometer-scale folds, where the elongation occurred parallel to the fold axes. Other occurrences of rodding gneisses throughout the Orlica-Śnieżnik Dome are thought to occupy similar structural positions, which would point to the significance of large-scale folds in the tectonic structure of the dome.",

The samples come from the Jantar Bituminous Claystones Member of the Opalino core, Baltic Basin, northern Poland. Images were obtained with spatial resolution of 25 μm, which enabled the authors to create a 3-D visualization and to calculate the ratio of fissure and graptolite volume to the total sample volume. A set of μCT slices was used to create a 3-D reconstruction of graptolite geometry. These μCT slices were processed to obtain a clearly visible image and the volume ratio. A copper X-ray source filter was used during exposure to reduce radiograph artifacts. Visualization of graptolite tubaria (rhabdosomes) enabled Demirastrites simulans to be identified. Numerical models of graptolites reveal promising applications for paleontological research and thus for the recognition and characterization of reservoir rocks.",

A new family Ventalepididae fam. nova is established for this genus upon a peculiar combination of characters, including scale structure and dermal bones ornamentation.

Palaeozoogeographical analysis suggests Laurentian affinities of the Ventalepis assemblage demonstrating the major congruency to the Belgian and East Greenland ones. These and Russian localities are separated by a vast ORS continent. Presence of the dipnoan Jarvikia in all three locations, as well as an Ichthyostega -like tetrapod in the Belgian one reveals palaeozoogeographical connections, which might reflect possible dwelling not only in the near-shore continent periphery but also in the river systems of the continent itself.",

The intraspecific variability of the type species, its neotype, the intra-generic framework and a new generic diagnosis are established. Many more than 100 taxa related and/or similar to Bothrophyllum were analyzed and the most important of them are discussed. Detailed analysis of the type species based on the neotype and supported by additional topotype specimens illustrated here, allows restriction of both the type species and the genus, and leads to the proposition that Bothrophyllum -like taxa with a shortened cardinal septum should be considered of subgeneric (not named) status. Detailed analysis of the specimens and species described and illustrated from the type site (Myachkovo Quarry, Moscow Basin) form the basis for further considerations. On the basis of that analysis and characters established for the type species, taxa from all other European, African, Asiatic and North American areas either named Bothrophyllum or bearing characters of that genus were analyzed. The supposed origin and discussion of the relationships conclude the paper. A list of synonyms and exclusions from Bothrophyllum and lists of species included, excluded, or possibly belonging to Bothrophyllum and Bothrophyllum -like corals with a shortened cardinal septum are presented.",

Measurements were performed on glacially abraded basaltic surfaces within the Little Ice Age (LIA) glacial forelands of Hoffelsjökull, Fláajökull, Skálafellsjökull and Virkisjökull in Iceland. Results show a statistical increase in micro-roughness in a direction from the glacial termini to LIA moraines. However, a major change in the micro-roughness of basaltic surfaces only occurs during the first 80 to 100 years since the onset of subaerial weathering. Increase in rock surface micro-roughness is accompanied by an increase in weathering rind thickness and a decrease in Schmidt hammer R-values. Micro-roughness measurements with the use of the Handysurf E-35B can provide insights into initial rates of rock surface micro-relief development. The use of this instrument as a relative dating technique is limited to fine-grained rocks and decadal time-scales of weathering because of the limited range of measureable micro-relief amplitude.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The relationship between the development of iron sulfide and barite nodules in the Cenomanian Chalk of England and the presence of a red hematitic pigment has been investigated using sulfur isotopes. In southern England where red and pink chalks are absent, iron sulfide nodules are widespread. Two typical large iron sulfide nodules exhibit δ 34 S ranging from −48.6‰ at their core to −32.6‰ at their outer margins. In eastern England, where red and pink chalks occur in three main bands, there is an antipathetic relationship between the coloured chalks and the occurrence of iron sulfide or barite nodules. Here iron sulfide, or its oxidised remnants, are restricted to two situations: (1) in association with hard grounds that developed originally in chalks that contained the hematite pigment or its postulated precursor FeOH 3 , or (2) in regional sulfidization zones that cut across the stratigraphy. In the Cenomanian Chalk exposed in the cliffs at Speeton, Yorkshire, pyrite and marcasite (both iron sulfide) nodules range in δ 34 S from −34.7‰ to +40.0‰. In the lower part of the section δ 34 S vary from −34.8‰ to +7.8‰, a single barite nodule has δ 34 S between +26.9‰ and +29.9‰. In the middle part of the section δ 34 S ranges from +23.8‰ to +40.0‰. In the sulfidization zones that cut across the Cenomanian Chalk of Lincolnshire the iron sulfide nodules are typically heavily weathered but these may contain patches of unoxidised pyrite. In these zones, δ 34 S ranges from −32.9‰ to +7.9‰. The cross-cutting zones of sulfidization in eastern England are linked to three basement faults – the Flamborough Head Fault Zone, the Caistor Fault and the postulated Wash Line of Jeans (1980) – that have affected the deposition of the Chalk. It is argued that these faults have been both the conduits by which allochthonous fluids – rich in hydrogen sulfide/sulfate, hydrocarbons and possibly charged with sulfate-reducing bacteria – have penetrated the Cenomanian Chalk as the result of movement during the Late Cretaceous or Cenozoic. These invasive fluids are associated with (1) the reduction of the red hematite pigment or its praecursor, (2) the subsequent development of both iron sulfides and barite, and (3) the loss of overpressure in the Cenomanian Chalk and its late diagenetic hardening by anoxic cementation. Evidence is reviewed for the origin of the red hematite pigment of the coloured chalks and for the iron involved in the development of iron sulfides, a hydrothermal or volcanogenic origin is favoured.",

Four successive inoceramid zones are recognized, those of Inoceramus pictus , Mytiloides puebloensis , M. kossmati , and M. mytiloides , as established in the stratotype section at Pueblo, Colorado. Their correlation to Pueblo is confirmed by ammonite data. The mid-Early Turonian zone of M. kossmati yielded an assemblage of Inoceramus , with species showing close affinity to the latest Cenomanian lineages. This multi-species sample proves the survival of Inoceramus lineages into the otherwise Mytiloides -dominated Early Turonian, and indicates that their disappearance from the record of the North American Western Interior was not because of their extinction. It is suggested that the apparent lack of Inoceramus in Lower Turonian strata is due to an extremely low population abundance in the Early Turonian sea.",

In total, the analysis included fifteen profiles of such sediments, which revealed the presence of abundant malacofaunas comprising 39 mollusc species. Five faunistic assemblages differing in species composition and structure were defined in the material studied. Individual assemblages correspond to different climatic and environmental conditions, thereby making it possible to interpret the features of the sedimentary environments and specify the age of the deposits. Faunas with Pupilla loessica and Pupilla sterri containing species typical of loess formations are characteristic of deposits from the coldest phase of the last Glacial period (MIS 2). A fauna with Vertigo genesii, with a large proportion of cold-loving and moisture-loving taxa, is typical of the Younger Dryas. Associations that are dominated by shade-loving species, with Discus ruderatus and Discus perspectivus, correspond to the early and middle Holocene respectively. The investigations show that malacological analysis can be successfully applied to the research into slope deposits, enabling both the depositional conditions and the age of the sediments to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Neptunian dykes filled with Middle Jurassic sediments from the High-Tatric series in the Tatra Mountains are described. Six types of dykes, which constitute two groups, are distinguished, basing on the type of filling deposits, external shape of the systems and character of the walls. Group I embraces all of the dykes with sharp-edged walls and predominantly vertical structures. Group II consists of dykes with smooth walls and predominantly horizontal structures. The distribution of particular types of dykes in the High-Tatric tectonic units is discussed. The processes of the initiation of dykes, their development and filling with deposits are reconstructed. The distribution of the dykes of Group I, their orientation, shape, size and relationship to the host-rocks, indicate the mechanical nature of the initiation phenomena. The dykes of Group II underwent major reconstruction during the development stage, which made studies of their initiation impossible. Neptunian dykes belonging to Group I display features indicating the sole role of mechanical processes during their development. In the dykes of Group II chemical erosion played an important role. Different dykes were filled in different ways. Processes of injection of loose sediments into fissures opening in the solid substrate, rapid burying of open dykes by migrating dunes of crinoidal sand, and slow sieving of fine material into vast systems of voids, are proposed to explain the filling of dykes by various types of sediments. The interpretation of the formation of internal breccias at the footwall of a fault scarp is presented. The influence of pressure dissolution phenomena on the post-depositional history of the neptunian dykes is evaluated. Field and microscopic observations were complemented by isotopic analyses of the sediments and calcite cements filling the dykes. Paleogeographic conclusions based on the characters of the neptunian dykes are given.",

The Bathonian deposits belong to three main lithofacies: crinoidal, ferruginous and nodular limestones. The crinoidal limestones formed by deposition of pelmatozoan material transported over the sea-bottom in the form of megaripples. The ferruginous limestones developed in zones of restricted sedimentation, which were located above the areas of crinoid deposition that surrounded elevated blocks supplying terrigenous material. The nodular limestones represent deeper facies that were deposited on a slope descending towards a deep-sea basin. The Callovian wavy-bedded limestones mark the onset of pelagic deposition, which continued during the Late Jurassic.",

This study investigates the role that predation and parasitism may have played in the inoceramids' demise. Inoceramids show a range of predatory and parasitic features recorded in their shells ranging from extremely rare bore holes to the parasite-induced Hohlkehle. The stratigraphic record of these features suggests that they were virtually absent in inoceramids prior to the Late Turonian and became increasingly abundant through the remainder of the Cretaceous. These results suggest that predation and parasitism may have played a role in the inoceramid extinction, but more rigorous, quantitative data are required to test this hypothesis further.",

Refolded folds and refolded metamorphic rock fabrics, formed under particular P-T conditions and deformed under other P-T conditions, together with a variety of igneous masses whose positions structural sequences can be determined, provide such a complex framework that the likelihood of random matching is remote while the lack of expression of one parameter does not appreciably reduce the strength of the correlation. Isotopic data demonstrating corresponding events in the gneisses from different parts of the region is an additional factor for correlation. With this being associated with matching complex structural frameworks that show evidence of having been formed under the same successive stress systems, together with matching metamorphic and igneous histories, the gneisses of the Presvecokarelides of eastern and eastern central Finland are interpreted as having formed in one orogenic regime. Corresponding sets or features in the granitoid association of northern Finland indicate that the successively formed stress systems were operative over a large crustal segment, while the expression of the various structural metamorphic and igneous features and their interrelations correspond, in many respects, to those of orogens whose evolution has been related to the movement of large lithospheric plates.",

Ecological preferences of species, changes in their composition and frequency together with shell dimensions are used as indicators of palaeoenvironment and palaeoclimate.

Pending international agreement on the definition of -the limits of the Frasnian, it is recommended that the base should continue to be defined as the base of the Assise de Fromelennes. This level agrees with the :boundary currently accepted by the Conseil geologique de Belgique; and seems close to the concept accepted by Gosselet when he proposed the Frasnian in 1879. This horizon appears, on present evidence, to fall within the varcus Zone of the conodont chronology: it may not be far from the base of the goniatite Lunulicosta Zone and Manticoceras Stufe. The serious repercussions of current proposals to change the definition to the base of the Assise de Frasnes are, outlined. The upper limit of the Frasnian is now defined as the base of the Assise de Senzeille and it is recommended that it should remain so until international agreement recommends a change. A case is argued for considering a slightly higher horizon within the conodont triangularis Zone and at the base of the Cheiloceras Stufe, since it is ,this boundary, in practice, which has widest international acceptance at present. The need for international discussion of correlations and definitions of these boundaries is emphasized. Selected aspects of these problems are considered in detail.",

Two stratigraphically short sediment intervals near Sawai Bay have been examined. Qualitative and quantitative microfossil analyses show the Sawai Bay ‘A’ Section to be devoid of siliceous microfossils, while 24 well-preserved calcareous nannofossil taxa are identified. The Sawai Bay ‘B’ Section yields 18 calcareous nannofossil, 33 radiolarian and 25 diatom taxa. The calcareous nannofossil index taxa ( Ceratolithus armatus Müller, 1974a and C. cristatus Kamptner, 1950) indicate both sections to be from zones NN12 (CN10b) and NN13 (CN10c) of early Pliocene (Zanclean) age. The radiolarian taxa, i.e., Didymocyrtis avita Riedel, 1953, Euchitonia spp., Siphocampe lineata (Ehrenberg) Nigrini, 1977, Stichocorys peregrina Riedel, 1953, Semantis spp. and Stylochlamydium sp. are common in the Sawai Bay ‘B’ Section, which is assigned to Zone RN9. Most of the diatom taxa are represented by representatives of the genera Actinocyclus Ehrenberg, 1837, Azpeitia Peragallo in Tèmpere and Peragallo, 1912, Coscinodiscus Ehrenberg, 1839a, Grammatophora Ehrenberg, 1841 and Triceratium Ehrenberg, 1839b, with the benthic diatom species Triceratium favus Ehrenberg, 1839b being predominant (~35% of the total diatom count). Siliceous microfossils are also represented by silicoflagellates dominated by Dictyocha spp. and sponge spicules dominated by astrophorids.",

Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (3), 351-366. Warszawa. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the variability of echinoderm assemblages from Bathonian ore-bearing clays from Gnaszyn. Remains of Crinoidea, Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea, and Holothuroidea have been studied from 38 rock samples. The most common echinoderms represented are the crinoids Balanocrinus berchteni and Chariocrinus andreae and a few species of the holothurian genera Priscopedatus , Calclamna , Staurocaudina , Eocaudina , Achistrum , Theelia and Hemisphaeranthos . The echinoderms from Gnaszyn show various life strategies: benthic or epibenthic forms, sessile sestonophages (Crinoidea), motile macrophages (Asteroidea) and detritivores (Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea), infaunal and epifaunal detritus feeders, sediment feeders or rake-feeders (Holothuroidea). Their presence suggests well oxygenated and presumably relatively cold bottom marine waters. The parts of the Gnaszyn section around concretion horizons and characterized by the ubiquitous occurrence of the holothurian Theelia and echinoids were deposited during phases of optimal living conditions with sufficient influx of plant detritus and good oxygenation of the sea bottom. These parts commonly host echinoderm associations dominated by crinoid remains, which occasionally are still articulated (or disarticulated but remaining intact) - this points to a quiet environment with normal oxygenation of the bottom waters but anaerobic/dysaerobic conditions in the sediment.",

Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (3), 421-437. Warszawa. Qualitative and quantitative studies on calcareous nannofossils have been carried out on the Middle-Upper Bathonian succession of Gnaszyn (Kraków-Silesia Homocline, Częstochowa region). The nannofossil assemblages are moderately or well-preserved and are dominated by Watznaueria britannica ; also common are Staurolithites lumina and Zeugrhabdotus erectus . The presence of delicate nannofossil forms together with dissolution- resistant taxa shows that the changes in composition of some of the nannoplankton assemblages reflect original variations. The frequency and diversity changes of the calcareous nannofossil assemblages have been interpreted in relation to fluctuations of sedimentation rate versus changes in trophic conditions within the photic zone. The highest diversity assemblages contain a high percentage of palaeofertility indicators, and are impoverished in the genus Watznaueria . This is interpreted as a reflection of a lower sedimentation rate and more stable, possibly mesotrophic conditions within the photic zone. On the other hand, W. britannica -dominated assemblages with low species diversity may represent more unstable environments with a high influx of terrestrial material related to a high sedimentation rate and a high nutrient influx, i.e. eutrophic conditions in the photic zone.",

The formation is divided into three members, in ascending order the Foxmould, Whitecliff Chert and Bindon Sandstone, each of which is bounded by a prominent erosion surface that can be recognised throughout the western part of the Wessex Basin. The full thickness of the formation, up to 60 m, was formerly well exposed in cliffs in the Isle of Purbeck in the steeply dipping limb of the Purbeck Monocline. The upper part of the succession is highly condensed in comparison with the Devon succession and exhibits lateral variations over distances of hundreds of metres that are probably related to penecontemporaneous fault movements. Much of the fauna is not age-diagnostic with the result that the ages of parts of the succession are still poorly known. However, the Isle of Purbeck sections contain diverse ammonite faunas at a few stratigraphically well-defined levels that enable the succession to be correlated with that of east Devon and west Dorset.",

The δ 18 O composition of their shells demonstrated the average growth-season water temperatures during the mesocratic stage of the interglacial (Ortel Królewski Lake), during its climatic optimum – the Carpinus – Abies Zone (Ossówka-Hrud, Roskosz and Szymanowo Lakes), and in the post-optimum (Szymanowo Lake). The calculation was based on δ 18 O Shell values and the δ 18 O Water assumed for the Holsteinian from the modern oxygen isotope composition of precipitation and the expected amount of evaporative enrichment. The mean oxygen isotope palaeotemperatures of Ortel Królewski lake waters were in the range of 18.1–21.9°C and were uniform for the Taxus and Pinus – Larix zones. Ossówka-Hrud and Roskosz Lakes had mean temperatures of 17.4–21.0°C during the climatic optimum, whereas the temperature of Szymanowo lake waters was estimated at 20.6–21.7°C at that time. These values are concordant with the pollen-inferred July air temperatures noted during the Holsteinian in eastern Poland. Relatively high values of ~25°C in the post-optimum noted at Szymanowo were connected with the presence of a shallow and warm isolated bay indicated by pollen and mollusc records.",

In the analysis presented here, a fossil record of a re-flooding window has been recognized. Nine Late Silurian carbonate sections exposed on the banks of the Dnister River in Podolia (Ukraine) have been correlated base on bed-by-bed microfacies analysis and spectral gamma ray (SGR) measurements. Correlated were sections representing settings ranging from the inner part of a shallow-water carbonate platform to its slope, through an organic buildup. The reconstructed depositional scenario has been divided into six development stages, with the first three representing a regressive interval and the latter three a transgressive interval of the basin’s history. The re-flooding window has been identified at the beginning of a transgressive part of the succession. Surprisingly, it is characterized by an extremely fast growth of a shallow, tide-dominated platform and by deposition of calciturbiditic layers in a more basinal area. The interpreted succession is a small-scale model illustrating the reaction of carbonate depositional sub-environments to sea level changes and determining the facies position of the stromatoporoid buildups within the facies pattern on a Silurian shelf. The use of SGR analyses in shallow water, partly high-energy, carbonate facies, both for correlation purposes and for identifying depositional systems, is a relatively new method, and thus can serve as a reference for other studies of similar facies assortment.",

    "abstract": "We document an upper upper Albian ( Mortoniceras rostratum Zone) cephalopod assemblage from Clansayes (Drôme, south-eastern France). Although fossils are rare in local exposures and in the single sampled level, a decade of intensive fossil collecting yielded 290 ammonite and 5 nautilid specimens. In total, we describe 1 species of nautilid and 24 species (within 17 genera) of ammonites, including 13 heteromorphs. Only two of these ammonite taxa were previously recorded from the upper upper Albian at Clansayes, which demonstrates the value of this fauna with regard to taxonomy, palaeobiology and palaeobiogeography. Based on morphological and biometric analyses performed on an extensive material (104 specimens), we discriminate two species for the heteromorphic ammonite genus Mariella Nowak, 1916 within the Mortoniceras rostratum Zone. In addition, we investigate shell chirality patterns in Mariella from the late Albian of southern France. Upon comparison of the Clansayes material with older material from the immediately underlying upper Albian Mortoniceras fallax Zone at the neighbouring Salazac locality, we identify an increase in the proportion of sinistral specimens. This observed increase in the frequency of sinistral Mariella specimens may hypothetically be part of a global evolutionary pattern, considering that nearly all documented younger Cenomanian Mariella (and more generally Cenomanian turrilitids) are sinistral.",

    "abstract": "The Northern Copper Belt is located in south-western Poland, a region well known for its copper and silver occurrences of varying significance. This area also includes the abandoned mines of the North-Sudetic Trough (Old Copper District), as well as the currently active New Copper District in the southern part of the Fore- Sudetic Monocline. The vast exploration programme of Miedzi Copper Corp. initiated in 2011 in the northern, deeper part of the Fore Sudetic Monocline provided new data about the deeper parts of this geological unit, located north of the known deposits. A number of prospective areas with Cu-Ag mineralization were investigated, which ultimately resulted in the discovery of three new Cu-Ag deposits. Both the prospective areas and the documented deposits form the so-called Northern Copper Belt, which as a whole has high potential for the identification of new ore deposits and an increase in resources. A description of these three new deposits is provided along with characteristics of the areas of their possible extension, and the additional prospective areas with hypothetical and speculative resources. The new deposits are compared to other Polish Cu-Ag ore deposits, with an emphasis on differences in their geological structure and mineralogy. The paper also presents a brief summary of the applied new exploration tools which have led to this discovery.",

The sediments represent a shallow peritidal zone of the shelf. A new genus and species, Voronocladus dryganti, belonging to the Dasycladales Pascher, 1931, is established. Most of the specimens representing the algal thallus are overgrown by problematical epibiotic graptolites, described as Podoliagraptus algaeoides gen. et sp. nov. This phenomenon is explained as an epiphytic mode of life of the putative graptolite on algae, and is herein compared to recently known coexistences of algae with other organisms. The excellent state of preservation, and the abundance of studied Dasycladales algae and epibiotic problematics indicate that the investigated mudstone layer can be treated as a ‘Konservat Lagerstätte’ sensu Seilacher (1970).",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an interpretation of sedimentologic, paleomagnetic, and geochemical data collected in the Upper Kimmeridgian–Valanginian carbonates of the Giewont series (Giewont and Mały Giewont sections, High-Tatric succession, Western Tatra Mountains, Poland). The studied succession provides insight into the sedimentary conditions prevailing in the South Tatric Ridge (Tatricum), a submarine elevation located between the Zliechov Basin (Fatricum) and the Vahic (=South Penninic) Ocean. The sedimentary sequence includes micrites, pseudonodular limestones, cyanoid packstones, lithoclastic packstone, and encrinites. The results are discussed with regards to their significance for detrital input, paleoclimate, and paleoproductivity, which in turn are considered in the context of both local and regional paleoenvironmental trends and events. The greatest depositional depths during the latest Kimmeridgian–earliest Tithonian are documented by the occurrence of pseudonodular limestones. A Tithonian shallowing trend is demonstrated via the increasing size and roundness of cyanoids, while the final (?)emergence and erosion in the South Tatric Ridge is documented by earliest Cretaceous disconformities. This process might have been related to both falling sea-level during the major eustatic regressive cycle and tectonic uplift caused by the mutually related (re)activation in the Neotethyan Collision Belt and rifting in the Ligurian-Penninic-Vahic Oceans. The highest lithogenic influx (although still low; max 0.5% of Al content) during the Late Kimmeridgian is considered as associated with relatively humid climate conditions, whereas a subsequent decreasing trend is thought to result from aridification during the latest Kimmeridgian–earliest Tithonian. Ultimately, deposition in the High-Tatric zone was affected by both large-scale environmental perturbations characteristic of the latest Jurassic (climate changes, variations in seawater pH, monsoonal upwelling, lithogenic input, etc.), as well as local sedimentary controls, predominantly the oxygenation state of bottom waters and tectonic movements.

    "abstract": "A carbon and oxygen isotope stratigraphic profile has been made, for the first time, through the Late Turonian-Coniacian sedimentary sections containing regionally widespread firm- and hardgrounds of Mangyshlak Mountains, western Kazakhstan. Generally, Turonian and Coniacian time has been considered as a transitional stage between two Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAE), because of the peculiar pattern of variation of the δ13C and δ18O values. Unfortunately, there is no such record in the sections we examined, thus the Mangyshlak Sea behaved uniquely compared to the majority of seas and oceans at that time. The process of hardground formation is polygenetic but involved stopping deposition of calcium carbonate and initiation of the hardground over the large area of the sea floor. Normal causes of cessation of calcium carbonate seem unlikely and the expected drastic changes of hydrochemistry of the bottom waters cannot be detected in any of the minerals within the hardground sediments. Also, changes in climate, if there were any, are very difficult to estimate. Moreover, winnowing of the carbonate sediment is also not detectable from the characteristics of the hardground surface. Because the sedimentary sequence containing that regional hardground formation is transgressive, the most plausible reason for cessation and deposition of calcium carbonate is acceleration of the transgression. This might release sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate to slow precipitation and deposition of calcium carbonate. Also, the greater distance from the shore might have reduced the supply of nutrients which decelerated photosynthetic activity, which in turn decreased consumption of carbon dioxide, thus enhancing precipitation of calcium carbonate. Some additional winnowing of calcium carbonate sediments would have helped in subsequent development of the hardground. Finally, deceleration of the transgression renewed precipitation and deposition of calcium carbonate.",

The Lower Santonian corresponds to the Cladoceramus undulatoplicatus Zone, the lower Middle Santonian to the  Cordiceramus cordiformis Zone. The Sphenoceramus pinniformis Zone spans the upper Middle Santonian to the lower Upper Santonian. The succeeding Sphenoceramus patootensiformis Zone corresponds approximately to the  Marsupites testudinarius crinoid zone of the upper Upper Santonian. Occurrences of the belemnite Gonioteuthis  are discussed. The ammonite occurrences are documented in the context of inoceramid and, where possible, belemnite and crinoid stratigraphy. A Texanites ( Texanites ) pseudotexanus Zone extends from the uppermost M. subquadratus  Zone to the Upper Coniacian/Lower Santonian boundary. The Kitchinites emscheris Zone comprises the Lower and Middle Santonian. The Upper Santonian corresponds to the Boehmoceras arculus Zone. The ammonite faunas are predominately endemic from the Upper Coniacian to the Middle Santonian. Only the Upper Santonian yields supraregional and even global ammonite taxa such as Boehmoceras arculus and B. krekeleri , which co-occur with the widespread crinoids Uintacrinus socialis and Marsupites testudinarius . Sequence boundaries, followed by transgressive pulses, are identified in the uppermost Coniacian, with a subordinate event in the Middle Santonian, the most significant event in the basal Upper Santonian and the last in the Lower Campanian. Ammonite occurrences are clearly related to the sequences recognized.",

A survey of all the phenomena noted on the Devonian/Carboniferous passage beds, also the exceptionally great depth of the sediments – the age equivalents in the Chojnice area of the Etroeungt beds (Tn1a) – reasonably suggest that this area is of essential all-European importance for the clearing up of the problems of the Dewonian/Carboniferous passage beds and the boundary between these two systems.",

    "abstract": "In the Tatra Mts., the variability of structures within the granitoid rocks and their sedimentary complexes depends on the physical properties of the rocks, particularly on their porosity and sensibility to dissolution. In the relatively homogeneous and low porosity granitoid rocks, the shear surfaces are planar and smooth without damage zones around the shear planes. They did not develop open spaces during shearing, which prevented fluid migration and hydrotectonic phenomena. In the sedimentary rocks, mechanical, mostly bedding anisotropy controlled the geometry and morphology of the shear zones. High porosity and recurring changing in pore fluid pressure determined the cyclic character of the thrustrelated shearing processes. Fluids appearing within the thrust-fault fissure played the key role in tectonic transport and selective mass-loss processes (hydrotectonic phenomena). The mass-loss process was an effect of mechanical disintegration, pressure solution and cavitation erosion. The multistage character of the thrusting processes resulted in a gradual increase in mass loss value and in geometrical complication of the shear zones. Within the Czerwone Wierchy Nappe, the minimum value of the mass-loss estimated from a restored cross-section is in the range of 15-50%.",

    "abstract": "In the Tatra Mts., thrust-napping and shearing were multi-stage re-activated processes. Their cyclic character was determined by increases and decreases in pore fluid pressure. During each cycle, new parts of the rheologically heterogeneous wall-rock were selectively destroyed due to hydraulic fracturing, brecciation and mylonitization, and moved out as a solution and/or suspension. As a result of these processes, including pressure solution, considerable mass loss could have taken place. All these processes took place under the considerable influence of fluids. In this paper we consider the possible contribution of cavitation erosion to mass loss processes. Displacement along an uneven thrust surface could create chambers filled with fluid and sudden falls in local pressure promoting the inception of cavitation. Cavitation damage, mainly mechanical in nature, could act synergistically with slurry abrasion and pressure solution processes. Our work is of a hypothetical character. To prove the possibility of cavitation erosion within shear zones in the Tatra Mts. we conducted an experiment to show the low resistance of rock samples to cavitation erosion. We also discuss and characterize the conditions essential to induce cavitation within thrust zones at the base of nappes.",

Mean accumulation rate of the entire succession was moderate: from 8 to 11 cm/ky. The source rocks were Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary rocks. Geochemical data (La, Th and Sc contents) point to a continental island arc as the original source of the detrital material. Soft-sediment deformations and methane-related authigenic carbonates that are also present in this succession evidence the migration of methane-charged fluids through the sediment column.

Due to complicated nomenclatural histories, however, they are often confused. A morphometric analysis performed herein indicates that T. brachiatum is conspecific with T. inconspicuum, and that both were previously often misidentified as T. barbadense. Triceratium barbadense sensu stricto is a distinct species similar to Triceratium castellatum West, 1860. Triceratium brachiatum and T. kanayae are transferred herein to a new genus, Fenneria, for which a close phylogenetic relationship with Medlinia Sims, 1998 is proposed. A review of the geographic and stratigraphic distribution of Fenneria shows that the best constrained records of its occurrences are found at DSDP Site 338, and ODP Sites 1051 and 1260. The ages of the base (B) and top (T) of each species’ stratigraphic range are calibrated here to the Geomagnetic Polarity timescale either directly or inferred via correlation with dinocyst biostratigraphy. Latitudinal diachroneity of ~7 million years is documented  for F. brachiata, which disappears earlier in tropical and mid-latitude sites than in the northern high latitudes. These observations, coupled with a preliminary compilation of the Chron C20n taxonomic composition of pelagic diatom assemblages for Sites 338, 1051 and 1260, indicate that diatoms diversified palaeobiogeographically considerably earlier than the Eocene−Oligocene Transition, as commonly believed. This study also emphasizes the importance of the detailed examination of specimens from both museum collections and deep-sea cores as a step toward enhancing the utility of Palaeogene diatoms in palaeoceanographic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.",

The age assessment of the studied sequence is based on the diagnostic Normapolles species, such as Oculopollis orbicularis Góczán, 1964, Oculopollis zaklinskaiae Góczán, 1964, Krutzschipollis spatiosus Góczán in Góczán et al., 1967 and Krutzschipollis crassus (Góczán, 1964) Góczán in Góczán et al., 1967. The concurrent presence of these pollen species suggests a late Santonian–early Campanian age for the succession. The sporomorph association is encountered in a palynofacies dominated by continental elements, including translucent phytoclasts (tissues, wood remains and plant cuticles). The sedimentary succession shows no evidence of marine elements and a very low proportion of AOM that attests to deposition within a lagoonal to foreshore marine environment, with high continental input and short transportation. The vegetation in the studied area was primarily composed of a range of Normapolles-producing angiosperms and secondarily of pteridophyte spore-producing plants. Gymnosperms were rare. Such a vegetation pattern reflects a warm, seasonally dry climate during the late Santonian–earliest Campanian in the studied area. The dinosaurs inhabited a wet lowland area, probably rich in herbaceous plants.",

    "abstract": "The nature of the Cenomanian–Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event (CTOAE) and its δ13 C Excursion is considered in the light of (1) the stratigraphical framework in which the CTOAE developed in the European shelf seas, (2) conclusions that can be drawn from new detailed investigations of the Chalk succession at three locations in England, at Melton Ross and Flixton in the Northern Province where organic-rich ‘black bands’ are present, and at Dover in the Southern Province (part of the Anglo-Paris Basin) where they are absent, and (3) how these conclusion fit in with the present understanding of the CTOAE. The application of the cerium anomaly method (German and Elderfield 1990) at Dover, Melton Ross and Flixton has allowed the varying palaeoredox conditions in the Chalk Sea and its sediments to be related to the acid insoluble residues, organic carbon, δ18O (calcite), δ13C (calcite), δ13C (organic matter), Fe 2+ and Mn2+ (calcite), and P/TiO2 (acid insoluble residue). This has provided evidence that the initial stages of the δ13C Excursion in England were related to (1) a drop of sea level estimated at between 45 and 85 metres, (2) influxes of terrestrial silicate and organic detritus from adjacent continental sources and the reworking of exposed marine sediments, and (3) the presence of three cold water phases (named the Wood, Jefferies and Black) associated with the appearance of the cold-water pulse fauna during the Plenus Cold Event. Conditions in the water column and in the chalk sediment were different in the two areas. In the Northern Province, cerium-enriched waters and anoxic conditions were widespread; the δ13C pattern reflects the interplay between the development of anoxia in the water column and the preservation of terrestrial and marine organic matter in the black bands; here the CTOAE was short-lived (~0.25 Ma) lasting only the length of the Upper Cenomanian Metoicoceras geslinianum Zone. In the Southern Province, water conditions were oxic and the δ13C Excursion lasted to the top of the Lower Turonian Watinoceras devonense Zone, much longer (~1.05 Ma) than in the Northern Province. These differences are discussed with respect to (1) the Cenomanian–Turonian Anoxic Event (CTAE) hypothesis when the ocean-continent-atmosphere systems were linked, (2) limitations of chemostratigraphic global correlation, and (3) the Cenomanian–Turonian Anoxic Event Recovery (CTOAER), a new term to define the varying lengths of time it took different oceans and seas to recover once the linked ocean-continent-atmosphere system was over. The possibility is considered that glacio- eustasy (the glacial control hypothesis of Jeans et al. 1991) with the waxing and waning of polar ice sheets, in association with the degassing of large igneous provinces, may have set the scene for the development of the Cenomanian–Turonian Anoxic Event (CTAE).",

The investigation included aqueous chemical and isotopic composition, chemistry of mineral phases, geochemical modelling, and tritium and radiocarbon groundwater dating. Chemical diversity in the groundwater system is created by the mixing of modern fresh water and older sulphate water with higher dissolved solids. The system is treated as a system of flows of two end-member water types. Geochemical modelling is used for: (1) explaining the origin of the chemistry of both water components, (2) quantifying the groundwater mixing, (3) correcting the radiocarbon age of the groundwater for the effects of chemical water-rock interactions, and (4) calculating reaction rates. Study of stable (C, S, O, H) and unstable ( 3 H, 14 C) isotopes allowed the inverse mass balance geochemical models to be verified and specified, and the groundwater to be dated. The chemistry of the modern, tritium-bearing, fresh water is a result of dissolution of limestones, dolomites and gypsum. The mean tritium-age of this water, based on the lumped-parameter approach, varies between 10 and 200 years. The sulphate mineral water owes its chemistry to the process of dedolomitization driven by gypsum dissolution. Its radiocarbon age is about 5.9 ka BP, i.e., during the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum. Rates of chemical reactions responsible for the formation of sulphate type water are estimated to be: dissolution of gypsum (2.85 μmol/L/year) and dolomite (0.21 μmol/L/year), calcite precipitation (0.20 μmol/L/year), organic matter decomposition (0.08 μmol/L/year).",

The δ 13 C and δ 18 O values were measured in individual opercula of Bithynia tentaculata and in shells of Bithynia tentaculata, Gyraulus albus, Gyraulus crista, Lymnaea sp., Physa fontinalis, Radix auricularia, Theodoxus fluviatilis and Valvata cristata. The gastropods selected for the study are among the species most commonly found in European Quaternary lacustrine sediments. The carbon isotope composition of the gastropod shells was species-specific and the same order of species from the most to the least 13 C-depleted was observed at all sites sampled. Differences in shell δ 13 C values between species were similar at all sampling sites, thus the factors influencing shell isotopic composition were interpreted as species-specific. The δ 18 O values of shells were similar in all the species investigated. Significant intra-specific variability in shell δ 13 C and δ 18 O values was observed not only within the populations of Lake Lednica, which can be explained by heterogeneity of δ 13 C DIC, δ 18 O water and water temperature between the sites where macrophytes with snails attached were sampled, but also between individuals sampled from restricted areas of the lake’s bottom. The latter points to the importance of factors related to the ontogeny of individual gastropods.",

The borehole commenced at an unknown depth below the Early Cenomanian marls of the Bemerode Member, but higher beds of the Kirchrode Marls and the basal beds of the Bemerode Member were exposed in the Mittellandkanal and its Stichkanal extension at Misburg. The borehole and surface exposures permit a virtually complete Late Albian succession of Aucellina species to be observed. Published Aucellina range data from the borehole are reassessed and it is suggested that the lower part of the recorded range is based partly on misidentifications of fragments of thin-shelled bivalves such as Syncyclonema and Amussium . Aucellina appears in the borehole succession within the upper part of the Callihoplites auritus ammonite Subzone ( Mortoniceras inflatum Zone) and continues to the top of the borehole succession within the Preaeschloenbachia briacensis ammonite Subzone ( Stoliczkaia spp. Zone). Aucellina from higher in the briacensis Subzone collected from the Misburg Mittellandkanal section are also discussed and illustrated. There is some evidence that Aucellina occurs typically at levels in the borehole containing predominantly Boreal European Province ammonites, supporting the general inference that Aucellina lived in cooler northern waters. In contrast, Aucellina is poorly represented in intervals with Tethyan ammonites and thin-shelled inoceramids (e.g. the Mortoniceras ( Durnovarites ) perinflatum Subzone, Stoliczkaia spp. Zone). The briacensis Subzone, with an admixture of Tethyan ( Stoliczkaia ) and Boreal ammonites contains a distinctive, taxonomically highly diverse Aucellina assemblage. Relevant taxonomic research on European Late Albian and Early Cenomanian Aucellina faunas is reviewed. The Late Albian Aucellina succession in the borehole differs from that established from partially correlative successions in England.",

The new species is recognized as an obligate commensal to the hermit crabs which inhabited some of the selected (thick-walled, high-spired, and/or spacious) gastropod shells. The morphology ofborings is comparable to that of the present-day species, especially of the pan-Atlantic species Trypetesa lampas (HANCOCK, 1849) and the Californian species Trypetesa lateralis TOMLINSON,.1953, to the latter of which the new species was . supposedly an ancestor. A peculiar feature of borings in some species of the genus Trypetesa, the newly established T. polonica sp. n. including, namely the presence of the accessory exit produced by the external mantle flap is interpreted as having been constructed to involve a passive flow of water (the so-called prairie-dog's effect). This was required by the Trypetesa specimens to ensure further food supplies and thus to survive in the case when the gastropod shell had been discarded by the hermit crab. The Trypetesa to hermit crabs relationship, recognized for the Miocene representatives, is postulated to have resulted from a refuge of one stock of acrothoracican cirripedes from their former endolithic mode of life. The behavior of the modem Trypetesa species, heritaged from their Miocene forerunners, is consequently dated back some over 15 m. y. ago (Langhian to Serravalian stage interval).",

Trace element contents (Sr, Mn, Na, Fe) and shell microstructures of nonluminescent (NL) brachiopods compare well with those of modern brachiopods. Isotopic data derived from Upper Silurian NL brachiopod samples show a significant negative delta 13 C excursion during the Early Ludfordian (Didymothyris didyma Zone). Above this horizon, increasing delta 13 C values can be observed both for brachiopods from the northeastern edge of the East European Platform (samples from the Baltic area) and carbonate whole rock samples from Austria and Australia. The Middle Ludfordian isotope variations is probably a worldwide chemostratigraphical marker level, although the magnitudes of positive isotope excursions show large interregional differences, which may be related to regional oceanographical differences.",

Field samples were collected from rain water, ceramic-cup lysimeters located at depths 0.6 m, 0.9 m, and 1.2 m and in a piezometer in the phreatic zone at a depth of 1.5 m. Analysis of chemical constituents in the water and mineral constituents in the sediments allowed saturation indices to be estimated for dominant minerals. Laboratory evaporation experiments showed significant affects of this physical processes on water chemistry in the vadose zone. Detailed mineralogic analysis allowed the cation exchange capacity of sediments to be estimated. More detailed study on Cu and Zn transport in the vadose zone indicates increasing diversification of Cu and Zn species with depth, and a degree of sorption saturation ranging from 9% to 90%. A relatively dramatic change in the average TDS from 30.2 mg/L in rain water to 318 mg/L in the phreatic zone, and in the hydrochemical type from SO 4 -Cl-Ca-NH 4 in rain water to HCO 3 -SO 4 -Ca-Mg confirms a hypothesis that in relatively uniform unconsolidated sediments, subsurface water chemistry is determined more by processes and reactions occurring in the vadose zone than in the phreatic zone. Significant complexity of these processes and reactions limit the applicability of available hydrochemical models based on chemical equilibrium at the present time, and emphasize the importance of new experimental techniques which would allow the in-situ interaction along water/mineral surfaces to be observed at preferably molecular level. Results of this research characterize processes in the vadose zone in north-eastern Poland and can be compared to similar studies known from other regions and climatic zones.",

Mylonitic foliation of the resultant granitegneisses was due to contrasting ductility of quartz, K-feldspar, and plagioclase during the deformation. The deformation was overlapped and severe recrystallization of the minerals once ground down, in particular K-feldspar, which obliterated partly the earlier farbic, and to local increase in grainsize. Blastomylonitization of the primary granitic masses, emplaced into metasedimentary schistose rocks, was related to pervasive shearing and an easterly directed Variscan thrusting as well as napping that all took place toward the end of the main N-S oriented folding in the region. The direction of stretching ubiquitously conforms with that of the main folds and the mineral lineation in the schistose Stronie formation, hence it likely represents the Y axis of strain ellipsoid.",

    "abstract": "The new dataset of the carbon and oxygen stable isotope values across the sedimentary sequence of the Changhsingian Stage at Meishan, south China documents the carbon biogeochemical cycle in detail. The cycle began with storage of organic carbon (C org ), mainly as biogenic carbon dioxide in clathrates, and carbon dioxide from anaeorobic methane oxidation (AMO) in the stratified sea water masses, which is reflected by a rapid increase in the δ 13 C values. Storage of Corg demanded a large biomass productivity, and thus consumption of a vast amount of carbon dioxide, which would have been associated with climatic oceanic water cooling. Oceanic water cooling and enhanced volcanism is actually reflected by a gradual increase in the δ 18 O values. The longterm stasis between C org burial and reburial was then achieved, as reflected by the stable course of the δ 13 C curve. At the same time, cool water circulation caused a continuous increase in the δ 18 O values. At the end of the cycle, several factors including earthquakes and other tectonic movements marking the onset of major Siberian volcanism, together with a local temperature increase resulted in a change of ocean circulation, caused mixing of stratified sea water masses. This was followed by destruction of the existing clathrates, degassing of carbon dioxide, oxidation of organic matter, and a rapid decrease in the oceanic δ 13 C values. Apart from the carbon dioxide that was released to the atmosphere, part of the methane must have been oxidised, creating additional carbon dioxide as well as water vapour. The carbon dioxide and water vapour must have initiated a greenhouse effect and caused thermal stratification of seawater which, in turn, initiated reconstruction of the redox in the Early Triassic.  The end of the cycle was associated with the end-Permian mass extinction. The global warming associated with methane release from clathrates led to collapse of terrestrial plants. At the same time, the mixing event brought methane and organic matter for oxidation, which caused massive consumption of oxygen and extinction of the terrestrial fauna. In the marine environment, the mixing event brought water masses rich in carbon dioxide, as well as excess hydrogen ions from anoxic zones, onto shelf areas, causing a collapse of marine biota.  The carbon biogeochemical cycle of the Changhsingian indicated by the initial rapid rise, long-term stasis, and final rapid drop in δ 13 C values, seems to be a rule for a pattern of Phanerozoic δ 13 C values in sedimentary carbonates. This suggests that a process of methane storage and release may have had a bearing on major geochemical perturbations throughout Earth history. However, methane storage, with or without the association of carbon dioxide and other forms of C org , and its subsequent release, could have occurred in many different scenarios throughout the Phanerozoic. Therefore, the end of the carbon cycles may be associated with mass extinction only when release of methane is coupled with other phenomena, which is the case with the end-Permian event.",

The unique lithologlical and paleontological characteristics of these deposits permit recognition of a new lithostratigraphicaI unit, the Norovica Formation, in the Triassic of the West Carpathians. The formation includes light-grey compact limestones overlying the Hauptdolomit and underlying the Lower Liassic crinoidal limestones. Three members are distinguished within the Norovica Formation, viz . Lower Limestone Member, Siwa Woda Limestone Member, and Mojtin Limestone Member. The Norovica Formation contains the conodonts Misikella posthernsteini Kozur & Mock and the foraminifers Triasina hantkeni Mojzon indicative of the Rhaetian. Only the lowermost part of the formation may represent the Upper Norian (Sevatian).",

They vary in structure and composition among the Kaczawa Mts, Świebodzice, Klodzklo, and Bardo structures as well as the Intra-Sudetic synclinorium and the Lower Carboniferous of the Owl Mts block. The Klodzko is the only one folded during the Caledonian orogeny. The Świebodzice structure and the lower structural stage of the Bardo structure were folded during the Nassau phase. The Klodzko structure was uplifted at that time. The Kaczawa nappes developed during the Sudetic phase. At the same time, the Bardo structure was ultimately formed, with molasse and Lower Carboniferous flysch series overlying the folds of Nassau age. Pebbles of epimetamorphic rocks found in the Devonian to Lower Carboniferous strata south of the Kaczawa Mts derived from the Proterozoic basement of the Kaczawa Mts structure. As shown by the palinspastic reconstroctions, the coefficient of tectonic shortening ranges from 0.36 up to 0.80. Two distinct developmental stages are recognized in the history of the Struga and Domanow dislocations; the tectonic displacements were opposite at the two stages.",

    "abstract": "The latest Albian (Vraconian) brachiopod fauna from Enisala, in North Dobrogea, includes representatives of rhynchonellids and terebratulids. The rhynchonellids are scarce, representing two families, Cyclothyrididae and Tetrarhynchiidae. The Cyclothyrididae with the subfamily Cyclothyridinae, and the Tetrarhynchiidae with the subfamily Cretirhynchiinae, are represented by rare specimens of ? Cyclothyris sp. and Burrirhynchia cf. sigma  SCHWENBACH, 1867), respectively. The terebratulids are very abundant and include representatives of several famili es, as follows: Sellithyrididae, Capillithyrididae, Cancellothyrididae and Terebrataliidae. The Sellithyrididae, which make up the bulk of the assemblage , are represented by two subfamilies: Sellithyridinae with Sellithyris upwarnesis (WALKER, 1870),  Boubeithyris boubei (O'ARCHIAC, 1847) and Ovatathyris cf pottemensis OWEN, 1988, and Nerthebrochinae with  Harmatosia crassa (O'ARCHlAC, 1847). The Capillithyrididaeare represented by the subfamily Capillithyridinae with  Caplllithyris capillata (O'ARCHlAC, 1847). The Cancellothyrididae are represented by the subfamily Cancellothyridinae with numerous specimens of Terebratulinaprotostriatula OWEN, 1988. The Terebrataliidae are represented by the subfamily Gemmarculinae with scarce specimens of Gemmarcula canaliculata (ROEMER, 1840) and Gemmarcula sp.  The abundance and diversity of the terebratulids in the brachiopod assemblage from Enisala was related to favourable environmental conditions connected with the onset of the marine transgression on North Dobrogea during the latest Albian. There is a marked stratigraphic lag with some species which in North Dobrogea occur in the latest Albian appearing in the Early Cenomanian in Central and Western Europe . This suggests that North Dobrogea was located on the main route of the westward migration of the mid-Cretaceous brachiopod faunas.",

The eruption probably started with the opening of relatively short parallel (stopped) fissures, apparently tension gashes, in the NE part of the island, on the slope of the main stratovolcano. The opening of the fissures was probably due to lateral translation of a part of the island along a NNE-SSW directed tectonic Iine, the apparent surface projection of a deep-seated dextral strike-slip fault parallel to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The southern prolongation of this fault seems to have been the site of minor eruptions in 1732 and 1818, and of slight volcanic activity in 1971 subsequent to the major event in 1970. The opening of the gashes preceded the formation of parasitic craters which were active in producing basaltic lava and ash for a couple of weeks in 1970.",

However, L. carlsi and C. maderi also exhibit significant morphological differences, showing Leonodus a typical diplodont tooth morphology with a linguo-labially elongated base, that contrast with Celtiberina’s teeth that show a single conical cusp curved lingually with a week developed flat base mesio-distally extended, perhaps reflecting distant relationship. These data are compatible with a pre-Devonian diversification of the two main tooth types traditionally recognised in Palaeozoic sharks (i.e., “cladodont” vs “diplodont”).

This assemblage presumably is of early Danian age, with Cyclaster danicus  occurring in the lower Danian of Denmark and southern Sweden. The specimens are preserved as internal moulds, composed of phosphatised glauconitic sandstone, occasionally with some test material adhering. The genesis of these moulds involved the following steps: (1) infilling of tests of dead echinoids with glauconitic sand; (2) penetration of the infills by coelobiotic deposit-feeding organisms that produced burrows along the inner test surface; (3) early-diagenetic cementation of infills by calcium phosphate; and (4) exhumation and intraformational reworking of specimens, leading to abrasion,  fragmentation and loss of test material in some individuals. Co-occurring are unphosphatised moulds of Echinocorys ex gr. depressa (von Eichwald, 1866) and Pseudogibbaster cf. depressus (Kongiel in Kongiel and Matwiejewowna, 1937), which may represent a younger (middle to late Danian) assemblage. Additionally, the presence of derived late Maastrichtian echinoids, e.g., Temnocidaris ( Stereocidaris ) ex gr. herthae (Schluter, 1892), Pleurosalenia bonissenti (Cotteau, 1866) and Hemicara pomeranum Schluter, 1902, is confirmed for the Greensand, based on new material and re- examination of previously recorded specimens. In summary, members of three echinoid assemblages of different age and preservation occur together in the Greensand. Our results are compatible with former interpretations of this unit as a condensed, transgressive lag with mixed faunas of different age and provenance. However, they are incompatible with the hypothesis that phosphatised Danian fossils preserved in the Greensand are derived from a facies equivalent, now gone, of the lower Danian Cerithium Limestone in eastern Denmark, because all moulds are composed of phosphatised glauconitic sandstone that is utterly different from the calcareous dinocyst-dominated, fine crystalline matrix of the Cerithium Limestone.",

Subsurficial sediments from the ooze are assigned a Marine Isotope Stage 2 age, approximately at the Last Glacial Maximum. The occurrence of Ethmodiscus ooze suggests massive late Pleistocene blooms in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean and provides a plausible link to paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic changes related to Antarctic Intermediate Water mass, which carried a high dissolved silica content as silicon leakage that reduced dissolution rate of diatom frustules. Northward flow of Antarctic Intermediate Water was probably related to surface current migration and southward shift of the Northwest Pacific Gyre to form oligotrophic conditions that triggered Ethmodiscus rex blooms under unusual nutrient recycling conditions within the ocean system. This bloom hypothesis may help explain differential silica dissolution during the last glacial stage.",

The subsequent development of a structural pattern of microscopic fault-related structures and calcite infillings reflects the activity of strike-slip faults that began in the Late Cretaceous (Late Maastrichtian) and lasted until the early Miocene (Langhian). The fabric of the syntectonic veins provides insights into the evolution of the permeable fault-related structures that were the main pathways for fluid flow during fault activity. Microstructural study of calcite veins coupled with stable isotope and fluid inclusion data indicates that calcite precipitated primarily in a rock-buffered system related to strike-slip fault movement, and secondarily in a partly open system related to the local activity of the releasing Chmielnik stepover or the uplift of the area. The presence of meteoric fluids descending from the surface into damage zones suggest that the strike-slip faulting might have taken place in a nonmarine, continental environment.",

The following new taxa are described: Fenestracrinus gen. nov. with the type species F. oculifer sp. nov., Discocrinus africanus sp. nov., Styracocrinus rimafera sp. nov., Lebenharticrinus quinvigintensis sp. nov., L. zitti sp. nov., Euglyphocrinus cristagalli sp. nov., E. jacobsae sp. nov., E. truncatus sp. nov., E. worthensis sp. nov., Roveacrinus gladius sp. nov., R. solisoccasum sp. nov. and Drepanocrinus wardorum sp. nov. In addition, the new subfamily Plotocrininae is erected. The stratigraphical distribution of the taxa in two important localities, Taghazout in the Agadir Basin (Morocco) and Sif el Tella, Djebel Mhrila (central Tunisia), is provided. The faunas from the uppermost Albian and lowermost Cenomanian of the Agadir Basin are nearly identical to those recorded from central Texas, USA, some 5,300 km away, and permit a detailed correlation (microcrinoid biozones CeR1 and CeR2) to be established across the southern part of the Western Tethys, independently supported by new ammonite records. For the middle and upper Cenomanian, rather few detailed records of microcrinoids are available elsewhere, and the North African record forms the basis for a new zonation (CeR3–CeR6). The distribution of Turonian Roveacrinidae in North Africa is evidently very similar to that described in the Anglo-Paris Basin, and zones TuR1–3, TuR9, 10 and 14 are recognised for the first time in the Tethys.",

    "abstract": "Abstract New velocity models of lithospheric thickness and velocity structure have been developed for the Arabian Shield by three tasks: 1) Computing P-Wave Receiver Functions (PRFs) and S-Wave Receiver Functions (SRFs) for all the broadband stations within the Saudi seismic networks. The number of receiver function waveforms depends on the recording time window and quality of the broadband station. 2) Computing ambient noise correlation Green’s functions for all available station pairs within the Saudi seismic networks to image the shear velocity in the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the Arabian Peninsula. Together they provided hundreds of additional, unique paths exclusively sampling the region of interest. Both phase and group velocities for all the resulting empirical Green’s functions have been measured and to be used in the joint inversion. 3) Jointly inverted the PRFs and SRFs obtained in task 1 with dispersion velocities measured on the Green’s functions obtained in task 2 and with fundamental-mode, Rayleigh-wave, group and phase velocities borrowed from the tomographic studies to precisely determine 1D crustal velocity structure and upper mantle. The analysis of the PRFs revealed values of 25-45 km for crustal thickness, with the thin crust next to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba and the thicker crust under the platform, and Vp/Vs ratios in the 1.70-1.80 range, suggesting a range of compositions (felsic to mafic) for the shield’s crust. The migrated SRFs suggest lithospheric thicknesses in the 80-100 km range for portions of the shield close to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba and near the Arabian Gulf. Generally, the novelty of the velocity models developed under this paper has consisted in the addition of SRF data to extend the velocity models down to lithospheric and sub-lithospheric depths.",

Raster digital models (digital concentration-distribution models - DC-DMs) as interpolations of geochemical data are proposed as a new tool to depict the crystal growth mechanism in a magmatic environment. The Natural Neighbour method is proposed for interpolation of Electron Microprobe Analysis (EMPA) data; the Natural Neighbour method and Kriging method are proposed for interpolating data collected by the LA-ICP-MS method. The crystal growth texture was analysed with the application of DC-DM derivatives: 3D surface models, shaded relief images, aspect and slope maps. The magmatic mass properties were depicted with the application of solid models. Correlation between the distributions of two elements on a single crystal transect was made by operations on the obtained raster DC-DMs. The methodology presented is a universal one but it seems to be significant for the depiction of magma mixing processes and the heterogeneity of the magmatic mass.",

Further comparison with foraminiferal faunas of the Brausnitzbach Marl (Schrammstein Formation) were carried out to clarify its relationship to the marls of the Graupa 60/1 core. Tethyan agglutinated marker species for the late Turonian to early Coniacian confirm the proposed age of the marls of the Graupa 60/1 core and the Brausnitzbach Marl. The palaeoenvironment of the marls reflects middle to outer shelf conditions. The maximum flooding zones of genetic sequences TUR6, TUR7 and CON1 could be linked to acmes of foraminiferal species and foraminiferal morphogroups. In general, a rise of the relative sea-level can be recognised from the base to the top of the marls of the Graupa 60/1 core. While agglutinated foraminiferal assemblages suggest a generally high organic matter influx and variable but high productivity in the Graupa 60/1 core, the Brausnitzbach Marl deposition was characterized by moderate productivity and a generally shallower water depth.",

    "abstract": "Petroleum products influence the engineering behaviour of the soil. Neogene clays and glacial tills from Central Poland were tested under laboratory conditions to evaluate the changes of selected physical and mechanical parameters: particle size distribution, particle density, swelling, shear strength and permeability. Four petroleum products were used in the experiments: diesel fuel, kerosene, jet fuel and mineral engine oil. The study revealed that even for the lowest degree of contamination the values of physical and mechanical properties of the soils changed significantly. Greater variation can be expected in soils contaminated with high-viscosity compounds. Also, higher relative changes were found for glacial tills than for Neogene clays. Consolidation tests revealed changes in soil permeability depending on the soil composition and the physical properties of the contaminant – considerable reduction of permeability was observed for glacial tills contaminated with light Jet fuel, while the reduction was lower for Neogene clays. The obtained results indicate the role of mesopores and the dimensionless pore pressure coefficient in changes of soil permeability. The methodological issues regarding testing and analysing the hydrocarbon-contaminated soils were also presented and discussed, which might be useful for researchers studying contaminated soils.",

They derive from marine limestones and marls cropping out on the northern slope of the Hruby Regiel mountain in the Western Tatra Mountains. Leaves belonging to the families Fagaceae and Lauraceae and fruits of the palm Nypa are recognized. The co-occurrence of the planktonic foraminifer taxa Chiloguembelina cf. gracillima and Globigerinatheca cf. index and fruits of Nypa suggests a latest Eocene age of the fossil flora. The plant assemblage is typical of paratropical or subtropical evergreen forests in a warm and humid subtropical climate, recent counterparts of which occur in southeast Asia. The presence of Nypa is characteristic of mangroves. The good state of preservation of the leaves suggests coastline proximity during sedimentation of the plant-bearing deposits.",

The oldest record from Węże 1, dated to 3.6–3.2 Ma, is also the most abundant and the type locality for this species. Only isolated teeth came from two other Polish sites, Węże 2 and Rębielice Królewskie 1A, dated to 2.5–2.2 Ma. The visceocranium from Varshets (c. 2.5 Ma) shows intermediate features between the type specimen from Węże 1 and the Early Pleistocene M. vetus, its possible descendant. The palaeontological records corroborate well with molecular data. The comparison of marten crania from Węże 1 and Varshets shows decrease in size and massiveness of teeth during the evolution of the species. Martes wenzensis shows an admixture of features inherent to M. vetus, M. martes, and M. foina Erxleben, 1777. The species resembles more M. vetus and M. martes than M. foina. It is described as a large, robust marten, with a flat forehead, short and broad viscerocranium, wide snout, robust canines, elongated and narrow premolars and enlarged carnassials.",

The fossil record of the suborder in the Late Paleogene reveals that clupeoids were abundant in the Western, Central, as well as Eastern Paratethys. Clupeoid descriptions from the Polish Outer Carpathians (SE Poland, Central Paratethys) remain incomplete due to usage of ‘collective species’, taxonomical inaccuracies, and lack of clear links between extinct and extant representatives. In this paper we present a new clupeoid, † Beksinskiella gen. nov., from the Oligocene of the Outer Carpathians, Poland. The new genus encompasses the nominal species † Maicopiella longimana (Heckel, 1850). † Beksinskiella gen. nov. has a unique combination of characters (skull roof with frontoparietal striae; smooth opercle; 6–7 branchiostegal rays; 42–48 vertebrae; dorsal and anal fins with 21–23 rays; the last two rays of the anal fin being elongated, and the presence of a complete series of abdominal scutes with the postpelvic ones poorly developed), supporting recognition of a new genus of the Suborder Clupeoidei.

    "abstract": "The Suborder Clupeoidei Bleeker, 1859 comprises mostly marine fishes, which form large schools feeding on plankton. The fossil record of the suborder in the Late Paleogene reveals that clupeoids were abundant in the Western, Central, as well as Eastern Paratethys. Clupeoid descriptions from the Polish Outer Carpathians (SE Poland, Central Paratethys) remain incomplete due to usage of ‘collective species’, taxonomical inaccuracies, and lack of clear links between extinct and extant representatives. In this paper we present a new clupeoid, † Beksinskiella gen. nov., from the Oligocene of the Outer Carpathians, Poland. The new genus encompasses the nominal species † Maicopiella longimana (Heckel, 1850). † Beksinskiella gen. nov. has a unique combination of characters (skull roof with frontoparietal striae; smooth opercle; 6–7 branchiostegal rays; 42–48 vertebrae; dorsal and anal fins with 21–23 rays; the last two rays of the anal fin being elongated, and the presence of a complete series of abdominal scutes with the postpelvic ones poorly developed), supporting recognition of a new genus of the Suborder Clupeoidei. Similarities and differences between fossil and extant genera of Cluepoidei are discussed to shed light on their relationship.",

    "abstract": "Martes wenzensis Stach, 1959 is the only European Pliocene marten and possible ancestor of an evolutionary lineage leading through Martes vetus Kretzoi, 1942 to Martes martes Linnæus, 1758. Its occurrence ranged between c. 3.6–2.2 Ma and its presence is recorded herein from four sites: three Polish and one Bulgarian (Varshets). The oldest record from Węże 1, dated to 3.6–3.2 Ma, is also the most abundant and the type locality for this species. Only isolated teeth came from two other Polish sites, Węże 2 and Rębielice Królewskie 1A, dated to 2.5–2.2 Ma. The visceocranium from Varshets (c. 2.5 Ma) shows intermediate features between the type specimen from Węże 1 and the Early Pleistocene M. vetus, its possible descendant. The palaeontological records corroborate well with molecular data. The comparison of marten crania from Węże 1 and Varshets shows decrease in size and massiveness of teeth during the evolution of the species. Martes wenzensis shows an admixture of features inherent to M. vetus, M. martes, and M. foina Erxleben, 1777. The species resembles more M. vetus and M. martes than M. foina. It is described as a large, robust marten, with a flat forehead, short and broad viscerocranium, wide snout, robust canines, elongated and narrow premolars and enlarged carnassials.",

    "abstract": "In the region of the Caucasus considered herein two large structural complexes have been identified: an autochthone, including the Gagra-Java zone (GJZ) of the Greater Caucasus fold-and-thrust belt, the Kura foreland basin (KFB), and an allochthone consisting of the Utsera-Pavleuri, Alisisgori-Chinchvelta, Sadzeguri- Shakhvetila, Zhinvali-Pkhoveli nappes and Ksani-Arkala parautochthone. The nappes are established on the basis of paleogeographic reconstructions, structural data, as well as drilling and geophysical data. The leading mechanism for the nappe formation is the advancement to the north and the underthrusting of the autochthone under the Greater Caucasus (A-type subduction). The nappes were formed mainly in the Late Alpine time (Late Eocene–Early Pliocene) and include only the sedimentary cover of the Earth’s crust (thin-skinned nappes). However the basal detachment (décollement) of the nappes, according to seismic data, penetrates deeply and cuts the pre-Jurassic crystalline basement, and even the entire Earth’s crust representing thick-skinned deformation. The total horizontal displacement of the flysch nappes of the southern slope of the Greater Caucasus in their eastern (Kakhetian) part is 90–100 km. While, considering the folding of the entire Greater Caucasus, the total transverse shortening of the Earth‘s crust within its limits is equal to 190–200 km.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of grabens rich in lignite is important in the context of the accumulation of ~40–650 m of peat, as well as the exploitation of later formed lignite seams with a thickness of ~20–250 m. Six such areas were selected for a detailed palaeotectonic analysis: the Gostyń, Szamotuły, Legnica, Zittau, Lubstów, and Kleszczów grabens. During the analysis, borehole data were used, taking into account the compaction of peat at the transition to lignite, in order to reconstruct the magnitude of the total subsidence. This made it possible to distinguish between regional (covering areas also outside the grabens) and local (occurring only in the grabens) tectonic movements, and among the latter, tectonic and compactional subsidence. The hypothetical palaeosurface of the mires was reconstructed based on the lignite decompaction. As a result, it was possible to determine whether the examined peat/lignite seams underwent post-depositional uplift and/or subsidence. Between one (Gostyń Graben) and four (Zittau Basin and Kleszczów Graben) stages of tectonic subsidence were distinguished in the studied lignite-bearing areas. In the case of the Zittau Basin, as well as the Lubstów and Kleszczów grabens, post-depositional stages of tectonic uplift were also indicated. Like the boundaries of lithostratigraphic units, the successive stages of the Cenozoic tectonic development of the examined grabens are diachronic.",

    "abstract": "This paper is a continuation of the previous one (Widera, 2024. Acta Geologica Polonica, 74 (1), e2). A new, alternative interpretation of the tectonic development of two lignite-rich deposits in the Lubstów and Kleszczów grabens in central Poland is presented. The maximum thickness of lignite mined from both deposits is &amp;gt;86 and &amp;gt;250 m, respectively. These grabens were selected for detailed tectonic analysis because syn-depositional or post-depositional tectonic uplift is undeniably evident. The current study focuses on the distinction between tectonic subsidence/uplift and autocompactional subsidence, and on the timing of their occurrence. Such a research approach allows for the presentation of new conceptual models of Cenozoic tectonic evolution during the formation of the third, very thick, Ścinawa lignite seam (ŚLS-3) and the second Lusatian lignite seam (LLS-2). As a result, it is shown here that the magnitude of both the downward and upward tectonic movements are significantly smaller than previously thought. This new interpretation is also confirmed by the low rank of lignite coalification and the net calorific value of the ŚLS-3 and LLS-2.",

The low diversity of dinoflagellate cyst assemblages, along with the dominance of land-derived spores and pollen, suggest restricted (marginal) marine environments, in contrast to their coeval representatives from the Tethyan Realm. Open marine (inner shelf) environments developed at a few horizons in the Dahab and Bahariya formations, partly contemporary with the global Aptian and Cenomanian eustatic cycles. These environments were relatively more offshore than those described in the eastern and southeastern parts of the basin. The study of total palynological organic matter (TPOM) has contributed largely to these established environmental settings. It has also allowed the recognition of redox (suboxic to anoxic) conditions and the impact of a large magnitude of terrigenous influence.",

The basis for this correlation was a litostratigraphic analysis of selected loess sites in the uplands, which are well-documented in the literature, and the occurrences of loess and loess-like deposits under the cover of glacial deposits in the lowland part of the Vistula catchment, characterized by a much sparser documentation. The nomenclature of loess horizons follows Maruszczak (2001) and Kukla (1987), but sometimes is significantly changed, according to modern Quaternary stratigraphical schemes. According to the analysis, accumulation of almost all loess horizons distinguished so far has been documented in the Pleistocene succession of the Vistula catchment: the oldest – lower (LNd), middle (LNs), and upper (LNg); older: lower (LSd), middle (LSs), and upper (LSg); and younger: lowest (LMn), lower (LMd), middle (LMs), and upper (LMg). In most cases loess accumulation took place in steppe-tundra conditions preceding the maximum ice-sheet development during the succeeding Scandinavian glaciations. For selected sites, the loess occurrence is presented in superposition to glacial tills and interglacial deposits. The distinguished loesses and glacial tills are tied to the stratigraphic schemes of the Pleistocene in Poland (Marks et al. 2016, 2019) and correlated with Ukrainian loess horizons (Łanczont et al. 2019).",

    "abstract": "Based on the analysis of the geological context and palynological studies performed on lake and bog sediments in the Southern Podlasie Lowland, a new concept of the maximum extent of the Odranian Glaciation (Saalian, MIS 6) is presented for the study area. It is depicted by the Siedlce−Łosice−Kornica zone of end moraines, which so far was considered as stadial-rank or as the Wartanian ice sheet limit. To the south of this zone, near Biała Podlaska and in the Łuków Plain, there occur numerous sites with fossil deposits of the Mazovian Interglacial (MIS 11c). Sites with new documentation, i.e., Wólka Domaszewska, Kolonia Bystrzycka, Przytulin, Hermanów, and Skrzynka are located about 30 km to the south and 60 km to the west of the Biała Podlaska area. Palynological analysis unequivocally indicates the presence of a vegetation succession characteristic of the Mazovian Interglacial. In all sites, deposits of the Mazovian Interglacial are covered by lacustrine sediments of the Liviecian Glaciation (Fuhne, MIS 11b-MIS 10) or mineral sediments of the Vistulian Glaciation (Weichselian, MIS 2) and the Holocene. The sediments infill paleolakes carved in glacial tills of the Sanian 2 Glaciation (MIS 12). The lake sediments of the Mazovian Interglacial and the overlying biogenic and mineral deposits occur in the analysed sites directly below the surface. They are never covered by glacial deposits, which suggests that the Odranian ice sheet did not cover the study area. The location of the lake and bog sites with their geological analysis allow for the precise depiction of the eastern limit of the Odranian ice sheet lobe, which in the study area correlates with the limit suggested in the late 19th century. The Odranian ice sheet did not cover Southern Podlasie.",

Our data show that craniids significantly preferred the smooth shells of Porambonites sp. over the coarsely ribbed shells of Platystrophia sp. and the moderately ribbed shells of Cyrtonotella sp. and Glossorthis sp.

The ‘rocky’ (coral) Kadzielnia Limestone, corresponding to a stromatoporoid-microbial mud mound, now treated as the Kadzielnia Massive Limestone Member of the Kowala Formation, has been studied for almost 200 years. This large bioherm is famous for its exceptionally diverse fossil inventory. The history of its geological exploration is insufficiently known, as exemplified by the overlooked contribution of Alexei Doronin, a master’s student at the Imperial University of Warsaw (IUW). In 1893, under the guidance of Professor Vladimir Amalitsky, he published a note on the age of the Kadzielnia Limestone. The paleontological basis for this discussion was the IUW student’s fossil collection, in which Doronin identified 28 taxa, mainly brachiopods (19 species). He was the first to recognize the occurrence of gastropods (e.g., Loxonema) and crinoids, and at least four species of brachiopods (e.g., Dielasma sacculus). In a comprehensive brachiopod-based stratigraphic discussion, Doronin emphasized the great similarity of the Kadzielnia assemblage to the Middle Devonian fauna of Western Europe, but also including the typical Upper Devonian species Rhynchonella cuboides. Ultimately, he advocated assigning a terminal Middle Devonian age to the Kadzielnia Limestone. Despite this erroneous dating, Doronin’s noteworthy but unnoticed contribution holds significant implications not only for further study of Kadzielnia but also for understanding the development of geosciences in the late 19th century in the Congress Poland (then part of partitioned Poland within the Russian Empire), including the academic role of the IUW. Unfortunately, for reasons unknown, the scientific career of Amalitsky’s talented pupil never truly began.",

The basement of the region is composed of Mesozoic–Paleogene rocks. In the various Neogene basins, Miocene–Pliocene sedimentary and volcanic rocks overlie the basement rocks and form the secondary rock units. The youngest units are Plio-Quaternary aged terrestrial sediments and volcanics. The main structure of the study area consists of WNW-ESE and NE-SW trending intersecting graben-horst structures and the normal faults forming them. The approximately WNWESE trending basins are filled with Miocene–Pliocene sediments, while the NE-SW trending basins are filled with Pliocene–Quaternary sediments. Kinematic studies show that the faults in the study area are developed in all directions and the distribution of the slicken lines indicates that there is multidirectional crustal extension. The principal stress axes obtained from all the kinematic data show that σ1 is nearly vertical, σ2 and σ3 are horizontal. If all faults are assumed to have been formed due to the same stress system, the study area is predominantly elongated in the NW-SE direction. However, detailed field observations and structural analyses indicate that the NE-SW trending fault systems are younger than the WNW-ESE trending faults. This indicates that firstly NNE-SSW and then NW-SE crustal extension developed in the study area respectively.",

The core from L-1, treated similarly to C-1, was used to control for contamination. Microbial experiments and molecular analyses were performed on both core samples to ensure accurate results unaffected by laboratory processing contamination. Microbial incubation tests were successfully employed to demonstrate microbial hydrocarbon degradation and methane formation from 13C-labelled acetate. A new method for staining microorganisms from rock samples was introduced to estimate biomass. The results indicated that microorganisms from the C-1 well exhibited both hydrocarbon biodegradation and acetoclastic methanogenesis during a 3-month incubation at 100°C. Fluorescence-stained and countable microorganisms were only observed in the C-1 samples, while no biodegradation or methanogenesis occurred in reference samples from L-1 well. The study provides valuable insights into microbial activities in extreme conditions, emphasizing the importance of proper controls and techniques to ensure accurate interpretation of results.",

A correlation scheme is presented for the eastern part of the Iberian Chain (eastern Spain) on the base of representatives of the family Perisphinctidae, which is intended to serve as a basis for the setting of a standard zonal scheme for the Tethyan Oxfordian, one of the main items in the current work of the Oxfordian Working Group . In the Iberian Chain the Middle Oxfordian is widely represented under sponge limestone facies. With few exceptions, carbonate sedimentation in the whole studied area starts, as a rule, at the middle part of the Transversarium Zone (Luciaeformis Subzone). Several new biohorizons, widely recognized at a basin scale, are tentatively proposed, to refine the zonal scheme which is characterized now by: the Iberica horizon at the middle part of the Schilli Subzone, the Jelskii and Wartae horizons within the Rotoides Subzone, and the Grossouvrei, Bifurcatus and Ariniensis horizons within the Grossouvrei Subzone.

The structure of the exoskeleton of non-tremataspid osteostracans was investigated by SEM for the first time. A reconstruction of the structure of the Ungulaspis arctoa exoskeleton is suggested. Because of the poorer preservation of the Ateleaspis sp., only preliminary observations on the thin structure of its exoskeleton could be made. The forms under investigation are characterized by a similar type of sculpture on the surface of the shied (small tubercles) and on the body scales (thin crests). Some similarities in the structure of their shield exoskeleton (the presence of distinctly expressed tesserae, the presence of radiating canals, the probable absence of perforated septa and pore fields) were indicated. Ungulaspis arctoa is remarkable in the possessing macromorphological features typical of both the Ateleaspis - and Scolenaspis -like osteostracans. This similarity in the structure of exoskeleton of the investigated forms provides additional evidence in support of the affinity of these groups of osteostracans and their possible origin from common ancestors.",

Warszawa. 18 archaeogastropod species are described from the Campanian of Torallola in north-eastern Spain, including 13 new species and one new genus. They are assigned to the Liotiinae, Colloniinae, Turbininae, Skeneidae and Cirridae. Our species of the Liotiinae are comparable with Recent as well as Triassic liotiids, the documented colloniids show close relations to modern species. Certain members of the Angaria-Astraea-Turbo-relation are difficult if not impossible to distinguish on shell characters alone, although these shells can be traced back into the Triassic. Three skeneiform species are assigned to Recent Skenea, but neither fossil nor recent Skeneidae are sufficiently well known, so our treatment remains preliminary. The new genus Torallochus is introduced for species having initially planispiral coiling that later changes to turriform coiling, and which are sculptured with strong ribs or spines on the periphery. The systematic position of this genus within the Trochoidea remains uncertain. Among the Cirridae, the genus Shikamacirrus is synonymized with the older name Sensuitrochus, and the youngest member of this genus is described. The new species are Pseudoliotina stinnesbecki, Arene mcleani, Homalopoma schroederi, Astraea iredalei, Astraea batalleria, Astraea hickmanae, Astraea? sohli, Skenea wareni, Skenea suturata, Skenea torallensis, Torallochus rempensis, Torallochus pupiformis, and Torallochus discus.",

The opinion about tectonical control of the Korytnica basin is presented. The basin was established as a result of the action of Alpine faults and rejuvenation of Laramide faults. In the centre of the Korytnica basin an oval depression attaining about 80 m, is situated. This depression is divided from the low of Korytnica village by narrow pre-Miocene substrate ridge. The clay deposits filling the basin are an almost isometric lithosome, and its partly syntectonical character is postulated. The sedimentation of the brown-coal deposits and the green clays, being the lower members of whole sequence, shows no connection with the Badenian transgression. Two zones can be distinguished in the basin: shallow north-eastern and deeper south-western zone. The lack of the hyphothetical Jawor ridge suggests that isolation of the basin from the open sea was only of hydrodynamic nature.",

If an area of reduced hydraulic conductivity is introduced, the conduit system evolves around this area and a deep phreatic cave is formed. This is true only, if the contrast in hydraulic conductivity is large enough.

In their geological history these clays became overconsolidated. They include numerous weakness surfaces, are sensitive to the influence of exogenic processes, and can be classified as soils of specific properties. It is necessary to take into account the state and history of loads when testing these soils. This paper deals with the testing of overconsolidated soils. It contains full characteristics of the engineering-geological properties of the Mio-Pliocene clays of the Warsaw area. On the basis of the determined properties, the load-bearing capabilities of unweathered and weathered clays as the construction subgrade have been analysed. Special attention was paid to the quantitative expression of the influence of wetting (swelling), structure disturbance, and occurrences of shear strength weakness surfaces (cohesion and angle of internal friction). In the case of clays, it is possible that horizontal stresses are higher than vertical stresses (K0 = 0.74-1.44). The behaviour of clays occurring in slopes has been assessed. Laboratory and field (static penetration and dilatometer) test results are presented. Obtained results can be used directly for the evaluation of Mio-Pliocene clays as a construction subgrade, and indirectly for other overconsolidated soils, especially in the context of testing methodology.",

    "abstract": "The authors recently published in this journal (SANTOS & al. 2003) the description of a new trace fossil, Lacrimichnus SANTOS, MAYORAL & MUNIZ, 2003, ichnogen. nov. They ascribed this ichnotaxon to the encrusting activity of calyptracean gastropods (Crepidula LAMARCK 1799) and ostracean bivalves. However, they not exclude the possibility that the scars might have been made by Capulus or Calyptraea. In the case of the Portuguese and Spanish material, the traces were made by the Crepidula fossilized with the pectinid bivalves, particularly in view of the fact that no specimens of Calyptraea or Capulus were found. The occurrence in the Atlantic realm (southwestern Iberian Peninsula, Portugal and Spain) was dated as Late Tortonian (Late Miocene) to Lower Pliocene; similar tarces are also known fossil from the Holocene. During the printing of their paper, the authors found an article by BONGRAIN (1995), which seems to be crucial for the definitive interpretation of these traces. In her paper, BONGRAIN demonstrated that the Recent capulid gastropod Capulus ungaricus attaches itself to the valves of the pectinid bivalve Aequipecten opercularis and leaves a distinctive bioerosion trace at the site of attachment. She attributed analogous bioerosion traces on the pectinid Gigantopecten gallicus from the Serravallian (Mid Miocene) of Salles (Aquitanie, southest France) to other species of Capulus and inferred a general commensalism-parasitism relationship between capulid gastropods and pectinid bivalves, even though they were never found fossilised in direct association. She noted the similarity of the bioerosion traces on the North American Lower Pliocene pectinid Chesapecten jeffersonius, including those shown in the specimen figured by LISTER (1687, pI. 167), to the traces made by the Recent Capulus ungaricus. She also discussed two additional examples in the literature of the inferred relationship between capulid gastropods and pectinids, from the Pliocene of New Zealand ant the Late Pleistocene of Japan respectively. The bioerosion traces discussed by BONGRAIN (1995), but not considered paleoichnologically by her (p. 347, l'aspect paleoichnologique du sujet et les problemes de parataxinomie qu'il souleve demanderaient a etre traites par un specialiste de la question, ce que je ne suis pas), are virtually identical to our new ichnotaxon Lacrimichnus.",

The peculiarly shaped forms ‘raphanoides’ and ‘scutorum’ are ecophenotypes of this species; the same applies to the ‘tulipiformis’ specimens reported previously fromthis section.Discussed are dynamic events controlling the life and death conditions in the nearshore (offshore) environment of Rafina, where the giant specimens of Concavus ( Concavus ) concavus (DARWIN, 1854) flourished through several successive generations. As opportunistic species they adopted the r-selection reproduction strategy in order to dominate over other biota. The intermittent action of high-energy agents was responsible for the production of balanid-shell hash that involved taphonomic feedback. This enabled further colonization of the biotope and the growth of multiphased (bouquet-like and pyramidal) clusters. The demise of the monospecific balanid communities is ascribed to a heavy storm which stirred-up the whole balanid-bearing sequence, to produce a proximal tempestite. This final burial and subsequent depositional lull in the Rafina environment was favoured by a temporary deepening of the whole Lower Pliocene (Zanclean) basin beyond the bathymetric range in which the balanid population could survive.",

The oldest part of the succession, known as the Huczwa Formation and comprising depositional sequences 1–4, was investigated based on lithofacies analysis, sequence stratigraphy and petrographic studies. The article provides descriptions of depositional sequences, parasequences (cyclothems) and lithofacies that were formed in a range of environments (elements of depositional architecture) and as a result of volcanic processes – lava and pyroclastic eruptions and chemical weathering of their products. Correlation of the sequence stratigraphy to the West European and global Carboniferous chronostratigraphic divisions, as well as to the Khoriv suite in the Lviv-Volyn Basin in adjacent Ukraine, indicates a putative late Tournaisian age for sequence 1, and a late Visean age for sequences 2–4. There is a stratigraphic gap between sequences 1 and 2, spanning probably the uppermost Tournaisian and the lower and middle Visean. The upper Tournaisian is represented by the FRST-LST deposits of sequence 1, comprising mainly volcaniclastic conglomerates and sandstones developed in braided-river channels and incised valleys with hyperconcentrated flow processes. These deposits are represented by polymictic paraconglomerate and lithic/sublithic/subarkose arenites or sublithic wackes, and contain predominantly grains of acidic and alkaline volcanic and igneous rocks. This material probably came from the Łuków-Wisznice Elevation and the Volynian Polesia region, located to the NE and E of the Lublin Basin. In the uppermost part of sequence 1, volcanic rocks and tuffs appear which developed during the activity of at least three volcanic cones in the Lublin Basin. The volcanoes were the source of alkaline lavas in the central and SW areas of the basin, and of acidic lavas in the SE area, previously undescribed. The Visean sequences 2–4 consist of the FRST-LST sediments deposited within incised valleys. The TST and HST deposits accumulated mainly in a shallow ramp-type carbonate shelf, shallow clayey shelf and deltaic environments.",

This street connected the NW-German-Polish Basin in the north and the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin (and adjacent regions of the Tethys) in the south. However, post-Cretaceous erosion north of Meißen removed any Upper Cretaceous deposits but erosion outliers at Siebenlehn and especially north of the Forest of Tharandt proof the presence of a marly through silty belt in this area. Three transgressions (base of uppermost Lower to Middle Cenomanian, base of Upper Cenomanian and base of the geslinianum Zone in the mid-Upper Cenomanian) have taken place. The sedimentation was influenced by the topography of the mentioned islands and by movements at structural lines in the Proterozoic and Palaeozoic basement. During the early Late Cenomanian, a marly-silty sedimentation (Mobschatz Formation) in the north existed besides sandy sedimentation in the south (Oberhäslich Formation). The transgression at the base of the geslinianum Zone caused the final submergence of island chains between Meißen, Dresden and Pirna, and a litho- and biofacies bound to cliffs and submarine swells formed. A silty-marly lithofacies, a mixed sandy-silty lithofacies (Dölzschen Formation) and a sandy lithofacies in the south (Sächsisches Elbsandsteingebirge) co-existed during the latest Cenomanian. The first mentioned biofacies yields a rich fauna mainly consisting of oysters, pectinids, rudists, and near-shore gastropods accompanied by echinids and, in some cliffs, teeth of sharks. The Pennrich fauna (Häntzschel 1933; Uhlig 1941) especially consists of the very common serpulids Pyrgopolon (P.) septemsulcata and Glomerula lombricus (formerly Hepteris septemsulcata and G. gordialis).",

    "abstract": "Abstract We report the discovery of lower jaws of Baculites (Ammonoidea) from the Upper Cretaceous U.S. Western Interior. In the lower Campanian Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Chalk of Kansas, most of the jaws occur as isolated elements. Based on their age, they probably belong to Baculites sp. (smooth). They conform to the description of rugaptychus, and are ornamented with coarse rugae on their ventral side. One specimen is preserved inside a small fecal pellet that was probably produced by a fish. Another specimen occurs inside in a crushed body chamber near the aperture and is probably in situ. Three small structures are present immediately behind the jaw and may represent the remains of the gills. In the lower Maastrichtian Pierre Shale of Wyoming, two specimens of Baculites grandis contain lower jaws inside their body chambers, and are probably in situ. In both specimens, the jaws are oriented at an acute angle to the long axis of the shell, with their anterior ends pointing toward the dorsum. One of the jaws is folded into a U-shape, which probably approximates the shape of the jaw during life. Based on the measurements of the jaws and the shape of the shell, the jaws could not have touched the sides of the shell even if they were splayed out, implying that they could not have effectively served as opercula. Instead, in combination with the upper jaws and radula, they constituted the buccal apparatus that collected and conveyed food to the esophagus.",

Monazite grains demonstrate subtle to distinct patchy zoning related to slight compositional variations. Textural and compositional characteristics indicate that the monazite formed in a single magmatic event in a slightly heterogeneous system, and was only weakly affected by secondary alteration, which did not disturb the Th-U-Pb system. Chemical dating of the monazite gave a consistent age of 299 ± 1.7 Ma. The current study presents the first geochronological data for the Stolpen granite. It provides evidence that Stolpen is the youngest Variscan granitic intrusion in the Lusatian Granodiorite Complex and indicates that magmatic activity related to post-collisional extension in this region lasted at least 5my longer than previously assumed",

The remains of the wooden building located directly on the prehistoric lacustrine sediments created a unique opportunity to reconstruct the near-shore sedimentation of the Drużno Lake. Geological, malacological and palynological methods were applied during the investigation. The results, compared with the ranges of both the Drużno Lake and the Vistula Lagoon, known from previous studies of the region, allowed the correlation of a phase of a deep lake with the “Roman Period”. Rapid shallowing of the lake occurred in the “Migration Period”. The final disappearance of the lake in the area of modern Elbląg occurred in the early Middle Ages.",

    "abstract": "The Indian Mesozoic dinosaur record is famous for documenting significant aspects of dinosaur evolution during the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The Cenomanian–Turonian Nimar Sandstone, Lower Narmada valley, has produced fragmentary skeletal remains of Sauropoda indet. The Maastrichtian Lameta Formation has yielded at least 6 valid sauropod taxa and indeterminate titanosaurid remains, and at least 11 named (but likely oversplit) theropod taxa, i.e., 3 smaller-bodied species and 8 medium-to-large sized theropods. Apart from skeletal remains, Infra- and Intertrappean beds of peninsular India have yielded more than 10,000 dinosaur eggs belonging to 5 oofamilies and 15 oospecies. Most of the Indian ootaxa show distinct affinities with the Late Cretaceous ootaxa of four other continental areas – Spain, France, Argentina and Morocco. The presence of the two dominant oofamilies, Fusioolithidae and Megaloolithidae, in the Infra- and Intertrappean localities of peninsular India and three different continents (South America, Europe and Africa) further shows an ancient Gondwanan affinity and basic terrestrial association among these three landmasses. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of skeletal material, the most plausible pathway of dinosaur dispersal between India and Madagascar took place during the Late Cretaceous. The other conceivable dispersal pathway for the small animals was between India and Asia by means of the Kohistan Dras Volcanic Arc or a northeast pathway through Somalia, while the very large vertebrates, like theropod dinosaurs, may have emerged as a component of a ‘Pan Gondwanan’ model.",

The oldest schemes assume the subdivision of the Pleistocene into three glaciations (i.e., Cracow, Middle-Polish and Baltic) separated by two interglacials (Great and Eemian). The scheme published in 1992 comprises eight glacial and seven interglacial units. The most recent scheme for the Quaternary contains seven advances of the Scandinavian ice-sheet on the area of Poland during the Nidanian (MIS 22), Sanian 1 (MIS 16), Sanian 2 (MIS 12), Liviecian (MIS 10), Krznanian (MIS 8), Odranian (MIS 6), and Vistulian (MIS 2–5d) glaciations. They are separated by six interglacials: Podlasian, Ferdynandovian, Mazovian, Zbójnian, Lublinian and Eemian. The ranges of glacial transgressions, and key interglacial and preglacial sites are assembled in a cumulative scheme for the area of Poland. We review the main study methods on which the subsequent versions of the stratigraphic scheme were based. These include Prof. Lindner’s own detailed field research in glaciated and extraglacial areas, and paleofloristic, paleontological and paleomagnetic studies of major interglacial sites carried out by numerous researchers, as well as thorough literature studies.",

A record was obtained of all seven Regional Pollen Assemblage Zones (RPAZs) according to Mamakowa’s description of the Eemian pollen succession (1989), and of the changes in microfossil assemblages and isotopes in palaeolake sediments associated with lake evolution. Special attention was paid to the Middle Eemian RPAZ 4 (i.e. hazel phase) of the climatic optimum; all proxies associate this with the highest water level and a warm humid climate. During the E5/E6 RPAZs, the eutrophic lake transformed very quickly, and a transitional peatbog was formed. The higher humidity of the late Eemian resulted in another increase in water level. The multi-proxy record of the Żabieniec palaeolake which we obtained was compared to those of other Eemian water bodies in the Garwolin Plain and in Central Poland that exhibit sedimentation gaps especially during the younger part of the E5 RPAZ.",

    "abstract": "Permian rugose corals of the Cordilleran-Arctic-Uralian Realm are abundant in shallow-water carbonates along the northwestern and western margin of Pangaea, from the Ural Mountains, area in Russia, through the Svalbard Archipelago and arctic and western North America, to Bolivia and Peru. The colonial forms are of particular interest for the biostratigraphy and reconstruction of the paleogeography of this extensive region. A revision of the systematics of these corals has shown that, although important differences exist between the assemblages in the areas listed, the faunas are recognizable throughout the entire realm. Almost all of the faunas in the realm, on cratonal Pangaea, are Cisuralian (Asselian to Artinskian) in age although younger faunas occur in rocks of terranes subsequently accreted to North America. The cratonal faunas show a general trend from a predominance of relatively simple, fasciculate species with open axial areas or weakly developed axial structures in the lowest Permian, to younger, more complex fasciculate and massive species with a variety of morphological elements in their axial structures and dissepimentaria. Suppression of the walls occurs commonly in the youngest faunas. As a result of the northward movement of Pangaea into cooler waters, colonial rugose corals were exterminated from the more northerly areas by early to mid-Artinskian time, but persisted throughout the Artinskian and possibly into the Kungurian and early Guagalupian in the cratonic successions of the western U.S.A. Similarities between the coral faunas of cratonal North America and the western allochthonous terranes indicate that faunal interchange occurred between these various coral faunas during the Cisuralian. The only colonial corals recovered from Wordian to Lopingian rocks in this region are waagenophyllid corals of tethyan affinity from the Cache Creek and Quesnellia terranes of British Columbia and the Hayfork and Eastern Klamath terranes of California.",

A coat developed on some tubes, and structured like a dense felt composed of needle-shaped sclerites (presumably aragonitic) associated with a granular precipitate of calcite, is interpreted as having been produced by the infested scleractinian polyps which reacted against the intruders by an immense secretion of calcium carbonate. An abundant occurrence of Josephella commensalis sp.n. on local growth-discontinuity surfaces within the scleractinian colonies may suggest their formation just by temporary overpopulations of the micropolychaetes whose metabolism (? or exploitation) has become fatal to a part of the colony.",

    "abstract": "The region of the Bobrowiec Massif, crucial in underground flows within the Chocholowski Stream catchment area, was not studied in details until the 50ies. The Chocholowskie Vaucluse Spring is recharged mainly by karst systems, including that of the Szczelina Chocholowska - Jaskinia Rybia caves. The remaining 20% of water in the system comes from surface waters of the Chocholowski Stream. First succesful dye tests were conducted on this system in 1971/1972. The paper presents data and interpretation of the recent dye-tracer experiments for the Chocholowskie Vaucluse Spring recharge area. The results of these tests prove that the connection between the Szczelina Chocholowska - Rybia caves karst system and the Chocholowskie Vaucluse spring is of a karst-fissure character. This hydraulic connection is a typical example of a sub-channel circulation, where flow through a karst-fissure system takes place beneath the bottom of an existing river channel. Comparing the time of dye flow through the system with water stages indicates that the system of fissures linking the sinkhole zone with the vaucluse spring is at least three fold. The inverse relation between watermark stands reflecting the degree of watering in the massif and the time, at which dye penetrates the system, is also distincly visible.",

The Lower Werfenian (Seislian) clastics in the Tatra Mts. occur within autochtonous and fold, units, also in the lower sub-tatric (Krizna) nappe units. Within autochtonous units the Seisian rests on the peneplained. Surface of the crystalline massif, in one of the exposures it overlies the Permian conglomerate of the Verrucano type. Seisian deposits begin with conglomerates or conglomeratic sandstones. Pebbles of siliceous, volcanic and milk-quartz rocks are exotic in character. They are overlain by arkose- and quartzitic sandstones displaying cross stratification, ripple marks and flutes. In the Upper Seisian there is a predominance of silt-clay deposits interbedded by quartz sandstones, in the uppermost part by yellow dolomites. The occurrence is noted of plant remains and of slime-eaters. Illite is here the chief component of clay rocks. An anaIysis of the directional structures shows that the clastic material had been transported from the north southward. The petrographic composition suggests that the material had been brought from massifs built of crystalline, metamorphic and volcanic rocks which make up the Pra-Carpathian massif now completely covered by the Carpathian Flysch. The sedimentary structures and the character of the sediment, fairly uniform over large areas of the Central Carpathians, indicate that the sedimentation of the Lower Werfenian deposits took place in a water basin, most likely in a shallow-sea environment.",

    "abstract": "Devonian rocks crop out in several thrust sheets in the sedimentary belt of North-Western Karakorum, both to the south and to the north of the Reshun Fault. Gently metamorphosed Devonian dolostones and volcanics are also present in the Tash Kupruk Zone north of the thrust sheet system. The most complete succession is found in the Karambar Thrust sheet where dolostones and recrystallized limestones (Vandanil Formation) lie above the black shales and siltstones of the Baroghil Group. The age of the Vandanil Formation is poorly defined, approximating latest Silurian or earliest Devonian at its base and proven to be Pragian in the 4th of its 5 lithozones. The overlying Chilmarabad Formation is divided into two members. The lower member is a mixed siliciclastic–carbonate package, present in most southern and western thrust sheets. The upper member is ubiquitous; it consists of dolostones, often stromatolitic. The calcareous part of the TashKupruk Zone consists of similar facies. The carbonate flats of the Chilmarabad Formation display a trend towards emersion towards the top, and are overlain, with regional unconformity, by the basal unit of the Shogrām Formation. The base of the latter consists of arenite and fine conglomerate (deposited in an alluvial setting) overlain by alternating marine bioclastic limestones and litharenites with one or two coral bafflestones in the middle to upper part. The age of the lowermost part of the Shogrām Formation is Givetian, extending through the Frasnian and seemingly into the Famennian, but the last is poorly documented (contrasting with the classic Shogrām and Kurāgh sections of Chitral); it reflects a return to fine terrigenous input.  The inferred palaeogeography accords with the Northern Karakorum having been part of the Gondwana margin during the Devonian. Awide, mostly calcareous platform, characterised extensive areas of the Karakorum, Central Pamir, Badakhshan and, in a minor way, Central Afghanistan (Helmand Block). The sandstone petrography suggests that clastics polluting the carbonates originated from erosion of a pre-existing sedimentary cover. During theGivetian a first rifting episode, possibly echoing the opening of an ocean to the east, affected the whole area, with volcanic outpourings in the rifts, while eroding shoulders fed the basins, though never extending as deep as the crystalline basement. A minor volcanic input is also recorded. The tectonic pulse almost ceased during the Frasnian, gradually resuming towards the end of the Devonian.",

Analysis of measurements of teeth with complete bases randomly selected from 3,050 initially available teeth failed to reveal the presence of sexual dimorphism or the discrete presence of juveniles as expected, based on an independent study which identified the presence of Orthacanthus juvenile occipital spines. A few highly symmetrical small teeth are present, which had not been previously observed in the Texas lower Permian. They may be symphyseals and restricted only to juveniles. Other unusual teeth include germinal teeth and deformed teeth, both of which occur in the Clear Fork and underlying Wichita groups. One tooth displays an apparent example of the equivalent of an “enamel pearl” on one of its cusps. The most unusual teeth are those that appear to have undergone various stages of resorption. Only the lingual margin of the base is affected in which the apical button is resorbed to varying degrees until only the labial margin with the basal tubercle and the three cusps are all that remain. If the teeth were undergoing resorption, then the perplexing problem is why the apical button is resorbed and not the superjacent basal tubercle. Other vertebrate remains include palaeoniscoid scales and teeth and unidentified tetrapod bone fragments, jaw fragments, and teeth. Rare fragments of bones (scales?) bear a “comb edge” which have not been previously observed in the Texas lower Permian.",

A vertically oriented Buntsandstein succession (Lower Triassic) from Józefka Quarry (Holy Cross Mountains, central Poland), steeply wedged within folded Devonian carbonates, is recognised as an effect of normal faulting within a releasing stepover. The sandstone succession, corresponding to the Zagnańsk Formation in the local lithostratigraphic scheme, is represented by two complexes, interpreted as deposits of a sand-dominated alluvial plain (older complex), and coarse-grained sands and gravels of a braided river system (younger complex). The sandstone complex was primarily formed as the lowermost part of the several kilometres thick Mesozoic cover of the Holy Cross Mountains Fold Belt (HCFB), later eroded as a result of the Late Cretaceous/Paleogene uplift of the area. Tectonic analysis of the present-day position of the deformed sandstone succession shows that it is fault-bounded by a system of strike-slip and normal faults, which we interpret as a releasing stepover. Accordingly, the formation of the stepover in the central part of the late Palaeozoic HCFB is evidence of a significant role of strike-slip faulting within this tectonic unit during Late Cretaceous/Paleogene times. The faulting was probably triggered by reactivation of the terminal Palaeozoic strike-slip fault pattern along the western border of the Teisseyre–Tornquist Zone.",

    "abstract": "A microfauna of small shelly fossils (SSF) is reported here for the first time from middle Cambrian (Series 3, Stage 5) subsurface strata of the Torgau-Doberlug Syncline (TDS), Central Germany. Considering that this microfauna is strongly limited and poorly preserved the material is quite abundant and diverse. The assemblage consists of molluscs (pelagiellids, bivalves), coeloscleritophorans (chancelloriids, halkieriids), poriferids, protoconodonts, cambroclaves, hyoliths, brachiopods, and disarticulated echinoderm remains. Additionally, a probable pterobranch hemichordate is noted. The assemblage is dominated by epifaunal suspension feeders from mid- to outer shelf depositional settings. Stratigraphically it represents (together with rare trilobites) the oldest middle Cambrian (Series 3, Stage 5) fauna known from Central Germany and the entire Saxothuringian Zone.  Regardless the taphonomic problems related to the SSF occurrence, close palaeobiogeographic relations are indicated with the Mediterranean shelf of West Gondwana (especially with the areas of southwestern Europe and Morocco). The reported microfauna coupled with recent trilobite and palynomorph research supports assumptions that the Cambrian succession in the TDS is by far more complete than hitherto suggested, emphasizing its importance as a region yielding Cambrian rocks in Central Europe.",

Acta Geologica Polonica, (1), 137-151. Warszawa. The Mała Łąka Fault in the Tatra Mts. is a synsedimentary normal fault responsible for the variable thickness of Eocene deposits in the area. Its main activity took place in the interval from the sedimentation of red conglomerates to the appearance of nummulitic limestones. The estimated throw is up to 350 m. Near the northern margin of the Tatra Mts., the trend of the fault changes from N-S to NE-SW. This part of the fault could have been activated during the Neogene uplift of the Tatra Mts. and rejuvenated as a sinistral fault. In the upper reach of the Mała Łąka Stream, the fault trend does not follow the course of the Mała Łąka Valley. Here, the flowing stream waters used extensional fractures within a damage zone associated with the Mała Łąka Fault rather than the lithological boundary at the tectonic contact between the Triassic dolomites and the Eocene conglomerates. The fault has a hingelike character; its hinge was located in the present-day Kościeliska Valley, c. 2.5 km west of the Mała Łąka Valley.",

The taxonomic value of rostral nodes of extinct sharks, with comments on previous records of the genus Lamna (Lamniformes, Lamnidae) from the Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, North Carolina (USA). Acta Geologica Polonica , 62 (1), 117-127. Warszawa. Shark rostral nodes from the Yorktown Formation (Zanclean, early Pliocene) of Lee Creek Mine, North Carolina (USA), previously assigned to the genus Lamna Cuvier, 1816, have been reinterpreted using a preliminary identification key for extant Lamniformes based on rostral morphology. In addition, the fossil rostral nodes have been compared in detail with Recent material of both the porbeagle, Lamna nasus (Bonnaterre, 1788) and the salmon shark, Lamna ditropis Hubbs &amp; Follet, 1947. Despite the fact that the rostra compared relatively well with those of Recent Lamna , the Lee Creek Mine specimens proved to differ significantly in having near-parallel lateral rostral cartilages that join the rostral node individually, instead of abutting ones. Based on this observation, we here propose to strike the genus Lamna from the Lee Creek Mine faunal list, so long as no other diagnostic material is forthcoming. These partially preserved rostra are likely to have belonged to extinct taxa within the families Lamnidae or Otodontidae, both of which have been documented from the Yorktown Formation on the basis of isolated teeth of at least three species, Cosmopolitodus hastalis (Agassiz, 1838), Megaselachus megalodon (Agassiz, 1835) and Parotodus benedenii (Le Hon, 1871).",

    "abstract": "The Kamieniec Ząbkowicki Metamorphic Belt (Fore-Sudetic Block, southwest Poland) consists mainly of mica schists. Based on mesostructural features, their deformational history has been interpreted in different ways and not quite consistently with the results of microstructural studies. Since the schist complex comprises acid metarhyolites – quartzo-feldspathic schists – which are well suited to microstructural analysis, we attempted to study quartz [c]-axis lattice preferred orientation (LPO) in these rocks in order to compare the results with those obtained by other authors and check against the proposed sequences of tectonic events in the region. The quartzo-feldspathic schists are fine- to medium-grained rocks with varying amounts of K-feldspar porphyroclasts. Most of these porphyroclasts are accompanied by symmetric or asymmetric pressure shadows. Their asymmetry uniformly indicates a top-to-the SSW shear sense along W-dipping foliation in a strike-slip regime. Quartz [c]-axis LPO indicates that the deformation took place mainly at plane strain with a non-coaxial component, with a top-to-the SSW or NNE sense of movement, and an apparent flattening field. The thermal conditions of deformation of the quartzo-feldspathic schists were within the limits of the amphibolite facies (550–600oC). Integration of the micro- and mesofabric data indicated the superposition of two tectonothermal events: the main one with sinistral strike-slip, top-to-the SW kinematics consistent with the asymmetry of the porphyroclasts, and a subsequent overprint with dextral, transpressional, top-tothe NE kinematics. There is a visible dependence of the quartz LPO on the degree of mylonitization in the quartzofeldspathic schists. A westward increase in mylonitic deformation is observed in the study area.",

    "abstract": "The thermal maturity data presented by BROCHWICZ-LEWIŃSKI & al. (1986) from the subsurface of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, southern Poland are discussed. The supposed low maturity level (60-70°C) in Cambrian rocks, based on acritarch color, is inconsistent with the maturity trends inferred by other indices of organic metamorphism (coal rank, vitrinite reflectance, conodont CAI), most probably because of decolorization of acritarchs due to secondary oxidation.

The fauna contains 14 species representing 12 genera and subgenera (of 14 species, 6 are new records in the Korytnica Clays). Using data obtained from observations of Recent corals, ecological requirements of the following genera from the Korytnica Clays have been presented: Stephanophyllia, Caryophyllia, Acanthocyathus, Tethocyathus, Paracyathus, Polycyathus, Ceratotrochus, Ceratotrochus (Edwardsotrochus) , Peponocyat!Jus, Flabellum, Balanophyllia and Dendrophyllia. A possibility of redeposition of coral fauna in some localities is discussed. Ahermatypic fauna from some other sites is interpreted as autochthonic, and a deep sublittoral zone is suggested as the life environment of these corals.",

    "abstract": "An assemblage of the extremely well preserved Middle Miocene (Badenian) starfishes from Nawodzice in the Holy Cross Mountains, Central Poland, is taxonomically recognized to be composed primarily of the two species, new to the science. The dominant is Astropecten navodicensis sp.n. that usually occurs in groups of several specimens, and is preserved with the arms either extended, or closed in a tulip-like form. Associated is Ceramaster polonicus sp.n., the holotype of which has its ossicle arrangement intact. Isolated ossicles are assigned tentatively to the higher taxa, Astropecten sp. and Goniasteridae gen.et sp. indet., respectively. All starfishes of the studied assemblage are thought to be buried in life position, presumably while still alive , under extremely shallow marine (shallow subtidal to intertidal) environmental conditions some 15 m.y. ago (Badenian stage corresponding to the Langhian/Serravallian boundary interval). The species name Astropecten granulatus WIENBERG RASMUSSEN, 1972, used by WIENBERG RASMUSSEN (1972) for an Eocene species from England, and also by KACZMARSKA (1987) for the Middle Miocene isolated ossicles from the Korytnica Basin in Poland, appears to be a younger homonym of the common present-day species Astropecten granulatus M¥LLER & TROSCHEL, 1842; it is thus superseded herein by a new species name, Astropecten anglicus nom.n.",

For the alteration of biotite to chlorite the replacement of potassium in the interlayer by a brucite-like layer and the subsequent increase in volume was observed. There were, however, some missing brucite-like layers within the chlorite units. Moreover, both topotactic and low angle replacement of biotite to chlorite were identified. For the direct hydration of hornblende to chlorite, HRTEM and selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) showed that the c* and a* of chlorite were parallel to the b* and a* of hornblende, respectively.

The schoenni and korytnicensis-limatus assemblages occupied the littoral zone of the Korytnica Basin. The remaining nassariid assemblages inhabited different offshore environments. Nassariid assemblages appear to be a useful tool for local stratigraphic correlation as their succession is identical within almost the entire study area, excluding the littoral zone. The lower limit of one of the most widespread nassariid assemblages ( korytnicensis assemblage) is proved to be an isochronous surface. The isochronous nature of other boundaries between the nassariid assemblages recognised in the succession is also postulated. The entire nassariid sequence is interpreted as a record of temporal changes in the relative size of two large gastropod populations: the population of Nassarius restitutianus and the population of Nassarius korytnicensis . Environmental requirements of the most abundant nassariids are described in detail.",

    "abstract": "The interstadial of the Cracovian glaciation from Jasionka near Rzeszow The palynologically studied borehole sectio from Jasionka occurs north of Rzeszow within the Subcarpathian “pra-dolina” (Urstromtal) (fig. 1). The formation of the Subcarpathian “pra-dolina” most probably goes back to a period before the Cracovian (Mindel) glaciation. Undoubtedly, as early as in the Pleistocene times a large river flowed in the “pra-dolina” at the foot of the Carpathians. The bottom of that river was on a higher level than the floor of the valley at the time of the Cracovian glaciation. The geological section I-I (fig.2) cuts the pra-dolina at a point where the presence has been observed of but the lowest of its terraces formed during the oldest stadial of the Cracovian glaciations, while the rock floors of the higher terraces with the Pre-Pleistocene times occur at an altitude of 210-215 and 220-230 m a.s.l. The·petrographic composition and character of gravels of which all the terraces consist, is very much the same. It is characterised by the side-by-side occurrence of Carpathian rocks and an admixture of Tatric rocks (Werfenian quartzites and granites). Scandinavian crystalline rocks are absent here. These are impoverished:gravels (fig. 4). During the G II-1/max. interglacistadial (interstadial) of the Cracovian glaciation which preceded the ice invasion of the Subcarpathian·region, the “Pra-dolina” was already a morphologically mature from. It was a relatively broad and deeply incised valley (about 40 m), with a well developed system of terraces. The river in the valley no longer eroded downward but it meandered along that broad valley. Lateral erosion and accumulation occurred in alternation in the various sectors of the flood terrace there. lt is to this period that we may refer the fossil oxbow-lake from the vicinity ,of Jasionka, filled in by organogenic sediments (series II). The palynological profile described by M. Dąbrowski (1967) indicates a distinct increasing warmth of interstadial order of magnitude. The ice-sheet of the Cracovian glaciation (G II max.) invaded the area here considered and covered the fluvial and oxbow--lake deposits of the Subcarpathian “pra-dolina with a layer of glacial accumulation deposits (series IV). In the vicinity of Jasionka this series is considerably degraded because of the subsequent processes of erosion and denudation. The petrographic composition of the gravel fraction from the glacial series very obviously differs from the deposits of fluvial accumulation, chiefly in the presence of pebbles of crystaline rocks from Scandinavia and in that of Cretaceous rocks from the Highland of Little Poland (Malopolska), (fig. 4). This undoubtedly indicates ;the glacial character of the deposits. The presence of organogenic deposits underlying the glacial series reliably indicates the occurrence of interglacistadial conditions before the maximum ice-sheet advance. This would be a confirmation of S. Z. Rozycki's opinions (1961, 1967) with respect to the occurrence of older stadials of the Cracovian glaciation prior to its maximum extent. These stadials never reached the area of the Sandomierz Lowland.",

The Tournaisian here is developed mainly as a siliceous-clay series whose petrography has been summarily described. The lower part of the Gattendorfia horizon occurs as calcareous-marly sediments analogous with the Famennian. The transition of the Devonian into the Carboniferous in borehole Bolechowice 1 took place in the lamellibranchian facies The division of the Famenian in this borehole is discussed and stress is laid on the general resemblances in the development of the Tournaisian and the Strunian at Bolechowice and Kowala. A brief description is also for the first time given of the development of the Strunian in the Holy Cross Mts., also the extent and facial types of this stage on the basis of Tournaisian sections from this region.

The age of the collection is thus middle late Campanian to late early Maastrichtian, and it closes a stratigraphic gap between faunas described formerly from this region. The specimens are nuclei collected from the desert pavement. The abundance of specimens allows for a comparison to other Campanian-Maastrichtian ammonoid records from Mexico, North America and Europe.",

The parent fluids of fluorite were of the Na-Ca-Cl type with a low CO₂ content. The fluoride ions had sources in the pluton and in its host rocks. Fluid inclusion observations provide evidence of various post-formation alteration. such as refilling, partition, cracking, migration, expulsion or vacuole modification from irregular to cubic habit.

The deterioration of rugose corals, globally diverse in time and space in the late Viséan and Serpukhovian, has resulted in the patchy distribution of survivors and newcomers, present in the Bashkirian. Difficulties in inter-basinal communication and the isolation of some sites have resulted in a different content of Bashkirian Rugosa in particular patches, with only rare genera in common. New data has made it possible to document the appearance of the first late Carboniferous genera in the Donets Basin as early as the lower Voznessenkian Horizon (= lower Chokierian Substage), i.e., close to the beginning of the Bashkirian Stage. The two stages of diversification, established in the Bashkirian rugose corals of the Donets Basin, cannot find their counterparts elsewhere. A palaeogeographic overview of the most important sites of diversified rugose corals documents the need to re-examine many taxa, which should be based on complete specimen studies. This and the precise placement of taxa in the modern stratigraphy must be done in order to make rugose corals globally comparable. Simple repetitions of names, commonly used in general summaries, is strongly misleading in both stratigraphic and palaeogeographic reconstructions.",

The intensity of these phenomena is reported to decrease from east to west within the lower members of the flysch area, while within its upper members the order is reversed. The writers believe this to be due to orogenic movements at work in the Podhale geosyncline. The exotic material of flysch beds is built up mainly of Tatride and Granide elements. The coarse-clastic fraction of deposits near the bottom of flysch beds diminishes from east to west, but from west to east towards the top. This suggests that clastic material in the Podhale basin is derived from diverse supply sources during particular development stages of the geosyncline.",

    "abstract": "PREGLACIAL AND INTERGLACIAL DEPOSITS IN THE TATRA MTS The travertine cemented talus breccia, discovered at the summit of Mount Ciemniak in the Czerwone Wierchy massif of the Western Tatra Range (fig. 1), has been formed at the base of the mountain slope – whose reconstruction is shown in fig. 2 - under completely different morphological conditions. In order to determine the age of the breccia the writer has devoted some time to extensive geomorphological speculations primarily concerned with the detection within the Tatra Mts. of relicts of Preglacial morphology (fig. 3). According to Lucerna's Qpinion (1908) these forms were nearly completely obliterated during the Pleistocene in result of incision work caused by glacier cirques and periglacial activities. It is the writer's belief that conditions which had prevailed during the Quarternary in the Czerwone Wierchy massif allowed for the persistance there of Preglacial relief forms but slightly altered. It is not out of the question that the flat plane summit surface (2100 m.) here, as in the Karkonosze Range of the Sudeten Mts., represents relicts of the Miocene peneplain which developed during the first cycle of erosion after the Paleogene emersion. Hence the polygenic character of Preglacial surface. The age of the talus breccia cannot be accurately determined. Most probably it is a Preglacial deposit, though it may be possibly referred to Miocene or interglacial times. Talus breccias have been also recorded from several other sites. These, owing to their morphological position, should be referred to the interglacial period. One of these breccias has a moraine cover (fig. 4). Within the Tatra Mts., besides relatively compact travertine deposits, some now inactive talus fans are referable to the last interglacial period. These fans are situated within valleys where the work of glaciers during the last glaciation was not very intense.",

    "abstract": "The gypsum ooids found in the Miocene evaporites of Poland were investigated in optic and scanning microscopy. Cortical fabric was recognized and interpreted in terms of environmental conditions. The cortices are built of porous and massive layers. The former are interpreted as originated in supersaturated in respect of gypsum and agitated brine, the latter – in supersaturated but relatively less agitated brine. The lateral disappearing of the porous layers, replaced by the massive gypsum, can result from the primary growth of radial massive polycrystals or from the local recrystallization. Rounded, mainly massive gypsum grains without clear concentric structure, exhibiting partly chaotic and partly quasi-radial arrangement of crystals, are interpreted as ooids or accretionary grains originated in relatively less agitated brine than the porous gypsum ooids. Cortical crystals are predominatly oriented radially with their 010 crystallographic planes tangential to the ooid surface. This orientation is explained as a result of: ( i ) competitive growth of the lens-shaped cortical crystals, ( ii ) initial accretion of crystals (nucleation or deposition according to the snow-ball mechanism) with the 010 tangential to the substrate. The latter possibility could be realized because supposed, produced by abrasion, microcrystalline fragments of gypsum, flattened along the 010 perfect cleavage plane, might become deposited or adsorbed on the ooid, with the largest 010 surface parallel to the substrate, in such a way creating the oriented nuclei of new cortical crystals.",

All these cephalopods descended from the Paleozoic nautiloids, which are represented today by two genera with a tetrabranchiate gill structure and other anatomical features, which differ from those in extant coleoids. The physiology of extant nautiloids enables them to survive in waters with low oxygen content at a few hundred meters depth, toward where the nautiloids withdrew. The two pairs of gills, which occur in extant nautilids only, are suggested to reflect a minor anatomical modification to improve respiration in low oxygen settings by the duplication of the cephalopod initial single pair of gills, and are thus of no taxonomic significance.",

A number of parageneses were found, consisting of hedenbergite, grossular, wollastonite, vesuvianite, albite, actinolite, calcite, epidote, quartz and fluorite. The skarn minerals formed in four stages of different physico-chemical conditions. Stage I, which took place during the prograde metamorphism in a quasi-isochemical system, resulted in crystallization of hedenbergite (ca. 500°C), wollastonite and grossular (ca. 600-650°C) at pstatic = ptotal = pfluid = 2 kbar. The latter two minerals formed at peak metamorphic temperatures, when at ca. 650°C the fluids had a CO 2 concentration of 30 molar percent. Stage II began the retrograde metamorphism, also in a quasi-isochemical system, and resulted in the origin of vesuvianite, actinolite, prehnite, epidote and calcite pseudomorphs after wollastonite. Vesuvianite was the earliest retrograde mineral, which had probably started growing when the temperature decreased below 600-580°C. Water activity increased during retrograde metamorphism at the expense of the CO 2 activity, whose concentration was lower than 2 molar percent during the prehnite formation. Stage III comprised mainly silicification which began at least at 410°C in an allochemical system; it could have partly overlapped stages I and II in time. Stage IV, which was mainly the fluorine metasomatosis at 360 to 110°C developed also as an allochemical process. Thus, the skarns from Garby Izerskie are high-temperature calc-silicate varieties of the pyroxene-garnet-wollastonite type with the subsequent alteration of the calcic plagioclase to the sodic one, and the silica and fluorine metasomatosis.",

Individual mounds are up to 80 m thick and have base diameters of up to several hundred meters. Thickness ratios between mound and intermound deposits are about 5:1 with mound slopes not exceeding 15 o . The bulk of the rock volume consists of a microsparitic matrix which due to its peloidal structure and common laminated crusts is probably a cyanobacterial precipitate. Siliceous sponges contributed to mound stabilization but did not form a rigid framework. Several other invertebrate groups (mainly crinoids) inhabitated the mound surfaces and were transported into adjacent depressions. Stromatactoid cavities, which are so characteristic for Palaeozoic mud mounds, are extremely rare. Generally they are completely occluded with late diagenetic blocky spar; only a few cavities are lined with an early marine RFC cement. The latter is distinguished by relatively heavy δ 18 O signatures of -3.4 ‰PDB which contrast with the isotopic composition of the burial cements displaying mean values of - 9.7‰  δ 18 O PDB. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of early cements, matrix and non-luminescent brachiopod shells fit well into the curve of the isotopic evolution of the Phanerozoic seawater.",

Acta Geologica Polonica, 55 (4), 361-370. Warszawa. The Dhahal Mountains located at the eastern margin of the northern Wadi Araba sinistral fault represent an example of a transpression associated with the Dead Sea transform, which is a sinistral wrench fault. This structure was formed as a result of right bending of the Humrat Fidan active sinistral fault, which is a parallel strand of the Dead Sea transform located east of the main Wadi Araba fault. The fault bend caused uplift and squeezing of the Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks of the transpression. Positive flower structures, folds, fault-bounded wedge-shaped pop-ups and reverse faults are the main structural elements that characterized the Dhahal transpression. Folds are found as sets or as single anticlines and synclines. The major trend of the fold axes is N50°; the principal stress axis (σ1) is perpendicular to this trend (N140°). This trend deviates 26° anticlockwise from that of the Dead Sea stress system (DSS) (as obtained from fault slip data north of the study area), which is responsible for the formation of the Dead Sea transform. Evidence of active uplift in the Dhahal structure is provided by the sharp topography relative to the surrounding areas, and the low mountain front sinuosity index of the western margin of the Dhahal mountains.",

No deposits of the older Pleistocene have been found within the area under consideration. The Middle Polish Glaciation is associated with the fomnation of three series of undrained deposits: from shallow undrained peat lakes a boulder clay horizon and frontal moraine hills. The decline of the Middle Polish Glaciation witnessed the development of periglacial phenomena and the formation of terrace III of the Pilica river. During the Eemian, interglacial erosion set in followed by the accumulation of the lower sands of terrace II. The accumulation of the upper part of terrace II occurred during the Baltic Glaciation. The close of the latter saw the formation of dunes on terraces II and III as well as within areas outside of valleys. Fluvial erosion took place at the beginning of the Holocene, followed by the accumulation of sands and fluvial silts of terrace I. The formation of peatbogs in the valley of the Pilica and its tributary valleys started after the formation of terrace I.",

A lectotype for  Pinna ( C .) socialis was designated and the taxon is assigned herein to P . ( Cyrtopinna ) Morch, 1853, the first record of the subgenus from the Jurassic. A brief review of Stegoconcha Bohm, 1907 revealed two species groups within the genus. Species close to the type species S. granulata are characterized by a nearly smooth anterior shell, followed posteriorly by deep radial furrows and rows of pustules covering the dorsal flank. Another group comprises radially ribbed species related to S. neptuni (Goldfuss, 1837). It includes among others the Paleogene species S. faxensis (Ravn, 1902), extending the known range of Stegoconcha from the Middle Jurassic into the Paleogene. The paper suggests a relationship between Stegoconcha and the Cretaceous Plesiopinna Amano, 1956, with S. obliquata as a possible intermediate species leading to Plesiopinna during the Early Cretaceous. Furthermore, a possible relationship between Stegoconcha and Atrina Gray, 1842 is discussed.",

    "abstract": "A huge isolated accumulation, more than 3 m thick and 10 m wide, of densely packed, uncrushed brachiopods has been found in Jozefka Quarry within the Middle/Upper Devonian Szydlowek Beds deposited in a relatively deep environment of an intrashelf basin (Kostomloty facies zone, western Holy Cross Mountains, Poland). The low-diversity assemblage is strongly dominated by the atrypide Desquamatia globosa jozefkae  Balinski subsp. nov. and, to a lesser degree, by the rhynchonellide Coeloterorhynchus dillanus (Schmidt, 1941), which constitute 72.8% and 22.1% of the fauna, respectively. Less frequent are specimens representing the genera Hypothyridina , Schizophoria and Phlogoiderynchus . According to the conodont fauna found within the coquina bed, the stratigraphic position of the shell accumulation is close to the Givetian/Frasnian boundary. The brachiopods are associated with numerous crinoids and less frequent bryozoans, receptaculitids (Palaeozoic problematica), sponges and solitary corals. Although it is difficult to entirely  exclude the autochthonous nature of the brachiopod coquina member, its allochthonous origin and redeposition of the brachiopod shells to the deep basin by gravity flows is much more probable. Such conclusion is supported by the following facts: (1) the position of the complex in a succession of deep-marine basinal facies impoverished in oxygen; (2) its lateral thinning-out and composite internal stratification; (3) the lensshaped geometry of the coquina bed in the section perpendicular to the bedding dip; (4) high variability of the sediments preserved within the shells; and (5) the preferred orientation of the shells. The brachiopods mixed with crinoidal debris were probably transported by low-velocity, high-density, gravity-induced debris flows. Lack of fossils typical of the Middle Devonian shallows, such as massive stromatoporoids, amphiporoids and tabulates, indicates that the source area of the bioclastic material was not located in the shallowest part of the shelf, but most probably on a submarine sea-mount to the north of present-day Jozefka, as suggested by earlier investigators. The triggering mechanism of the allochthonous deposition was an earthquake rather than storm activity. The enormous thickness of the brachiopod complex is probably caused by the sinking of bioclastic material, transported in succeeding depositional multi-events, in a soft, muddy bottom, typical of the Szydlowek Beds deposition.",

Thirteen of these taxa are reported for the first time from the territory of Ukraine. Among them are the first records of Trapezia glaessneri Muller, 1976 in the Fore-Carpathian Basin and Pachycheles sp. in Paratethys. One taxon ( Petrolisthes sp. A) probably represents a new species. The occurrence of this significant decapod fauna is restricted almost exclusively to the Upper Badenian (i.e., early Serravallian) coralgal reefs of the Ternopil Beds. The taxonomic composition of the decapods indicates that the Late Badenian depositional environment was a shallow marine basin dominated by reefs that developed in warm-to-tropical waters of oceanic salinity. The decapod assemblage from the Ternopil Beds is similar in its taxonomic composition to numerous decapod faunules from fossil reefs of Eocene to Miocene age from the Mediterranean realm and of Miocene age from Paratethys. In contrast, decapod remains are very scarce in Badenian siliciclastic deposits (Mikolaiv Beds) and are represented by the most resistant skeletal elements, i.e., dactyli and fixed fingers. This scarcity was caused by the high-energy environment, with frequent episodes of redeposition, which disintegrated and abraded the decapod remains.",

The graben is located north of Poznań in central- western Poland, and is NW–SE-trending, ~20 km long, 3–5.5 km wide, and up to 160 m deep. It is filled with Lower Oligocene and Neogene sediments, including relatively thick lignite seams. Data from boreholes allow the assignment of the graben-fill sediments to appropriate lithostratigraphic units. Furthermore, analysis of changes in the thickness of these units provides evidence for periods of accelerated graben subsidence or uplift relative to its flanks. As a result, two distinct stages of tectonic subsidence and one inversion in the Paleogene–Neogene evolution of the Szamotuły Graben have been distinguished. Thus, relatively significant subsidence occurred in the Early Oligocene and the middle Early–earliest Mid-Miocene, while slight inversion took place in the middle part of the Mid-Miocene.",

Geochemical modelling indicates the predominance of the felsic component in subsequent magma batches, however, the mantle origin of the admixed magma input is suggested on the basis of geochemical and Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and Pb isotopic data.

Syntectonic dawsonite [NaAlCO3(OH)2] indicates the following series of deformational events within the fault zones: i) detachment and buckle folding resulting from movement along thrust faults; ii) faulting as a compensation of the shortening, resulting in the fault propagation folding, breakthrough thrust faulting and imbrications; and iii) strike-slip faulting.

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) studies were used for the microstructural analysis of natural clays and clay pastes. Qualitative microstructural changes were observed: from a honeycomb microstructure for the initial clay paste to a turbulent microstructure for the dried paste. It was also noticed that water loss caused by the increase of the suction pressure had a significant impact on the microstructural transformations. Significant changes in the quantitative values of the pore space parameters were also observed. Increase of suction pressure and water loss caused a decrease in porosity and changes in the values of morphometric parameters, such as pore distribution; for example, a significant increase of the number of pores of 0−10 μm size and changes in the geometric parameters of the pore space were noticed with the increase of suction pressure. The pore space with larger isometric pores was modified into a pore space with the dominance of small anisometric and fissure-like pores. The increased degree of anisotropy from a poorly-oriented to a highly-oriented microstructure was also observed. After rapid shrinkage the reduction in the number of pores, maximum pore diameter, and total pore perimeter was recorded. The process of rapid water loss induced the closure of very small pores. A similar effect was observed during the increase of the suction pressure, where the closure of pore space of the clay pastes was observed very clearly.",

Thermal maturity in the boreholes shows a regular increase with depth. Geological data combined with Raman spectroscopy and mean vitrinite reflectance results indicate that the analysed Carboniferous strata reached maximum paleotemperatures from c. 110 to c. 265°C. The regional paleogeothermal gradient in the late Paleozoic was c. 80°C/km. The Variscan heating event presumably caused a major coalification process of organic matter. The Carboniferous–Permian magmatic activity must have contributed to high heat flow, adding to the effect of sedimentary burial on the thermal maturity.",

A revision of the previously elaborated succession of the Timan-Pechora associations revealed that the correlation problems are connected with the taxonomic interpretation of the zonal species Palmatolepis hassi and Palmatolepis jamieae. Analysis of the conodont collection of Professor W. Ziegler from the Rhenish Slate Mountains, Germany, especially from the interval encompassing the Lower hassi to Upper rhenana zones, has provided evidence of the lack of validity of the jamieae Zone as a separate stratigraphic unit. This statement is based on the composition of the jamieae and Lower rhenana conodont associations and the absence of P. jamieae near the lower boundary of the zone in the stratotype and other sections of the Rhenish Slate Mountains, becoming more common upsection. The correlation between the Timan-Pechora conodont associations III–XI, the Standard Conodont Zonation (Ziegler and Sandberg 1990) and the Frasnian Zonation (Klapper 1989; Klapper and Kirchgasser 2016) is suggested herein. The Domanikian Regional Stage corresponds to the punctata–Late hassi zones of the Standard Conodont Zonation and to Frasnian Zones 5–10. The boundaries of Frasnian Zones 8–9 need to be further specified in South Timan. The correlation between the Standard Conodont Zonation and the Frasnian Zonation of Klapper is elaborated.",

The aim of the model research was to predict both the hydrochemical reactions of water injected into wells for its disposal and the hydrogeochemical processes in the reservoir formation. The purpose of hydrogeochemical modeling of the hydrocarbon formation was also to determine the potential of formation waters, injection waters, and their mixtures to precipitate and form mineral sediments, and to determine the corrosion risk to the well. In order to evaluate saturation indices and corrosion ratios, the geochemical programs PHREEQC and DownHole SAT were used. The results of hydrogeochemical modeling indicate the possible occurrence of clogging in the well and the near-well zone caused mainly by the precipitation of iron compounds (iron hydroxide Fe(OH)3 and siderite FeCO3) from the formation water due to the presence of high pressures and temperatures (HPHT). There is also a high certainty of the precipitation of carbonate sediments (calcite CaCO3, strontianite SrCO3, magnesite MgCO3, siderite FeCO3) from the injection water within the whole range of tested pressures and temperatures. The model simulations show that temperature increase has a much greater impact on the potential for precipitation of mineral phases than pressure increase.",

The original definition of Teschenites was accompanied by uncertainties in the taxonomic and stratigraphic position of its original type species, i.e., Hoplites neocomiensiformis Uhlig, 1902. The present contribution focuses on and provides a possible taxonomic solution by establishing the new genus Tescheniceras. In Butkov Quarry, the new genus includes five species. Tescheniceras flucticulum (Thieuloy, 1977), the type species, is the most abundant. Tescheniceras callidiscum (Thieuloy, 1971), the subzonal species for the uppermost Valanginian (Thieuloy 1971b), occurs only sporadically. Because Acanthodiscus radiatus (Bruguiére, 1789), the index species for the basal Hauterivian (radiatus Zone) in the international ammonite zonation, does not occur in the locality, the basal Hauterivian is indicated by the first appearance of the genus Spitidiscus Kilian, 1910.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The peridotites from the area of Korydallos, in the Pindos ophiolitic massif, crop out as deformed slices of a rather dismembered sub-oceanic, lithospheric mantle section and are tectonically enclosed within the Avdella melange. The most sizeable block is a chromitite-bearing serpentinite showing a mesh texture. Accessory, subhedral to euhedral Cr-spinels in the serpentinite display Cr# [Cr/(Cr + Al)] values that range from 0.36 to 0.42 and Mg# [Mg/(Mg + Fe 2+ )] values that vary between 0.57 and 0.62, whereas the TiO 2 content may be up to 0.47 wt.%. The serpentinite fragment is characterized by low abundances of magmaphile elements (Al 2 O 3 : 0.66 wt.%, CaO: 0.12 wt.%, Na 2 O: 0.08 wt.%, TiO 2 : 0.007 wt.%, Sc: 4 ppm) and enrichment in compatible elements (Cr: 2780 ppm and Ni: 2110 ppm). Overall data are in accordance with derivation of the serpentinite exotic block from a dunite that was formed in the mantle region underneath a back-arc basin before tectonic incorporation in the Korydallos melange. Two compositionally different chromitite pods are recognized in the studied serpentinite fragment, a Cr-rich chromitite and a high-Al chromitite, which have been ascribed to crystallization from a single, progressively differentiating MORB/IAT melt. Although both pods are fully serpentinized only the Al-rich one shows signs of limited Cr-spinel replacement by an opaque spinel phase and clinochlore across grain boundaries and fractures. Modification of the ore-making Cr-spinel is uneven among the Al-rich chromitite specimens. Textural features such as olivine replacement by clinochlore and clinochlore disruption by serpentine indicate that Cr-spinel alteration is not apparently related to serpentinization. From the unaltered Cr-spinel cores to their reworked boundaries the Al 2 O 3 and MgO abundances decrease, being mainly compensated by FeO t and Cr 2 O 3 increases. Such compositional variations are suggestive of restricted ferrian chromite (and minor magnetite) substitution for Cr-spinel during a short-lived but relatively intense, low amphibolite facies metamorphic episode (temperature: 400-700 °C). The presence of tremolite and clinochlore in the interstitial groundmass of the high-Al chromitite and their absence from the Cr-rich chromitite matrix imply that after chromitite formation a small volume of a high temperature, post-magmatic fluid reacted with Cr-spinel, triggering its alteration.",

The phosphate substance of these concretions is of francolite-kurskite composition. Among carbonate admixtures calcite, rhodochrosite and sideroplesite were found. The problem of carbonate-apatites and the genesis of concretionary pelitic clay phosphorites are discussed. In the writer's opinion they are products of early diagenetic processes; carbon dioxide and fluorine, controlling the solubility of calcium phosphates and the physico-chemical conditions of the environment, are the most important factors in their origin. The increased concentration of fluorine is to be attributed to the acid exhalations of the Upper Cretaceous volcanism strictly contemporaneous with the formation of phosphorites. Some suggestions are also advanced regarding the probable paleogeographic changes in the axial zone of the geosyncline at that time.",

The sedimentary history of the Silurian succession of Podolia is characterised by its cyclic pattern, with shallowing-upward cyclothems. In the traditional interpretation, the occurrence of stromatoporoid beds within each cyclothem marks the deepest (or most open-marine) sedimentary environment within the cycle. According to the results of recent studies, their occurrence is connected rather with a relatively shallow-water environment and with high energy phenomena. A substantial reinterpretation of the main sedimentary processes governing the deposition and facies distribution on the shelf is presented. Particularly, there are recognised and described high-energy sedimentary events repeatedly punctuating the generally calm sedimentation that prevailed in the lagoonal settings, some of which are interpreted as tsunami induced. Further perspectives for studies on the Silurian successions of Podolia are also discussed. The main problem is the precise correlation of particular sections that are scattered over vast distances and developed in similar facies associations.",

    "abstract": "Peculiar polygonal markings on·the meadows in the Wieprz river valley During the author's geological and geomorphological investigations in the area of the Lublin Upland a regular polygonal (penta- and hexagonal) network of crackings was found by him on the meadows of the valley of the Wieprz and its tributary Stawek, in the neighbourhood of the village Zakrzew. The crackings are of 1,5-3 m in diameter (s. fig. 1, 2). They are very similar to the polygonal network found in the arctic tundra (e. g. to the fissure polygons in Greenland and Spitsbergen). These crackings were formed in the following circumstances. The meadow, on which they appear; was a pond until 1944. After the dam was destroyed during the last year of the war, the water flowed down rapidly and the surface of the bottom, coated with a thick silt layer, dried up very quickly and formed the network·referred to. This phenomenon proves that the markings formed through drying·are similar to those which are produced by the action of frost. The main difference consists in their surfaces: the forms of drying action have a flat and even surface, those of the action of frost have a convex surface. The author also describes another type of meadow markings in the neighbourhood of Ciechanki on the river Wieprz. The meadow is filled with mounds 20-40 cm high, often bell-shaped (fig. 3) . They recall the bugry of the Russian tundra, the palsen of the finish tundra and the thufurs of Iceland, but, according to the author, they were pressed out by the pasturing cattle. Among the forms of the meadow microrelief in Poland discussed, the author quoted the following: 1) mounds arising from the volume alternation of green turf mass by frost action (after Brandt and Lozi:6ski), 2) green turf mounds which were formed in connection with turf lenses in the area of highland peat-bogs, 3) cattle mounds, mentioned above, 4) mole-hills raised on the dry meadows, which, when covered by vegetation, are very similar to the first group.",

    "abstract": "Taxonomic studies of Cretaceous inoceramid bivalves are confounded by high levels of intraspecific morphological variation within the group. Such variation is illustrated here using Cremnoceramus bicorrugatus  s. s. (MARWICK, 1926) from the lower Coniacian of New Zealand. This taxon displays a remarkable range of intraspecific variation that is the sum of three major components: 1) a basic set of ontogenetic transformations between the juvenile, immature and adult stages; 2) intra-populational variation in the relative timing or rate of developmental events; and 3) intra-populational variation in the rate of absolute growth. The first of these components was largely genetically determined, whereas the other two were probably influenced by extrinsic environmental factors. Taxonomic interpretation of C.  bicorrugatus s. s. is not possible without some understanding of both the basic ontogenetic plan and developmental variations within that plan. Interpretation is facilitated by the profound and step-wise nature of the ontogenetic transformations. In many other inoceramids, however, ontogenetic transformations are more subtle but may be subject to equally significant intraspecific developmental variations. Therefore, inoceramid taxonomists should describe not only total population variation, but also should document ontogenetic development in any species. In this way it is possible to identify basic ontogenetic plans, constrain likely limits to intraspecific variation, and distinguish intraspecific from interspecific morphological variation.",

The basic assumption about the evolution, required by ecostratigraphy, is that either there is the process of community evolution, or co-evolution among large groups of species plays an important role in the biotic evolution. There is no community evolution in the nature because ecological communities themselves are merely an epiphenomenon of species evolution. Empirical data show that co-evolution is insignificant among planktic organisms; but it is important among shallow-marine benthic organisms. This observation sets the Iimits of applicability to the ecostratigraphic time-scale which appears adequate to that part of the fossil record that represents shallow-marine realm, but not to the record of pelagic realm.",

    "abstract": "Formation of local structural forms in the Polish part of the Peri-baltic syneclise in the background of the geological development of the whole unit The area of the present investigations covers the south-western part of the peribaltic syneclise. The writer's research studies confirm the previously recognized block character in the structural style of the peribaltic syneclise as suggested by the presence of numerous deep dislocations. This is applicable most particularly to the Old Paleozoic structural stage. The peribaltic depression was marked already in the Cambrian. Its most readily distinguishable formation occurred in the Devonian-Carboniferous. The axis of the sedimentary basin in the Cambrian constituted by the greatest thickness of sediments lay along the line from Kościerzyna to Wilno (Vilnius). Advancing subsequently northwards during the Paleozoic sedimentation it followed the southern peripheries · of Latvia during the· Carboniferous. During the Permian sedimentation it is gradually displaced southwards as far as the northern slope of the Mazury-Suwalki elevation. This is most clearly suggested in comparing the thickness of sediments in Zechstein cyclothems and the occurrence range of the saliniferous horizons. Comparatively the maximum gradient of changes in the facies and thickness of Old Paleozoic sediments occurs along the line of the Lower Vistula course and may be connected with the existence of a regional southern dislocation zone with a considerable downthrow of the western limb. The oldest Cambrian members, the so-called Zarnowiec series occur to the west of that line. Here the Cambrian deposits are more deep-water in character as is shown by the markedly greater mudstone content when compared with that in the area east of the Vistula. Similarly it is in this zone that occurs the Ordovician boundary of the carbonaceous facies, it being thicker in the east and a thinner mudstone one in the west The sedimentation of Paleozoic rocks was broken up by intermittent periods of the intensity of uplifting block movements in the substratum, the area of the blocks showing the maximum uplifting being also at that time subjected to erosion. This process is fairly well detectable at the turn of the Lower and Middle Cambrian. In order to determine its range the Cambrian has been cut up into smaller complexes on geophysical prospecting diagrams. Their correlation has shown the absence of the youngest Cm 1 C member out of those· differentiated in the Lower Cambrian in the neighbourhood of Lidzbark Warminski and Barciany. Following the Lower Cambrian these regions had been somewhat more uplifted the overlying sediments being partly outwashed. This process is still more evident after the Middle Cambrian, where the dismembered into blocks syneclise areas are quite distinct. The further east and the nearer to the Mazury-Suwalki elevation the deeper the erosional activities. The longest discontinuity connected with strongest erosion is Post-Silurian. At that time the erosional processes in the Polish part of the Platform area continued with varying intensity until the Permian. The bearing of the differentiated structure of the crystalline substratum is observable in the development of the sedimentary cover within the area under consideration. Namely, facing the general tendencies towards the uplifting of the platform, the oldest and simultaneously the lightest of the granite complexes, that is those of Mazowsze, Dobrzyn and Kaszuby, were subjected to the greatest uplifting and the sediments covering them to the deepest erosion. Hence, in the marginal area of the platform, above the granite massifs, there is a lack of deposits of the Podlasie stage (Silurian) in spite of their observed presence farther NE within the axial zone of the peribaltic syneclise. The development of positive local structural forms in the sedimentary complex started during the initial period of sedimentation. In the Cambrian this was expressed mainly in the decreasing thickenss of particular stratigraphic members in elevated areas. This resulted, on the one hand, from the slower tempo of sedimentation in· elevated areas, or even its complete absence at certain periods, like for example in the Zareby region, while on the other hand it is due to the more elevated structural elements being eroded during the sedimentary breaks, like for instance in the region of Barciany or Zareby. There are also differences in the lithological development of Cambrian sediments on elevated areas and outside of them, these are, however, less readily explained. In the Lower Silurian, the more important local forms of elevation, such as the ridge of Zareby or that of Olsztyn, showed an increase in the thickness of nodular limestones. Mudstone sedimentation dominated to the west in deeper zones. Hence, undoubtedly, the tectonic activity of the substratum favoured facial differentiation. The principal phases of the formation of local tectonic forms are referable to the end of the Silurian (the ardenne phase). This being probably connected with the folding of the Caledonian Chain in the western forefield of the Platform, also to the turn of the. Lower and Upper Carboniferous (the Sudetic phase). The positive structural forms developed during the older Paleozoic were expressed in an increase in the thickness of the Zechstein anhydrites, mainly the anhydrite of the Lower Z 1 cyclothem.",

New collections of additional specimens and associated taxa from other erratic boulders in the type locality have confirmed observations (Tozer 1971; Krystyn 1978) that the age of the original boulder was misinterpreted, and have shown that “ Trachyphyllites ” is actually of Early Jurassic (Hettangian) age. An unpublished generic revision of the entire superfamily Lytoceratoidea by Hoffmann (2009) has shown that “ Trachyphyllites costatum Arthaber” is a junior synonym of Analytoceras hermanni (Gumbel, 1861), a taxon thought by Wahner (1894) to be a subjective synonym of Analytoceras articulatum (J. Sowerby, 1831) We reestablish the species Analytoceras hermanni (Gumbel, 1861) for Analytoceras articulatum “Type B” (Wahner 1894), which is characterized by a wide umbilicus and a small whorl expansion rate. The morphologically distinct “TypeA” (Wahner 1894) corresponds to the type species of Analytoceras, A. articulatum (J. Sowerby, 1831). A revised phylogeny of the Early Jurassic lytoceratids is presented.",

The general evolution of the ammonite record during the studied time interval, with a recognizable decrease during the Transversarium-Bifurcatus Zones, can be biased by the better development and better outcrop conditions of the Bimammatum Zone in the area. The other studied chronozones are comparatively worse known and correspond to a comparatively larger development of buildups and/or intervals of tectonic instability in the Algarve, especially during the Transversarium-Bifurcatus Zones. In the recorded ammonite assemblages, the lytoceratids are always accidental elements with less than 2% representation, and their record decreases significantly during the Bimammatum Zone. The general trend of decreasing in the phylloceratids is coherent with the reduction of the ecospace inherent to the sequential evolution proposed by M ARQUES & al. (1991). On the contrary, the evolution of the phylloceratids does not offer a clear interpretation according to the sequential scheme recently proposed by P ONSOT & V AIL (1991). Significant deviations in the record of some ammonite groups have been recognized in comparatively high-energy deposits and are related to taphonomic effects. In one case it has been interpreted as an evidence of the heterogeneity of ecologic parameters whose recognition is however difficult through facies analysis.

    "abstract": "LITHOSTRATIGRAPHY OF UPPER JURASSIC DEPOSITS IN THE LUBLIN-RADOM AREA SUMMARY The present paper offers a characteristic of lithological formations occurring in the Lublin-Radom area, prepared according to the Code of the Polish stratigraphic classification, terminology and nomenclature. The author has distinguished eleven formations (fm); their stratotypes are based on boreholes with completely (in 100%) cored Jurassic deposits. The established formations were referred to the local biostratigraphy (Niemczycka 1976) and correlated with the accepted ammonite subdivisions (Table 1).  THE KRAŚNIK FORMATION Deposits of this formation are represented by sponge organodetritic limestones. In their lower parts there occur dolomites in the form of euhedral crystals, whereas their upper layers are distinctly silicated and reveal no doIomitization. The following ammonites can be found in the lower part of the Kraśnik Fm.: Campylites cf. delmontanum Opp., Euaspidoceras perarmatum (Sow.) and Taramelliceras cf. bukowskii Siem.; this allows to estimate its age as Lower Oxfordian – Cardioceras excavatum and Cardioceras bukowskii Zones (Table 1). The higher part of the formation contains a faunal assemblage of brachiopods and foraminifers, which suggests its Middle Oxfordian age (Table 1). THE JASIENIEC FORMATION The formation is composed of organodetric limestones containing mainly trochites. There occur aIso scarcely remnants of pelecypods, brachiopod end gastropods, as well as echinus spicules and algae. The recognized assemblge of brachiopods and the microfauna (Table 1) points to the Middle Oxfordian age of the formation. THE BEŁŻYCE FORMATION Within this formation there occur two main rock types, that is, white pelite Iimestones and grainy limestones, as well as several mixed types. Gastropods and a certain foraminifer assemblage (Table 1) are representatives of the fauna. The age of the formation cannot be exactly determined; most probably it may be assigned as Upper Oxfordian. THE GŁOWACZOW FORMATION The main rocks of that formation are pelite marls and marly limestones; partly organodetritic coarse-grained and dolomitic in some places. In the whole profile there occur hard grounds and connected with them intraformational conglomerates and calcareous breccias. The fauna is represented by different Mytilus species and a characteristic microfaunal assemblage (Table 1). Similar deposits containing an ammonite fauna are know from the Mesozoic surrounding of the Świetokrzyskie Mts and the Polish Lowland. By analogy the age of the Glowaczow Fm. may be estimated as Kimmeridgian. THE URZĘDOW FORMATION The formation is represented by dolomites, marly dolomites, limy dolomites and; secondarily, by grey dolomitic Iimestones. Average CaMg(CO 3 ) 2 contens in deposits vary from 76 to 99.8%. Quartz and glaukonite grains occur but in inconsiderable amounts. The fauna is represented mainly y pelecypods; brachiopods and gastropods are less frequent. Its assemblage is similar to that of the Glowaczow Fm. A characteristic microfaunal assemblage is, however different (Table 1). The age of the formation to be Upper Kimmeridgian (Niemczycka 1976). THE ZAKRZEW FORMATION (fm) It is represented by sandy dolomites with detritus of the carbonized and pyritized flora, scrarps of coal and grey-blue cherts. Those deposits are indistinctly horizontally laminated with carbon material in which detritic quartz contents reach 30% layers of brown sandstones with carbonized flora occur scarcely. In their lower parts remants of Echinodermata may be occasionally observed. In particular boreholes deposits of this formation are somewhat different in a degree of dolomitization and in sand quantities. No fauna has been documented from deposits of the discussed formation. However, sedimentological and paleontological considerations allow to estimate ita age as Lower and Middle Oxfordian. THE BASZNIA FORMATlON It is represented by glauconite-chlorite marls and marly limestones with layers of mudstones and siltstones and also of calcareous conglomerates. Anhydrite inclusions and detritus of dolomitic rocks occur among them. There was documented the presence of Pseudocyclammina jaccardi (Schrodt.) foraminifers and Vernoniella sequana Oertli ostracods. On the basis of the microfauna and the facial-paleogeographic analysis the deposits of the Basznia Formation may be determined as Upper Oxfordian. THE JARCZOW FORMATION Its main deposits are nodular dark-grey siltstones and non-calcareous mudstones with abundant carbonized flora, rizoidal structures and detritus of quartz, gneisses and quartz porphyrites. No fauna has been found in those deposits. Their age may be determined from their position in the lithological profile, between the Kraśnik and the Ruda Lubycka formations, as Upper Oxfordian (Table 1, Fig. 1). THE TYSZOWCE FORMATION It is represented by characteristic, veriegated, cherry-green-grey sandstones, mudstones and siltstones, with intercalations of sandy-mudy conglomerates and dolomitic marls. The deposits show a cyclic sedimentation. In the dolomitic doeposits Ammodiscus sp. was found. There is no sufficient faunistic documentation for deposits of the Tyszowce Formation. Their age has been determination as Upper Oxfordian. THE RUDA LUBYCKA FORMATION It is represented by dolomites with anhydrite alternations. Mudstones and dolomitic marls occur less frequently, and limestones and dolomitic limestones are rare. Stratigraphically important fauna has not been found in the stratotype profile as well as in the adjacent boreholes. Only few remnants of gastropods or pelecypods and single Ammodiscus sp. foraminifers were recorded in calcareous fragments of the profile. THE BABCZYN FORMATION In the stratotype profile it is represented by white or beige grainy limestones, oolithic-onkolithic-nodular lumpy or pelite limestones. Algal limestones with corbules are fairIy abundant. Gastropods end ostracods present in deposits of this formation suggest their Portlandian age.",

    "abstract": "The development of the concept of structural trend and its use both in the study of Precambrian shields and intercontinental Precambrian correlations are examined. On the basis of examples from Scotland, Fennoscandia, East Africa, India and Western Australia it is shown that the concept has been useful where applied to regions in which a single feature, such as lithological layering, foliation, upright folds or major fault lineaments, dominates the structural regime. However, is unqualified use in regions of polyphase deformed rocks has often been misleading and resulted in erroneous correlations. This is particularly the case where the nature and origin of the particular trend is unspecified, where differences between cover tectonics and tectonic overprinting of basement are not demonstrated, or where the relationship of trend to a polyphase deformational sequence is not determined. Repeated reference in the literature to trends which are ill-defined or not representative of a structural regime often leads to their unquestioned acceptance. With the framework of Precambrian shields being important in atempts to reconstruct previous configurations of continental masses, assessment is necessary of any structural trend used as a basis of correlation.",

The current opinion is that the Holy Cross dislocation separates the Łysogora and the Kielce region which differ in their palaeogeographic and palaeotectonic development. The present writer believes that a similar role is played by the Zbrza dislocation in relation to the region of Kielce and to the newly differentiated region of Jedrzejow whose southern boundary is limited by the Ksiąz Wielki dislocation. The three regions here mentioned are characterized by the gradually S-N decreasing thickness of deposits, both in the Palaeozoic and the Mesozoic.",

The fault network in the analysed area is at least Late Variscan in age and has been probably rejuvenated in several phases of the Alpine cycle. The faults bordering the Wolsztyn ridge and the Poznan-Oleśnica dislocation zone are directly associated with the fractures localised in the Moho surface. Tectonic structures of NW-SE directions show association with the Middle Polish aulacogene.

This is particularly important in the case of interoperability of different systems, for example a system simulating hydrogeological processes and the hydrogeological geospatial database system. The research tools of geomatics allow the construction of data models of such systems conformable to these standards. However, in the definition of such a model several ontological and semantic inconsistencies arise. Two examples are taken for consideration: hydrogeological feature and coverage. These terms are frequently applied improperly to cases of geospatial information. Definition of these terms in a hydrogeological context will prevent ambiguities in formulating models of hydrogeological data.",

The taxonomy of the roveacrind microcrinoids is revised by the senior author, and a new genus, Peckicrinus, is described, with the type species Poecilocrinus porcatus (Peck, 1943). New species include Roveacrinus proteus sp. nov., R. morganae sp. nov., Plotocrinus reidi sp. nov., Pl. molineuxae sp. nov., Pl. rashallae sp. nov. and Styracocrinus thomasae sp. nov. New formae of the genus Poecilocrinus Peck, 1943 are Po. dispandus forma floriformis nov. and Po. dispandus forma discus nov. New formae of the genus Euglyphocrinus Gale, 2019 are E. pyramidalis (Peck, 1943) forma pyramidalis nov., E. pyramidalis forma radix nov. and E. pyramidalis forma pentaspinus nov. The genera Plotocrinus Peck, 1943, Poecilocrinus and Roveacrinus Douglas, 1908 form a branching phylogenetic lineage extending from the middle Albian into the lower Cenomanian, showing rapid speciation, upon which a new roveacrinid zonation for the middle and upper Albian (zones AlR1–12) is largely based. Outside Texas and Oklahoma, zone AlR1 is recorded from the lower middle Albian of Aube (southeastern France) and zones AlR11–CeR2 from the Agadir Basin in Morocco and central Tunisia. It is likely that the zonation will be widely applicable to the middle and upper Albian and lower Cenomanian successions of many other regions.",

    "abstract": "The known occurrence of corals distinguished here in the new Family Krynkaphyllidae varies at the subfamily level. Those of the Subfamily Krynkaphyllinae subfam. nov. are so far almost unknown from outside of the Donets Basin. In contrast, those of the Subfamily Colligophyllinae subfam. nov. are common, possibly ranging from the lower Viséan Dorlodotia Salée, 1920, a potential ancestor of the family, to the Artinskian Lytvophyllum tschernovi Soshkina, 1925. They bear different generic names, but were all originally described as fasciculate colonial. A detailed study of Lytvophyllum dobroljubovae Vassilyuk, 1960, the type species of Colligophyllum gen. nov., challenges that recognition in that at least some of those taxa are solitary and gregarious and/or protocolonial. As such, solitary, protocolonial and, probably, fasciculate colonial habits are accepted in the Colligophyllinae subfam. nov., whereas the Krynkaphyllinae subfam. nov. contains only solitary taxa. The resemblance to the Suborder Lonsdaleiina Spasskiy, 1974 led to the analysis of families included in that suborder by Hill (1981) in the context of their relationship, or homeomorphy, to Krynkaphyllidae fam. nov. This question primarily concerns the Family Petalaxidae Fomichev, 1953; a relationship with the Family Geyerophyllidae Minato, 1955, is more distant, if one exists. The distinct, parallel stratigraphic successions of taxa within two subfamilies of the Krynkaphyllidae fam. nov. document their probably common roots and early divergence. However, a lack of robust data precludes an interpretation or treatment of those successions as phylogenetic. The absence of key stratigraphic and morphologic data meant that eastern Asiatic taxa have not been considered in these successions; however, morphological similarities allow for their tentative inclusion within the Krynkaphyllidae fam. nov. The following new taxa are introduced: Krynkaphyllidae fam. nov., Krynkaphyllinae subfam. nov., Colligophyllinae subfam. nov., Krynkaphyllum gen. nov., Colligophyllum gen. nov., Protokionophyllum feninoense sp. nov., Krynkaphyllum multiplexum sp. nov., Krynkaphyllum validum sp. nov., and three species of Protokionophyllum Vassilyuk in Aizenverg et al., 1983 left in open nomenclature.",

The results confirm the regional variability of the erratic material in the Sanian 2 tills and point to the long-term development of fluvioglacial sands cover documenting cold climate conditions. They also evidence that the western part of the Holy Cross Mountains was the area where two oppositely directed ice sheet lobes (Radoszyce and Sandomierz) advanced during the Sanian 2 Glaciation and that deglaciation of the area took place in two stages. Huge quantities of meltwater released at that time contributed to the intensification of earlier initiated karst phenomena, as well as filling of the existing caves by fluvioglacial sands.",

The lower part of the Aït Lamine Formation yields ammonites indicative of the Pervinquieria (Subschloenbachia) rostrata and P. (S.) perinflata ammonite zones, and the Thalmanninella appenninica planktonic foraminiferan Zone. The base of the Cenomanian is identified at 42.2 m above the base of the Aït Lamine Formation, based on the lowest occurrence of the planktonic foraminiferan Thalmanninella globotruncanoides Sigal, 1948. Lower Cenomanian ammonites of the Graysonites adkinsi Zone enter 3 m higher in the succession. Microcrinoid zones AlR11 and AlR12 are identified in the Upper Albian, and the base of the CeR1 Zone coincides with the lowest occurrence of Cenomanian ammonites. The ammonite and microcrinoid occurrences and detailed distributions are very similar to those found in north central Texas, which, in the Cenomanian, was 5,300 km to the west. The new records suggest that the G. adkinsi Zone is equivalent to the uppermost (Lower Cenomanian) part of the Pleurohoplites briacensis Zone of the Global Stratotype Section for the base of the Cenomanian stage. An hiatus, of global extent, immediately underlies the base of the G. adkinsi Zone and is represented in the Agadir Basin by an erosion surface containing bored and encrusted hiatus concretions.",

The second unit occurs only locally and its age is limited to the Maastrichtian, to the Rzehakina inclusa Zone. The third unit is composed of thick-bedded sandstones that in some parts may form more than the half of the total thickness of the formation. It is Late Maastrichtian–Danian in age and is placed in the upper part of the Rzehakina inclusa Zone and the lower part of the Rzehakina fissistomata Zone.

This massif was the classic area of F. Rabowski's geologic investigations. The structuraI intricacies of the high-tatric Czerone Wierchy fold, sheared by the crystalline core of the Giewont fold preserved on the Czerwone Wierchy peaks, have been described by that author. The most comprehensive report of the geology of this area was discovered among F. Rabowski's manuscripts (1959) and maps (Rabowski 1955, Michalik 1959). Z. Kotanski's stratigraphic investigations (1955a, b, 1956, 1959) permitted the distinction of new lithologo-stratigraphic horizons in the high-taric Triassic. His data supplied a basis for the differentiation of a number of new tectonic units, such as the parautochtonous Stoly fold, also the southern (Ździary) and northern (Organy) units of the Czerwone Wierchy fold. Both these units have a synclinal structure and their synclinal bends curve southward (Kotanski 1961).",

He gives an outline of the regional subdivision of these mountains, based on effects of the younger crustal movements, characterized by a great vertical component. These great regional units are mostly heterogenous in character. As a rule, however, they are composed of fragments of different homogenous structures, belonging often to some different series of some different orogenic periods. The stratigraphy of the metamorphic series being in the Sudetes rather uncertain and not yet adequately clarified, the tectonic development of the older structures is often obscure in essential details, or even controversial. The writer gives also a brief and preliminary description and interpretation of his microstructural field studies in the Kaczawa Mts. (Bober-Katzbachgebirge), and in the Śnieznik Group (Glatzer-Schneegebirge), as far as these studies concern the lineation phenomena in the metamorphic series",

Hence, even in the lack of fossils, the Anisian and Campilian stages may be distinguished. A very distinct angular unconformity occurs here between the Triassic and the Lias. Particularly intense old-Cimmerian movements preceded the deposition of Liassic sediments in the Pieniny Klippen BeIt. During later nappe movements the angular un conformity between Triassic and Liassic rocks were an important factor in the shearing of the Lias from the folded substratum. The Haligowce series displays marked analogies with the northernmost high-tatric series (Osobita and Bobrowiecka series), together with which it is referable to the Podhale series. The latter has some features that are either inter-mediate or in common with traits of both the high-tatric series and the Pieniny Klippen Belt series.",

In samples from the Upper Badenian of Western Ukraine we found two clusters of Diodora specimens, showing a similarity with these species, but a review of shell diagnostic characters using a statistical approach has revealed their clear conchological separateness. The first species from Varovtsi and Horodok is attributed herein to D. nodosa (Eichwald, 1830), whereas the second species from Maksymivka is described as a new species, D. stalennuyi sp. nov. We consider that these molluscs inhabited the Polish-Ukrainian marginal part of the Late Badenian Basin.

The Formation is well exposed in cliffs in east Devon and the Isle of Purbeck, but is poorly exposed inland. It comprises sandstones and calcarenites with laterally and stratigraphically variable amounts of carbonate cement, glauconite and chert. The sedimentology and palaeontology indicate deposition in marginal marine-shelf environments that were at times subject to strong tidal and wave-generated currents. The formation of the Upper Greensand successions in the region was influenced by  penecontem-poraneous movements on major fault zones, some of which are sited over E-W trending Variscan thrusts in the basement rocks and, locally, on minor faults.  Comparison of the principal sedimentary breaks in the succession with the sequence boundaries derived from world-wide sea-level curves suggests that local tectonic events mask the effects of any eustatic changes in sea level. The preserved fauna is unevenly distributed, both laterally and stratigraphically. Bivalves, gastropods and echinoids are common at some horizons but are not age-diagnostic. Ammonites are common at a few stratigraphically narrowly defined horizons, but are rare or absent throughout most of the succession. As a result, the age of parts of the succession is still poorly known.",

Altholepis salopensis sp. nov. is based on small polyodontode scales with typically three to eight high odontodes; the scale form was previously considered to belong to acanthodian “ Nostolepis ”  robusta (Brotzen, 1934). The structure of other scales formerly assigned to “ Nostolepis ” robusta has led us to erect a new genus  Jolepis for this scale form, which differs from Altholepis in lacking an ordered layout of odontodes . Jolepis robusta  (Brotzen, 1934), originally (and possibly still) considered to be an acanthodian, is also known from the Baltic countries, Russia, and northern Germany (ex erratic limestones). Scales of acanthodian Parexus recurvus Agassiz, 1845, and/or possibly from the stem chondrichthyan Seretolepis elegans Karatajūtė-Talimaa, 1968 (scales of these two taxa are barely distinguishable), and of stem chondrichthyan Polymerolepis whitei Karatajūtė-Talimaa, 1968 are also present.

Fossil fish and agnathans were collected in 1978 and 1979 from the outcrops of the Matusevich, Vavilov and Malyutka formations along the Matusevich, Bol'shaya and other rivers. The fish fauna consists of representatives of the main taxonomic groups of Devonian vertebrates, i.e., psammosteid heterostracans, placoderms, acanthodians, chondrichthyans, porolepiform and osteolepiform rhipidistians, and dipnoans. Summnarising all avaiable data on the distribution of vertebrates, it is possible to suggest a very late Givetian - Frasnian age for the Matusevich Formation, a late Frasnian age of the Vavilof Formation, and a latest Frasnian - early Famennian age for the Malyutka Formation of Severnaya Zemlya.",

Distribution of sectioned true grains is more similar to the sieve-distribution of apparent grains. Based on this, a new method of thin-section - conversion of granulometric data has been elaborated, to recognize the distribution of true grains from the distribution of apparent grains. The transformed distribution depicted by cumulative curve allows for the evaluation of the textural parameters, with the values approximately equal to sieve parameters obtained by the graphic method. The new method has a universal character, and it may also be used for indurated deposits with various grain sizes. A suggestion of modified manner of measurements of elongated apparent grains in a thin-section is given. For practical use of the newly proposed method the algorithm of procedure leading from the thin-section measurements to the sieve textural parameters evaluation is presented.",

    "abstract": "Cancrinite and analcime were synthesized in the two hydrothermal systems: acid plagioclase – Na 2 CO 3 – H 2 O and basic plagioclase – Na 2 CO 3 – H 2 O under widely varying temperatures and salt concentrations in the solution. The IR, 1 H MAS NMR, DTG/TG analyses were carried out to determine water position in the crystals. Additionally IR spectra were recorded during subsequent dehydration and rehydration processes. The results of the investigations indicate that the water environment in both minerals is sensitive to the conditions of crystal formation. Crystallization temperature is the most important factor influencing water position. The water sites in the analcime and cancrinite crystals depend on structure modifications. Variations of the structure result from different chemical composition of the source material, structure of the substrates and the salt concentration in the solution. The structures formed under lower temperatures incorporate more water than those formed at high temperatures. In the cancrinite and analcime two main types of water, H 2 O(I) and H 2 O(II), appear. Other OHm groups can also be recognized. The position of water H 2 O(II) is better defined than that of H 2 O(I). H 2 O (II) is the most sensitive indicator of thermal conditions of the formation of cancrinite as well as analcime. The amount of H 2 O(II) equals that of H 2 O(I) in the products of low temperature (300°C) syntheses. In crystals synthesized at high temperature (550°C) the presence of H 2 O(II) is very limited.",

    "abstract": "The pelecypod species Sphenia anatina (Basterot) from the shore facies of the Korytnica basin (Middle Miocene; Holy Cross Mountains, Central Poland) was adopted to live in more or less empty borings produced by diverse pelecypods ( Gastrochaena , Aspidopholas , Jouannetia , Lithophaga ). In result of the tendency to fill the space of the boring tightly to protect the body against the rocking and shaking prevailing all over the biotope, the shell of particular individuals acquired the shape of the occupied boring. In consequence, the four groups of the shell shape may be distinguished, all of them almost strictly counterparting the shape of the primary occupants. These groups, the ecotypes (gastrochaenicola, aspidophoiicoia, jouanneticoia, lithophagicola, respectively), although of no taxonomic importance, may be well indicated in the hitherto described specimens from the Neogene deposits of Europe. The revision of taxonomy of all those specimens shows that presumably only one species of the genus Sphenia Turton lived in the Neogene of Europe, viz. Sphenia anatina (Basterot). and all the shape-deviated and variously called specimens are the ecological variants of this very species. Finally, this extinct species is compared, in the terms of its shell characteristics. taxonomy, and ecological requirements, with the present-day species Sphenia binghami Turton which, if taxonomically really separate, has developed directly from its Neogene ancestor, Sphenia anatina (Basterot).",

The three regions thus distinguished differ in the development, of the Zechstein deposits, the geology of the substratum and the further structural development. They are a fragment of the East European Platform the marginal zone of this Platform and a fragment of the Middle European Basin. The sedimentary process in the particular lithostratigraphic horizons has been described and their regional differentiation has been stressed. A new interpretation is suggested of the origin of the recessive evaporates” of the boundary of the Leine and Aller cycles and the formation of carbonate rocks among anhydrites. Changes in the shoreline and in the depth of the basin occurring in the successive cycles are reported. The usefulness of conodonts and the polychaete jaw apparatuses for stratigraphic correlations of the Permian is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Many granitic intrusions display evidence of magma mixing processes. The interaction of melts of contrasting composition may play a significant role during their generation and evolution. The Strzegom-Sobótka massif (SSM), located in the Sudetes (SW Poland) in the north-eastern part of the Bohemian Massif of the Central European Variscides, exhibits significant evidence of magma mingling on the macro- and micro-scales. The massif is a composite intrusion, with four main varieties: hornblende-biotite granite (with negligible amount of hornblende) and biotite granite in the western part, and two-mica granite and biotite granodiorite in the eastern part. Field evidence for magma mingling is easily found in the biotite granodiorite, where dark enclaves with tonalitic composition occur. Enclaves range from a few centimeters to half a meter in size, and from ellipsoidal to rounded in shape. They occur individually and in homogeneous swarms. The mixing textures in the enclaves include fine-grained texture, acicular apatite, rounded plagioclase xenocrysts, ocellar quartz and blade-shaped biotite. The most interesting feature of the enclaves is the presence of numerous monazite-(Ce) crystals, including unusually large crystals (up to 500 μm) which have grown close to the boundaries between granodiorite and enclaves. The crystallization of numerous monazite grains may therefore be another, previously undescribed, form of textural evidence for interaction between two contrasting magmas. The textures and microtextures may indicate that the enclaves represent globules of hybrid magma formed by mingling with a more felsic host melt. Chemical dating of the monazite yielded an age of 297±11 Ma.",

    "abstract": "Charnockites – i.e., orthopyroxene-bearing felsic rocks – were formed in a deep-seated dry environment, either under plutonic or high-grade metamorphic conditions. Most charnockites known from the crystalline basement of Poland appear to be of Mesoproterozoic age (1.50–1.54 Ga), cogenetic with the Suwalki Anorthosite Massif, and associated with mangerite and granite members forming the AMCG suite of the Mazury Complex. Genetically distinct rocks, characterised by the presence of anhydrous minerals, e.g., orthopyroxene and garnet, were also recognised along 592 m of the Łanowicze PIG-1 borehole section, within the AMCG suite. U-Pb geochronology by sensitive high resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) was used to date the complexly zoned zircons. The ages of crystallisation of the charnockite protoliths from various depths at 1837 ± 7, 1850 ± 9, 1842 ± 6, and 1881 ± 16 Ma makes these rocks the oldest dated crust within this part of the Polish basement. The Łanowicze PIG-1 borehole section bears components from neighbouring tectonic domains known from Lithuania: the West and Middle Lithuanian (WL/MLD) domains considered as a continental margin at 1.84–1.86 Ga and the fragmented Latvia-East Lithuania (LEL) domain, where the oldest continental crust was generated at c. 1.89–1.87 Ga. The metamorphic zircon overgrowths document a high-grade event at 1.79 Ga and then constrained at 1.5 Ga. Dating of pre-Mesoproterozoic crust cryptic within the AMCG Mazury Complex provides valuable information on the nature of the pre-existing blocks formed during the long lasting Svecofennian orogeny.",

    "abstract": "The Neogene basaltoid intrusions found in the S-7 borehole in the Sumina area (USCB) caused transformations of the adjacent Carboniferous rocks. The mineral and chemical compositions of the basaltoides are similar to those of the Lower Silesian basaltoides. The transformations that took place in the vicinity of the intrusion were manifested in the formation of natural coke, the secondary mineralization of these rocks (calcite, chlorite, zeolites and barite) and in the specific distribution of rare earths (REY). Among REY, the light elements (LREY) had the highest share, while the heavy elements (HREY) had the lowest share. Regardless of the lithological type of the analyzed rock, with increasing distance from the intrusion, the percentage of MREY and HREY elements increases at the expense of the light elements LREY. All analyzed distribution patterns of the REYs are characterized by the occurrence of anomalies, which often show a significant correlation with the distance of sampling points from the basaltoid intrusion. The specific distribution of REYs in the vicinity of the intrusion of igneous rocks is an indication of the impact of hydrothermal solutions associated with the presence of basaltoides on the rocks closest to them located at a temperature of over 200°C.",

The interval studied covers the contact between the Raptawicka Turnia Limestone (RTL) Fm. and the Wysoka Turnia Limestone (WTL) Fm. Their sedimentary sequence is composed of micrites, pseudonodular limestones, cyanoid packstones, lithoclastic packstone and encrinites. A precise correlation with the previously published Mały Giewont section is ensured by biostratigraphy, rock magnetic and GRS logs. The methodology adopted has enabled the recognition of two stratigraphic discontinuities, approximated here as corresponding to the latest Tithonian–early (late?) Berriasian and the early Valanginian. The hiatuses are evidenced by biostratigraphic data and the microfacies succession as well as by perturbations in isotopic compositions and rock magnetic logs; they are thought to result from a conjunction of tectonic activity and eustatic changes. A modified lithostratigraphic scheme for the Giewont and the Osobita High-Tatric successions is proposed. The top of the RTL Fm. falls in the upper Tithonian, where cyanoid packstones disappear. At the base of the WTL Fm. a new Giewont Member is defined as consisting of a basal lithoclastic packstone and following encrinites.",

The XPS analysis showed the presence of Al in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination while the K2p line indicated the possibility of K+ substitution by other cations in interlayer sites. Mössbauer spectroscopy provided information about crystal chemistry with respect to the local electronic and geometric environment around the Fe atom and to distortions of the polyhedra. It turned out that iron was located mostly in the cis-octahedra position wherein about 75% of iron appeared in the form of Fe 3+. The most preferred cation combinations around Fe corresponded to 3Fe 3+ ions and MgFe 2+Fe 3+/2MgFe 3+. Raman spectroscopy illustrated aluminium substitution in silicon and iron positions wherein the concentration of the aluminium determined the degree of structural distortion within the layered system. These isomorphic substitutions implied a typical band arrangement in the hydroxyl region, which has not been observed in celadonites so far.",

The study was focused on determining the influence of 1) copper (II) concentration on the activity of selected microorganism communities and 2) the applied electron donor on the course and evolution of mineral-forming processes under conditions favouring growth of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB). The influence of copper concentration on the activity of selected microorganism communities and the type of mineral phases formed was determined during experiments in which copper (II) chloride at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.7 g/L was added to SRB cultures. The experiments were performed in two variants: with ethanol (4 g/L) or lactate (4 g/L) as the sole carbon source. In order to determine the taxonomic composition of the selected microorganism communities, the 16S rRNA method was used. Results of this analysis confirmed the presence of Desulfovibrio, Desulfohalobium, Desulfotalea, Thermotoga, Solibacter, Gramella, Anaeromyxobacter and Myxococcus sp. in the stationary cultures. The post-culture sediments contained covelline (CuS) and digenite (Cu 9 S 5 ). Based on the results, it can be stated that the type of carbon source applied during incubation plays a crucial role in determining the mineral composition of the post-culture sediments. Thus, regardless of the amount of copper ion introduced to a culture with lactate as the sole carbon source, no copper sulphide was observed in the post-culture sediments. Cultures with ethanol as the sole carbon source, on the other hand, yielded covelline or digenite in all post-culture sediments.",

The Opole–Zawadzkie Major Groundwater Body (south-west Poland) was chosen for this investigation. The parameters for anisotropy were analysed on the basis of well yield and observation of macro-fractures (field scale) compared with micro-fractures. Sta-tistical tools were used to assess the directions and values of anisotropy. The estimated parameters were tested on two different models realized in Visual Modflow code. The anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity was recognized as an es-sential factor for groundwater flow direction and water table depletion prognosis as well as for water budget modification. The second model (M2), representing anisotropy flow conditions, gave an 11% lower value of safe yield in com-parison with the first model (M1-isotropic). Additionally, anisotropy conditions caused water table lowering and limitation of aquifer recharge. The results of these studies indicate the need for more attention to be paid to the anisotropy problem in the area, where fracture-karstic aquifers are the main source of groundwater supply.",

Their shape is markedly differentiated and varies from spherical to cylindrical and even irregular contours, with size ranging from 0.7 to 1.6 cm. They are rusty-yellow in colour, very light, their streaks being 1.442 g/cm 3 as against 2.355 g/cm 3 shown by other infiltrations. The pisoliths are made up of from 15 to 20 concentric calcium carbonate laminae, while their nuclei consist mostly of fragments of stalactites. The writer accounts as follows for the origin of the pisoliths. Action of water with a H 2 CO 3 and CaC0 3 content, dripping down onto the cave floor, wore out small irregularly shaped, water filled hollows. Water of these reservoirs and loose rock fragments there were moved about by drops of water falling down. The precipitated calcium carbonate was concentrically deposited on the moved rock fragments giving rise to cave pisoliths.

Nostoceras ( Didymoceras ) wernickei (Wollemann, 1902) comb. nov., to which three of the four specimens that were described and illustrated by Wollemann (1902) belong, has irregularities of ribbing and tuberculation and changes its direction of growth at the transition from the helicoidal whorls to the hook, which is a typical feature of members of the subfamily Nostoceratinae. Torsion of body chambers is not developed in hairpin-shaped ammonite species, which means that the species name wernickei is no longer available for such polyptychoceratine diplomoceratids. Consequently, the fourth specimen figured and assigned to Hamites wernickei by Wollemann (1902) is here transferred to Oxybeloceras and considered conspecific to material from the Hannover area (Lehrte West Syncline) as O. aff. crassum (Whitfield, 1877). In addition to the “ Heteroceras -Schicht des Mucronaten-Senons” of Lüneburg ( bipunctatum / roemeri Zone, upper upper Campanian), the geographic range of N. ( D. ) wernickei probably includes Upper Austria, Tunisia and the Donbass region, while O. aff. crassum is known from the Hannover area (northern Germany), southern France, northern Spain and Upper Austria.",

At maturity, the ribs on both valves thicken into steep flanks that allow the oyster to increase interior volume without increasing its exterior footprint on the seafloor. Lopha staufferi is the first (earliest) ribbed oyster in the Late Cretaceous of the Western Interior, but has no ancestor in the basin. It disappears from the rock record as suddenly as it appeared, leaving no direct descendent in the basin. In the southern part of the basin where it is well constrained, L. staufferi is restricted stratigraphically to the upper Cenomanian Metoicoceras mosbyense Zone (= Dunveganoceras conditum Zone in the north). Lopha staufferi has an unusual paleogeographic distribution, occurring in only two, widely scattered areas in the basin. It has been found at several localities near the western shoreline of the Late Cretaceous Seaway in west-central New Mexico and adjacent Arizona, and in localities 1,900 km (1,200 mi) to the northeast near the eastern shoreline in northeastern Minnesota, but nowhere in between. In west-central New Mexico and adjacent Arizona, L. staufferi is a guide fossil to the Twowells Tongue of the Dakota Sandstone.",

The Duna carbonate-hosted deposit contains a significant amount of Ag (18.9–264.3 ppm ), Cu (77–41600 ppm), Sb (32.7–11000 ppm), Sr (63.5– 15100 ppm), and Fluid inclusions with 7.34–23.65 wt.% NaCl equivalent. The homogenization temperature of about 110–285°C, as well as the paragenesis of the minerals shows a difference compared with other Pb-Zn deposits such as the Irish-type and MVT. The ore mineralization in the Duna mine occurred as stratabound, open space-filling, and along the brecciated fault zones. The concordant (stratabound) type of mineralization, with salinity and homogenization temperature of 18.54 to 23.65 wt.% NaCl equivalent, and 113°C to 165°C respectively, is usually typical of MVT-ore deposits, which in this area evolved during the Early Cimmerian orogeny and was later interrupted by mineralization along younger brecciated fault zones with salinity and homogenization temperature of 7.34 to 23.65 wt.% NaCl equivalent, and 113°C to 285°C respectively. This discordant mineralization, which occurred along the faults, formed by the end of the Late Cretaceous and during the Cenozoic as a result of the intrusion of a plutonic mass, and is comparable to the Irish-type ore deposits.",

The structure of the terrace has been surveyed in five profiles. The sedimentary sequence includes alternating layers of gravel and calcareous mud with a maximum thickness of up to 2.2 m. A rich and varied malacofauna has been found in the mud. The age of the sediments was determined using the radiocarbon method. The sediments that make up the terrace cover the younger part of the Middle Holocene and the entire Late Holocene. The analysis of the malacofauna has allowed for the characterization of environmental changes. The most important of them dates back to the Middle Ages and is associated with the phase of intensive settlement in the Pieniny Mts.. It is indicated by deforestation and the related change in the composition and structure of malacocoenoses manifested by the replacement of forest communities by ones with open-country species. Gravel horizons are records of flood periods correlated with wet climatic phases. It is possible to distinguish six such phases covering the following periods: 6600–6100 y cal BP, 5500–5100 y cal BP, 4500–4100 y cal BP, 3200–2300 y cal BP, 2000–900 y cal BP and 400–200 y cal BP. They correspond to the periods of increased fluvial activity of rivers, intensification of mass movements, advances of alpine glaciers and the increase in the water level in lakes.",

Although this specimen was found in a relatively southern state, the proximal articular surface of this ungual is similar to that of Gorgosaurus libratus Lambe, 1914, a taxon found in the northern state, Alberta. Although based on limited evidence, this may suggest that the range of tyrannosaurids considered endemic to the north of Laramidia extended farther south than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Marine mudstone of Coniacian age (c. 89.51–86.49 Ma) was deposited on a storm-dominated ramp spanning the foredeep of the Cretaceous Western Canada Foreland Basin. Marine flooding surfaces define 18 allomembers that thin over 300 km, from c. 140 m in the proximal foredeep to c. 20 m close to the forebulge crest. The broadly conformable succession of allomembers is partitioned into five ‘tectono-stratigraphic units’ by low-angle unconformities that bevel off c. 10 to 20 m of strata over ‘arches’ that have a length scale of c. 50–100 km and are bounded by relatively linear zones of flexure. Depositional history involved two alternate modes: ‘Background’ deposition of subtly-tapered allomembers took place on a planar sea floor, subject to regional flexural subsidence, with sea-level modulated by Milankovitch-scale (c. 125 kyr) eustatic cycles. ‘Flexural’ events deformed the strata into troughs and arches across narrow zones of flexure. Arch crests were bevelled off, probably by submarine wave erosion. Eroded sediment did not accumulate in troughs but was advected beyond the study area by storm-driven processes. Cycles of deposition, warping and erosion were repeated five times on an average timescale of 600 kyr. Arches and troughs do not coincide with Precambrian basement structures, and their origin remains enigmatic. Changes in in-plane stress may have effected the localized vertical motion.",

The updated reports on any fossil opercula of the tube-dwelling polychaetes are reviewed, to indicate their difference from the studied material. The opercular system in the present-day species of the genus Vermiliopsis is shown, to accentuate the structural setting of the studied ancient calottae, among which three morphological groups are distinguished. These groups are described, in the open nomenclature, as the calottae comparable to those of the present-day species, viz. Vermiliopsis infundibulum (PHILIPPI, 1844), V. Iabiata (O.G. COSTA, 1861), and V. monodiscus ZlBROWIUS, 1968. The noted differences are discussed, and such factors as various stratigraphic age (thus, phylogeny), preservation and/or taphonomic loss (? abrasion), and biotope conditions (environmental stress, various bioprovince connections) are thought to have influenced differences in morphology and/or biomineralization of the studied Middle Miocene calottae and of their present-day counterparts.

This new taxon of the genus Discinisca DALL, 1871, is the first recognized specifically within the Cretaceous System, and is regarded to represent a separate subgenus, to embrace the disciniscans featured by their dorsal valves elongated, dome-shaped, and laterally flapped. The appearance of the disciniscan brachiopods within the topmost Cretaceous sequence of the Middle Vistula Valley was convergent with the decline of the Late Cretaceous regressive cycle when extremely shallow-marine areas had evolved to yield environmental conditions the most compatible with life requirements of the present-day representatives of that extant genus.

    "abstract": "Two statistical methods (cluster analysis and discriminant function) based on twenty textural and mass physical parameters of the surficial sediments deposited in the modern glaciomarine sedimentary environment of the NW BrepoIlen Bay, Hornsund Fjord, Spitsbergen, have resulted in the recognition of the three major lithofacies. According to the origin, type of transport, and depositional pattern they were identified as: ( i ) glacial till, ( ii ) ice rafted sediments, ( iii ) water transported sediments. This classification system enabled the facies identification of older subsurficial deposits from core samples. The areal distribution of analyzed textural and physical properties and their interrelations, against a background of the rapid retreat of the tidewater glaciers (43 to 100 m annually), varied sedimentation rate (4 to 110 mm a year), and presence of dead ice blocks on the bay floor preserved by salt (34‰) and cold (-1 to + 0,5°C) bottom water, have allowed to gain insight into sedimentary processes of a glaciomarine environment.",

Differences are observed in the chemical composition, values of the ionic ratios, and varying general mineralization. This should probably be connected·with the various origin and dynamics of the brines as well as with differences in the lithology and tectonics of the deposits collecting the brines. In Permian deposits there occur very strongly mineralized waters mostly of the types Cl-Na, CI-Na-Mg, Cl-Na-Ca. Their mineralization increases with the distance from the zone of the Sub-Tertiary outcrops of the Permian. An analysis of correlations between the particular hydrochemical indices has shown ,the presence of a relatively small number of dependent factors. This reasonably suggests a lack of uniformity in the determination of ironic relations in hydrogeological studies. Strong mineralization and the chemical composition of the waters indicate that the Permian waterbearing formation in the Foresudetic monocline lies within a zone of extremely slow water exchange, to be rated on·a geological scale.",

Due to the short duration of the experiments the reaction had not approached equilibrium and partly metastable phases were formed. Wairakite nucleated in the laumontite stability field in the system plagioclase-quartz-H 2 O. Higher sodium activites led to the formation of mixed analcime-wairakite crystals or analcime crystals. The mechanisms of zeolite formation seems to comprise topotaxial growth on the plagioclase surface caused by a dissolution-precipitation process.

Particularly very high is concentration of sulfur dioxide and particulates. Emission rates percapita and per unit of GDP have been several times that of neighboring western countries, although the levels have been somewhat decreasing. Pollution is concentrated in the area of Silesian Coal Basin, which, for example, produced 23 % of Poland’s total SO 2 emissions in 1992, though it occupies only 2% of the country’s area. Contribution of abandoned hard-coal mines processes in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) to greenhouse gases pollution is discussed and a prognosis of future air pollution presented. During the last decades considerable improvements have been achieved in reducing air pollution in the country’s industrial areas, usually as a result of the Government’s efforts through legislative, regulatory and economic means. Also, monitoring of air quality has greatly improved during recent years. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) states report, between 1985 and 2004, the CO 2  emissions decreased in Poland by more than 30%, SO 2 by 40%, NOx by 4% and particulate matter (PM) by 44%. Potential future improvements in air cleaning with technology transfer and carbon dioxide sequestration is also discussed.",

Nasal which belongs to the sub-tatric range of the vicinity of Zakopane (Western Tatras), we can observe a well preserved synclinal twist, closed from the south, already reported by Z. Kotanski (1959b, 1963). This twist formed in the Anisian limestones and dolomites of the Mala Świnica unit which had been overthrust onto the Keuper, Rhaetic -and Liassic rocks of the Suchy Wierch unit owing to the stress from the south (comp. Guzik & Kotanski 1963). The presence of this twist indicates the scale-nappe style in the geology of the Tatra Mts. (Kotanski 1961, Guzik & Kotanski op. cit.), and not the digitation-nappe style, which was accepted previously (Goetel & Sokolowski 1930). The synclinal twist of Mt. Nosal is cut up by many transverse dislocations formed owing to the subsidence of the rigid Middle-Triassic rocks on the more plastic sediments of the Upper Triassic and Liassic (comp. Goetel & Sokolowski op. cit.). Some of these faults came into existence immediately after the formation of the synclinal twist of Mt. Nosal, others are post-Eocene in age as is reliably indicated by the fact that deposits of the transgreding Eocene are dissected by these faults.",

The investigation of its individual members over a larger area has, thus far, encountered considerable difficulties. The geologists of the Polish Oil Industry have surveyed and mapped an area of 850 sq. km., with supplementary evidence yielded by dug-outs and deep borings. These studies have greatly modified previous views concerning the tectonics of the considered area (tabl. I and fig. 2). 4,200 m. of the stratigraphic column, from the Albian to the Oligocene, have been examined and facial analyses made (fig. 3). The resulting inferences are supported by micropalaeontological evidence leading to the establishment of the stratigraphic position of the Cretaceous, Paleocene, Lower- and Middle Eocene oil-bearing series (figs.4-5). Six main and several smaller tectonic elements have been distinguished which have been assigned to three distinct areas: 1. Northern - with the predominance of steep generally regular anticlines; 2. Central - which is a scale-folded area. The two scales (Pustki and Łubno) were, so far, considered as one locally scaled anticline. It has now been made clear that the Iwonicz- Rymanow anticline is separated from the Bobrka anticline by a distinct syncline and that together they overthrust the Kopytowa scale; Both these areas are characterised by disharmonic internal structure of their tectonic elements, resulting from differences of plasticity of the Eocene shales in relation to the sandstone Cretaceous core am the more rigid Oligocene cover. 3. Southern - the Zboiska-Rudawka Rymanowska anticline which, in its part of maximum uplifting, passes into a scale with a 4 km. overthrust. The group of the Dukla folds was overthrust onto its peripheral syncline.

    "abstract": "LOWER CARBONIFEROUS VOLCANISM IN THE KRZESZOWICE AREA In 1949, within a cut to the Orlej porphyry quarry (Cracow region), a section of about 150 m. was exposed of Carboniferous beds developed as shales, mudstones and dolomitic limestones. The limestones and shales in the top portion of the section contain a rich fauna which determines their age as uppermost Visean (Czarniecki 1955). The shale series in the central part intercalated by tuffites and tuffitic conglomerates (pI. L and LI), which consist of angular shale fragments and poorly rounded porphyry fragments with diameter up to a score or so of centimetres (pI. LII, fig. 1). Microscopic analyses have shown that shale fragments occurring in tuffitic conglomerates do not differ from Orlej shales stratigraphically underlying these conglomerates. On mineral composition analyses the magmatic elements of tuffites and tuffitic conglomerates (pI. LII, fig. 2 and LIII) have been referred to rhyolites. They differ by their composition from the porphyries of the Zalas laccolith (including the Orlej porphyries), from those of Miekinia and from other acid volcanic rocks in the Cracow region. The wrirters think that the coarse clastic tuffitic material was introduced into the argillaceous Orlej series through submarine slumps associated with disturbances due to uppermost Visean volcanism. The tuffitic conglomerates and tuffites outcropping in the Orlej quarry, therefore, represent oldest volcanic activities in the Cracow region.

Differences in the facies and thickness of the clastic deposits are due to the synsedimentary Lower Permian block·tectonics. During the Rotliegendes the stresses of the vertical movements of the substratal blocks varied, favouring redeposition, many times repeated of the sediments The considered area covers the northern part of the Fore-Sudetic monocline in the Poznan-Śrem region. The Permian substrate is built of strongly diagenized sandstones and muddy shales varying in dip. The spores they have yielded (Krawczynska-Grocholska & Grocholski 1976) suggest their age as the Lower Carboniferousand the lower part of the Namurian. The Lower Permian deposits supply no paleontological data so that the stratigraphic division has been based on their lithological characters. On the basis of borehole profiles (Figs 1-3) and on correlation with other regions (cf. Klapcinski 1971, Glowacki 1973) the Rotliegendes here may be divided into two sub-groups, and an informal lithostratigraphic division may be suggested for the Poznan-Śrem region (Table 1). The oldest Rotliegendes deposits in the Poznan-Śrem region are those of the Dolsk formation. The lithological variability of this .formation, ranging from conglomerates in the bottom (the Kaleje conglomerate member) through conglomeratic sandstones and sandstones to muddy sediments in the top, reasonably suggests one only sedimentary cycle during which· the sediments were deposited in a flowing-water environment. The wide expansion and the facies variability of sediments in the Dolsk formation indicate their deposition to have taken place within an area of well developed morphology, and their transport direction from the NE to the SW (Fig. 4). The trachybasalt formation of Wyrzeka has probably developed along the Środa-Donatowo fault. The maximum thickness of volcanic rocks has been observed in the Wyrzeka region and it is there that was probably situated the centre of the volcano disgorging the lava flows, mostly in the north-eastern direction (Fig. 5). The quartzitic porphyries formation of Mlodasko is confined to the north-eastern margin of the Poznan-Śrem region. It has been observed only in a few boreholes and probably occurs as a continuous lava cover. These porphyries overlie a Lower Carboniferous substrate. The volcanic activity was followed by a period of erosion due to the Saale phase. The conglomerates encountered in some of the boreholes, mostly overlying the Autunian rocks, may be reasonably regarded as the main conglomerates of the Saxonian sedimentary cycle. The presence of these conglomerates, differentiated as a member of the Polwica conglomerates, is connected - similarly as the Autunian. deposits - with the Środa-Donatowo dislocation zone. The variable thickness and lithology is probably due to the existence of different alimentary areas. A similar picture of the basin whose outline is traceable in the Kaleje region can be concluded upon the facies analysis of the Solec conglomerate member or that of the muddy layer within the Saxonian sands tones (Figs 6-7). The sandstone formation of Siekierki occurs practically throughout the area, the southern part excepted where there are no Rotliegendes sediments. The thickness of the sandstones here varies strongly from almost a zero figure to 1000 m in the Kornik 1 borehole. The great differences in thickness may be explained by the existence of several dislocation zones confining the particular substratal blocks along which the vertical movements had taken place (Figs 8-9). A picture of the extent of translocations is shown in the thickness map where the increase in thickness of the sediments may reasonably be supposed to correspond to the extent of trans-locations (Fig. 8). The vertical movements were gentle in character and did not lead up to the uncovering of the Lower Carboniferous substrate. Nontheless, such sedimentary conditions favoured a many-times repeated redeposition of the sediments accompanied by changes in their transport direction.",

Particular attention has been given to albite twins and their origin, conditions of origin and differentiation depending on the kind of feldspar replaced by albite. Twinnings of two genetic types have been found to occur in albites, namely: the relicts (i.e. inherited after earlier feldspar) of normal habit of lamellae, and growth twinnings of chessboard habit of twin-bands. The relict twinnings occur an albites developed at the expense of primary plagioclases and rarely of potassium feldspars. A method has been established for the determination of the primary plagioclase composition on the basis of the position of the relict pericline composition plane in secondary albite taking into account the (Al, Si)-ordering state in plagioclase structure of volcanic and plutonic rocks. An extremely rare case has been found of Ala-A twinning in which the rhombic section 0kl is the composition plane (the case theoretically anticipated by Franke, 1920). Chessboard twinning characterizes albites developed at the expense of potassium feldspars, and only occasionally at the expense of plagioclases. They show important differences in their form depending on the kind of primary feldspar. The method of recognition of secondary albites and for the determination of the primary composition of plagioclase on the basis of the position of the pericline composition plane, as used in this paper, implies that the albitization processes in igneous complexes are much more frequent than was hitherto supposed, and the share of primary alkaline rocks – mainly the sodium ones – in the earth's crust is smaller than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "Ichnia 2008 – the Second International Congress on Ichnology – was held in Cracow from 1 to 5 September 2008, with 71 talks attended by more than 115 registrants. Specialists on every aspect of this very broad field were invited to present their work, and manuscripts were solicited for two theme issues of which this is one. The other is Advances in marginalmarine and non-marine ichnology in Geological Quarterly, edited by Grzegorz Pienkowski,Anthony J.Martin and Christian Meyer. History is inescapable in a city with such a rich past as Cracow. The initial session was held in the Jagiellonian University’s richly appointed ceremonial meeting hall, with paintings of alumni such as Copernicus and Pope John Paul II overlooking the proceedings. Wewere honored to hear first an address fromtheVice-Rector of the University, ProfessorAndrzejMania, who spoke on humanistic aspects of scientific visits to Cracow.  Appropriately, of the world’s ichnologists Dolf Seilacher was invited to give the first scientific talk. He chose to begin with a somber apology for the Germans’ invasion and occupation of Poland during his youth – meaningful words from a man who had served in the German military. For it was in this room that, shortly after the Nazi takeover, the faculty of the University gathered and were arrested to be sent to a concentration camp. It is one measure of how much the world has changed within two generations. The talks and posters that followed over the next few days were as diverse as the presenters. They included work on virtually every aspect of ichnology, and much of itwas at the cutting edge of the field and exciting. But it was not all hard science. Ample opportunities were arranged for the attendees to socialize together, including a sumptuous dinner party held onWawelHill, the old royal castle of Cracow. Field trips before, during, and after the conference showed off the best regional exposures that Poland has to offer. The international reputation of researchers on the Carpathian flysch and theHoly Cross Mountains has been put into proper perspective, especially in conjunction with a visit to the Marian Ksiązkiewicz collection in the Jagiellonian University’s Geological Museum – surely the most extensive collection of trace fossils currently on exhibit anywhere in the world. Another attraction was Dolf Seilacher’s Fossil Art exhibit, consisting of full-sized casts of natural exposures showing intriguing trace and body fossils; this was held at the Geological Museum of the Institute of Geological Sciences of the PolishAcademy of Sciences.  Capping the event, after a rainy soccer game on the great Blonia lawn, was the conference dinner, 125 m underground in the mediaevalWieliczka Salt Mine. A fine meal was had as folk musicians and dancers performed in front of us, whereupon the audience was invited to join the dance. The themes set by the first Ichnia in Argentina in 2004 (stimulating talks, wonderful field trips, good eating, and a taste of local culture) were thus followed with success in Poland.  In this theme issue, the reader can sample a few of the presentations that were delivered at Ichnia 2008 on the general topic of marine ichnology. In this collection are articles on the cutting edge of deep- and shallowmarine ichnofacies as well as papers on particular ichnotaxa, and one that crosses the boundaries of history, art, and science. There is even one that unravels a murder mystery with a hint of passion. We hope you will enjoy these talks in their written form as much as we did when they were first presented by their authors in Cracow.",

Organic hieroglyphs occur only within a relatively thin Flysch series between the lower and upper Podhale beds which are in turn characterised by the presence of anorganic hieroglyphs. 2.

    "abstract": "In Rhaetian (Late Triassic) times, the Hauptdolomit/Dachstein carbonate shelf situated at the passive continental margin of the northwestern Tethys was characterized by an extensional tectonic regime. Rifting and spreading movements fragmented this shelf into a loosely fitted mosaic of fault-bounded blocks characterized by a differential subsidence pattern. This is expressed in significant thickness variations of platform carbonates and in the formation of the intrashelf Kossen Basin. In this study, it can be demonstrated that tectonic subsidence triggered the development of a carbonate platform margin and that the influence of eustatic sea-level changes was negligible. The Steinplatte complex developed at the transition of the Kossen Basin to the Dachstein Carbonate Platform. Small-scale isolated carbonate mounds situated on a smoothly inclined homoclinal ramp characterized the initial phase and acted as nuclei of further carbonate buildup growth. However, only the ideal palaeogeographic position far enough away from the carbonate-suppressive terrigenous influence of the Kossen Beds, combined with vigorous carbonate production stimulated by rapid subsidence-caused sea-level rise, favoured continuous mound growth. Once established, the carbonate buildup was characterized by rapid aggradational growth, developing a palaeogeographic high with a steep slope and a depression with decreased sedimentation behind, several kilometres distant from the Dachstein Carbonate Platform. Contemporaneously, isostatic adjustment caused an accommodation minimum on the nearby margin of the Dachstein Carbonate Platform leading to its westward progradation. Fading out of subsidence caused filling of the former depression in the back of the buildup by prograding shallow-water Dachstein Limestones. Thus, a new platform margin was established in the Steinplatte area, elevated almost 200 m above the adjacent Kossen Basin. At the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, the Steinplatte complex was subjected to subaerial exposure by a sudden tectonic uplift followed by a rapid isostatic drop. Emergence is indicated by levels of karstified limestones directly underlying supposed exposure surfaces. Final drowning of the Steinplatte complex as well as of the whole Dachstein Carbonate Platform is indicated by the cover of Early Jurassic (Sinemurian) deeper water, ammonite bearing limestones (Adnet Formation).",

In the whole near-axial area joint is uniform regardless of the tectonic and stratigraphic position of the beds (cf. Figs 1–3), thus being of pre-tectonic origin. Tectonic analysis has shown that the axis of the Podhale synclinorium merges eastward (diagram IV in Fig. 4), whereas in the western part of Podhale it is tilted westward (Goląb 1959). Thus a large transversal elevation of Bialy Dunajec exists in the discussed area, i.e. between the Bialy Dunajec stream and Bialka river (Fig. 5). Its origin is probably due to the post-Eocene movements of the flysch substrate; it lies directly to the north of the transversal Koszysta elevation of the Tatra Mts what suggests an interrelation of both those structures.",

Changes in the composition of the Bunter sandstones are not connected with the various lithostratigraphic horizons or various fecies to which they belonged but were caused by their position in relation to the source area.",

    "abstract": "Balanomorph cirripedes from the Eocene–Oligocene of the Hampshire Basin (United Kingdom) and the Middle Eocene of the Cotentin Peninsula, Manche (France) are described. A new genus, Vectibalanus, is founded, with the type species Balanus unguiformis J. de C. Sowerby, 1846; assigned to this are also Balanus erisma J. de C. Sowerby, 1846 and Vectibalanus mortoni sp. nov. In addition, a new species of Lophobalanus Zullo, 1984, L. fresvillensis sp. nov., is described. This is the first record of that genus from outside the eastern USA and the oldest species known to date. Cladistic analysis of 24 morphological characters suggests that Vectibalanus unguiformis is sister taxon to a group comprising the most derived balanomorph taxa, and thus represents an important transition in the evolution of the group, with the initiation of development of a complex parietal wall structure. Vectibalanus unguiformis was evidently adapted to low salinity habitats (10–30 ppt), and is the oldest known brackish water barnacle. The other species ( V. erisma, V. mortoni sp. nov.) occupied more clearly marine environments (&amp;gt;30 ppt). Balanomorph barnacles appeared simultaneously in the Priabonian (Upper Eocene) of the Gulf and Atlantic seaboards of the USA and northwest Europe, which probably represents a northerly migration from Tethys.",

    "abstract": "Rare erratic clasts – extraneous rock types – occur in the Upper Cretaceous Chalk, including a local basal facies, the Cambridge Greensand. The underlying Upper Albian Gault Clay and the Hunstanton Red Chalk Formations have also yielded erratics. The discovery of these erratics, their description and the development of hypotheses to explain their origins and significance are reviewed. They became the subject of scientific interest with the interpretation of a particularly large example “The Purley Boulder” by Godwin-Austen (1858) as having been transported to its depositional site in the Chalk Sea by drifting coastal ice. Thin section petrography (1930–1951) extended knowledge of their diverse provenance. At the same time the Chalk Sea had become interpreted as warm, so drifting ice was considered out of context, and the preferred agents of transport were entanglement in the roots of drifting trees, as holdfasts of floating marine algae, or as stomach stones of marine reptiles or large fish. Reconsideration of their occurrence, variable nature and sedimentary setting suggests that there are three zones in the English Chalk where erratics may be less rare (1) near the base of the Cenomanian in the Cambridge area, (2) the Upper Cenomanian–Middle Turonian in Surrey, and (3) the Upper Coniacian and Lower Santonian of Kent. The assemblage from each level and their sedimentary setting is subtly different. Present evidence suggests that the erratics found in the Upper Albian–Lower Cenomanian and the Upper Cenomanian–Middle Turonian zones represent shallow water and shoreline rocks that were transported into the Chalk Sea by coastal ice (fast-ice) that enclosed coastal marine sediments as it froze. The Upper Coniacian and Lower Santonian erratics from Rochester and Gravesend in Kent are gastroliths.",

    "abstract": "This paper compares unstable and stable isotope ratios measured in a speleothem core from the Nevada desert (the well-known DH 11) with speleothems at the centre of the continent in the Black Hills of South Dakota. All samples grew over most of the past 500,000 y. The thermal calcite in the large Nevadan desert basin displays a range of the initial U ratio ( 234 U/ 238 U0) of only 0.25 and is much enriched in 234 U, reflecting selective leaching in a very low energy weathering environment. Similar thermal calcite from a much smaller basin the Black Hills (Wind Cave) is less homogenised (U/U0 range is ~0.5) and less enriched as a consequence of its more vigorous sem-arid weathering environment. Both display glacial-interglacial cyclicity in the ratio. A vadose speleothem from Jewel Cave, Black Hills, has a U/U 0 range of 0.75 and many erratic features attributable to rapidly changing local conditions in the overlying tall grass- coniferous forest vegetal transition. O and C stable isotopes are again homogenised in the large Nevada basin: the range is 2.8 ‰ 18 O and 1.2 ‰ 13 C, encompassing all glacial-interglacial cyclicity. In the Wind Cave thermal calcites the range again is roughly double, an effect of lesser homogenisation taking place in the smaller aquifer. There is also a perturbation of the signals of ~100 ky duration that may have been caused by release of deep CO 2 . 18 O and 13 C measurements in the Jewel Cave vadose sample form a broad envelope that encloses the Black Hills thermal calcite data, indicating that the full range, glacial – interglacial, of speleothem 18 O was probably 10 ‰ here in the centre of the continent, which may be compared to 1.2 ‰ estimated at the sources of the precipitation in the Gulf and Caribbean. 13 C of the vadose speleothem ranged 7.0 ‰ in the Black Hills, oscillating between moderate and very low (desert-like) levels of soil CO 2 activity.",

    "abstract": "On the character of the Western Carpathian Mesozoic geosyncline and the Podhale epimiogeosyncline Evidence is given of the miogeosynclinal character of the geosyncline in the Mesozoic of the Western Carpathians. This is most conclusively demonstrated - in agreement with M. Kay's (1947, 1951) statement - by the lack of well developed initial volcanism. Neither the Lower Triassic volcanites of Chocz, the Tithonian high-tatric limburgites, nor the Lower Cretaceous teschenites from the Flysch of the Outer Carpathians, may be regarded as expressions of this volcanism. Spilites from the exotics of the Pieniny Clippen Belt most likely do not derive from the Mesozoic but from the Paleozoic. Hence, contrary to what D. Andrusov (1958, 1959) postulated, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that during the Mesozoic eugeosynclinal and miogeosynclinal basins occurred alternately within the Western Carpathians. On the other hand, within the miogeosyncline, the alternate occurrence may be observed of intrageanticlinal basins (e.g. the high-tatric and the Czorsztyn series) and of intrageosynclinal basins (e.g. the sub-tatric and the Pieniny series). With reference to M. Kay's classification of geosynclines, a new type - the epimiogeosyncline, has been erected by the writer. This is a secondary geosyncline (epigeosyncline) which after the tectogenesis of the Alpine type replaced the miogeosyncline. The epimiogeosynclinal sediments display a deep-sea mainly Flysch, character. The Podhale Flysch in the CentraI (Inner) Carpathians are the representative type of this kind of sediments.",

This is clearly testified by the Cenomanian and Turonian inoceramid assemblages as well as the ammonites and belemnites. The inoceramid zonation as applied in Western Europe can be easily used in Eastern Europe. This identity is also valid for the distribution of bio- and eco-events ( Schloenbachia/virgatus Event, Chondrites Event, Mytiloides Event, lamarcki/cuvieri Event) and the stratigraphic location of the barren intervals in this part of the mid-Cretaceous. The gaps in the Middle and Upper Cenomanian and at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary in Eastern Europe are greater than in Western Europe. For lithological comparisons especially the limy offshore development is useful. This comparison shows the whole facies similarity and the same time location of the important facies changes. The basal greensand of the Crimea area can be compared with the Early Cenomanian greensand of the southern Munsterland and eastern Subhercynian regions. The unfossiliferous Upper Cenomanian limestones of the Crimea are closely comparable to the so-called “Arme Rhotomagense Schichten”, and the reddish marls and argilliferous limestones with the Rotplaner facies in Western Europe.

    "abstract": "Quaternary cover around Mt. Miedzianka in The Holy Cross Mts SUMMARY The area studied is situated at SW margins of the Paleozoic core of the Holy Cross Mts, at the western part of Checiny anticline. The core of the anticline is built of Cambrian shales and siltstones, whereas its limbs of Devonian limestones markedly more resistant to weathering, also as compared to clay-sandy Lower Triassic rocks that contact the limbs from the south (cf. Figs 1-2). The structure of the anticline is also markedly influenced by a dense network of faults of two predominating directions, viz. WNW-ESE and NNE-SSW, which were repeatedly reactivated during the late Tertiary time (Lindner 1971a). These lithological and tectonic factors resulted in the formation of deep river valleys discharging waters towards the south in the late Tertiary and early Quaternary time (denivelations may be estimated at 100-150 m). The oldest Quaternary deposits are represented in valleys by weathering cIays (Fig. 2), up to 10 m thick, and directly covering the Devonian limestones. The Cracow (Mindel) Glaciation is represented by two series of tills, indicating twofold entering of the icesheet ( cf. Figs 2-3). Data from numerous boreholes show that the icesheet never covered the whole area but rather was stopped by the hills. This gave rise to an oasis surrounded by ice and sheltered by those hills (Figs 3-4), and in which deposition of silts and afterwards of sands took place. During the Great (Holstein) Interglacial, an extensively deep valley (30 to 50 m deep) was formed subsequently filled by vast amount of gravels and sands (Fig. 2); it discharged waters towards the south, into the contemporaneous pre-Nida river valley (Hakenberg & Lindner 1971). Mid-Polish (Riss) icesheet was stopped at the distance of 7–9 km NW of the region. The morphological analysis shows that drainage basin of the upper Hutka river could not discharge waters from the front of the icesheet, and it was the time of acceleration of slope processes. A valley eroded 15–20 m down the present water level in the river was presumably formed during the optimum Eem Interglacial. This valley was buried during the post-optimum part of the Eem Interglacial and BaItic (Worm) Glaciation time. The subsequent erosion resulted in the formation of a terrace situated about 3 m above the present water level, and it was accompanied by intense eolian processes. The final erosional and depositional processes in the Hutka valley active during the Holocene, are responsible for the development of the flood-plain.",

The tesseraspid material is not abundant, and most often preserved as a “patchwork” of bony platelets (tesserae), except for a few partly articulated specimens.

All species are based upon rare and incomplete material, as no head carapaces associated with trunk and tail are known, and so, the intraspecific variability is also unknown. Distinction between “species” is based on the detail of the superficial sculpture of the tesserae of the head carapaces, which is unsatisfactory. It is concluded that only four of the nominal species can be retained. A review of all other known tessellated pteraspidomorphs indicates that our knowledge of tessellated heterostracans is  currently insufficient to support a meaningful classification.",

Recognition as egg cases is confirmed based on the observation of layered collagen fibers. The presence of a tuberculated bone fragment preserved within one case confirms a vertebrate source. The nature of the tubercles and the unique morphology of the egg cases supports the interpretation of an arthrodiran source. Reports of Devonian egg cases are limited to either assumed chondrichthyan producers or a putative ‘egg sac’ with a  morphology atypical for any vertebrate. The Cleveland Shale egg cases thus represent the first record for a non-chondrichthyan producer. Among placoderms, behaviors of a pelagic life style with obligate nesting sites, reef fishes with live birth, and estuarine and fluvial nurseries, along with eggcase oviparity testifies to the diversity of reproductive strategies. As with modern fishes these strategies may be ecologically driven and the derived and variable reproductive biology of extant chondrichthyans is actually a primitive condition among gnathostomes. One consequence of the diversity of reproductive strategies (dependent on the topology of relationships) is the independent origin of internal fertilization within placoderms,  possibly suggesting external fertilization as the primitive gnathostome reproductive mode.",

Various types of internal deposits were derived in a different manner and from different sources. Fine carbonate sediments, represented by variously coloured pelitic limestones, calcilutites and fine calcarenites, most probably come from uplifted and corroded carbonate massifs (possibly from the allochthonous units of the High-Tatric succession). Products of weathering, both in dissolved form and as small particles, were washed into the sedimentary basin of the autochthonous unit, and redeposited within the dykes. The sandy varieties of the infillings,  epresented by red, ferruginous calcareous sandstones, come directly from the host rocks or from loose sediments present on the sea bottom at the time of fracturing. The most probable age of the infilling sediments is Sinemurian to Pliensbachian. The occurrence of dykes of this age is yet another feature confirming that the sedimentary development of the Lower Jurassic sandy-carbonate facies in the autochthonous unit was strongly influenced by  synsedimentary tectonic activity, such as block-faulting.",

The progressing atrophy of the columnotheca, leading to its total reduction in extreme species, and the occurrence of an axial structure instead of a compact pseudocolumella established in these species are accepted as differences exceeding the genus level. All specimens assigned to this subfamily were derived from the same Limestone F1 of the Donets Basin, and mostly from the same locality. The reasons for their split into a relatively large number of species are: 1) an increased radiation typical for faunal turnover times; 2) a delay in the appearance of differentiated skeletal characters relative to the appearance of genetic differences large enough to characterise different species; 3) a bias in preservation of fossil remnants by comparison to living populations, amplified by biases in the collections available for study by comparison to the total number of specimens fossilised.",

Jotunites were recently described within the deeply buried c. 1.5 Ga Suwałki and Sejny anorthosite massifs in the crystalline basement of NE Poland. The major and trace element compositions of Polish jotunites show them to have a calc-alkalic to alkali-calcic and ferroan character, with a relatively wide range of SiO2 content (40.56 wt. % up to 47.46 wt. %) and high concentrations of Fe (up to 22.63 wt. % Fe2O3), Ti (up to 4.34 wt. % TiO2) and P (up to 1.46 wt. % P2O5).

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) studies were used for the microstructural analysis of natural clays and clay pastes. Qualitative microstructural changes were observed: from a honeycomb microstructure for the initial clay paste to a turbulent microstructure for the dried paste. It was also noticed that water loss caused by the increase of the suction pressure had a significant impact on the microstructural transformations. Significant changes in the quantitative values of the pore space parameters were also observed. Increase of suction pressure and water loss caused a decrease in porosity and changes in the values of morphometric parameters, such as pore distribution; for example, a significant increase of the number of pores of 0−10 μm size and changes in the geometric parameters of the pore space were noticed with the increase of suction pressure. The pore space with larger isometric pores was modified into a pore space with the dominance of small anisometric and fissure-like pores. The increased degree of anisotropy from a poorly-oriented to a highly-oriented microstructure was also observed. After rapid shrinkage the reduction in the number of pores, maximum pore diameter, and total pore perimeter was recorded. The process of rapid water loss induced the closure of very small pores. A similar effect was observed during the increase of the suction pressure, where the closure of pore space of the clay pastes was observed very clearly.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of grabens rich in lignite is important in the context of the accumulation of ~40–650 m of peat, as well as the exploitation of later formed lignite seams with a thickness of ~20–250 m. Six such areas were selected for a detailed palaeotectonic analysis: the Gostyń, Szamotuły, Legnica, Zittau, Lubstów, and Kleszczów grabens. During the analysis, borehole data were used, taking into account the compaction of peat at the transition to lignite, in order to reconstruct the magnitude of the total subsidence. This made it possible to distinguish between regional (covering areas also outside the grabens) and local (occurring only in the grabens) tectonic movements, and among the latter, tectonic and compactional subsidence. The hypothetical palaeosurface of the mires was reconstructed based on the lignite decompaction. As a result, it was possible to determine whether the examined peat/lignite seams underwent post-depositional uplift and/or subsidence. Between one (Gostyń Graben) and four (Zittau Basin and Kleszczów Graben) stages of tectonic subsidence were distinguished in the studied lignite-bearing areas. In the case of the Zittau Basin, as well as the Lubstów and Kleszczów grabens, post-depositional stages of tectonic uplift were also indicated. Like the boundaries of lithostratigraphic units, the successive stages of the Cenozoic tectonic development of the examined grabens are diachronic.",

The nappes are established on the basis of paleogeographic reconstructions, structural data, as well as drilling and geophysical data. The leading mechanism for the nappe formation is the advancement to the north and the underthrusting of the autochthone under the Greater Caucasus (A-type subduction). The nappes were formed mainly in the Late Alpine time (Late Eocene–Early Pliocene) and include only the sedimentary cover of the Earth’s crust (thin-skinned nappes). However the basal detachment (décollement) of the nappes, according to seismic data, penetrates deeply and cuts the pre-Jurassic crystalline basement, and even the entire Earth’s crust representing thick-skinned deformation. The total horizontal displacement of the flysch nappes of the southern slope of the Greater Caucasus in their eastern (Kakhetian) part is 90–100 km. While, considering the folding of the entire Greater Caucasus, the total transverse shortening of the Earth‘s crust within its limits is equal to 190–200 km.",

One such example is the extinct family Metoposauridae Watson, 1919. Metoposaurids were abundant amphibians in Late Triassic Pangea. The remains of the genus Metoposaurus Lydekker, 1890 have been found in Germany, Poland and Portugal with three species, respectively Metoposaurus diagnosticus (Meyer, 1842), Metoposaurus krasiejowensis Sulej, 2002 and Metoposaurus algarvensis Brusatte, Butler, Mateus and Steyer, 2015. Since the majority of studies concern the skull and the pectoral girdle, in this work M. krasiejowensis has been analysed through a morphometric study of the mandible. This was made possible by the high abundance of fossils found in Krasiejów (SW Poland) in the last 20 years. The characteristics considered are the morphology of the mandible corpus and its most relevant bones, the adaptation to stress during biting and the dermal ornamentation. The results reveal that not only do these characters have great intraspecific variability, but that at least two groups of a single population of M. krasiejowensis probably had different lifestyles, one more aquatic and the other more terrestrial.",

This mineralization was found in the north-eastern part of the Karkonosze granitoid pluton at the southern slope of the Wysoki Grzbiet (High Ridge) in Izera Mts. The studies concerned mainly 18 Sb minerals: antimony, Sb-bearing domeykite, getchellite, stibnite, willyamite, berthierite, boulangerite, bournonite, chalcostibite, falkmanite, famatinite, geocronite, robinsonite, semseyite, tetrahedrite-(Fe), cervantite, kermesite and schafarzikite; seven of them have been found in Poland for the first time. The parageneses, morphological features, XRD data and chemical composition of the Sb minerals are presented. Fluid inclusions in quartz adhering to the Sb minerals had generally homogenization temperature (Th) 108–341°C and total salinity ΣS 4.6–10.1 wt. %. The inclusion fluids were of the NaCO3- Ca(HCO3)2-NaCl-KCl type with minor F and S, and occasional CO2 presence. The parent granitoid contains Sb in trace amounts (0.18–0.36 ppm) and the rock was possibly a source of this (and other) element(s) for the ore minerals. Migration of meso-epithermal solutions with Sb etc. was probably stimulated by local reduction of pressure during the formation of fissures and cracks in granite, next filled by quartz with ore minerals. The features of the historical process of the recognition of Sb ores and previous studies of the minerals investigated in this research are included in the presentation and discussion. Special attention was paid to the listing of the occurreences of Sb minerals in Lower Silesia with appropriate references.",

The circum- Laurussia warm current is suggested as having carried Yuanophylloides larvae from the North American superprovince to the Paleotethyan superprovince. This genus supplements the group of genera suggested by Fedorowski (2023) as having originated in the North American superprovince and migrating to the Paleotethyan superprovince. Together, these genera demonstrate the importance of taxonomic investigation to establish paleobiogeography as a constrain on global (i.e., tectonic scale) environmental reconstructions.",

It formed during pegmatitic to hydrothermal stages. Besides the isovalent substitution Sn → Ti, the chemical composition of the mineral is characterized by three coupled substitutions: (1) (Al, Fe, Sc)3+ + (OH, F)- → YTi + ZO, (2) XREE3+ + Y(Al, Fe, Sc)3+ →X)Ca2+ + YTi4+, and (3) (Al, Fe, Sc)3+ + (Nb, Ta)5+ → 2YTi. These substitutions are strongly dependent on the composition of the magma in terms of its Al2O3/TiO2 activity ratio, with the first one also influenced by the H2O/HF fugacity ratio. Fluorine, which induced the most common substitution (1), had its source in high-temperature F-bearing fluids released from rocks of the metamorphic envelope adjacent to the intruding granite. These fluids mobilized and transported various rock components (Sc, REE, Nb, Ta, etc.) among others in the form of fluoride complexes, enriching the aplogranite magma with some metallic elements. The substitution of Sn for Ti developed with decreasing temperature to the extent that in thin ore-mineralized quartz veins cutting aplogranite, titanite reaches Sn-bearing compositions up to the prevalence of Sn corresponding to malayaite.",

    "abstract": "The strongly bioturbated Middle Triassic (Anisian) limestones, referred to as vermicular limestone, are the dominant lithology of the Hisban Formation in Jordan. This limestone exhibits the monotonous Oravaichnium– Planolites ichnofabrics, which are known and common in the northern Peri-Tethys and the Germanic Basin. The most abundant and widespread trace fossil here is Oravaichnium carinatum, which is produced by bivalves. Specimens of O. carinatum from the Hisban Formation are typically strongly elongated in the vertical axis and have a smooth surface, whereas specimens from the Germanic Basin mainly have a pear-shaped cross-section. Nevertheless, both morphologies and transitional morphotypes between these ichnospecies are present in both areas. The difficulty in distinguishing between Oravaichnium and Planolites causes the intense bioturbation by bivalves to be underestimated. The wide occurrence of the Oravaichnium ichnofabric in the northern and southern Peri-Tethys suggests that small burrowing bivalves played a significant role in the colonization and infaunalization during the long-term recovery of the benthos after the Permian–Triassic crisis. They experienced intense development during the Middle Triassic, when they were responsible for extensive bioturbation.",

    "abstract": "This study presents for the first time, the field observations, petrography, mineral chemistry and geochemistry of chloritite hosted in the Al-Barramiya Neoproterozoic ophiolite of the Eastern Desert of Egypt, Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS). The Al-Barramiya ophiolite is one of the most important ophiolitic sequences exposed in the ANS. It is affected by different types of alterations including carbonatization, listvenitization, chloritization and rodingitization. The Al-Barramiya chloritite occurs as thin layers associated with highly serpentinized peridotite. It is a fine-grained rock entirely composed of chlorite (85–95 vol.%) with minor talc and accessory minerals (epidote, rutile, titanite, corundum and opaque minerals). The chlorite minerals in the chloritite are represented mainly by diabantite, while those in the serpentinites include ripidolite. Depending on the chemical composition of the chlorites, the chlorite in chloritite formed at temperatures ranging between 200 and 250°C, which are lower than those of the disseminated chlorite in the serpentinite (310–345oC), indicating their formation in different hydrothermal stages. The chloritite samples are rich in total REE contents (17.9–27.3 ppm) compared with the associated serpentinites (0.69–0.87 ppm). They are characterized by slightly depleted LREE relative to HREE [(La/Lu)n = 0.8–0.9], with a moderately negative Eu-anomaly [(Eu/Eu*)n = 0.4–0.5]. The negative Eu-anomalies are derived from chloritization fluids or reflect the presence of talc in the chloritite. Based on field work, petrography, mineralogical and geochemical data, the studied chloritite has been interpreted as being derived from the associated serpentinized ultramafics by hydrothermal alterations. This is supported by an enrichment of chloritite in compatible trace elements (Cr = 2031–2534 ppm, Ni = 1264–1988 ppm, Co = 76–101 ppm) similar to that which is observed in the associate serpentinite.",

The age of the succession is constrained by 1) acritarch assemblages suggestive of the Cambrian Series 2 Volkovia–Liepaina Zone in the underlying rocks, and 2) the directly overlying strata representing the Cambrian Series 2-Miaolingian boundary interval. A major erosional disconformity observed in the quarry is interpreted as a 1st order sequence boundary that can be correlated with the base of the När Lowstand in Scandinavia.

In this study, we tested this range-finder method on clastic sediments in NE Poland for the first time, with special focus on Pleistocene meltwater sediments generated by highly energetic glacial lake outburst floods, and the post-flooding sediments. Two datasets with known doses from standard measurements were compared to range-finder doses determined from quartz and feldspar in untreated sediments. We found statistically significant correlation between equivalent doses of (1) standard quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and range-finder feldspar infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) at 50 ºC, and (2) standard quartz OSL and range-finder quartz OSL in low-dose samples (<80 Gy). However, these correlations should only be considered as approximate whereby preparing more than three range-finder aliquots has the potential of yielding more accurate results. Correlation between the range-finder quartz OSL and range-finder feldspar IRSL is also significant. The rangefinder measurements can be used for approximate dose determination to preliminary assess the sediment age or as a selection tool to avoid incompletely bleached samples. The sedimentary environment and especially sediment reworking and transportation seem to influence these correlations. We consider the sediments studied here to have undergone between one and four reworking stages, and samples with repeated reworking usually represent well-bleached material for luminescence dating.",

    "abstract": "In Skrzelczyce Quarry, located in the southern part of the Holy Cross Mountains in central Poland, a large Upper Devonian carbonate mound is exposed. The Skrzelczyce mound, developed as massive and faintly bedded limestones, measures nearly 100 m in lateral extent and over 20 m in thickness, and laterally passes into coral-rich biostromal limestones belonging to the Sitkówka Beds. Four facies have been identified within the massive limestone unit: stromatactis-bearing limestones with scarce macrofossils (M1), macrofossil-rich limestones (M2), stromatoporoid-microbial limestones (M3), and limestones with fenestral structures (M4). These facies indicate varying depositional conditions and microbial activity, reflecting a complex interplay of environmental factors. The mound’s lithological features and spatial facies distribution resemble the late development stage of Devonian atolls in the Ardennes. This analogy suggests that the initial mound setting at Skrzelczyce might have been at depths of 30–60 m, in a moderate energy zone. The mound, composed predominantly of polygenetic biomicrite with a significant presence of laminar stromatoporoids and corals, features various forms of stromatactis, some typical and others related to sediment winnowing or to shelter cavities. The foraminiferal assemblages, along with lithostratigraphic correlation, suggest that the Skrzelczyce mound may belong to the lower to middle Frasnian, although the precise age remains uncertain due to the lack of conodont dating. The Skrzelczyce mound aligns with the definition of the Kadzielnia Member, and particular facies from Skrzelczyce can be matched with those described from the Kadzielnia Quarry. The structure outcropping in Skrzelczyce is the second largest Upper Devonian carbonate buildup after Kadzielnia in the Holy Cross Mountains, and the largest on the southern edge of the Kielce carbonate platform.",

    "abstract": "The Late Devonian Prypyat-Dnieper-Donets Rift is a significant tectonic structure on the East European platform. Devonian salt domes are extensively developed within the Rift and create a system of associated traps, which often accommodate oil and gas fields. Associated with these salt domes hydrothermal deposits and occurrences of mercury and base metals are also found in the south-eastern part of the Rift, near the Donets inversion-folded structure. Diapiric breccias (cap rocks) frequently contain fragments of various rocks, which remain poorly studied. The authors examined a fragment of metamorphosed mafic rock collected from a cap rock of the Bantysheve salt dome, situated in north-western Donbas, at the transition zone to the Dnieper Basin. The rock was identified as hornblende schist, metamorphosed at a relatively high temperature of 775–730℃ and low pressure of 1.4–1.0 kBar, corresponding to the hornfels facies of metamorphism. The U-Pb age of the metamorphic crystallisation of titanite from the schist was determined at 370 ± 17 Ma. This age matches the magmatism in the Prypyat-Dnieper- Donets Rift. Data obtained suggest that the most probable protolith for the studied schist is the Late Devonian picritic basalt or picritic dolerite, which is associated with the development of the Rift.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to assess the impact of various forms of anthropogenic pressure on selected karst springs in Poland, regarded as elements of “natural heritage”: Blue Springs, Goryczkowe Vauclusian Spring, and Zygmunt Spring. These springs are located in different regions of Poland and represent the most efficient karst springs in their respective areas, distinguished by exceptional aesthetic values and have been recognized as natural heritage sites and included in the international Most Important Karst Aquifer Springs (MIKAS) database or its national counterpart (NIKAS). A key factor differentiating these springs is the type of anthropogenic pressure exerted upon them. In the case of Blue Springs, located in central Poland near Tomaszów Mazowiecki, anthropopressure is manifested through modifications to the hydrological network and flow conditions due to attempts to extract groundwater for the municipal water supply of Łódź. Goryczkowe Vauclusian Spring, located in southern Poland within the Tatra National Park, is subject to indirect anthropogenic impact primarily via atmospheric deposition of pollutants originating from industrialized regions outside the park. For Zygmunt Spring, located in southern Poland, the dominant form of anthropopressure is intensive tourism. Despite its status as a nature reserve, the area has suffered from a reduction in biodiversity and poor water quality, particularly in terms of bacteriological status. Despite ongoing pro-environmental efforts, environmental changes around all the studied springs are evident and scientifically confirmed. Although the springs’ location within parks or reserves does not shield them from long-range atmospheric pollution, it does provide a level of protection by limiting both water usage and land development, generally restricted to tourism and sightseeing. Nevertheless, risks associated with tourism management must be acknowledged, including increased water demand, wastewater and solid waste generation, as well as non-compliance with regulations governing protected areas (e.g., destruction of unique vegetation).",

In the previous works, at least one of the barite generations has been interpreted as a result of crystallization from rising hydrothermal solutions. Detailed studies of fluid inclusions in all barites from the Bahariya Oasis prove that they have crystallized from solutions of meteoric origin. Three generations of fluid inclusions have been distinguished. Two of them are related to the barite crystallization and its progressive coalescence and recrystallization; these are predominantly liquid filled. The third generation is connected with infiltration of ascending solutions of meteoric origin; it includes both liquid and gas/liquid inclusions. On the basis of this study the possible mechanism responsible for the formation of gas/liquid inclusions under low temperature conditions is presented.",

The question has been elaborated mainly from the stratigraphic point of view. It summarizes the results of the works of seven authors (Dudaronek 1966, Dudek 1966, Grzybowski 1966, Roslaniec-Chodnikiewicz 1966, Rywocka-Kenig 1966, Stawin 1966, Wysoczanski-Minkowicz 1966), which are published in the present issue of Acta Geologica Polonica. They have been prepared, under the guidance of Professor Dr. S. Z. Rozycki, as diploma works for the master's degree at the Chair of Quaternary Geology of the Warsaw University. The writer was in charge of the students' field work. The data supplied by the students' works are supplemented by the observations and more detailed field investigations of the present writer herself. The Pleistocene of the discussed area is represented by the Eopleistocene so called Preglacial series of fluvial accumulation, and by two series of glacial origin separated by interglacial (s.c. Great Interglacial) erosional surface and interglacial deposits accumulated mainly in water environments. The older glacial series corresponds to the Cracovian (Mindel) Glaciation, while the younger one is connected with the Middle Polish (Riss) Glaciation. The latter shows clearly two horizons representing two glacistadials namely the Radomka- and the Warta Glacistadial. These glacial horizons are separated by interstadial series of fluvial and fluvioglacial accumulation. The glacial horizon of the Warta Glacistadial occurs commonly on the surface of the area (tabl. I), being represented by boulder clay as well as by numerous forms of glacial accumulation such as end-moraines, eskers and kames.",

This oscillation was probably responsible for a lowering of the water table in the basin and for an agglomeration of peat in the whole basin or at least a part of it.

    "abstract": "Morphometric attributes of 705 stromatoporoid specimens from a number of exposures from the Silurian of Podolia (Ukraine) and the Devonian of the Holy Cross Mountains (Poland), representing a wide array of shallow water carbonate sedimentary environments, have been analysed. Taken into account were such parameters as: general shape of the skeleton, shape of the final growth form (living surface profile), upper surface character, latilaminae arrangement, burial ratio and type of initial surface. A number of new ratios has been introduced, designed mainly to improve the mapping of the outlines of the stromatoporoids upper surfaces. All studied specimens were treated as belonging to one group, and relations between particular attributes were tested. The results were analysed in terms of potential environmental factors influencing stromatoporoid morphometric features. Most of the distinguished attributes are common in the studied group and occur in various combinations, with an important exception of parameters designed to reflect the shape of the skeleton’s upper surface, which are distinctly predominated by convex variants. This indicates that surface concavity was a highly undesired feature among stromatoporoids. Upper surface convexity is interpreted herein as a response to the hazard of clogging of the animals pores by tiny sediment particles suspended in the bottom turbid water layer. Common low burial ratios of final living surface profiles and the occurrence of specimens with a smooth upper surface but a non-enveloping latilaminae arrangement are other reflections of this phenomenon. Burial by sediments and redeposition were also important factors governing stromatoporoid development. No direct arguments indicating photosensitivity of stromatoporoids can be deduced from the presented results. The hitherto postulated allometric tendency among stromatoporoids of starting growth as laminar forms and later adopting consecutively higher profile shapes has not been confirmed here. On the contrary, a tendency for gradual elimination of very high profile forms with increasing stromatoporoid size has been observed. The final shape of a stromatoporoid skeleton was always an effect of a combination of various agents.",

New seismic 3D, well and field data were used to define the relationship between sedimentation and tectonic activity and to establish the synkinematic context of the Rzeszów basin-fill architecture. The basin evolution was controlled by the activity of the Carpathian frontal thrust and hinterland thrusts developed in the forelimbs of folds in the Skole thrust sheet, bounding the basin from the north and south, respectively. The activity of the frontal thrust resulted in hinterland-directed depocentre migration and tilting of the syntectonic stratigraphic sequence. Balanced cross-sections have indicated that during the last compressive stage of deformation, the syntectonic deposits filling the basin were shortened by c. 5%, which resulted in the formation of folds and contractional faults. The architecture of the syntectonic deposits and the development of contractional structures reflect the activity of thrusts bounding the basin during compressive deformation of the Carpathian orogenic belt.",

Ctenacanthus Agassiz, 1837 is recorded from the lower and middle Famennian of the central and north-western parts of the area. Sculptospina makhlaevi Lebedev gen. et sp. nov. originates from the lower Famennian of the Lipetsk Region. The holotype of ‘Ctenacanthus’ jaekeli Gross, 1933 and a new specimen from the upper Famennian of the South Urals are shown to belong to the same taxon, which is transferred to Acondylacanthus St. John and Worthen, 1875. New specimens of Tuberospina nataliae Lebedev, 1995 from the upper Famennian of Central Russia are described in detail. The newly presented material increases our knowledge of the composition of Famennian marine assemblages from the East European Platform. It is suggested that these assemblages may be classified as chondrichthyan-dominated and dipnoan-dominated. Hypothetically, after the end- Devonian Hangenberg extinction event, which affected numerous secondary consumers in vertebrate communities, some chondrichthyan groups could have encroached to take advantage of previously occupied ecological niches. Ctenacanthus, as well as Acondylacanthus and Amelacanthus survived the end-Devonian mass extinction to continue into the Carboniferous.",

The paper presents 8 taxa belonging to 4 genera (one new to science): Boxaster gen. nov., Noviaster Valette, 1929, Tylasteria Valette, 1929, Valettaster Lambert, 1914, and 4 families: Astropectinidae Gray, 1840, Goniasteridae Forbes, 1841, Sphaerasteridae Schöndorf, 1906 and Stauranderasteridae Spencer, 1913.

Two species are new: Valettaster planus sp. nov. and Boxaster wapienensis gen. et sp. nov. The Jurassic starfish assemblage recognised from the Wapienno/Bielawy succession is interpreted as an offshore starfish fauna with the admixture of allochtonous shallow-water taxa. The lithology of the source deposits indicates their transport by storm agitation and/or mass movements. This fact strongly influenced the preservation state, all collected plates being disarticulated and most of them abraded.",

The corals described herein include 12 species representing the genera Ankhelasma Sando, 1961, Bradyphyllum Grabau, 1928, Caninophyllum Lewis, 1929, Cyathaxonia Michelin, 1847, Ekvasophyllum Parks, 1951, Enniskillenia Kabakovich in Soshkina et al., 1962, Vesiculophyllum Easton, 1944 and Zaphrentites Hudson, 1941. Two of these species are new (Ankhelasma canadense sp. nov. and Ekvasophyllum variabilis sp. nov.) and 6 taxa are described in open nomenclature. The distribution and relative abundance of solitary Rugosa in Europe and the Liard Basin confirm the geographical proximity of those areas and the open marine communication between them during the early Carboniferous. It therefore represents an important contribution to the determination of the time of isolation of the western Laurussia shelf fauna from that of southeastern Laurussia, as well as the time of the possible emergence of species from southeastern Laurussia into the western Laurussia seas. Of particular importance here are cosmopolitan taxa and the timing of their disappearance from the fossil record.",

Quantitative analysis of nannofossil assemblages has shown the dominance of cold water species (up to 50%), e.g., Micula decussata Vekshina, 1959, Prediscosphaera spp., Arkhangelskiella spp., Calculites obscurus (Deflandre) Prins and Sissingh in Sissingh, 1977 and Lucianorhabdus cayeuxii Deflandre, 1959. In the early Maastrichtian, the studied area was more influenced by cool water masses from the Boreal Province rather than by warm water from the Tethyan Province. The significant predominance of cold water taxa and the elevated presence of Prediscosphaera cretacea (Arkhangelsky) Gartner, 1968 also supports the hypothesis of climate cooling in the early Maastrichtian.",

It is connected with the spatangoid echinoid burrow Scolicia de Quatrefages, 1849 and interpreted as a resting trace of the same tracemaker produced after moving up from a deeper position within the sediment. The resting is caused by an episode of unfavourable conditions related to shallowing of the redox boundary. The trace fossil is a component of the Nereites ichnofacies.",

In the first of them the typical minerals are bukovskýite and melanterite. The second group of secondary arsenates includes scorodite, kaňkite, zýkaite, and pitticite. The third assemblage includes Co-Ni-Mg arsenates of the erythrite-annabergite-hörnesite series. The first assemblage crystallized in a zone with a very high activity of sulphate and arsenate ions and where the pH varies within a narrow range of 2.0–3.5. The second group of secondary arsenates formed in the acidic zone. The minerals identified here suggest pH variation within fairly wide ranges, from about 2.0 to 5.5. Contrary to the first and second mineral assemblage, the Co-Ni-Mg arsenates formed under different geochemical conditions. Their crystallization took place under weak acidic to neutral conditions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of seismostratigraphic interpretation of the Upper Cretaceous sedimentary succession preserved within two synclines flanking the Szamotuły diapir in northwestern Poland. This succession is characterized by a complex Santonian–Campanian internal geometry characteristic of contourites – that is, deposits formed by contour (bottom) currents. The aim of the present paper is to document these contourites using 2D seismic reflection profiles calibrated by the Obrzycko 1 well. The contourite drifts in the immediate vicinity of the Szamotuły structure exhibit elongated mounded shapes, with adjacent concave moats. At greater distances from the diapir, gradual aggradational patterns are observed. The formation of these Santonian– Campanian contourites was associated with growth of the Szamotuły diapir during regional compression and Polish Basin inversion. These contour currents and associated contourites formed an integral part of a regional axial depositional system developed within the flanks of the Mid-Polish Anticlinorium. Furthermore, this paper discusses the potential role of contourites as palaeomorphological indicators of palaeoslopes in varied geodynamics settings, such as inverting sedimentary basins, as opposed to the passive margins upon which they have been most commonly documented.",

We assume that this controversial unit was deposited before the main latest Cenomanian–early Turonian transgression. The spit bars were likely overgrown by vascular plants during their emergence in the late Cenomanian, and then inundated during the latest Cenomanian and early Turonian transgressive phases. The studied deposits had been intensively bioturbated, and the cf.

Comparison with specimens from the type locality of the type species of the genus Laqueoserpula Lommerzheim, 1979 confirms the affiliation of the Bohemian species to this genus. The simple prismatic (SP) ultrastructure of the tube wall of L. reussi agrees with an assignment to the tribe Serpulini Rafinesque, 1815. In the Upper Cretaceous, representatives of Laqueoserpula are exclusively found in nearshore deposits, where they are accompanied by a high diverse marine invertebrate fauna. By its compact, large and robust tube forming a spiral and extremely thick tube wall, L. reussi was well-adapted to live in nearshore high energy environments, where its tube could be encrusted by bryozoans, brachiopods and oysters, and infested by hydroids and borers.",

They correspond well with the latest Silurian/earliest Devonian palaeoinclination obtained from the Bardo diabase (Holy Cross Mts.), and with those calculated from the Apparent Polar Wander Path for palaeocontinent Baltica. All compared intrusions represent the late Caledonian magmatic event that can be linked with the back-arc extension in the marginal part of the Old Red Continent. The angle between declinations of the latest Silurian/earliest Devonian normal polarity component “A” and the latest Carboniferous/earliest Permian secondary reversed polarity component “B”, both isolated from the Chrząstowice diabase, indicate the lack of palaeomagnetically detectable clockwise tectonic rotations of the Upper Silesia Tectonic Block with respect to stable Europe at least after the Silurian. However, a slight (up to a dozen or so degrees) anti-clockwise rotation of local sense cannot be excluded after the earliest Permian. The distribution of magnetic fabric points to the sill form of both studied intrusions.",

The section covers the lower and upper Berriasian (Calpionella and Calpionellopsis Zones respectively), however due to a thrust fault, the upper part of the Calpionella elliptica Subzone and the lower part of the Calpionellopsis simplex Subzone (lower/upper Berriasian boundary interval) were not documented. Reslults of GRS measurements reveal contrasting trends, with low detrital input (K, Th) and elevated Th/K ratio through the lower Berriasian, as well as relatively high detrital input and decreased Th/K ratio within the upper Berriasian. The differences occur also in the calpionellid frequencies and species richness: assemblages rich in Calpionella alpina dominate in the lower Berriasian, whilst more diversified yet less abundant associations characterize the upper Berriasian. Trends in palaeoenvironmental proxies correspond well with data from the Lower Sub-Tatric succession (Pośrednie-Rówienka composite section, Tatra Mts, Poland). The palaeoenvironmental change between the early and late Berriasian is most probably related to palaeoclimate (arid to humid transition), and fertility (from oligo- to mesotrophic regime). Trends documented in Th/K ratio might have been controlled by the intensity of aeolian transportation. As revealed by previous studies, the consistent record of palaeoenvironmental changes in both the Tisza Mega-unit and the Central Western Carpathians might be observed also in the middle Jurassic sediments.",

This pattern, classified as an ichnofossil, taxonomically new, Clavatulicola evaephilus ichnogen. et ichnosp.n., bears its specific name referring to the clavatulid species Clavatula evae (HOERNES & AUINGER, 1891), upon whose shells it was first presented over a century ago from Grund in the Vienna Basin, Austria. Within rich gastropod assemblages from Korytnica in the Holy Cross Mountains, Central Poland, containing a dozen or so clavatulid species, the newly established ichnotaxon is confined exclusively to the four species, viz. Clavatula evae (100% of shells infested), Cl. styriaca (100%), Cl. asperulata (92%), and Cl. suturalis (72%), what indicates a very high host specifity of the ichnofossil-producing commensals. As the potential producers of the ichnofossil pattern briefly discussed are the folliculinid infusorians and the phoronids.

The origin of the Cracow Canyon has been initiated at the Tertiary decline, and during the Quaternary the Canyon has been deepened due to the activity of meltwaters coming from the snow deposited on the flat surfaces around its upper part. Numerous caves preserved in the cliffs of the Canyon are remnants of underground tributary flows. The deepest, lower part of the Canyon originated in result of a collapse of a cave collecting the meltwaters.",

    "abstract": "The causes of historical climate changes are a continuing subject of heated discussions, in which political and economical aspects often dominate over the climatological facts. Although it seems indisputable that the discussed changes are a reality, the basic controversy concerns the influence of human activity on their magnitude. Geologists have entered into the discussion relatively late, but they have clearly widened the range of the discussion by the addition of climate changes recorded in various Phanerozoic successions. The present book perfectly fits in the mainstream of this discussion. The attractive book title, suggesting analysis of climate throughout the Palaeozoic, does not correspond very accurately to its content. In fact, the book focuses on the climatic changes only of the Late Palaeozoic, particularly those which occurred during the last 100 Ma of the Carboniferous and the Permian. This was really a very specific period of Earth’s history; comprising a geographically extensive and longlasting glaciation followed by a time of dry and hot climate. Simultaneously, geotectonical processes led to numerous changes of continent configurations and sea level, and finally to the greatest mass extinction in Phanerozoic history. There are numerous and readily recognizable indirect indications of Earth’s climate changes in the stratigraphic record of the interval under discussion. The book came about from the palaeoclimatic session held at the European Geosiences Union General Assembly Conference in Vienna (2011) and includes 22 papers. As usual, in the case of such sets of papers, their correspondence with the main subject of the book is variable. In a few cases, the main subject of the paper is strictly sedimentological, stratigraphical or regional, and any climatic aspects seem to have been added as an afterthought. However, such papers are the exception, and most of the papers concentrate largely on discussion of past climate changes.  All of the papers are grouped formally in five chapters but they can actually be classified into three main topics: general remarks on the Late Palaeozoic climate, stratigraphy and palaeogeography; Carboniferous case studies; and Permian case studies. Incidentally, the book editors were not particularly attached to the chapter subdivision, because the chapter titles are presented only on the contents page, and not in the text.  The choice of the four papers that open the book is very sound and the papers are particularly informative. H. Wofner analysed climate changes and their edimentological record in the Carboniferous–Permian time interval. This is a very competent synthesis of recent knowledge of the development of the Carboniferous–Permian glaciation and it provides a brief description of the key world sections, an excellent starting point for further reading of regional case studies. Extremely interesting in the context of present-day discussion is the final conclusion that the variations in CO 2  concentrations are not a very convincing cause of global temperature changes. As it proved in the case of the Quaternary glaciation, “rising temperature preceded the increase of atmospheric CO 2  ”. According to this author, the causes of climatic changes are evidently more complex and were caused by ...forces emanating from our galaxy (cosmic ray influx, magnetic intensity, gravitational vectors) and their variation over the course of a galactic year (the time for the solar system to orbit the core of the galaxy)”. X. Wang and an assembly of Chinese and Japanese authors summarized the state of knowledge of the Carboniferous of South China. They presented a description of evolving brachiopod, fusulinacean and conodont assemblages in Chinese sections in the context of climate change. Although the paper could be assigned to the group of papers where the climatic context is of secondary importance, the article is an extremely useful synthesis of modern knowledge of the Chinese Carboniferous. Similarly synthetic in character is the paper by Zubin-Stathopoulos et al. on the Pennsylvanian–Permian carbonates in the north-west part of Pangea. The general subject of their observations is the very broad interval starting from the Serpukchovian (upper part of the Mississippian) and ending in the latest Permian in the classical region of east-central British Columbia. Microfacies analysis enabled warm and cold climatic zones to be distinguished and to be assigned to the changing palaeogeographies. The last of the papers included in the basic chapter is dedicated to a summary of the Zechstein magnetostratigraphy. M. Szurlies showed that the duration of the Zechstein (max. 3.5 Ma) was shorter than hitherto accepted and that the Permian/Triassic boundary was located within the continental deposits of the lowermost Buntsandstein. This conclusion had been proposed earlier by some Polish stratigraphers, and it was satisfactory that this hypothesis was now confirmed by magnetostratigraphic data. The second basic set of articles is connected with the Carboniferous and the Pennsylvanian/Permian boundary interval, i.e. with the time of the great ondwana Glaciation. In continental sections the recognition of climatic changes is difficult and therefore it is not surprising that most of the investigations are concentrated on eustatically controlled sedimentary cyclicity resulting from changes in volume of the southern continental ice sheet. Direct consideration of climate variations appears almost by accident in this chapter, and at times this gives the impression that climatic conclusions were added at the request of the reviewers or editors. Nevertheless, there are at least two papers, which describe very precise methodological tools. The first one (U. Gebhardt and M. Hiete) is devoted to the Carboniferous of the Saale Basin (Germany) and proposes an interesting procedure for distinguishing between auto- and allocyclicity in continental red beds of the Variscan intermontane basin (Pennsylvanian). The second one (M. Waksmundzka) is an example of the application of sequence stratigraphy in the correlation of Carboniferous sections between eastern Poland and western Europe, with innovative conclusions on the continuity of sedimentation. Neither paper concentrates on climate issues but they are both very interesting methodological contributions to stratigraphy. The last set of the papers is the most extensive and concentrates on Permian topics. They include direct climate-related interpretations based on geochemical analysis and provide quantitive data of specific climatic components. The best example is the analysis of carbon and oxygen stable isotopes in samples from brachiopod shells by J.K. Nielsen et al., which enabled recognition of seasonal climate changes in two different geographical zones, represented by Spitsbergen (20oN–45oN during the Permian) and Central Poland (Kajetanow – 30o farther to the south). Equally interesting is H. Kiersnowski’s paper, with the reconstruction of wind directions, dependent on climatic fluctuations during the Permian in western Poland. This is a very elegant example of the application of pure sedimentological data to the interpretation of past climates. Another example of such climatic implications drawn from sedimentological observations is the interpretation by G. Czapowski and H. Tomassi-Morawiec of the bromine content in salt, the key supposition being the connection of this indicator with variations in climate humidity. This part of the book is very well integrated and the component papers have been carefully selected. This most probably results from the personal interest of the book editors, A. Gąsiewicz and M. Slowakiewicz, whose scientific activity is focused on the widely interpreted geology of the Southern European Permian Basin. Their joint article, in the final part of the book, is devoted to the nature of hydrocarbons in the Zechstein Main Dolomite of Poland. In contrast to the older hypothesis on the Carboniferous source of the hydrocarbons, they argued that the majority of the hydrocarbons derived from in situ organic matter.  The quoted examples, although selected slightly tendentiously, confirm the general impression after reading the book that strict climatic considerations constitute the addenda rather than the basic conclusions. However, this does not reduce the importance of this valuable and useful book. It is especially worthwhile for all geologists who investigate Late Palaeozoic successions. In conclusion, this excellent set of case studies can be thoroughly recommended and it needs to be in all institutional libraries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper presents spatial analysis and numerical methods to describe the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions in a groundwater system. The research was conducted in the northern part of the Białystok High Plane, eastern Poland, within a Quaternary multi-aquifer system. Spatial analysis was used for imaging the quasi-continuous structure of the system based on a discrete set of hydrogeological data. A high-resolution regional flow model was used to identify the groundwater discharge and discharge zones of the individual aquifers. Calculations have shown a marked asymmetry of the flow system. Deeply incised river valleys in the Niemen River basin more strongly affect the groundwater than the discharge zones in the valleys of the Vistula River basin. As a result, the underground watershed in deeper aquifers is clearly shifted westward in relation to the morphological watershed. The hydrodynamic conditions of the system determined by numerical methods were used to identify the points along the groundwater flow-path for the hydrochemical study. It was the basis for the identification of points located along the groundwater flow direction, which were used in the hydrochemical study. Computational schemes of water solution models were calculated for the quasi-equilibrium state of chemical reactions between the solution and the solid and gaseous phases. Presentation of the chemical reactions allowed determining the origin of changes in the concentrations of individual components dissolved in groundwater. It was found that kaolinitization, i.e. chemical weathering of feldspars and plagioclases is the basic process that most affects the groundwater chemistry.",

    "abstract": "This volume 1 is dedicated to the memory of William Aubrey “Bill” Cobban, a great scientist and a great man, a giant of the US Western Interior Cretaceous studies and of ammonite paleontology. This is the collection 1 of contributions assembled by his friends, colleagues and followers. William A. Cobban died peacefully on April 21, 2015 at the age of 98. Bill was born on December 31, 1916 in Anaconda, in Montana, and raised in nearby Great Falls. After graduating from the University of Montana in Missoula, in 1940, he started working for Carter Oil Company (now Exxon Mobile). In 1946 he enrolled at John Hopkins University, and obtained his Ph.D. in 1949. He began his long career at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1948 and maintained his position and connections to the Survey until shortly before his death. During his long scientific life Bill published more than 300 papers on the ammonites and other molluscs, and stratigraphy of the Cretaceous, first of all of the US Western Interior, but also of the American Gulf and Atlantic coasts. He published a series of benchmark papers, including those on scaphitid ammonites of the Colorado Shale (his doctoral thesis topic); the cephalopods of the Mowry Shale (with J.B. Reeside); the biostratigraphy of the Pierre Shale (with Jim Gill); numerous papers on the biostratigraphy and ammonites of the entire succession at Pueblo (with Glenn Scott and Jim Kennedy); the general paper on ammonite paleobiology (with Jim Kennedy); the correlation of the Upper Cretaceous of the North American Cretaceous with that of Europe (with Jake Hancock and Jim Kennedy); on the Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point for the base of the Turonian Stage at Pueblo, Colorado (with Jim Kennedy and Irek Walaszczyk); on the Upper Cretaceous geochronology (with John Obradovich); on the Upper Cretaceous inoceramids (with Irek Walaszczyk and Peter Harries); on the unconformities in the Upper Cretaceous of the Western Interior (with Al Merewether); and many more. For his monumental work Bill received many honors and medals, including Meritorious Service Award (1974), the Distinguished Geologist Pioneer Award (1985), the Paleontological Medal (1985), the Distinguished Service Award (1986), the Raymond C. Moore Paleontology Medal (1990), the Gilbert Harries Award from the Paleontological Research Institute (1996), in 2004 he was honored during the 6th International Cephalopod Symposium for his studies on the Late Cretaceous ammonites of North America, and in 2006 he received the Dallas Peck Outstanding Scientist Award from the U.S. Geological Survey. Bill was honored by 4 genera of ammonites, 17 species of invertebrates, and one genus of fossil plant, named after him. Bill was a generous and friendly man, ready to share his scientific knowledge and experience with his colleagues and friends. He always had time for amateurs, who enjoyed visiting him and learned so much from him. Bill was among the most distinguished palaeontologists who worked for the United States Geological Survey. We all miss his advice and wisdom, and are honored to have worked with him. ------------------------------ 1 This memorial volume will appear in two parts; part 1 published herewith, and the second part, which will be published as the first issue of Acta Geologica Polonica for 2017.",

    "abstract": "Professor Henryk Makowski died on 30th January, 1997. The Polish scientific community is proud of his world-famous discoveries on ammonoid biology. His theory of sexual dimorphism in ammonites gained him a wide reputation among fellow scientists. His scientific works rest mostly within the realm of paleontology. Only while working on paleontological questions did he touch stratigraphic problems, perhaps because he mostly had to do with condensed deposits, often containing mixed faunas. Only his lectures and handbooks reveal his deep stratigraphic insights. There are no longer any geologists alive who would remember Henryk Makowski in his youth. He was born in 1910 in Volhynia, in a part of Europe especially hard hit by the historical cataclysms of the first half of the twentieth century. He grew up in Krzemieniec, where he attended the well-known Liceum Krzemienieckie. Later, he studied geology and palaeontology at the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius (now Lithuania) and the Jan Kazimierz University in Lvov (now Ukraine). He was employed at Lvov University shortly before World War II, while he was still a student, and he graduated not long after the Soviet invasion of 1939. During the Soviet occupation he worked for an enterprise prospecting for coal in the Carboniferous near the Bug River, and later, during the German occupation, he was employed in the Amt fur Bodenforschung. By the end of the war he was in Warsaw and, since in the aftermath of the war there was no point in returning to his homeland, he remained in Poland. He actually began his research work and his scientific career at the age of 35. He was a senior researcher in the Maria Curie-SkΠodowska University in Lublin for some time, but by the end of 1945 he had moved to the University of Warsaw, after his Lvov mentor, the late Prof. Jan Samsonowicz. The University, like the city itself, was just beginning to rise from the rubble left after the war, and the decimated scientific staff had first to bring it back to life. The palaeontological teaching collection originated from the fire-blackened fossils that Makowski dug out from the ruins and ashes of the Geology Laboratory. He needed to find a new research topic. First, he turned to the stratigraphy of the Jurassic from boreholes in Eastern Poland. Then he became fascinated by the exquisitely preserved ammonite fauna from the ¸ukow erratic mass, left by the Scandinavian ice-sheet in the Pleistocene. He devoted his monograph “La faune Callovienne de ¸ukow en Pologne” to these fossils, for which he was granted a PhD in paleontology in 1951. Detailed studies of this wonderfully preserved material directed him towards studies of the sexual dimorphism in ammonites. These studies became his lifetime fascination and rewarded him with his greatest successes. Sexual dimorphism had already been suggested by earlier ammonite researchers, but it was Makowski who analysed the phenomenon in depth and presented a strong case for it, supported by elaborate arguments. Much of his evidence came from biometric analysis of the ontogenetic development of the shell. He did not restrict his interests to the ¸ukow ammonites, but also undertook research on large numbers of specimens collected from numerous Devonian and Jurassic sites. The results were published in 1962, and his monograph Problem of sexual dimorphism in ammonites, published in Palaeontologia Polonica, opened a new chapter in ammonoid biology. It was acclaimed by the world experts in the field. This monumental opus set the limit to Prof. Makowski’s ambitions. He continued research aimed at further development of the discoveries presented in the monograph, but his later work was hindered by his long illness. He regarded only high level scientific questions as worthy of his attention. He published minor papers with great reluctance and, in fact, he wrote only a few of them following the monograph on sexual dimorphism. His last publication, on dimorphism and evolution in the goniatite Tornoceras, appeared in the Acta Palaeontologica Polonica in 1991. Scientific research was his main goal; he regarded a formal academic career with warm-hearted irony and the detachment that was so typical of him. Students knew him as a popular and highly regarded lecturer, as well as an editor and co-author of historical geology textbooks. To his younger colleagues, he was a Professor, head of the Historical and Regional Geology Laboratory, and Dean of the Faculty of Geology of the University of Warsaw. He did not push forward his own opinions; he approached everyone with attention and respect, was simple and honest. All who knew him remember him as a man of great wisdom, modesty, and goodness. Professor Henryk Makowski (1910-1997) the Editor of Acta Geologica Polonica in the period 1976-1981, remains for ever in our memory as a man of the greatest intellect, the author of his Opus Magnum on sexual dimorphism in ammonites (1962). He was also an unforgettable person, both as a scientist, and as an academic teacher. Our own personal contact with him dates back to the early 1960s, when we were post-graduate students interested in highly fossiliferous localities. It soon appeared that our interest fitted in perfectly with his own plans, and he cordially invited a group of like-minded students to join him on his fieldtrips to Łukow. In the 1960s Professor Henryk Makowski was still the youngest of all the professors of our Faculty, and the only one who systematically searched all of the fossiliferous exposures, particularly his favourite locality, Łukow. At a time when the ‘goldrush’ of amateurs to collect everything in sight was still unknown, the weekend trips to Łukow in the autumn or early springtime were always very productive. The concretions waiting for us in huge heaps after the autumn rains or the spring thaw could be cracked open systematically in order to find those with a pearly ammonite inside. Professor Makowski was invariably optimistic that we would find something exciting, either ammonite species new for the locality (e.g. of the genera Hecticoceras, Choffatia, Grossouvria), or complete specimens of the greatest rarities, known formerly only from small fragments, like almost a giant genus Collotites. He was especially keen on finding juvenile shells of the nautilid Cenoceras that preserved details, such as the cicatrix, indicative of their hatching from eggs. To keep our hammering under control, he regularly called for a break, so that he could serve to us with cups of the delicious hot coffee that he always kept with him in one or two vacuum flasks. A sudden fall in production at the ¸ukow brick-kiln in the early 1970s, and the subsequent flooding of the pits by rainwater, brought that period in our lives to an end. Fortunately, after ¸ukow was lost to science, he was still able to demonstrate his ideas on ammonoid and molluscan palaeobiology to us at other localities. During our geological excursions we were always amazed at his wide knowledge of subjects outside geology. Any living creature found in the field became the subject of a lecture leading us through meanders of interrelated scientific disciplines. Architectural monuments were also commented on with a deep understanding of their historical background. The Professor was also known as a person who looked at everything with great detachment. He was a simple and decent man. He hated anything that was the slightest bit “bombastic”. He must also be remembered as a leading author and editor. We were always very impressed by his great accuracy when preparing illustrations, both line-drawings and photos, to demonstrate the details of his favorite ammonites. Professor Henryk Makowski actually published only a small number of papers. He was always aware of, and was actually rather proud of, his inability to write ‘trivial’ papers. It is easy to imagine that some people must have regarded him, in medieval terminology, as a Homo Uni Libri - a man of one book only, obviously the monograph on sexual dimorphism. His editorial skill when he was coordinator and editor of the academic textbook on Historical Geology (published 1977), and Editor of Acta Geologica Polonica during the years 1976-1981, was widely recognized. When his health failed rapidly, and we took over the editing of the journal from him, we found that his experience and advice were invariably very helpful.",

Impacts of heavy groundwater pumping on hydrogeological conditions in Libya: Past and present development and future prognosis on a regional scale. Acta Geologica Polonica, 63 (2), 283-296. Warszawa. Libya, like many other regions with arid climates, suffers from inadequate water resources to cover all the needs of this rapidly developing country. Increasing amounts of water are needed to supply the population, as well as for agricultural irrigation and industrial use. As groundwater is the main water source in the country, it represents a natural resource of the highest economic and social importance. Conceptual and numerical models were implemented on a regional scale to show how the natural situation has changed following heavy groundwater abstraction during the last decades in the northwestern part of the country. The results of the numerical model indicated that the current zones of depression of the piezometric surface could have been caused by smaller withdrawn amounts than previously estimated. The differences in the assessed withdrawn groundwater volumes seem to be quite high and might have a considerable influence on the future possibilities of groundwater use in the study region.",

Nine samples have been taken from the cored parts (Table 1), out of which seven have yielded a very rich and excellently preserved micropaleontological  assemblage indicating the Carixian-Domerian age. Within the Polish territory, Liassic sedimentation occurred in a fresh-water basin (Fig. 1). These areas were invaded by the sea only from the NW through the Kujavian-Pomeranian furrow. During the Carixian and the Domerian this region must have communicated both with the sea of northern and western Europe as well as with the Alpine geosyncline. This is reasonably suggested by the presence in the profile here considered of numerous  Foniminifera species; which occur in those areas too. The sea was shallow and off-shore as is indicated by the occurrence of megaspores, plant fossils and a fair abundance of OphthaImidiuam (a genus reported from shallow seas). Diagrams in Figs 2 and 3 show the percent content changes in the vertical section of the more interesting microfossil groups. These lead to suppositions (of minor importance) concerning changes in the sea depths and in the coastline in that part of the basin here under consideration. Increased numbers of foraminifers from the family Nodosariidae suggest increasing depth while greater number of agglutinated foraminifers suggest sea shallowing. An increase in the numbers of megaspores and plant remains suggests an approach to the coastline.",

    "abstract": "Stratigraphy of the bunter in the SW margin of the Fore-Sudetic Monocline The stratigraphy of the Bunter from 3 borehole profiles in the SW margin of the Fore-Sudetic monocline is here described on the basis of megaspores and the cyclic sequence of lithological assemblages. Two index megaspore· assemblages have been differentiated, viz. the Otynisporites eotriassicus , characteristic of the lower oolithic beds of the Lower Bunter, and Trileites validus , an index assemblage of the Rot. The absence of megaspores associated with the megaspore assemblage I (Fuglewicz 1973a) and the mode of development of the deposits here under consideration suggest the existence of a stratigraphic lacuna involving the upper oolithic beds and the supra-oolithic Bunter beds. The object of the present paper is to describe the stratigraphy of the Bunter in the SW margin of the Fore-Sudetic monocline, as based on megaspores and the cyclic sequence of lithological assemblages. The stratigraphic division of the deposits here considered is that accepted by Fuglewicz (1973a). The material needed for the investigation work has been obtained from 3 boreholes drilled· by the Geological Institute: Przesieczna 1, Steszow IG-1 and Czernczyce IG-1. Sub-oolitic, lower-oolitic and inter-oolitic Bunter beds have been differentiated within the. profiles under consideration, while the Rot is observed to consist of sub-gypsum, lower gypsum, inter-gypsum, upper-gypsum and supra-gypsum beds. The occurrence· of megaspores has been observed in the lower-oolitic beds of the Bunter and in the Rot deposits. The megaspore assemblage from the lower-oolitic beds, the first to be worked out, is the oldest one so far reported from the Bunter. The Otynisporites eotriassicus assemblage consists· of three megaspore species: Trileites vulgaris Fugl. the predominant Otynisporites eotriassicus Fugl. and Hughesisporites simplex Fugl. The megaspore assemblage occurring in the Rot, previously differentiated by the writer as the megaspore assemblage II (Fuglewiczb1973 a), has now been assigned the name of Trileites validus Fugl. This assemblage consists of 6 megaspore species. Trileites validus Fugl. is the predominant one, Narkisporites brevispinosus Fugl. is less numerous while Bacutriletes insolitus Fugl., B. asuphus Fugl., Narkisporites sp., Dijkstraisporites sp., Erlansonisporites licheniformis Fugl. and Aneuletes rotundus Fugl. occur sporadically. Comparisons of the Bunter megaspore assemblages supplemented by the writer's observations lead to the conclusion that the occurrence of some species is distinctly connected with facial development. In the marine (Rot) deposits the dominance is observed of the smooth megaspores ( Trileites validus Fugl.), while ornamented megaspores as a rule predominate in the limnic sediments (comp. the olenekian mega-spores of NE Poland (Fuglewicz 1973a). The absence of megaspores contained in the megaspores assemblage I (Fuglewicz 1973a), also the facial analysis of the Bunter deposits here considered, suggest a stratigraphic lacuna (Hardegsen disconformity) in the analyzed profiles involving the Middle Bunter (upper-oolitic and supra-oolitic beds).",

Several regional dislocations, connected with the evolution of the Carpathian foredeep, have been noted in the Mesozoic-Paleozoic substratum. The contact area of the Inner Carpathians with the Outer Carpathians, c. 8 km in width, comprising the Pieniny Klippen Belt and the southern part of the Magura unit, has been interpreted as the consuming plate margin of the Euro-Asiatic plate in the Cretaceous and Tertiary time. Processes taking place in the southern part of the Outer Carpathians Flysch geosynclines have led to the consumption of the plate margin owing to subcrustal convecotion currents while the Flysch of the northern part of the geosyncline has been overthrust northwards. In the light of the presented interpretation the presence of autochtonous Flysch deposits under the Carpathian overthrust seems hardly admissible.",

A profile of Mesozoic deposits, about 2 m. thick, has been exposed there at the bottom of a basalt quarry. A thin bed of contact-metamorphic rock overlies the contact of basalt with the underlying Mesozoic deposits. Subcircular concretions of loam altered through thermic metamorphism, averaging 6 cm. in diameter, occur within this bed. One of the concretions, probably owing its origin to the contact of the Mesozoic with the Carboniferous, has been found to consist of Carboniferous greywacke with argillaceous fossiIiferous shale. The underlying rocks also display contact metamorphism. They have developed as smoky grey argillaceous shale with rod-Iike or salty cleavage and a low mica content. The rods and plates are arranged perpendicularly to the contact surface with basalt. The thickness of these shales is about 20 cm. Underlying them are non-bedded dark grey loams with poorly distinct slaty cleavage, attaining a thickness of up to 40 cm. Downwards they grade into grey marly non~bedded clays, carrying small amounts of glauconite. The full thickness of the exposed profile does not exceed 2 m. The age of the clays here described may with great probability be referred, to the Cretaceous on ground of the yielded fossil microfauna assigned to Arenobulimina sp., Ataxophragmium sp., Egerellina sp., Marsonella sp. and Textularia sp.

    "abstract": "YOUNG PALAEOZOIC VOLCANISM IN AN AREA SE OF WAŁBRZYCH The present paper is based on geological material obtained from bore-holes and mining operations in an area lying east of Walbrzych, within the Inner-Sudeten basin (fig. 1). The prospecting drillings have penetrated the section of Lower Carboniferous coal measures (fig. 3). The here described layers are Walbrzych beds containing coal seams, Bialy Kamien beds consisting of sandstones and conglomerates (chart 1) and Żacler beds made up mainly of arkose sandstones. Over the Żacler (Westphalian) beds the occurrence is noted locally of porphyritic tuffites, indicating pre-Permian volcanic activity. Strongest volcanic phenomena are here associated with the eruptive stage of the Rotliegendes. The volcanic cycle of the Rotliegendes begins with basic lavas of the meIaphyric type and their tuffs, passing into progressively more acid lavas. The terminal members of this cycle consist of lavas and corresponding effusive rocks of the quartz-parphyry group. Within the Niedźwiadki hills lying E of Walbrzych (fig. 2) porphyries and their tuffs merge with the silI introduced between variously resistant layers in the Walbrzych beds (fig. 3). Effusive rocks (lapilla tuffs, volcanic breccias, tuff agglomerates and tuffites) are grouped around volcanic necks. Porphyries and their effusives are dissected by a melaphyre dyke with a narrow belt of basic tuffs suggesting for the basic eruptive rocks a younger age than that of the more acid effusive constituents. The age of the porphyries may be established as bordering on the upper Westphalian and the Stephanian. Subsurface sub-volcanic breccias caused by violently ascending steam, gases and lava have been yielded by bore-hole Y. The thick porphyry sill (fig. 4) is a magmatic rock. Some subvolcanic breccias contain porphyry material, others lack it. The breccias primarily consist of sandstones, shales and conglomerates from the Bialy Kamien beds. Plate LIV, fig. 1 shows thin zigzag coal seams whose argillaceous constituents have been crushed and bent owing to mechanical shifting and bending. These breccias display similarities with mud volcano breccias. Steam and gases owed their origin to the cooling porphyry sill. During expansion they crumbled up the adjacent rocks so that mud and the ascending rock fragments filled the free spaces there. Sub-volcanic breccias which pierce coal seams are a hindrance to mining operations. In literature they are commonly referred to as ,,Riegel.

    "abstract": "AN ANALYSIS OF THE FAULT NETWORK WlTHIN THE ŁYSOGORY UNIT (HOLY CROSS MTS CENTRAL POLAND) BASED ON PHOTOINTERPRETATlON METHODS  SUMMARY An analysis of the fault network is presented for the Łysogory unit in the Holy Cross Mts, Central Poland. This unit, built up of the Middle and Upper Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian deposits (Fig. 1), has a simple monoclinal structure with, some secondary disharmonic disturbances, and it is bordered from the south by the Holy Cross, dislocation which is the greatest fault in the Holy Cross Mts, presumably a deep-seated one and reaching the Moho surface (cf. Kutek & Glazek 1972, Guterch & at 1976). The photointerpretation has been based on air photograms of the scales 1:16,800 through 1:18,800 (Fig. 2), and on space aerograms of the scale 1:250,000, taken by Landsat-2; of the latter, analysed were (Fig. 3B) the bands 6 and 7 that correspond to the wave lenghts 0.7–0.8 and 0.8–1.1m. Morphologic map of the scale 1:100,000 with contours every 5 m was also taken into account, as it is comparable to small-scale radar photograms; interpretation has been surveyed by the Ronchi ruling (Fig. 3A). All these materials, as being of diversified scales, display different elements of the disjunctive tectonics. The Holy Cross dislocation is weakly readable in all these three interpretations (compare Figs 2, 3A and 3B), and better recognizable is only its central part (compare Figs 2 and 3A). There appears however a distinct, hitherto unknown longitudinal fault zone that stretches along the Silurian occurrence belt (see Figs 2–3); other longitudinal faults are small and occur only in some areas. Main transverse faults (cf. Fig. 1) display commonly the nature of the fault zones within which the particular faults are generally normal. All these faults recognized by the photointerpretation methods are well pronounced in morphology, and this is demonstrated the best by the Łysogory transverse fault (Fig. 4). The photointerpretation allowed to recognize a great number of diverse small faults (Figs 2 and 3A) which are not visible in the field. These faults have been analysed statistically to show their maxima that do not correspond to the joint system of the Łysogory area (Fig. 5A); they well agree however with the joint system of the Mesozoic margins of the Holy Cross Mts (Fig. 5B). Consequently, these small faults are to be regarded as originated simultaneously with joints of the Holy Cross margins, presumably during the Laramide tectonic movements (cf. Jaroszewski 1972, Kutek & Glazek 1972, Mizerski 1976). On the other hand, good readability of many of the faults (both transverse and small ones) investigated by photointerpretation methods may evidence their, neotectonic activity.",

    "abstract": "SEQUENCE OF PETROGENETIC PROCESSES WITHIN THE DEPOSITS OF THE HOLY CROSS GROUP SUMMARY Recent works on the lithology and stratigraphy of the oldest sedimentary strata in the Holy Cross Mts, Central Poland, resulted in the recognition of petrogenetic processes responsible for the development of the Holy Cross Group (youngest Precambrian through the lowermost Ordovician; cf. Orlowski 1975). The obtained data, both of biostratigraphic (S. Orlowski) and petrographic (K. Łydka) nature, evidence a sedimentary continuity of the Cambrian deposits. They also indicate that the Holy Cross Group represents one sedimentary cycle (cf. Text-fig. 1), whereas the differentiation in its mineralogical composition resulted from geotectonic evolution of neighboring alimentary areas. The appearance of higher concentrations of kaolinite in sandstones of the Cambrian units younger than the Holmia Zone may point to the origin of quartz cement in these rocks. Namely, during the kaolinization of feldspars large amounts of silica had been freed, and that silica filled the interspace in sandstones and siltstones. Kaolinite is thereby regarded as authochthonous in the investigated sequence, and the chemical weathering of detrital feldspars as being of Cambrian age. More intensive weathering was responsible for a stronger decrease in feldspar frequency within the younger Cambrian deposits. The analyses of fine-pelitic fractions in the investigated deposits show that all the formations, starting from the Czarna Shale Fm. Up to the Klonowka Shale Fm. (cf. Text-fig. 1) display the same degree of the diagenetic advance that corresponds to the katagenetic stage. The secondary processes resulted in the difference between the sedimentary strata of the Holy Cross Group, and the strata attributed to the Riphean and characterized by the features typical of the initial stages of regional metamorphism (cf. Łydka 1973a).",

'The multi-species (or better, multi-genus) method appears therefore' as the only valid benthic-foraminifer-based paleoecological approach to paleoenvironmental reconstruction. Six distinct associations are recognized among the Polish Miocene foraminifers, and called after their most typical genera; these are the Asterigerina , · Quinqueloculina , Valvulineria , Robulus , Florilus , and Sphaeroidina associations. The former three associations prevail under shallow-water conditions, while the others are indicative of deeper-water environments. The Asterigerina association is recognized for typical of seagrass or kelp beds. The Quinqueloculina association typical of the Sarmatian deposits appears indicative of very high availability of the calcium carbonate.",

    "abstract": "Biostratigraphy of the Famenian from the borehole Gozd 2 (Western Pomerania) The stratigraphic position of Upper Devonian sediment from the column Gozd 2 has been revised on the basis of conodont fauna, and referred to the conodont Palmatoiepis crepida and Palmatolepis rhomboidea Zones. In the ammonite division they correspond to the lower and upper part of the Cheiloceras (do ll α - do II β). Zone. The proposed stratigraphical division of the Famenian sediments from the column Gozd 2 is the first attempt of distinguishing conodont zones in the boreholes of the Gozd area. The here described material comes from the Gozd 2 borehole profile. At the depth between 2992.0 and 3203.0 m underlying Carboniferous deposits there is a series of Upper Devonian deposits, 211.0 m thick. They are composed of marly limestones partially nodular. The top of this series consists of grey-yellow mudstones and limy claystones. The brachiopods found in the deposits described by Łobanowski (1970) has determined the stratigraphical position of the series in Middle and Upper Fransian. The encountered conodont assemblage has enabled the autor to more accurately determine the stratigraphic position of the deposits. They comprise two Famenian conodont Zones - Palmatolepis crepida and Palmatolepis rhomboidea with their subzone. The typical forms found in the Palmatolepis rhomboidea zone are: Palmatolepis rhomboidea Sannemann, P . klapperi Sandberg & Ziegler, P . glabra pectinata Ziegler, P . glabra prima Ziegler & Huddle, Polygnathus semicostatus Branson & Mehl. In the Palmatolepis crepida Zone only two forms: Palmatolepis crepida Sannemann and P . circulans Szulczewski have been found. The re-occurrence of a part of the Palmatolepis rhomboidea Zone suggests the possibility of a reverse high-angle fault with vertical separation c.150m.",

    "abstract": "Lithofacies and conodonts in Visean profile, Olkusz area, southern Poland The investigated WB-94 borehole profile (100 % core) is located at the north-eastern margin of the Upper Silesian·Coal Basin, in vicinity of Olkusz (Fig. 1). Predominant in the profile (Fig. 2) are dark marly spiculitic calcilutites with layered or lemses-shaped black cherts, comparable to the Wilson's (1975) standard microfacies 1 (PI. 1, Figs. 1-2;Pl. 2, Fig. 1; Pl. 3, Fig. 2). The autochthonous marly beds are intercalated with grey to pinkish homogeneous intrabiosparenites containing abundant abraded and redoposited skeletons of echinoderms, brachiopods, foraminifers (mostly endotyrids), bryozoans and various calcareous·algae (Pl. 1, Fig. 3;.Pl. 2, Fig. 2;·PI.·3, Fig. 1). This microfacies corresponds to SMP 4 and 5 (Wilson, 1975). Laminated fine calcarenites and calcilutites, with cherts in plaes, form the intermediate litological variety. The biostratigraphic study of 10 (including positive) conodont samples (see Table 1, and Fig. 2 for location in the profile) is based upon the Lower Carboniferous conodont zonation constructed by Austin (1974) with some modifications by Groessens (1974) and Groessens, Conil & Lees (1976). Stratigraphically important and/or taxonomically interesting formtaxa are illustrated on Plates 4-8 and described in the paleontological part. The occurrence of Gnathodus sp./aff Paragnatthodus commutatus (Branson & Mehl)/and Mestognathus sp. in the lowermost dated sample (215.3 m) indicates that it is not older than the upper part of the Visean Mestognathus beckmanni Zone. In turn, the sample from depth 187.7 m is not younger than the lowermost part of the Visean Gnathodus bilineatus bilineatus Zone as indicated by the stratigraphic ranges of Gnathodus delicatus Branson & Mehl and Gnathodus sp. indet. (Meischner 1970, Boogaert 1967,Higgins 1974, Matthews & Thomas 1974). The uppermost dated sample (depth 183.1 m) contains stratigraphically mixed conodont assemblage with the admixture of the typical Famenian and Tournaisian forms (Table 1). The admixture is most probably related to the redeposition of some contemporaneously eroded Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous conodont-bearing carbonates within the Lower Carboniferous shelf platform (cf. Bojkowski & Bukowy 1966, Jurkiewicz & Żakowa 1972). The·investigated lithofacie beIongs to the anaerobic marginal deeper shelf with intense redeposition from the intra-basinaI or coastal shoals inhabited by abundant benthic assemblages.",

    "abstract": "Three lithofacies characterize the TuronianlConiacian sequences in the Upper Cretaceous of the Elbe Valley. The marly lithofacies, between Weinbohla - Dresden - Heidenau, consists of marls and calcareous clays (Strehlen Formation). A transitional lithofacies , with alternations of marls, clays and blocky sandstones, follows to the southeast (area between Rosenthal - Pima - Lohmen). A sandy lithofacies, with blocky sandstones, is developed even farther to the southeast (Elbsandsteingebirge). The TIC boundary is situated in the lower part of the Strehlen Formation in the marly lithofacies, known from several boreholes. Coniacian index ammonites are absent across the TIC boundary in the three investigated boreholes apart from a deformed and incomplete specimen of Placenticeras cf.  orbignyanum (GEINITZ). Therefore, bivalves must be used to place the TIC boundary. The Didymotis  event II (Dresden-Marienhof Borehole), with Cremnoceramus waltersdorfensis (ANDERT), lies at the top of the Upper Turonian M. scupini Zone. The rarity or absence of the bivalve Didymotis in the Dresden-Blasewitz and Graupa boreholes is caused by facies changes. The FAD of Cremnoceramus rotundatus (TRaGER non FIEGE) , especially the C. rotundatus Event (Graupa Borehole, Hinterjessen Marl), can be used to place the TIC boundary. A small interval below the FAD of C. rotundatus and above the Didymotis II event, which may belong to the basal Coniacian, yields Cremnoceramus waltersdorfensis  (ANDERT), Cremnoceramus waltersdorfensis hannovrensis (HEINZ), Mytiloides carpathicus  (SIMIONESCU) and Placenticeras cf. orbignyanum (GEINITZ). In the sandy lithofacies fossils are rare. It is not possible to place the boundary in either the Herrenleite Sandstone or in sandstone d. In the marly lithofacies of the Upper Cretaceous of Saxony bracketing of the TIC boundary is possible by means of planktonic foraminifera. It is possible to identify the evolution of planoconvex double-keeled globotruncanids of the Dicarinella hagni - Dicarinella primitiva - Dicarinella concavata  group from the Upper Turonian. In the Dresden-Blasewitz and Dresden-Marienhof boreholes this group is represented in the TIC boundary interval by Marginotruncana paraconcavata PORTHAULT and Dicarinella cf. concavata (BROTZEN). They are of rare occurrence because they are facies controlled. It is not possible to recognize the boundary between the schneegansi and concavata zones because of the restricted occurrence and rarity of the index forms in the investigated sections. In the Dresden-Blasewitz and Dresden-Marienhof boreholes the benthonic species Stensioeina granulata  (OLBERTZ) was identified.",

The sites are scattered on the whole surface of the granitoid. The native silver occurred in wire, rod, platy, dendritic, anhedral granular and euhedral cubic and octahedral habits; in some specimens twins and fenster faces were also found. Associated with native silver small amounts of acanthite crystallized commonly, sometimes apparently formed by sulphur diffusion into silver. Inclusions of native gold, electrum, galena, chalcopyrite and pyrite occurred in the native silver. The parent fluids of the specimens were epithermal, because the homogenization temperature (Th) of inclusions in quartz, calcite and cleavelandite that were the host minerals of the native silver was generally 91–165ºC and for individual samples the Th range was 4–11ºC. The total salinity of the fluid was 2.4–7.2 wt. % with Na and Ca (hydro)carbonates as the main dissolved components and admixtures of K, Mg, Fe, Al, S, Cl and F. The parent granitoid contains Ag in trace amounts (0.034–0.056 ppm) and was probably the source of this element for the crystals of native silver. Migration of Ag was made easier by the presence of fluoride ions in fluids.",

It is based on “isochronous” marker bands defined largely by calcitic macrofossil assemblages, and it avoids problems caused by the poor or non-preservation of ammonite assemblages and lateral changes in chalk lithofacies. Eight folgen are based on one, two, or more marker bands. Their sequences, lithologies and calcitic macrofossil assemblages are described from 33 exposures in the Northern Chalk Province of England. The folgen are named, in ascending order, the Belchford, Stenigot, Dalby, Bigby, Candlesby, Nettleton, Louth and Flixton, after villages in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, England. The folgen are traced throughout the Transitional and Southern Chalk provinces of England. They are present in the Cenomanian chalk of northern Germany and northwest France.

    "abstract": "Several closely-spaced phosphorite beds stand out at the Albian–Cenomanian transition in the mid-Cretaceous transgressive succession at the northeastern margin of the Holy Cross Mountains, central Poland. They form a distinctive condensed interval of considerable stratigraphical, palaeontological, and economic value. Here, we correlate the classical section at Annopol with a recently investigated section at Chałupki. We propose a new stratigraphic interpretation of the phosphorite interval, based on lithological correlations, Rare Earth Elements and Yttrium (REE+Y) signatures of phosphorites, age-diagnostic macrofossils, and sequence stratigraphic patterns. This interval has long been considered as exclusively Albian in age. However, new macrofossil data allow us to assign the higher phosphorite levels at Annopol and Chałupki, which were the primary target for the phosphate mining, to the lower Cenomanian. In terms of sequence stratigraphy, the phosphorite interval encompasses the depositional sequence DS Al 8 and the Lowstand System Tract of the successive DS Al/Ce 1 sequence. The proposed correlation suggests that lowstand reworking during the Albian–Cenomanian boundary interval played an important role in concentrating the phosphatic clasts and nodules to exploitable stratiform accumulations. Our conclusions are pertinent to regional studies, assessments of natural resources (in view of the recent interest in REE content of the phosphorites), and dating of the fossil assemblages preserved in the phosphorite interval. On a broader scale, they add to our understanding of the formation of stratiform phosphorite deposits.",

We conducted highly-resolved pollen and isotope analysis of the 27-m-long, upper part of the sequence of the lake sediments covering the final stage of the Holsteinian and the early phases of the Saalian Complex (Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 11–10). In the pollen profile three main forest interstadials (L PAZ O-3, O-5, O-7) and the intervening steppe – tundra stadials (L PAZ O-2, O-4, O-6, O-8) as well as numerous units of lower rank were identified. Interstadials were characterized mainly by the presence of well-established pine forest. Stadials in turn, represented steppe – tundra vegetation with very pronounced continental influences. Also, three clearly established phases of forest fires starting at the beginning of interstadials and gradually disappearing are interesting feature of the sequence. Fires of that scale are very rarely noted in the palynological spectra. The examined sequence is characterized by the high dynamics of changes in the post interglacial part of the profile. It provides, coupled with clear features of the Holsteinian succession and its duration, a reliable correlation with other terrestrial and marine archives.",

    "abstract": "Lithic fragments including quartz grains occur infrequently in the shallow-marine limestone sequence of the Fatra Formation deposited in the tensional intra-shelf depression of the Central Western Carpathians during the Rhaetian. Nevertheless, their study can bring data answering questions of sources, palaeogeodynamic arrangement, and processes at the end of the Triassic. In this study, we examined optically the cathodoluminescence (CL) colours of single quartz grains from the Kardolína section (Tatra Mts, Slovakia). These colours reveal a dominance of grains derived from regionally metamorphosed and plutonic rocks. Grains of hydrothermal and pegmatite origin are less frequent. Some of the quartz grains show recycled cement rims suggesting at least a second cycle origin. This sedimentary basin was situated near to the passive margin formed by the Variscan consolidated terrains of the Vindelician Highlands. Our study of the CL colours of quartz grains contributes to the elucidation of the nature of the rocks of the vanished Vindelician mountain belt.",

Geochemical, including isotope, and biological data, made it possible to reconstruct the environmental conditions, as well as traces of human influence over the last ca. 6,200 years. Four stages of human impact have been documented by the pollen data. The first traces of human groups in the vicinity of Charzykowskie Lake are preserved in sediments from about 4,000 years ago. The human activity is poorly recorded in the Cladocera and in the geochemical compositions of the lake sediments, probably due to the size and depth of the lake and its isolation.",

    "abstract": "Loess is an important component of cave deposits. Loess and loess-like strata in caves and rock shelters may serve as stratigraphic correlative units and paleoclimate indicators. For the Polish Jura (southern Poland), one of the key regions of cave deposits studies in Europe, the published information concerning the stratigraphic importance of loess is limited to the sequences from around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). In this paper, a review of the archival data about loess deposits situated below the LGM strata in caves and rock shelters of the Polish Jura is presented. The paper discusses the occurrence, lithology, stratigraphy, chronology and paleoecology of the pre-LGM cave loess. The most important sites of the pre-LGM cave loess in the region include: Biśnik Cave, Nietoperzowa Cave, Mamutowa Cave, and Ciemna Cave (only the outer zones). The loess strata in these sites correlate with cold Marine Isotope Stages (MIS): mid-3, 4, 5b–d, 6, and possibly 10. They represent all the main facies of cave loess: typical eolian loess, colluviated loess-like deposits, loess with bedrock debris, and loams of complex grain-size composition but with the predominance of a loess component. Stratigraphic correlations with loess-paleosol sequences are proposed.",

The alluvial fan has a diverse morphology and complex structure, and its formation is the result of the accumulation and erosion activity of several rivers. In order to reconstruct the evolution of the alluvial fan, geological cross-sections of the Stryi, Svicha and Dniester river valleys were made on the basis of archival drillings and field research. The stratigraphy of the alluvial fills is based mainly on morphological (morphostratigraphic) criteria and the correlation of terrace levels with those of adjacent areas. Fluvial sediments from the Late Glacial and Holocene were dated by the radiocarbon method, which allowed the determination of the age of fan dissection. The main factor controlling the course of accumulation and erosion on the alluvial fan was climate change. The accumulation of alluvial covers was preceded by phases of erosion, which generally fell at the end of the glacial periods (late glacial) and the beginning of the interglacials. Differences in the depth of dissection of the strath and the thickness of the accumulated alluvial sediments in the northern and southern parts of the fan may be the result of different tectonic movements and/or the transport capacity and size of river discharges. In the Late Glacial (Alleröd-Younger Dryas) and the Early Holocene the alluvial fan was dissected to a depth of 10–15 m due to the erosion of the Stryi and Dniester rivers.",

    "abstract": "The newly discovered mid-Campanian Szozdy Delta System (Roztocze Hills, SE Poland) located in the southern part of the Polish Cretaceous Basin, at the northern edge of the Łysogóry-Dobrogea Land, has revealed interesting features concerning the relationship between the abundance of rutile and tourmaline. A distinct inverse relationship between rutile and tourmaline can be readily recognised in the succeeding units of the tripartite cyclothems (calcareous mudstone, calcareous sandstone, and calcareous gaize) representing the submarine part of the Szozdy Delta System. In the Szozdy section, both minerals are of similar shape (highly rounded), durability, and size; they are, however, characterised by markedly different densities. Therefore, it might be expected that these two mineral phases will be strongly dependent, both vertically and spatially, on the local energy of the sedimentary environment hydrodynamic power that existed during the deposition of the succeeding units of the cyclothems. The lighter tourmaline was likely transported further to the more quiescent prodelta environment, rendering the prodelta facies overrepresented in this mineral, whereas the heavier rutile was deposited closer to the river discharge. Such relative change in the abundance of these two mineral phases, emphasised by a standardised Z-score statistics, is referred here to as rutile to tourmaline index (RuTidx). Accordingly, as the RuTidx increases, the hydrodynamic power in the sedimentary environment increases as well. Since these two mineral phases are comparatively immune to alteration during the sedimentary cycle, the RuTidx is considered here to be an independent tool in recognising the hydrodynamics of the depositional environments of any age.",

    "abstract": "The potential of heavy minerals as a provenance tracer in Albian arenites of extra-Carpathian Poland was assessed. Studies in this area have focused on various methods based on heavy mineral chemistry that provide an effective tool for reconstructing the provenance of quartz-rich sediments. The previously suggested division of the study area into two domains with different source areas: the western domain – the Miechów area, and the eastern domain – the Lublin area, was based on geochronological (monazite and muscovite dating) and rutile mineral chemical studies. The mineral chemistry of newly examined heavy minerals supports the previously suggested division. The mineral chemistry of detrital tourmaline suggests medium-grade metamorphic rocks as the main source in both domains. Detrital garnet in the western domain shows affiliation to the Góry Sowie Massif, while garnet in the eastern domain was most probably sourced from southern/central Norway. The western domain was most probably fed from rocks of the Bohemian Massif. The main source area for the eastern domain was most probably located in the Baltic Shield. The distinct division of the study area into two domains was caused by the palaeogeography of the region in the Albian and the action of longshore currents in south-eastward and eastward directions.

This event is compared to that recognized in some populations of the present-day and ancient free-living bryozoans, those inhabiting the Korytnica Basin including.

The greatest depth (over 1500 m.) of the Upper Cretaceous sea occurs in the Turonian.

The deep karst of the Boleslawiec syncline is of an ancient, Upper Permian origin. Its maximum development is associated with the weathering processes of the younger Tertiary and older Quaternary.

    "abstract": "This short comment is to prevent the distribution of erroneous data in publications about thelodonts resulting from a presentation and published abstract by Marss and Ivanov (2011). At the Eighth Baltic Stratigraphical Conference in Riga, we reported on a thelodont and chondrichthyans from the Middle/Upper Devonian boundary beds of the Middle Urals. The talk was based on two samples from the Pokrovskoye locality given to us by A.Z. Bikbaev (Ekaterinburg, Russia). A turiniid thelodont, chondrichthyans, placoderms, acanthodians, a struniiform sarcopterygian, and actinopterygians had been reported from that locality prior to our work, whereas the beds with thelodont scales were then thought to correspond to the disparilis Zone (Bikbaev et al. 2002; Ivanov 2008). The thelodont scales we received were 0.6–1.0 mm long (considered, in retrospect, too small for a turiniid, although in sorted sediments such could be found). On the basis of scale morphology, they were provisionally identified as belonging to a turiniid taxon. One particular feature (laterally slantwise finely striated crown) was considered decisive for that identification. The scale histology had not been studied for the abstract and conference talk, but was completed later, at which time we saw fine, sinuous and branching dentine tubules such as those of Shieliidae, whereas turiniids have long and straight but proximally widened tubules. The histological study did not confirm our preliminary identification and we hereby invalidate it. It also became evident that the samples from the eastern and the western slope of the Middle Urals were mixed up (e-mail from A.Z. Bikbaev to A.O. Ivanov on 29.12.2012). Neither of these errors affects the data on other fishes (sarcopterygians, chondrichthyans, etc.) published earlier from the Pokrovskoye localities (Bikbaev et al. 2002; Ivanov 2008), which are correct.  The error in identification could have been avoided if detailed study of both the morphology and histology of the scales had been carried out before the conference. To avoid any confusion in future publications, we strongly suggest not using any of the thelodont data in question.",

These waters occur mainly in the Krynica Subunit of the Magura Nappe, between the Dunajec and Poprad rivers, close to the Pieniny Klippen Belt (PKB). The origin of these waters is still not clear, this applies to both “volcanic” and “metamorphic” hypotheses. Bearing in mind the case found in the Szczawa tectonic window and our geological and geochemical studies we suggest that the origin of the carbon dioxide may be linked with the thermal/pressure alteration of organic matter of the Oligocene deposits from the Grybow Unit. These deposits, exposed in several tectonic windows of the Magura Nappe, are characterized by the presence of highly matured organic matter – the origin of the hydrocarbon accumulations. This is supported by the present-day state of organic geochemistry studies of the Carpathian oil and gas bed rocks. In our opinion origin of the carbon-dioxide was related to the southern, deep buried periphery of the Carpathian Oil and Gas Province. The present day distribution of the carbonated mineral water springs has been related to the post-orogenic uplift and erosion of the Outer (flysch) Carpathians.",

    "abstract": "During fieldwork in the early 1990s at the then still active quarry near Nasilow, on the left bank of the River Vistula (Wisla), accompanied by Professor Andrzej Radwanski, some lobster remains were collected. A fragmentary anterior portion of a decapod crustacean carapace, recovered from a level about 2 m below the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary, in a siliceous chalk unit locally referred to as ‘opoka’, constitutes the oldest record of the thaumastocheliform genus Dinochelus Ahyong, Chan and Bouchet, 2010, D. radwanskii sp. nov. The other, more complete, individual is from c. 3 m above the K/Pg boundary, coming from marly gaizes or ‘siwak’; this is ascribed to a new species of Hoploparia M’Coy, 1849, H. nasilowensis sp. nov., the first to be recorded from Danian (lower Paleocene) strata. Although both ‘opoka’ and ‘siwak’ facies in the Nasilow area are very rich in diverse biota, including some brachyurans, no macruran remains had so far been recorded from the region.",

The absence of index species puts obstacles in the way of a proper stratigraphical assignment of the beds which yielded the ostracods described here. Taking into account that two forms specifically determined occur only in the Jurassic, and that other forms come closest to the Jurassic forms, it is most likely that the beds are Jurassic in age. This opinion is reliably confirmed by the absence of forms typical of the Cretaceous.",

On l'a determine comme une roche eruptive-basique, semblable aux teschenites fraiches ou aux diabases. Les analyses detaillees, microscopiques et chimiques (liste 1) ont confirme, que cette roche appartient en effet aux teschenites. Les differences insignifiantes entre la roche eruptive du forage Bielsko 4 (fig. 1 et 2) et le magma caracteristique des teschenites typiques (liste 2 et 3) resultent, du metamorphisme assez intense. C'etait deja K. Smulikowski (1929, 1930), qui a attire attention particuliere sur la communaute de ce phenomene. La presence de la teschenite entre les couches du substratum paleozoique donne un argument important en faveur de l'âge jeune (Miocene) des teschenites (Konior 1958, 1959). La serie la plus ancienne, trouvee le plus bas dans le forage Bielsko 4, au-dessous .de la profondeur de 1970 m, est constituee par les roches metamorphiques. Elles apparaissent dans le noyau au-dessous de l'intrusion des teschenites. Les analyses microscopiques et chimiques (liste 4), effectuees sur ces roches metamorphiques, ont permis de les attribuer aux. granitoides metasomatiques. Les roches protogenes de ces granitoides metasomatiques avaient originallement le caractere uniforme. C'etaient le plus probablement les roches sedimentaires, qui correspondaient au gres, ou outre du quartz (element principal) il y avait un ciment argileux et peut-etre les feldspaths et la biotite en petit nombre. Avant que ces roches protogenes de caractere des gres ont pris la forme des granitoides, elles·devaient subir les processus du metamorphisme regional et de la metasomatose. Les transformations metasomatiques pourraient etre dues a l'action post-magmatique de l'intrusion des teschenites, dont les symptomes sont connus des travaux de J. Morozewicz(1880) et de K. Smulikowski (1929, 1930).",

The older glacial series corresponds to the Cracovian Glaciation (Mindel). It is represented mainly by residual morainic material. The destruction and removal of the greater part of the Cracovian Glaciation deposits took place during the Great Interglacial owing to erosive and denudation processes. The younger glacial series in the investigated area is connected with the Middle Polish Glaciation (Riss). It is represented by two morainic horizons – the lower of them corresponds to the maximal stadial of the Middle Polish Glaciation, and the upper one to the Warta stadial of this glaciation. These two horizons are separated by fluvioglacial sands. The ice sheet of the maximal stadial of the discussed glaciation covered the whole investigated area “going” farther south. The ice sheet of the Warta Glacistadial reached most probably only the northern and central part of this terrain. It accumulated here the clearly marked end-moraines (tab. I).",

The presence is reported of Lower Namurian siltstones which represent here the passage of the deposits of the Upper Visean into those of the Namurian. The tectonic structure of the young Paleozoic cover on the substratum of gabbroidal rocks is a result of its compression between the thrusted blocks. This process was realized by the prolongation of faults from the substratum into the sedimentary cover. The formation of this structure took place gradually beginning with the younger Paleozoic. The hiatus within the Upper Carboniferous deposits is referable to a time of weaker stress. The deformation pattern was not altered during its long development.",

Among the cross and oblique dislocations forked to the N there occur six tectonic blocks which generally descend to the W, i.e. in the direction of the plunging of the fold. The downthrows of these blocks revived probably as morphotectonic subsidence. The longitudinal dislocations of two blocks announce more intensive complications evolving to the SE along the fold in the Bieszczady Mts. group. The intradislocational segments of the psedo-Ciezkowice sandstone between the shales of their top and bottom were altered into “macro-boudinage lenses.

(CENTRAL POLAND) Presence of a hard ground was stated in the top of the coraliferous layer in the Lower Kimmeridgian of the Holy Cross Mts. Its origin is due to a gap in deposition, which was caused in turn by the filling up of the basin almost to the water mark by growth of coral bunches and by associated sediments. During the gap the corrosion processes started both of the sea floor and of coral skeletons in places where the tops of coral branches contacted with the sea floor. This corrosion was caused by pH changes, which are characteristic of shoals, and took place mainly after rainfall. The influence of coral bunches on the sedimentation and the deposition of associated sediments is also discussed.",

They are separated by erosive surfaces and by fluvial deposits (fig. 3). The oldest horizon is represented mainly by boulder clay, showing in some places gravel or varved clay intercalations (fig. 1). It corresponds to the Cracovian (Mindel) Glaciation. The Cracovian boulder clay is cut by comparalively large valleys, filled with fluvial sands (fig. 2, layer 1). The erosion of these valleys as well as the accumulation of the sands were connected with the Great Interglacial period. Two younger horizons of glacial origin correspond respectively to the maximal and the Warta substages of the Middle Polish (Riss) Glaciation. The lower one is represented by bouIder clay and by coarse glacial gravels, while the upper horizon - mainly by boulder clay. They are separated by an erosive surface (small valleys), which cut down the lower Middle Polish horizon, and by bedded loess silts, filling these valleys and spreading in some places over the surface of the above mentioned glacial horizon. The loess material has been brought here by wind and accumulated in water environment. The erosion of the small valleys and then the accumulation of the loess silt materiaI was connected with a cool and comparatively short space of time, corresponding to the Pilica Interstadial (the interstadial following immediately the maximal reach of the Middle Polish Glaciation). The Warta boulder clay, covering the interstadial deposits, represents at Pacew the youngest Pleoistocene link of glacial origin.",

    "abstract": "An explanation of the genesis of the joints in the Opole marlstones The joints observed in the Turonian marlstones in the vicinities of Opole are classified into two systems, viz., a system of vertical joints and a system of oblique ones. The joints of the oblique system cross each other along almost horizontal tines. In the slits of the oblique jointing sometimes there appear the tectonic breccias, pieces of which are glued with lateral secretion. In the pieces of breccias oblique microjoints, which follow the oblique joints were found. The strain ellipsoids of both systems of joints are constructed. A comparison of the orientation of their axes shows that the described systems of joints were caused by different stresses. The system of vertical joints is regarded as formed earlier, probably by tension oriented similarly as that which acted contemporarily in the adjacent areas (Cracovian Upland, Sudetes). The system of oblique joints was formed as a result of horizontally acting tension. A supposition that the latter tension was connected with the folding of the Carpathians is expressed.",

The slices occurring here in the superposition (Fig. 2) underwent rotation along the surfaces of overthrusting. Particular members of tectonic units, which contact with one another along these surfaces, exhibit significant discrepancy. Rotation of successive, increasingly higher structures proceeded generally in anticlock-wise direction (Fig. 5), which is revealed by the analysis of statistical orientation of bedding ( cf. Fig. 3). The majority of joint fractures (Fig. 4) are characterized by a consistency of directions in all units (NE-SW and NW -BE), independently of their rotation. It therefore appears, these fractures came into being after the phase of nappe transport, presumably during the uplift of the Tatra massif in the Savian tectonic phase (Miocene).",

This paper presents an example of structural changes in fluvial sand of the Praski terrace (in Warsaw) caused by the activity of a temporary concrete batching plant. Our investigations made it possible to identify the material responsible for the structural anomalies observed in the bottom of the trench excavation. The compound responsible for the cementation phenomenon was identified as ettringite – hydrated calcium aluminosulphate: Ca 6Al 2[(OH) 12(SO 4) 3]·26H 2O. The source of ettringite were most probably significant volumes of contaminants coming from the temporary concrete batching plant (e.g., from the rinsing of concrete mixers and/or installations for concrete storage and transportation). While penetrating into the ground, ettringite caused extensive cementation of the soil mass, mainly in the saturation zone. As a result, the mineral (chemical) composition of the inter-grain space changed and the structure of the sand was strengthened. The estimated zone of volumetric changes in soil properties was about 6 thousand m 3. However, analysis of the chemical composition of groundwater for its potential sulphate contamination, did not reveal any anomalous concentrations of sulphates.",

    "abstract": "Geochemical studies of CO 2-rich therapeutic waters in the Sudetes have provided new data on a wide range of trace elements, going beyond standard chemical analyses of such waters. A consistent set of physicochemical data obtained using the same analytical methods was subjected to statistical analyses, including hierarchical clustering, factor analysis and nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis, Tau Kendall), to reveal geochemical relationships between physicochemical and chemical parameters in the waters, and their relationships with the aquifer lithology. Distinct differences in the composition of waters found in crystalline rocks (mainly gneisses and mica schists) and sedimentary rocks were identified. The wide range of elements can be associated with the hydrolysis of silicate minerals, including alkali and alkali earth metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Be) and (mostly) transition elements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Co, W, Mg). Carbonate equilibria are the next important factor as it determines the aggressiveness of the water towards the minerals of aquifer rocks and affects the concentrations of numerous solutes. The probable common origin of chlorides, bromides and sulphates together with Li, Na, Sr may be related to the relict saline component of deep circulating waters, a hypothesis that requires further investigations.",

These factors control the attitude, of the kinked zone as well as the kink surface. Both, flexural slip and simple shear appear to develop the kink band structures. The two mechanisms often operate together or flexural slip can be replaced by simple shear at a later stage of the inception of kink fold, especially of the low angle one. It is concluded that penetrative kink bands development is a total effect of a number of small distortions, arranged parallel to planes of maximum shearing stresses.",

The genus Melaxinaea is characterized by its strongly compressed shell, two straight rows of hinge teeth meeting at an angle, and divided and intercalated nodulose ribs and inner ventral crenulations. It should be placed in Tucetona group rather than in Glycymeris s.s. group in the Glycymerididae, because shells of Melaxinaea and Tucetona are ornamented with well-defined radial ribs and are without a velvety periostracum and fine striations on the shell surface in which radial rows of well-developed periostracum are inserted. In addition, their ligamental areas are always incised by distinct ligamental grooves. The genus Melaxinaea is however more specialized than Tucetona , because the ribs and inner ventral crenulations become divided and intercalated in ontogeny. The type material of the following species of Melaxinaea , Tucetona , and Glycymeris are illustrated: M. vitrea, T. pectiniformis, T. hanzawai, T. subpectiniformis, and G. capricornea .",

This contribution discusses the taxonomy of both families and presents their distribution in the layered sequences of the quarry. The genus Spitidiscus Kilian, 1910 classified as a member of the Superfamily Perisphinctoidea Steinmann in Steinmann and Döderlein, 1890 is an important representative of the Holcodiscidae from a stratigraphic point of view. In areas where the zonal index Acanthodiscus radiatus (Bruguière, 1789) does not occur, as in Butkov Quarry, the first representatives of Spitidiscus indicate the base of the Hauterivian. The genus Plesiospitidiscus Breistroffer, 1947 was long regarded as a member of the Superfamily Desmoceratoidea Zittel, 1895. This superfamily was based on its type species, Eodesmoceras celestini (Pictet and Campiche, 1860), which is not Valanginian in age, as now clearly proven. As a consequence, this superfamily is considered invalid. Vermeulen and Lahondère (2011) proposed an alternative by selecting a suitable initial genus, namely Plesiospitidiscus, for the Family Barremitidae, Superfamily Barremitoidea Breskovski, 1977 ( nom. transl.

Surface deposits are few, with most material being derived from borehole cores. Acanthodian scales are particularly numerous and comparison with scales from other regions of the Old Red Sandstone continent (Laurussia), specifically the Orcadian Basin of Scotland, the Baltic Region, Spitsbergen, and Severnaya Zemlya have demonstrated a lot of synonymy of acanthodian species between these areas. This is especially the case between Belarus, the Orcadian Basin and the Baltic Region, which has allowed us to produce an interregional biostratigraphic scheme, as well as to postulate marine connection routes between these areas. The acanthodian biostratigraphy of Belarus is particularly important as it is associated with spores and marine invertebrates, so giving the potential of more detailed correlations across not only the Old Red Sandstone continent, but elsewhere in the Devonian world. We also demonstrate that differences in preservation (e.g., wear and how articulated a specimen is) is one of the main reasons for synonymy.",

The necessary data have been obtained from borehole profiles situated in the eastern margin of the Łeba elevation (central part of the Polish Baltic Coast): Regression lines have been plotted showing the interdependence of the thickness of the Weiss Liegendes and the following variables: total thickness of the Werra cyclothem (MWE), thickness of the Zechstein limestone (MW), summaric thickness of anhydrites in the Werra cyclothem (MA), thickness of salts (MS) and the summaric thickness of the Werra saltless deposits (MBW). The studied interdependence and the corresponding regression lines have been diagramatically shown in Figs 1-6. This provided the basis for plotting the pattern of the primary original changes in the thickness of lithological components within the sedimentary basin of the Werra cyclothem. The sedimentation pattern shown in Fig. 8 does not comprise the rock salt while that in Fig. 9 takes account of the minimum original thickness of NaCl. The plotting of these patterns was feasible by taking advantage of the statistically existing correlations: MBW vs MZL(=T);MZL vs MA(=A); W=MW=MBW-(T+A) for the pattern in Fig. 8 and MWE v sMZL (=T);MZL vs MW(=W);MZL vs MA (=A)for that in Fig. 9 where the hypothetical salt thickness (MS) was obtained: S=MWE-(T + W + A). This resulted in the determination that relatively the strongest correlative connection exists between the thickness of the terrigenous Weiss Liegende deposits and the total thickness of the Werra cyclothem. This provides additional evidence that the Weiss Liegende sandstones are a transgressive product of the Zechstein sea and are stratigraphically referable to the Upper Permian. Their thickness increases towards the basin shores (Figs 8-9). It is reasonably supposed that they are the geochronological correspondent of the Zechstein limestones (W) while in the off-shore part of the basin they may correspond to the anhydrites (A) and, even to the rock saIts (S) -Figs 8 -9. Changes in the thickness of the Weiss Liegende are a reliable Iithofacial index making possible the reconstruction of the original quantitative relations in the peripheral parts of the evaporation basin. In this zone the carbonate rocks and the anhydrites decrease in thickness towards the basin shores while the central part of the basin (Fig. 9) is occupied by rock salt.",

    "abstract": "THE MlDDLE JURASSIC AND LOWER OXFDIAN LITHOFACIES IN THE RADOM-LUBLIN AREA SUMMARY The thickness is here shown of the Middle Jurassic and Lower Oxfordian sediments in the Radom-Lublin area, as well as the distribution of the lithofacies differentiated on the basis of the modified classification triangle of W. C. Krumbein & L. Sloss (Kotanski 1970, 1971). Attempts have also been made to reconstruct the paleogeographic conditions prevailing at that time. MIDDLE JURASSIC Middle Jurassic members lower than the Bathonian are known only from the westernmost part of the area here considered (Fig. 1). The most complete profile of sediments – from the Aalenian to the Kuiavian – occurs along the western boundary of their present distribution where they attain the maximum thickness. Along the line indicating the eastern occurrence limits of sediments younger than the Bathonian there are only those of the Kuiavian, 5 m in thickness. The remaining parts represented the source areas supplying the basin with terrigenous material. Bathonian-Callovian sediments cover practically the whole of the area here considered, the south-easternmost part excepted. This was the occurrence area of the Lublin land – a prolongation of that of the Ukraine (Niemczycka 1978 a), and of several minor paleostructures in the Central Lublin Region (Figs 2–3). Around the land areas the subsidence was rather small and the thickness of the Middle Jurassic does not exceed 10 m. An increase in thickness is distinctly observable in the south-eastern part where it attains 50 m at the boundary of their present occurrence range. Any available knowledge of the Middle Jurassic sediments older than the Bathonian has been provided mainly by the students of the Mesozoic margin of the Holy Cross Mts (References in Daniec 1970). These are sediments developed in the mudstone-sand lithofacies, abounding in a flora fairly well paleontologically documented. They have been assigned to group I of the classification triangle used here (Fig. 1, Table 1). Information concerning the Bathonian-Callovian lithofacies has been obtained from numerous bore holes drilled in our area (Figs 2–3). Lithofacial groups I, Il, III, IV and VIII have been differentiated in the Bathonian-Callovian sediments. Clastic deposits occur in the neighborhood of land areas existing at that time and are connected therewith. They are represented by mudstones and sandstones, subordinately by siltstones, while at the bottom they contain a characteristic conglomerate with elements of deposits of the Devonian and Carboniferous substratum. The clastic elements decrease with increasing distance from the land so that in the north-western part the sediments are almost exclusively carbonaceous. They are chiefly organo-detrital crinoid limestones, in the lower part slightly dolomitic, at the contact with the Lower Oxfordian bearing an ammonite fauna observable in the Nodular Bed (Dayczak-Calikowska 1969, 1873; Niemczycka 1965). LOWER OXFORDIAN The distribution range of the Lower Oxfordian sediments is slightly wider than that of the Bathonian-Callovian. The Lower Oxfordian basin widened out its range to invade the northern part of the land of Lublin, partly also some of the paleostructures (Figs 3–4). Similarly as in the Middle Jurassic, the above area was characterised by small subsidence. Its minimum occurred round the existing land areas where the thickness of deposits does not exceed 10 m, being slightly greater to the south and north-west where it attains 30 m. Eight lithofacial groups (Fig. 5) have been differentiated in the Lower Oxordian sediments, their distribution resembling that of the Bathonian-Callovian. Clastic sediments continue to occur in the vicinity of the land areas but covering a smaller area. Dolomitic deposits make their appearance as new lithofacial groups. They occur locally north and south of the land of Lublin, also in the vicinity of the Zakrzew (Z) paleostructure. A predominant part of our area is covered by limestone deposits represented by organodetrital spongy limestones. The amount of clastic material here is quite subordinate (Niemczycka 1976 a). As is reliably suggested by the distribution pattern and character of the lithofacial groups the area here considered was overflooded during the Middle Jurassic and the Lower Oxfordian by a rather shallow sea. Its islands protruded in the Central Lublin region, a peninsula which was a prolongation of the Ukrainian land into the Polish territory. At that time the sedimentation was distinctly connected with the above land areas. Their influence was, however, confined to the eastern part where terrigenous sediments were formed. Terrigenous material from the continental areas was brought into the northern part of our area only in small amounts and chemical sedimentation dominated",

The mechanical conditions responsible for the formation of relaxation fissures are also described. The critical depth of erosion necessary to start the propagation of relaxation fissures is computed. This is a basis for determination of the absolute age of the fissures. Hence the lower age limit of hydrocarbon accumulation can be defined indirectly. Within Polish territory the Peribaltic syneclise covers the NE part of Poland including eastern and central Pomerania along the Baltic coast. In this region, relaxation fissures of· natural origin occur in Middle Cambrian oil bearing quartzose sandstones. These fissures run horizontally and are rectilinear, arcuate or sinusoidal (Fig. 1). Often they form assemblages showing mutually compensated arrangement (Figs 1-2). The fissure assemblages occur in the sandstone close to clay intercalations (Fig. 1-1) indicating. the actual genetic connection of the relaxation fissures and the horizontal displacements of the plastic clay material in relation to the rigid sandstone rocks (Figs 1-4). The erosion of the overburden and simultaneous change of the regional dip causes the horizontal movement of the clay material. This movement results in the formation of short vertical, fissures associated with the horizontal relaxation fissures (Figs 1-3; Fig. 1-4). Thus they are formed owing to the reaction of the rock to the erosional reductions of the overburden. The length of relaxation fissures ranges from 1 to 10 cm, their width from 0.2 to 0.5 mm (Fig. 2). As a rule these fissures are not healed. The quartzose sandstones are of brittle material. The experimentally determined values of Young's module of elasticity (E) and those of Poisson's ration (v) are correspondingly: E = 2.1-2.25 10 5 , v = 0.9-0.11 (Figs 8, 10) and E = 1.9-1.95 10 5 kG/cm 2 ; v = 0.1-17 (Figs 9, 11). Hence it was possible to use Griffith's criterion of fracture (Fig. 6) to compute the minimal thickness of erosional reduction necessary for the formation of relaxation fissures in Cambrian sandstones (Fig. 7). Assuming that the erosion had the character of planar denudation (Fig. 7A) the thickness of the eroded overburden must have been at least 1000-1060 m (see model 7). Within the; Peri-baitic synedise erosion on such a scale may have taken place only between the Silurian and the Lower Permian (Rotliegendes) as the erosion achieved its maximum during that, time. Hence it is reasonable to suppose that the relaxation fissures in the Cambrian sandstones were formed during the Rotliegendes or late Carboniferous. Because of the numerous hydrocarbon traces observable along the unbended fissures it may be concluded that the migration and accumulation of oil within, the Middle Cambrian rock series took place during or after Upper Carboniferous-Roltliegendes time. On the basis of the computed maximum tensions which may have taken place in a rock subject to extension, it has been possible to compute the maximum depth of the occurrence of relaxation fissures (see formula 9). This depth ranges from 1650 to 1720 m below the denudation surface. Taking into account the necessary maximum values of tension possible to occur in a rock subject to elasticity, the theoretical maximum depth has been computed at which opened relaxation fissures may be observed (see formula 10). This depth has been estimated at 3800 to 4400 m below the sea level.",

    "abstract": "The correct stratigraphic position of the Ordovician/Silurian boundary sediments as well as the exact boundary between these two systems have not as yet been definitely determined. This is connected with the presence of various fossil groups in the pelagic and neritic facies, which greatly hinders a correlation of profiles. The orthostratigraphic division of the Upper Ordovician and the Lower Silurian is based on graptolites which place the currently accepted Ordovician/Silurian boundary at the bottom of the Glyptograptus persculptus zone. In profiles lacking graptolite remains the biostratigraphy of the border sediments is based on brachio-pods and trilobites which indicate the differentiation of the Hirnantian stage. In non-graptolithic facies the upper boundary of the Ordovician system is placed in the top of the Hirnantian stage. During her studies on the Upper Ordovician of the Łeba elevation the present ,writer has also studied the Ordovician/Silurian boundary sediments in this area and compared them with those from other regions of Poland and from some classical areas of their world occurrence. The sediments of the uppermost Ashgillian in the Łeba elevation are developed as grey mudstonesand-marls of the Mucronaspis mucronata zone with M. mucronata Brongniart, Phillipsinella sp., Hirnantia sagittifera (Davidson), Eostropheodonta hirnantensis (M'Coy), Orbiculoidea sp. In their top there occur black mudstones with graptolites of the Llandoverian Akidograptus ascensus zone. The fauna of the uppermost Ashgillian in the Łeba elevation has many features in common with the Hirnantia fauna of Wales. Movements connected with the Taconian phase of the Caledonian orogeny are responsible for distinct facial changes throughout Poland. The muddy-marly Ashgillian deposits, bearing a benthonic fauna of trilobites and brachiopods, have practically everywhere been replaced by mudstones and black muddy shales with a rich Silurian graptolite fauna. Here and there on the Ordovician/Silurian boundary there are. sedimentary lacunae, however, only of a local significance. As a rule the sediments of the M. mucronata zone are in contact with rocks of the Llandoverian Akidograptus ascensus or A. acuminatus zones. During the recent years the occurrence has been noted in various regions of the world (S Kazakhstan, the Perce district in Canada, Meifod-WelshpooI in Wales) of the Llandoverian G. persculptus zone together with the Hirnantian trilobites and brachiopods. This might reasonably suggest that the two stratigraphic units may, . at least partly, be regarded of the same age. On this assumption the top of the Hirnantian would correspond to the bottom of the A. ascensus zone. Two conceptions are now currently accepted for the Ordovician/Silurian boundary: a. In the bottom of sediments with a fauna in common, hence in the· bottom of the Hirnantian and of the G. persculptus zone. b. In the top of the two above units, hence in the bottom of the A. ascensus zone. This latter conception seems more correct in view of the appearance in the bottom of the A., ascensus zone of new characteristic graptolite genera such as Akidograptus, Dimorphograptus and Monograptus. The upper boundary of the Ordovician system as established in the bottom of the A. ascensus zone agrees with data from the Polish territory where this zone is ,readily distinguishable, while the G. persculptus zone has not -one case excepted -been reported from Poland.",

    "abstract": "PERMIAN DEPOSITS AND THEIR RELATlON TO THE SYNSEDYMENTARY TECTONlC IN THE SUBSURFACE OF THE RADOMSKO REGION (CENTRAL POLAND)  SUMMARY The lithology and thickness of the Permian sediments has been analysed in detail on the basis at a structural map of the top of the Sub-Permian deposits of the Radomsko region. The lithofacial development had been determined by the area here analysed being situated in a zone of strong tectonic activities at the crossing of several important dislocation zones. In the substratum there is a distinct boundary in the Permian, step-like in character, separating the sulphareous carbonaceous sedimentation type of the Miechow part here considered from the chloric sedimentation of salt structures in the Łodź part. This step, affected by subsequent synorogenous Alpine movements, was modelled into an elevation, today expressed by the presence of the Jurassic anticlines of Chelm, Smotryszow and Łekinsko. In the region between Radomsko and Belchatow there is a distinct boundary between the pattern of the distribution of the Permian facies, due to the differentiation of sediments in the northern (Łodź) part from those in the southern (Miechow) part. Figure 1 shows the deep bore hole profiles which had pierced or only reached the Permian deposits. Four boreholes: Gomunice 2, 5, 7 and 8 are in the northern part of our area, south of the Belchatow graben, while bore holes Gidle 5, Gidle 1, also Pągow IG-1 and Granice 2 are in the southern part. In the northern part of our area the fossil fragments of the Rotliegendes are overlaid by rather thick (370–560 m) Zechstein deposits developed as salt cyclothems. The oldest of these, the Werra cyclothem, is that best developed, while they are gradually reduced in the younger profiles. They represent the marine basin zone with a chloritic type of sedimentation, the thick salt beds here present being engaged in the process of halokinesis and forming salt domes (Fig. 2). The Permian profiles observed in boreholes of the southern part of the region here considered differ. They are of relatively small thickness (193–287 m), and the cyclic sequence of beds is observable sporadically and only in the oldest cyclothem. Generally they are carbonaceous sulphareous deposits (the cement) representing the lagoonal peripheries of the Permian basin (Poborski 1964). This distinct change in the thickness and lithofacies of the Permian deposits in the two parts of our area was due to synsedimentary movements, modifications in the configuration of the basin and to complications in the substratum structure (Dadlez & Marek 1969). The substratum here, built by sediments of the Lower Carboniferous was definitely modelled during the tectonic movements of all the successive Post-Visean and Pre-Zechstein phases (Jurkiewicz 1975). Moreover, they had been cut up by a system of dislocations with general NW-SE and SW-NE direction trends mutually overthrust and forming the frames of the blocks. An analysis of the distribution of the thickness and facies in the Permian reliably suggests that these blocks constituted a step-like pattern of depressions along the both direction trends. During the final phase of Zechstein sedimentation, the lowermost position along the SW-NE direction was that of the blocks directly adjacent in the south to the Belchatow graben where conditions favoured the development of complete salt cycles. A zone situated higher up was that of the “Kodrąb” dislocation (Fig. 3) with a transitional type of sediments oscillating from the chloritic to the carbonaceous-sulphareous facies. It predominated in the southern Miechow part of our region situated highermost. In this zone the boundary between the Łodź and the Miechow basins runs in the substratum. A similar step-like pattern was also produced in the NW-SE direction with its maximum substratal depression underlying the present Kamiensk–Chelm–Granice structures rising to the SW (Fig. 4). The greatest thickness of the Permian deposits, agreeing with the here considered pattern of the substratal modelling and with data from boreholes and the seismic sections, occur in the lowermost zones (Fig. 5). A study of the substratal structure in the vicinity of Radomsko has shown the part played by this zone during the Permian. An analysis of the distribution of the thickness and facies of the deposits suggest strong synsedimentary movements of the substratum along the old Variscan dislocations. This activity was responsible for the step-like formation of the substratum, affecting the sedimentation of this region. Higher up the sea invasion penetrated farther south into the Miechow region (Fig. 6). The step is the southern boundary of the occurrence range of the salt structures in this part of the Polish Lowland. In result of the activity of subsequent synorogenous Alpine movements the step took on the present form of an elevation.",

In the -central part of the investigated area of the High Tatra Mts it is horizontal or subhorizontal, but at the margin it is NW inclined; the attitude of joints is changing respectively. Together with the presence of aptite and pegmatite fillings it proves a role of prototectonic (late-magmatic) factors in foundation of joint net.

All these features can be explained if we assume a unique field of residual stresses resulting from superposition of prototectonic and tectonic stress fields.

In the marine (ROt) deposits the dominance is observed of the smooth megaspores..., while ornamented megaspores as a rule predominate in the limnic sediments”. The present writers suppose the megaspores to represent a group of land lycopodia growing on inland or coastal swamps. Hence, the distribution of these spores, both smooth and ornamented, does not depend on facial conditions but on such ecological conditions their parent plants had vegetated under, and on the characteristics and length of their transport. An attempt has also been made to clarify that the lack of megaspores cannot indicate the existence of a stratigraphic lacuna, as believed by Fuglewicz (1977 a). The most questionable lithostratigraphic problem advanced by Fuglewicz is an endeavour to correlate his own stratigraphic classification with that of Sokolowski. Fuglewicz believes that the lower oolitic layers “... correspond to complex 18 of the Bunter in Sokolowski's (1967) classification” while the intraoolitic layers “...most probably correspond to complexes 17 and 16 in Sokolowski's classification...” After correlating a number of the Lower and Middle Bunter profiles (Fig. 1) it is shown that an identification of the lower oolitic layers with complex 18 and that of the intra-oolitic layers with complexes 17 and 16 of Sokolowski's classification is incorrect. The lower oolitic and suboolitic layers observed in boreholes Czernczyce IG-l and Steszow 1G-l correspond to Sokolowski's complex 21, while the intraoolitic layers probably correspond to complexes 20 through 14.",
